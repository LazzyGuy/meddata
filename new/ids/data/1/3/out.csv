Methods: Three cases of endogenous Klebsiella pneumoniae endophthalmitis associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae with microbiological evidence were studied. The related literatures published from January 2008 to June 2018 were reviewed with ""pneumonia"" , ""endogenous endophthalmitis"" and ""Klebsiella pneumoniae"" as the keywords in CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed and Web of Science databases. Results: The 3 patients, all males, aged 54 years, 82 years and 48 years respectively. They all had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Endophthalmitis occurred in one eye in all of them, and the patients had eye symptoms including eye pain, progressive loss of vision, periorbital area inflammation, conjunctivitis, weakening or disappearance of pupil light reflex, corneal edema and anterior chamber effusion. All of 3 cases had multiple patchy pulmonary lesions, and Klebsiella pneumoniae was proven to be the pathogen by blood culture. Two cases had pulmonary abscess and liver abscess, and one of them had brain abscess. A total of 28 literatures with 81 cases of endogenous Klebsiella pneumoniae endophthalmitis associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia were retrieved from CNKI, WanFang, PubMed and Web of Science database. Conclusions:Klebsiella pneumoniae was one of the most common pathogens of pneumonia and endogenous endophthalmitis, which would seriously damage the lung and the eye. The early clinical features were not specific. Misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis might cause serious consequences. Eye pain and visual disturbance symptoms, ophthalmic examination, chest imaging, blood and aqueous humor etiology were of great value in the diagnosis of this disease.",[Incremental cost-effectiveness of the second Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189229,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2019 06 12,"Objective: To study the incremental cost-effectiveness of the second Xpert assay in detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. Methods: We continuously collected 2 896 specimens from suspected tuberculosis patients who had undergone 2 Xpert tests in a week from March 2015 to March 2018, including 2 402 suspected tuberculosis patients with 1 523 males and 879 females, with an average age of 50 years. Among them, 2 144 specimens of sputum and 258 cases of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected. We also enrolled 494 patients with suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis, 318 males and 176 females, with an average age of 42 years. Among them, 157 pleural effusion specimens, 106 cerebrospinal fluid specimens, 34 urine specimens and 197 pus specimens were collected. All specimens were subjected to two Xpert tests, smear microscopy, liquid rapid culture (BACTEC MGIT 960), and positively cultured bacteria were tested for drug susceptibility. Results: Among the 2 896 specimens from suspected tuberculosis patients, either one of the two Xpert test results was positive (including both tests were positive, the same below) in 1 639 patients, and 1 502 (91.6%) were positive in the first Xpert tests. The additional 137 (8.4%) test results were positive in the second tests. According to the smear test results, all specimens were divided into the smear negative group and the smear positive group. The second Xpert test was significantly higher than the smear-positive group (14.86%, 3.2%, P<0.001), and the extrapulmonary tuberculosis group was higher than the tuberculosis group (11.2%, 8.0%, P=0.12).Of the susceptibility test results, a total of 371 were rifampicin-resistant specimens. The first Xpert detected 91.4% (339/371), and the second Xpert detected the additional 8.1% (30/371).The cost increase of the second test was very significant. Tests were calculated at 650 yuan per time, the tuberculosis group was 1 184 yuan and 13 696 yuan(P<0.001); the extrapulmonary tuberculosis group was 1 755 yuan and 13 961 yuan(P<0.001). In the test of specimens of tuberculosis and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the smear-negative specimen cost increase of the second Xpert test was lower than that of the smear-positive specimen. Conclusion: The second xpert test showed significant value-added cost-effectiveness in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.",[Blood eosinophils: a biomarker of response to glucocorticoids and increased readmissions in severe hospitalized exacerbations of COPD].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189228,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2019 06 12,"Objective: To compare the clinical characteristics of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) by different levels of blood eosinophil (EOS) count and to investigate the predictive value of the response to glucocorticoid treatment and the readmission rate in the patients with higher blood eosinophils. Methods: A total of 120 patients with AECOPD were admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 01, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Patients were divided into two groups according to their admission blood eosinophil fractions. Patients with EOS%≥2% were in the EOS group (n=56) , while patients with EOS%<2% were in the Non-EOS group (n=64) . The clinical characteristics, hospitalization treatments especially the glucocorticoid treatment response were compared, and the risk of severe acute exacerbation of the two groups including the 12-month COPD-related readmission, and time to first COPD-related readmission were also compared. Results: Compared with the Non-EOS group, the EOS group had lower values of white blood cell (WBC) , neutrophil fraction (N%) , blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) , and C-reactive protein (CRP) . The EOS group also required shorter course of antibiotic treatment [8 (6-10) and 9 (7-11) , P=0.033]. In glucocorticoid-treated patients (n=82) , the EOS group had significantly alleviated symptoms than the Non-EOS group (patients withδCAT≥2 were 86.8% and 68.2%, respectively, P=0.046) , and the duration of hospitalization of the EOS group was shorter [9 (7-11) and 10 (9 to 13) , P=0.042]. Patients with glucocorticoid treatment in the EOS group had significantly alleviated symptoms than those without glucocorticoid treatment (patients with δCAT ≥ 2 were 86.8% and 61.1%, respectively, P=0.040) .

Based on apnea/hypopnea index(AHI), the patients were categorized into non-OSAHS group (0<AHI≤5/h), mild and moderate OSAHS group (5<AHI≤30/h), and severe OSAHS group (AHI>30/h). All patients were assessed for sleepiness and the Motreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaires, Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), attention and short-term memory assessment which included Trail Marking Test(TMT), digit span test(DST), and Complex Figure Test(CFT). The PSG parameters, ESS scores, total MoCA scores, attention and short-term memory were compared among groups, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the characteristics of attention and short-term memory impairment in young patients with OSAHS and their determining factors. Results: In the overall cognitive function assessment, severe OSAHS patients's MoCA scores were lower than those of the other two groups [27.0 (25.0, 28.0) vs 27.0 (26.0, 28.0) , 27.0 (26.0, 27.0) , P<0.01]. In the sleepiness self-assessment, severe OSAHS patients's ESS scores were significantly higher than those of the other groups (11.4±5.4 vs 5.3±4.5, 8.0±5.0, P<0.01) . In the attention tests, scores on the DST-D (8.1±1.1 vs 8.8±0.9, 8.5±1.0) and DST-B[5.5 (4.0, 7.0) vs 6.0 (5.0, 7.0) , 6.0 (5.0, 7.0) ] were significantly lower in severe OSAHS patients than in the other two groups (P<0.01) . In the memory tests, the re-drawing scores of severe OSAHS patients were significantly lower than those of the other two groups [23.0 (16.0, 27.0) vs 26.0 (24.0, 28.0) , 24.0 (20.0, 28.0) , P<0.01]. In the executive function tests, severe OSAHS patients spent much longer on both TMT-A (46.7±19.0 vs 40.2±17.4, 34.6±17.2) and TMT-B (76.9±32.6 vs 67.2±21.2, 58.6±27.5) than the other two groups (P<0.01). Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that, AHI, ODI and NREM (Ⅰ+Ⅱ) sleep ratios were the independent determining factors. Conclusion: Attention and short-term memory functions of young patients with OSAHS were impaired. The severity of apnea and hypoxia, NREM (Ⅰ+Ⅱ) ratio were all determining factors.",[Polysomnography and clinical characteristics of Tibetan and Han residents with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in Tibet].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189226,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2019 06 12,"Objective: To analyze the polysomnography and clinical characteristics of Tibetan and Han residents with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in high altitude areas of Tibet, and to explore whether nationality difference existed. Methods: The clinical data of 425 OSAS patients admitted to the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Hospital from November 2011 to February 2018 were retrospectively analyzed, which were divided into Tibetan group and Han group. Information including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, waist circumference and hip circumference was collected, and apnea-hyponea index (AHI), mean oxygen saturation (MSaO(2)) during sleep, lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO(2)) during sleep, sleep phases and Epworth scores were compared between Tibetan and Han groups. Results: No significant difference was found in AHI between Tibetan and Han patients. AHI was positively correlated with BMI, neck circumference and waist circumference. Oxygen saturation in the daytime was not significantly different between groups. However, MSaO(2) and LSaO(2) during sleep were lower in Tibetan group compared with Han group (79% vs 82%, 65% vs 69%, respectively, P=0.000). Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in MSaO(2) in mild OSAS patients, while the LSaO(2) in mild OSAS patients, the MSaO(2) and LSaO(2) in moderate and severe OSAS patients all showed significant differences between groups. Adjusted for BMI, the LSaO(2) in moderate OSAS patients, the MSaO(2) and LSaO(2) in severe OSAS patients in Tibetan group were still significantly lower than Han group. Stage-1 non-rapid eye movement was prolonged in moderate OSAS patients in Tibetan group compared with Han group (P=0.033), while other sleep phases and Epworth scores showed no significant difference between groups. Conclusion: In the circumstances of similar AHI, the MSaO(2) and LSaO(2) in moderate and severe OSAS patients were significantly lower in Tibetan group than in Han group, and the differences partially remained after adjusting for BMI, and the mechanisms needed to be further investigated in high altitude areas.",[Expert Consensus on Transbronchial Cryobiopsies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189225,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2019 06 12,,[Consideration on the use of injectable anti-tuberculosis drufgs in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis in china].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189224,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2019 06 12,,Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells for treating chronic kidney disease: A pilot study assessing safety and clinical feasibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189223,Kidney research and clinical practice,2019 06 12,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health concern, and available treatments are insufficient in limiting disease progression.

In this article, the method and clinical implications of the mortality hazard ratio analyses of various clinical parameters in the 2017 registry report have been described, with the inclusion of data on four additional parameters. The mortality risk based on clinical parameters was analyzed only for hemodialysis patients. The number of registered patients with laboratory data was 13,943 (8,446 male and 5,497 female patients), and death was reported in 3,139 patients. Analysis of the effects of various clinical parameters on mortality was performed using non-linear Cox proportional hazard model with the R statistics program. For all clinical parameters, univariate and adjusted multivariate hazard ratio analyses were performed. Analysis of the mortality hazard ratio showed that low body mass index, low hemoglobin, low serum albumin, low serum phosphorus, and low urea reduction ratio were associated with a significantly increased mortality risk, whereas paradoxically high serum creatinine levels were associated with low mortality risk.",New insights into the transcriptional regulation of aquaporin-2 and the treatment of X-linked hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189221,Kidney research and clinical practice,2019 06 12,"The kidney collecting duct (CD) is a tubular segment of the kidney where the osmolality and final flow rate of urine are established, enabling urine concentration and body water homeostasis. Water reabsorption in the CD depends on the action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a transepithelial osmotic gradient between the luminal fluid and surrounding interstitium. AVP induces transcellular water reabsorption across CD principal cells through associated signaling pathways after binding to arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). This signaling cascade regulates the water channel protein aquaporin-2 (AQP2). AQP2 is exclusively localized in kidney connecting tubules and CDs. Specifically, AVP stimulates the intracellular translocation of AQP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma membrane, increasing the osmotic water permeability of CD cells. Moreover, AVP induces transcription of the Aqp2 gene, increasing AQP2 protein abundance. This review provides new insights into the transcriptional regulation of the Aqp2 gene in the kidney CD with an overview of AVP and AQP2. It summarizes current therapeutic approaches for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by AVPR2 gene mutations."

Newer diode lasers target superficial and deep telangiectasias without the side effects of the 585-nm laser. Ablative resurfacing was introduced in the 1990s with the carbon dioxide laser to address facial rhytids and photoaging. While effective, the risks and downtime were significant.

Our expanding knowledge of the aging face has allowed us to shift the focus from skin-reduction lifting procedures to soft tissue augmentation. Within the past 5 years alone, nine new dermal fillers have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for soft tissue augmentation. The rise in both the use and number of dermal fillers in recent years is a testament to their safety and efficacy. Dermal fillers can be broken down to three major types: temporary, semipermanent, and permanent. The former, which include hyaluronic acid based fillers, provide safe and effective correction but only for a limited time, typically approximately 1 to 2 years at best. This review will cover the semipermanent (poly-L-lactic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite) and permanent (polymethylmethacrylate and liquid silicone) injectable fillers. These so-called deep dermal fillers are valuable, durable tools in correcting the aging face. Given their extended duration of effect, these fillers inherently carry their own risk for potential adverse events.

Subjects included 22 patients with unilateral ACL rupture and 22 healthy controls. Knee kinematics and kinetics during walking and running were examined using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system. The passive knee joint laxity, range of motion of knee joint, and knee muscle strength were also measured. Correlations between the knee kinematic and kinetic data and clinical assessments were evaluated. In the ACL deficient patients, there were no significant relationships between tibial translation during walking and running and passive knee joint laxity. The correlations between knee kinematics and kinetics and range of motion of knee joint were also not significant. Additionally, there were no significant correlations between knee kinematics during walking and knee muscle strength. However, there were several significant correlations between knee kinematics during running and knee muscle strength. The results demonstrate the importance of knee muscle strength for knee kinematics and kinetics during running in ACL deficient patients. Patients with stronger knee muscle strength may demonstrate more nearly normal knee joint movement during dynamic activities such as running.",Validation of a Photoplethysmographic Heart Rate Monitor: Polar OH1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189190,International journal of sports medicine,2019 06 12,"This study assessed the validity of a photoplethysmographic heart rate (HR) monitor, the Polar OH1 in various sports performed in ecological conditions: running, cycling, soccer, kayaking, walking, tennis and fitness. Seventy trained athletes (56 males, 14 females) wore the Polar OH1 armband and the H7 chest belt during training. A total of 390 h and 38 min of recording were compared using a 20-bpm window to assess data quality, and Bland-Altman agreements and ICC analyses were used to test accuracy. Linear regression analyses evaluated the HR accuracy and correlation with skin tone. Training loads (TRIMPs) were compared for each session. Reliability was high for endurance sports (>99%) and lower for sports involving arm movements (92~95%). Biases were slightly negative for all sports, whereas widths of limits of agreement varied from 7-20bpm. Bland-Altman agreements were all under 5% except tennis, kayak and fitness. HR accuracy was positively correlated to skin tone (p<0.05). Finally, TRIMPs from the OH1 device were inferior to criterion's (except walking and soccer), within a 3% range from reference. Hence, OH1 represents a valid tool to monitor instantaneous HR and training load, especially for endurance sports.",Relationship of Activity Patterns to Acute Mountain Sickness in South Pole Workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189189,International journal of sports medicine,2019 06 12,"This study aimed to evaluate the influence of physical activity on incidence of acute mountain sickness (AMS) by continuous activity monitoring in a free-living sample of South Pole workers over the initial 72 h at altitude exposure of 2,840 m (9,318 ft).

The aim was to analyze the adaptations induced by 2 types of sports: one involving intensive use of trunk muscles (i. e., judo), and one known to induce high aerobic capacity in the whole body (i. e., cycling). Eleven judokas, 10 cyclists and 9 healthy untrained young men performed trunk extension exercises on an isokinetic dynamometer. During the first session, muscle strength was assessed during maximal trunk extension. During a second session, a 5-min exercise was performed to investigate aerobic responses with regard to trunk muscles. The near infrared spectroscopy technique and a gas exchange analyzer were used continuously to evaluate mechanical efficiency, V̇O2 on-set kinetics, trunk muscle deoxygenation and blood volume. Judokas showed greater trunk strength and mechanical efficiency (p<0.05). Cyclists presented faster V̇O2 on-set kinetics (p<0.05) and greater muscle deoxygenation and blood volume compared to untrained men (p<0.001).

Twelve years after her diagnosis of CLL, routine follow-up chromosome analysis of peripheral blood revealed an abnormal metaphase with a dup(3)(q21q27) in 18 of 20 metaphase cells. To further characterize the abnormal chromosome 3, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using the Abbott BCL6 probe for 3q27. An additional BCL6 signal was observed in 303 of the 500 interphase nuclei examined. The ISCN was reported as 46,XX,dup(3)(q21q27)[1]/46,XX[2]. nuc ish(5'BCL6, 3'BCL6)x3(5'BCL6 with 3'BCL6x3)[303/500]. This abnormality was seen again in one of three available metaphases in a follow-up peripheral blood study five years later, consistent with persistent disease. Molecular genetic analysis identified the presence of somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region (IGH-V), which is recognized as an independent favorable prognostic marker in CLL. FISH analysis was negative for loss of SEC63 (6q21), amplification of MYC (8q24), loss of ATM (11q22.3), trisomy 12, loss of D13S319 (13q14.3), loss of TP53 (17p13.1) and CCND1/MYEOV IGH rearrangement [t(11;14)(q13;q32.30)]. Partial trisomy 3 is a relatively rare event seen in B-CLL, with commonly overrepresented segments including the q21-23 region and the q25-29 region of the long arm of chromosome 3, as well as changes leading to gains of 3q26- q27.

We included 238 patients for conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization study from January 2018 to October 2018. Patients with vPh in CML-Chronic Phase (CML-CP) were analyzed with respect to their demographic parameters, response to imatinib therapy, and survival. Out of 238 patients diagnosed with CML-CP, 8 patients (3.3%) showed vPh. The most common chromosomes involved in these translocations were 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11 and 12. In almost all the cases with variant Ph chromosome, the BCR-ABL rearrangement was detected by molecular methods or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All patients were treated with imatinib as a first-line therapy.

The goal of this study was to design a pulsed ultrasound (US) exposure scheme that reduced intracranial constructive interference and tissue heating, and maintained thrombolytic efficacy relative to continuous wave (CW) insonation. Three 220-kHz US schemes were evaluated, two pulsed insonation schemes (15 cycles, 68 µs pulse duration, 33% or 62.5% duty cycle) and an intermittent CW insonation scheme (50 s active, 30 s quiescent) over a 30-min treatment period. An in silico study using a finite-difference model of transcranial US propagation was performed to estimate the intracranial acoustic field and temperature rise in the skull for each insonation scheme. In vitro measurements with flow were performed to assess thrombolysis using time-lapse microscopy. Intracranial constructive interference was not reduced with pulsed US using a pulse length of 15 cycles compared to intermittent CW US. The 33.3% duty cycle pulsed US scheme reduced heating in the temporal bone as much as 60% relative to the intermittent CW scheme. All insonation schemes promoted sustained stable cavitation in vitro and augmented thrombolysis compared to rt-PA alone (p&amp;lt;0.05). Ultraharmonic and harmonic cumulative energy over a 30-min treatment period was significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) for the intermittent CW US scheme compared to either pulsed US scheme. Despite the difference in cavitation emissions, no difference was observed in the clot lysis between the three US schemes. These findings demonstrate that a 33.3% duty cycle pulsed US scheme with a 15 cycle burst can reduce bone heating and achieve equivalent thrombolytic efficacy as an intermittent CW scheme.",Oxygen and potassium vacancies in KTP calculated from <i>first principles</i>.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189148,Journal of physics.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images highlighted how neurites of SGNs follow straight lines by growing on top and between micro-pillars. Only micro-pillars with small and intermediate pillar spacings favor neurite alignment along preferred angles (30°, 90°, and 150°), while pillars with wider spacing produced less aligned neurites. We found propensity of adult SGNs grown on MPSs to attain more bipolar and multipolar morphologies.

Such chemicals can exert estrogenic activity and thereby disrupt neurobehavioral programming. Besides inducing direct host effects, GEN might cause gut dysbiosis and alter gut metabolites. To determine whether exposure to GEN affects these parameters, California mice (Peromyscus californicus) dams were placed two weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation on a diet supplemented with GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight) or AIN93G phytoestrogen-free control diet (AIN). At weaning, offspring socio-communicative behaviors, gut microbiota and metabolite profiles were assayed. Exposure of offspring to GEN induced sex-dependent effects on gut microbiota and metabolites. GEN exposed females were less likely to investigate a novel female mouse when tested in a three-chamber social test. When isolated, GEN males and females exhibited increased latency to elicit their first call, suggestive of reduced motivation to communicate with other individuals. Correlation analyses revealed interactions between GEN-induced microbiome, metabolome, and socio-communicative behaviors. For instance, comparison of GEN males with AIN males revealed the fraction of calls above 20 kHz was associated with daidzein, tocopherol, Flexispira spp., and Odoribacter spp. Results suggest early GEN exposure disrupts normal socio-communicative behaviors in California mice, which are otherwise evident in these social rodents. Such effects may be due to GEN disruptions on neural programming but might be attributed to GEN-induced microbiota shifts and resultant changes in gut metabolites. Findings indicate cause for concern that perinatal exposure to GEN might detrimentally affect offspring microbiome-gut-brain axis.",Adrenalectomy impairs insulin-induced hypophagia and related hypothalamic changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189132,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 06 12,"Adrenalectomy (ADX) induces hypophagia and glucocorticoids counter- regulate the peripheral metabolic effects of insulin. This study evaluated the effects of ADX on ICV (lateral ventricle) injection of insulin-induced changes on food intake, mRNA expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides [insulin receptor (InsR), proopiomelanocortin, cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), agouti-related protein, neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), corticotrophin-releasing factor in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus], and hypothalamic protein content of insulin signaling related molecules [insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1, protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP)]. Compared with sham animals, ADX increased hypothalamic content of pJNK/JNK, PTP1B and TCPTP, as well as decreased mRNA expression of InsR, and corticosterone (B) treatment reversed these effects. Insulin central injection enhanced hypothalamic content of pAKT/AKT and CART mRNA expression, decreased NPY mRNA expression and food intake only in sham rats, without effects in ADX and ADX+B rats. Insulin did not alter hypothalamic phosphorylation of IRS1 and ERK1/2 in the three experimental groups. These data demonstrate that ADX reduces the expression of InsR and increases insulin counter-regulators in the hypothalamus, as well as ADX abolishes hypophagia, activation of hypothalamic AKT pathway and changes in CART and NPY mRNA expression in the ARC induced by insulin. Thus, the higher levels of insulin counter-regulatory proteins and lower expression of InsR in the hypothalamus are likely to underlie impaired insulin-induced hypophagia and responses in the hypothalamus after ADX.",Endothelial adenosine kinase deficiency ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189131,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 06 12,"Insulin resistance-related disorders are associated with endothelial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for adenosine signaling in the regulation of endothelial function. Here, we identified a crucial role of endothelial adenosine kinase (ADK) in the regulation of insulin resistance. Feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) markedly enhanced expression of endothelial Adk. Ablation of endothelial Adk in HFD fed mice improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, decreased hepatic steatosis, adipose inflammation, and adiposity, which were associated with improved arteriole vasodilation, decreased inflammation and increased adipose angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ADK inhibition or knockdown in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) elevated intracellular adenosine level and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) activity, resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. Antagonism of adenosine receptor A2b abolished ADK-knockdown- enhanced NOS3 expression in HUVECs. Additionally, increased phosphorylation of NOS3 in ADK-knockdown HUVECs was regulated by an adenosine receptor-independent mechanism. These data suggest that Adk-deficiency-elevated intracellular adenosine in endothelial cells ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, and this is associated with an enhancement of NO production caused by increased NOS3 expression and activation. Therefore, ADK is a potential target for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance.",Molecular and clinical insights from studies of calcium-sensing receptor mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189130,Journal of molecular endocrinology,2019 06 12,"Twenty-five years have elapsed since the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) was first identified in bovine parathyroid and the receptor is now recognized as a fundamental contributor to extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+e) homeostasis, regulating parathyroid hormone release and urinary calcium excretion. The CaSR is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is functionally active as a homodimer and couples to multiple G-protein subtypes to activate intracellular signalling pathways. The importance of the CaSR in the regulation of Ca2+e has been highlighted by the identification of >400 different germline loss- and gain-of-function CaSR mutations that give rise to disorders of Ca2+e homeostasis. CaSR inactivating mutations cause neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, characterised by marked hypercalcaemia, skeletal demineralisation and failure to thrive in early infancy; and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, an often asymptomatic disorder associated with mild-moderately elevated serum calcium concentrations. Activating mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia, which is occasionally associated with a Bartter's-like phenotype. Recent elucidation of the CaSR extracellular domain structure enabled the locations of CaSR mutations to be mapped and has revealed clustering in locations important for structural integrity, receptor dimerisation and ligand-binding. Moreover, the study of disease-causing mutations has demonstrated that CaSR signals in a biased manner and have revealed specific residues important for receptor activation. This review presents the current understanding of the genetic landscape of CaSR mutations by summarising findings from clinical and functional studies of disease-associated mutations. It concludes with reflections on how recently uncovered signaling pathways may expand understanding of calcium homeostasis disorders.",The diurnal variation of bone formation is attenuated in adult patients with type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189129,European journal of endocrinology,2019 06 12,"Bone turnover has a diurnal variation influenced by food intake, incretin hormones, the sympathetic nervous system, and osteocyte function.

Meanwhile, utilization of IL-6 neutralizing antibody could partially attenuate the increased cancer growth and invasion abilities in Ishikawa and RL95-2 endometrial cancer cell lines and an orthotopic endometrial cancer model. We established a causative link between estrogen and IL-6 signaling activation in the development of endometrial cancer. The molecular mechanism defined in this study provided the evidence that E2 promotes endometrial carcinoma progression via activating the IL-6 pathway, indicating that interruption of IL-6 might be an essential therapeutic strategy in estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer.",Molecular prognostic factors in small-intestinal neuro-endocrine tumours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189127,Endocrine connections,2019 06 12,"Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SI-NETs) represent a heterogeneous group of rare tumours.

The importance of MC2R in adrenal physiology is exemplified by the condition familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), a potentially fatal disease characterised by isolated cortisol deficiency. MC2R mutations cause ~25% of cases. The discovery of a MC2R accessory protein MRAP, mutations of which account for ~20% of FGD, has provided insight into MC2R trafficking and signalling. MRAP is a single transmembrane domain accessory protein highly expressed in the adrenal gland and essential for MC2R expression and function. Mouse models helped elucidate the action of ACTH. The Mc2r knockout (Mc2r-/-) mice was the first mouse model developed to have adrenal insufficiency with deficiencies in glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and catecholamines. We recently reported the generation of the Mrap-/- mice which better mimics the human FGD phenotype with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency alone. The adrenal glands of adult Mrap-/- mice were grossly dysmorphic with a thickened capsule, deranged zonation and deranged WNT4/beta-catenin and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway signalling. Collectively, these mouse models of FGD highlight the importance of ACTH and MRAP in adrenal progenitor cell regulation, cortex maintenance and zonation.",Medium-term dynamics of element concentrations in a sparid fish and its isopod parasite after the Prestige oil-spill: Shifting baselines?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189125,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Historically, the European Atlantic is probably the most important oil-spill hotspot worldwide. One of the most recent accidents occurred in 2002 when the oil-tanker Prestige sank over the Galician Bank causing two major oil-spills followed by several small leaks until March 2003. This resulted in contamination of virtually all types of marine habitat. Considering that parasites have proved to be good effect and accumulation bioindicators, the present study addresses the medium-term changes in trace element content after the Prestige oil-spill in a model host-parasite system, the bogue, Boops boops (Sparidae) and the isopod Ceratothoa oestroides. To our knowledge, this study is the first to address trace element concentrations in natural fish and parasite populations associated with the effects of an oil-spill. We observed that both test organisms examined, the host and the parasite, indicate a detectable change in the relative composition of trace element concentrations before and after the Prestige oil-spill. Multivariate analyses also indicated a differential response of the different tissues to the temporal sampling sequence. However, analyses of both host and parasite tissues supported the pattern of a gradual temporal transition to a state of relative trace element content distinctly departing from the pre-spill situation. Moreover, the parasite-host element accumulation ratios better depicted this temporal pattern. Additionally, changes in V concentrations in fish liver tissues and Ni concentrations in the parasite tissues suggest that this host-parasite system may be a useful tool to assess these two element contaminations linked to heavy fuel oil-spill.",Optimization of process parameters for hydrothermal conversion of castor residue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189124,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,Castor plant (Ricinus communis) is a fast-growing shrub from Euphorbiaceae family. India ranks first in the world for the production of castor seeds. The generation of residue from its leaves and stems is more than 50% of the whole plant. This research work involves the estimation of the optimum condition for the production/value addition by hydrothermal liquefaction of castor residue using factorial design. Temperature (T) and residence time (RT) are the key parameters that affect the bio-oil yield. A 32 full factorial design was employed to understand the affects the bio-oil yield and conversion with key parameters. The key parameter and its interaction effects were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA); F-test and p-values were used to rank the process variable affecting the total bio-oil yield. It was observed that the temperature imparts significant effect on total bio-oil yield. The optimum conditions to obtain maximum total bio-oil yield are T = 300 °C and RT = 60 min. The statistical model was best fitted with high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9994 and 0.9473 for total bio-oil yield and conversion respectively.

We investigated the innervation of LVs and the response to agonists and antagonists of the autonomic nervous system in vivo. While skin-draining collecting LVs express muscarinic, α1- and β2-adrenergic receptors on lymphatic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, intestinal lacteals express only β-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors on their smooth muscle cells. Quantitative in vivo near-infrared imaging of the exposed flank-collecting LV revealed that muscarinic and α1-adrenergic agonists increased LV contractility, whereas activation of β2-adrenergic receptors inhibited contractility and initiated nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation. Tumor-draining LVs were expanded and showed a higher innervation density and contractility that was reduced by treatment with atropine, phentolamine, and, most potently, isoproterenol. These findings likely have clinical implications given the impact of lymphatic fluid drainage on intratumoral fluid pressure and thus drug delivery.",Influenza Virus Exploits an Interferon-Independent lncRNA to Preserve Viral RNA Synthesis through Stabilizing Viral RNA Polymerase PB1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189112,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in host antiviral defense by modulating immune responses. However, it remains largely unexplored how viruses exploit interferon (IFN)-independent host lncRNAs to facilitate viral replication. Here, we have identified a group of human lncRNAs that modulate influenza A virus (IAV) replication in a loss-of-function screen and found that an IFN-independent lncRNA, called IPAN, is hijacked by IAV to assist IAV replication. IPAN is specifically induced by IAV infection independently of IFN and associates with and stabilizes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase PB1, enabling efficient viral RNA synthesis. Silencing IPAN results in PB1 degradation and severely impairs viral infection. Therefore, our data unveil an important role of host lncRNAs in promoting viral replication by modulating viral protein stability. Our findings may open avenues to the development of antiviral therapeutics.",N-Glycolylneuraminic Acid as a Receptor for Influenza A Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189111,Cell reports,2019 06 15,"A species barrier for the influenza A virus is the differential expression of sialic acid, which can either be α2,3-linked for avians or α2,6-linked for human viruses. The influenza A virus hosts also express other species-specific sialic acid derivatives. One major modification at C-5 is N-glycolyl (NeuGc), instead of N-acetyl (NeuAc). N-glycolyl is mammalian specific and expressed in pigs and horses, but not in humans, ferrets, seals, or dogs. Hemagglutinin (HA) adaptation to either N-acetyl or N-glycolyl is analyzed on a sialoside microarray containing both α2,3- and α2,6-linkage modifications on biologically relevant N-glycans. Binding studies reveal that avian, human, and equine HAs bind either N-glycolyl or N-acetyl. Structural data on N-glycolyl binding HA proteins of both H5 and H7 origin describe this specificity. Neuraminidases can cleave N-glycolyl efficiently, and tissue-binding studies reveal strict species specificity. The exclusive manner in which influenza A viruses differentiate between N-glycolyl and N-acetyl is indicative of selection.",TRIM5α Restricts Flavivirus Replication by Targeting the Viral Protease for Proteasomal Degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189110,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a cellular antiviral restriction factor that prevents early events in retrovirus replication. The activity of TRIM5α is thought to be limited to retroviruses as a result of highly specific interactions with capsid lattices. In contrast to this current understanding, we show that both human and rhesus macaque TRIM5α suppress replication of specific flaviviruses. Multiple viruses in the tick-borne encephalitis complex are sensitive to TRIM5α-dependent restriction, but mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses, are resistant. TRIM5α suppresses replication by binding to the viral protease NS2B/3 to promote its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, TRIM5α contributes to the antiviral function of IFN-I against sensitive flaviviruses in human cells. Thus, TRIM5α possesses remarkable plasticity in the recognition of diverse virus families, with the potential to influence human susceptibility to emerging flaviviruses of global concern.",Robust Control of a Brain-Persisting Parasite through MHC I Presentation by Infected Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189109,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Control of CNS pathogens by CD8 T cells is key to avoid fatal neuroinflammation. Yet, the modalities of MHC I presentation in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the antigen presentation mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell-mediated control of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite in the CNS. We show that MHC I presentation of an efficiently processed model antigen (GRA6-OVA), even when not expressed in the bradyzoite stage, reduces cyst burden and dampens encephalitis in C57BL/6 mice. Antigen presentation assays with infected primary neurons reveal a correlation between lower MHC I presentation of tachyzoite antigens by neurons and poor parasite control in vivo. Using conditional MHC I-deficient mice, we find that neuronal MHC I presentation is required for robust restriction of T. gondii in the CNS during chronic phase, showing the importance of MHC I presentation by CNS neurons in the control of a prevalent brain pathogen.",Common Genetic Variations Associated with the Persistence of Immunity following Childhood Immunization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189108,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Vaccines have revolutionized public health, preventing millions of deaths each year, particularly in childhood. Yet, there is considerable variability in the magnitude and persistence of vaccine-induced immunity. Maintenance of specific antibody is essential for continuity of vaccine-induced serological protection. We conducted a genome-wide association study into the persistence of immunity to three childhood vaccines: capsular group C meningococcal (MenC), Haemophilus influenzae type b, and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines. We detail associations between variants in a locus containing a family of signal-regulatory proteins and the persistence MenC immunity. We postulate a regulatory role for the lead SNP, with supporting epigenetic and expression quantitative trait loci data. Furthermore, we define associations between SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and the persistence of TT-specific immunity. Moreover, we describe four classical HLA alleles, HLA DRB1∗0301, HLA DQB1∗0201, HLA DQB1∗0602, and HLA DRB1∗1501, associated with TT-specific immunity, independent of the lead SNP association.",Transcriptional States and Chromatin Accessibility Underlying Human Erythropoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189107,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Human erythropoiesis serves as a paradigm of physiologic cellular differentiation. This process is also of considerable interest for better understanding anemias and identifying new therapies. Here, we apply deep transcriptomic and accessible chromatin profiling to characterize a faithful ex vivo human erythroid differentiation system from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We reveal stage-specific transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility during various stages of erythropoiesis, including 14,260 differentially expressed genes and 63,659 variably accessible chromatin peaks. Our analysis suggests differentiation stage-predominant roles for specific master regulators, including GATA1 and KLF1. We integrate chromatin profiles with common and rare genetic variants associated with erythroid cell traits and diseases, finding that variants regulating different erythroid phenotypes likely act at variable points during differentiation. In addition, we identify a regulator of terminal erythropoiesis, TMCC2, more broadly illustrating the value of this comprehensive analysis to improve our understanding of erythropoiesis in health and disease.",ZIC3 Controls the Transition from Naive to Primed Pluripotency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189106,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) must transition through a series of intermediate cell states before becoming terminally differentiated. Here, we investigated the early events in this transition by determining the changes in the open chromatin landscape as naive mouse ESCs transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Motif enrichment analysis of the newly opening regions coupled with expression analysis identified ZIC3 as a potential regulator of this cell fate transition. Chromatin binding and genome-wide transcriptional profiling following Zic3 depletion confirmed ZIC3 as an important regulatory transcription factor, and among its targets are genes encoding a number of transcription factors. Among these is GRHL2, which acts through enhancer switching to maintain the expression of a subset of genes from the ESC state. Our data therefore place ZIC3 upstream of a set of pro-differentiation transcriptional regulators and provide an important advance in our understanding of the regulatory factors governing the early steps in ESC differentiation.",Nuclear Pre-snRNA Export Is an Essential Quality Assurance Mechanism for Functional Spliceosomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189105,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Removal of introns from pre-mRNAs is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression, mediated by spliceosomes that contain snRNAs as key components. Although snRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and function in the same compartment, all except U6 shuttle to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the physiological relevance for shuttling is unclear, in particular because the snRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reported to remain nuclear. Here, we show that all yeast pre-snRNAs including U6 undergo a stepwise maturation process after nuclear export by Mex67 and Xpo1. Sm- and Lsm-ring attachment occurs in the cytoplasm and is important for the snRNA re-import, mediated by Cse1 and Mtr10. Finally, nuclear pre-snRNA cleavage and trimethylation of the 5'-cap finalizes shuttling. Importantly, preventing pre-snRNAs from being exported or processed results in faulty spliceosome assembly and subsequent genome-wide splicing defects. Thus, pre-snRNA export is obligatory for functional splicing and resembles an essential evolutionarily conserved quality assurance step.",The Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Protein (FTO) Regulates Locomotor Responses to Novelty via D2R Medium Spiny Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189104,Cell reports,2019 06 12,"Variations in the human FTO gene have been linked to obesity and altered connectivity of the dopaminergic neurocircuitry. Here, we report that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in dopamine D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2 MSNs) of mice regulate the excitability of these cells and control their striatopallidal globus pallidus external (GPe) projections. Lack of FTO in D2 MSNs translates into increased locomotor activity to novelty, associated with altered timing behavior, without impairing the ability to control actions or affecting reward-driven and conditioned behavior. Pharmacological manipulations of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)- or D2R-dependent pathways in these animals reveal altered responses to D1- and D2-MSN-mediated control of motor output. These findings reveal a critical role for FTO to control D2 MSN excitability, their projections to the GPe, and behavioral responses to novelty."

However, quiescence can become deregulated in pathological settings. In this review, we discuss the recent advances uncovering intracellular signaling pathways, transcriptional changes, and extracellular cues within the stem cell niche that control induction and exit from quiescence in tissue stem cells.

Risk factors prominently observed among positive HCV and HBV cases were longer duration of diabetes, hospital admission, history of jaundice and history of surgeries which enlightened the importance of hepatitis vaccination once the subject is diagnosed with diabetes.","Bone mineral density, structure, distribution and strength in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189088,Bone,2019 06 12,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival in men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa), but has been associated with compromised skeletal health and increased fracture risk. However, limited previous research has investigated determinants of bone strength beyond DXA-derived areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in this population group. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effects of ADT in men with PCa on BMD, bone structure, estimates of whole bone strength and cortical bone distribution. A total of 70 ADT-treated men, 52 PCa controls and 70 healthy controls had DXA lumbar spine and proximal femur aBMD and pQCT distal (4%) and proximal (66%) tibia and radius cortical and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone structure, strength and cortical bone distribution assessed. Analyses included BMI and/or tibia/radius length as covariates. On average, ADT-treated men had a higher BMI than PCa (P < 0.05) but not healthy controls. ADT-treated men had 7.2-7.8% lower lumbar spine aBMD than PCa (P = 0.037) and healthy controls (P = 0.010), with a trend for a lower total hip aBMD in the ADT-treated men (P = 0.07). At the distal tibia, total bone area was 6.2-7.3% greater in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01), but total vBMD was 8.4-8.7% lower in ADT-treated men than both controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, bone strength index (BSI) was 10.8% lower relative to healthy controls only (P < 0.05).

Based on histopathological appearance at lung biopsy or autopsy, they have been termed: alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACDMPV), acinar dysplasia (AcDys), congenital alveolar dysplasia (CAD), and other unspecified primary pulmonary hypoplasias. However, the histopathological continuum in these lethal developmental disorders has made accurate diagnosis challenging, which has implications for recurrence risk. Over the past decade, genetic studies in infants with ACDMPV have revealed the causative role of the dosage-sensitive FOXF1 gene and its non-coding regulatory variants in the distant lung-specific enhancer at chromosome 16q24.1. In contrast, the molecular bases of AcDys and CAD have remained poorly understood. Most recently, disruption of the TBX4-FGF10-FGFR2 epithelial-mesenchymal signaling pathway has been reported in patients with these lethal pulmonary dysplasias. Application of next generation sequencing techniques, including exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has demonstrated their complex compound inheritance.

This study proposes fluorescence Stokes shift and specific fluorescence intensity (SFI) as novel indicators of hydrophobicity and MW. These indicators originate from the energy gap and photon efficiency of the fluorescence process, and can be readily extracted from a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). The statistical linkages between these indicators and hydrophobicity/MW were explored through investigation of DOMs across 10 full-scale membrane bioreactors treating municipal wastewater. Stokes shift was found to exhibit a general rule among the hydrophobicity components in the order of hydrophilic substances (HIS) < hydrophobic acids (HOA) < hydrophobic bases (HOB). The Stokes shift of 1.2 μm-1 is a critical border, above which the relative fluorescence correlated significantly with the HOA-related content (Pearson's r = 0.8). Regarding MW distribution (<1, 1-10, 10-100, and >100 kDa), SFI was found to be the most sensitive to the change of MW <1 kDa proportion, especially at the excitation/emission wavelengths of (200-320)/(310-550) nm (r > 0.9).

Interestingly, these defects are often associated with twin boundaries and have null Burgers vector, i.e. no long-range strain field. Here we analyze their stability by considering the forces that act on them and use in-situ aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to observe their behavior in GaAsP NWs using short annealing cycles. Their movement appears to be consistent with the thermally-activated single- or double-kink mechanisms of dislocation glide, with velocities that do not exceed 1 nm s-1. We find that motion of individual defects depends on their size, position, and surrounding environment and set an upper limit to activation energy around 2eV. The majority of defects (>70%) are removed by our post-growth annealing for several seconds at temperatures in excess of 640 °C, suggesting that in-situ annealing during growth at lower temperatures would significantly improve material quality. The remaining defects do not move at all and are thermodynamically stable in the nanowire.",Bi(OH)3/PdBi Composite Nanochains as Highly Active and Durable Electrocatalysts for Ethanol Oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189063,Nano letters,2019 06 12,"Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is critical for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells. However, current EOR catalysts suffer from high cost, low activity, and poor durability. Here we report the preparation of PdBi-Bi(OH)3 composite nanochains with outstanding EOR activity and durability. The incorporation of Bi can tune the electronic structure and downshift the d-band center of Pd, while the surface decoration of Bi(OH)3 can facilitate the oxidative removal of CO and other carbonaceous intermediates. As a result, the nanochains manifest an exceptional mass activity (5.30 A mgPd-1, 4.6-fold higher than that of commercial Pd/C) and outstanding durability (with a retained current density of ~ 1.00 A mgPd-1 after operating for 20,000 s). More importantly, the nanochains catalyst can be re-activated, and negligible activity loss has been observed after operating for 200,000 s with periodic re-activation, making it one of the best EOR catalysts.",Fluorescent Arylethynyl Hamilton Receptors for Barbiturate Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189061,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 12,"Barbiturates are common targets for molecular recognition in pre-organized receptors due to complementary hydrogen bond donor/acceptor interactions. Although many such receptors exhibit high selectivity and affinity for barbiturate guests, relatively few of these systems have desirable photophysical properties for sensing applications.

We also provide insights into the design principles required for efficient fluorogenic design of these systems to function as fluorescent barbiturate sensors.",Theoretical Study on the Rhodium-Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of C=C and C=O Double Bonds with Tertiary Silane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189060,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 12,"Reaction mechanisms of hydrosilylation of ketone and alkene with tertiary silane using Wilkinson-type catalyst were theoretically investigated on the basis of density functional calculations using ωB97XD functional. Previously proposed three mechanisms, Chalk-Harrod (CH) mechanism, modified Chalk-Harrod (mCH) mechanism, as well as outer-sphere mechanism were examined. Besides, we also found two mechanisms, alternative CH (aCH) mechanism and double hydride (DH) mechanism. In the aCH mechanism, a four-coordinate rhodium hydride complex formed through elimination of R3Si-Cl is a catalytically active species. In the DH mechanism, the active species is a six-coordinate complex with two Rh-H bonds. For the C=O double bond hydrosilylation, the rate-determining steps of the aCH and DH mechanisms are both acetone insertion into the Rh-H bond, and the order of the activation barriers is that DH < aCH ≈ CH < mCH. For the C=C double bond hydrosilylation, except for the mCH pathway whose rate-determining step is the hydrosilane addition reaction, the rate-determining steps of the CH, aCH, and DH pathways are Si-C reductive elimination reaction. The order of the energy barrier is that DH ≈ mCH < aCH ≈ CH. In the outer-sphere mechanism, no stable intermediate or transition state was found. Consequently, we concluded that the DH mechanism is adopted as the mechanism for the Rh-catalyzed hydrosilylation of carbonyl group while mCH or DH is adopted as that for alkenes under a condition where their active intermediates are formed. The present result revises a hypothesis that the hydrosilylation of carbonyl group is in general accomplished by the mCH mechanism. The active species in DH mechanism has one more extra Rh-H bond than that of the other pathways, and its interaction with silyl group, trans-influence, and small steric effect are the origin of the highly efficient catalytic activity, which was not reported before.",Postdeposition UV-Ozone Treatment: An Enabling Technique to Enhance the Direct Adhesion of Gold Thin Films to Oxidized Silicon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189059,ACS nano,2019 06 13,"We found that continuous films of gold (Au) on oxidized silicon (SiO2) substrates, upon treatment with ultraviolet (UV)-ozone, exhibit strong adhesion to the SiO2 support. Importantly, the enhancement is independent of micro- or nanostructuring of such nanometer-thick films. Deposition of a second Au layer on top of the pretreated Au layer makes the adhesion stable for at least 5 months in environmental air. Using this treatment method enables us to large-scale fabricate various SiO2-supported Au structures at various thicknesses with dimensions spanning from a few hundreds of nanometers to a few micrometers, without the use of additional adhesion layers. We explain the observed adhesion improvement as polarization-induced increased strength of Auδ-Siδ+ bonds at the Au-SiO2 interface due to the formation of a gold oxide monolayer on the Au surface by the UV-ozone treatment. Our simple and enabling method thus provides opportunities for patterning Au micro/nanostructures on SiO2 substrates without an intermediate metallic adhesion layer, which is critical for biosensing and nanophotonic applications.",Bonding in 2D donor-acceptor heterostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189058,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 12,"The ability to alter distances between atoms is among the most important tools in materials design. Despite this importance, controlling the interlayer distance in stacks of 2D materials remains a challenge. Here we show from first-principles that stacking electrenes-a new class of electron-donating 2D materials-with other 2D materials provides this control. The resulting donor-acceptor heterostructures have interlayer distances 1 Å less than van der Waals layered materials but 1 Å more than covalent or ionic bonds. This yields a class of quasi-bonds that exhibit characteristics of both ordinary chemical bonds and van der Waals interactions. We show how quasi-bonds have tunable polarities and strengths, and that these bonds can be understood by drawing on familiar concepts from molecular orbital theory. We also demonstrate several useful properties of 2D donor-acceptor heterostructures, including superlubricity, ultra-low work functions, and greatly improved voltages for lithium-ion batteries.",Spirometry Measurement of Peak Inspiratory Flow Identifies Suboptimal Use of Dry Powder Inhalers in Ambulatory Patients with COPD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189057,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Miami, Fla.)",2019 06 12,Determine the prevalence of suboptimal peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) and associated patient characteristics and compare PIFR measurements obtained with spirometry and In-Check DIAL® device in ambulatory patients with COPD.,Clinical Metagenomic Sequencing for Diagnosis of Meningitis and Encephalitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189036,The New England journal of medicine,2019 06 12,Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to identify a broad range of pathogens in a single test.

The work is motivated by the need to understand the molecular nature of the solvent-induced changes in capacity of Li-air batteries. We have shown that the dependence of the solvation shell stability on the cation size has a maximum at a particular ion radius that corresponds to a solvent coordination number of 4. The shell stability maximum coincides with the diffusion coefficient minimum. The variation of the cation shell stability has a crucial impact on the kinetics of the cation - O2- association. We have demonstrated that profound inhibition of the association reaction for Li+ in dimethyl sulfoxide is a result of the lock-and-key effect that cannot be described in the framework of Hard Soft Acid Base theory.",Coupled Application of Antioxidant Defence Response and Embryo Development in Amphipod Crustaceans in the Assessment of Sediment Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189019,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,2019 06 12,"Survival rate, frequency of malformed embryos, and antioxidant defence system (ADS) responses in the benthic amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus from the Baltic Sea were measured to examine the effects of toxic sediments, and to assess the usefulness of these endpoints in sediment toxicity biotesting. A highly contaminated sediment sample from the Baltic Sea was diluted with sediment from a clean site to come up with a series of five test sediments with dilutions from 1:32 to 1:1024, and the reference sediment. The 1:32 dilution of the test sediment was analysed for organotins (2862 µg Sn kg dry weight [dw]-1 ), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (6064 µg kg dw-1 ), and selected trace metals (e.g., Cu 352 mg kg dw-1 ). The survival rate of G. fasciatus (10-d toxicity test) was 100% in the reference and 1:1024 treatments, and started to decline from the 1:256 dilution onwards. In a 28-d experiment, various types of morphological malformations were observed in 11-80% of the amphipod embryos in the 1:64, 1:128 and 1:256 dilutions, with only <5% in the reference treatment. Also, elevated activities in the ADS enzymes glutathione S-transferase and catalase were observed in amphipods exposed to the contaminated sediments compared to the reference treatment, with responses at lower contamination levels compared to the appearance of malformations in the embryos. The results obtained illustrate the effectiveness of the combined application of embryonic malformations and ADS biomarkers in amphipods in the assessment of sediment toxicity, and potentially also of sublethal effects of chemical contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

We investigated the responses of relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (Pornsiriwong et al.), chlorophyll content and metabolites in flag leaves of commercial wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to three drought treatments in the glasshouse and field environments. We observed strong genetic associations between glasshouse-based RWC, metabolites and yield-gap based drought tolerance (YDT): the ratio of yield in water-limited versus well-watered conditions across 18 field environments spanning sites and seasons. Critically, RWC response to glasshouse drought was strongly associated with both YDT (r2 = 0.85, p < 8E-6) and RWC under field drought (r2 = 0.77, p < 0.05). Moreover, multiple regression analyses revealed that 98% of genetic YDT variance was explained by drought responses of four metabolites: serine, asparagine, methionine and lysine (R2 = 0.98; p < 0.01). Fitted coefficients suggested that, for given levels of serine and asparagine, stronger methionine and lysine accumulation was associated with higher YDT. Collectively, our results demonstrate that high-throughput, targeted metabolic phenotyping of glasshouse-grown plants may be an effective tool for selection of wheat cultivars with high field-derived YDT.",Overexpression of the Cdk5 inhibitory peptide in motor neurons rescue of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype in a mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189016,Human molecular genetics,2019 06 12,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Etiological mechanisms underlying the disease remain poorly understood, recent studies suggest that deregulation of p25/Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity leads to the hyperphosphorylation of Tau and neurofilament (NF) proteins in ALS transgenic mouse model (SOD1G37R). A Cdk5 involvement in motor neuron degeneration is supported by analysis of three SOD1G37R mouse lines exhibiting perikaryal inclusions of NF proteins and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Cdk5/p25 hyperactivation in vivo is a neuroprotective factor during ALS pathogenesis by crossing the new transgenic mouse line that overexpress Cdk5 inhibitory peptide (CIP) in motor neurons with the SOD1G37R, ALS mouse model (TriTg mouse line). The overexpression of CIP in the motor neurons significantly improves motor deficits, extends survival and delays pathology in brain and spinal cord of TriTg mice. In addition, overexpression of CIP in motor neurons significantly delays neuroinflammatory responses in TriTg mouse. Taken together, these data suggest that CIP may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",A symbiotic balancing act: arbuscular mycorrhizal specificity and specialist fungus gnat pollination in the mycoheterotrophic genus Thismia (Thismiaceae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189014,Annals of botany,2019 06 12,"Mycorrhizal associations in mycoheterotrophic plants are generally more specialized than in autotrophs.

Automation of this process would eliminate issues associated with cuing, subjectivity in data collection, and reinforcement delivery. Herein, I describe an automated apparatus that can accommodate almost any type of sample that can be brought into the laboratory. The apparatus consists of a 17-segment carousel that rotates behind a panel. Dogs can access a single sample at a time through a port in the panel. Infrared beams are used to detect sample observations and indications, and a dog-activated switch is used to advance the carousel to the next sample. Correct indications are reinforced with an automated feeder. After screening 12 dogs, 5 dogs were selected and trained to use the apparatus to classify samples containing amyl-acetate. All dogs achieved hit rates and correct rejection rates at or near 100% in fewer than 25 half-days of training (mean: 19.6, range: 12 - 24). These data suggest that the apparatus can be used to obtain accurate sample classification without excessive training requirements. Future improvements to the apparatus and training protocols may reduce the training requirements further.",Cutoff Value for Correcting White Blood Cell Count for Nucleated Red Blood Cells: What is it? Why is it Important?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189011,Laboratory medicine,2019 06 12,"Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.","Shallow plant-dominated lakes - extreme environmental variability, carbon cycling and ecological species challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189010,Annals of botany,2019 06 12,"Submerged plants composed of charophytes (green algae) and angiosperms develop dense vegetation in small, shallow lakes and in littoral zones of large lakes.

Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and CNKI databases for animal experiments comparing loading protocols and the long-term stability of micro-screws. Among 1011 detected papers, 16 studies met the eligibility criteria and were selected for analysis. Most studies showed medium methodological quality for evaluation of micro-screws' long-term stability. Five studies reported that loading would not destroy the long-term stability of micro-screws. Three studies indicated that low-intensity immediate loading or a 3-week minimal healing time was acceptable. Two studies reported that the loading magnitude was a controversial issue with regard to the micro-screws' long-term stability. Two studies suggested that counterclockwise loading could decrease the long-term stability of micro-screws. In conclusion, immediate loading below 100g force, healing time greater than 3 weeks, regular loading below 200g force and a clockwise direction of force supported the long-term stability of micro-screws.

The pig population also becomes infected by this pathogen, and undercooked or raw meat is an important source of infection for humans. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the rate of exposure of pigs to T. gondii in the municipality of Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte and seek to identify associations with possible risk factors. Blood samples were collected from 412 pigs and were analyzed using the immunofluorescence assay. Among these 412 serum samples, 40.7% were seropositive for T. gondii. The IgG antibody titers were 64 (56 specimens), 128 (32), 256 (37), 512 (23), 1024 (14), 2048 (5) and 4046 (1). Seropositivity for T. gondii was found to be related (p-value < 0.05) to the following factors: female gender, semi-confined rearing system, use of well water, dewormed animals, presence of cats, goats, sheep, mice and vultures on the farm and carcasses left on the ground. In contrast, seropositivity was not related (p-value < 0.05) to the age of the pigs, type of facility or feeding with human food remains.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate several techniques used for T. vivax diagnosis in order to assess the best way of using them during the course of the disease. Molecular methods demonstrated higher rates of detection than parasitological methods, detecting 33 of the 54 (61.1%) known positive samples, while the hematocrit centrifugation technique (best parasitological test) detected only 44.4%. The serological methods, IFAT and ELISA, detected seropositivity in 51 of the 54 (94.4%) and 49 of the 54 (90.7%) known positive samples, respectively. Despite being highly sensitive, the latter only demonstrates exposure to the infectious agent and does not indicate whether the infection is active. The present study was the first to use the qPCR for a South American isolate, improving disease detection and quantification. Furthermore, the analyses revealed that the patent phase of the disease may extend up to 42 days, longer than previously reported. The combination of several diagnostic techniques can lower the frequency of false negative results and contributes toward better disease control."

O ut of the 150 MtMYB genes, 139 were distributed among 8 chromosomes, with tandem duplications (TD) and segment duplications (SD). Microarray data was used for functional analysis of the MtMYB genes during growth and development al processes providing e vidence for a role in tissue s differentiation, seed development processes and especially the nodulation process. Furthermore, we have investigated the expression of MtMYB genes in response to abiotic stresses using RNA-seq data, which confirmed the critical roles in signal transduction and regulation processes under abiotic stress. We used quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR) to validate expression profiles. The expression pattern of M. truncatula MYB genes under different abiotic stress conditions suggest that some may play a major r ole in cross talk among different signal transduction pathways in response to abiotic stresses.

Known as Brazilian pine, A. angustifolia is the only native conifer species with economic/social relevance in this country. Due to massive exploitation, this species suffered significant population decline and currently is classified as critically endangered. It encouraged the scientific community to investigate genetic features in Brazilian pine to increase resources for management and preservation. In this work, RNA-Seq data was used to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the A. angustifolia chloroplast genome (cpDNA). The cpDNA is 146,203 bp in length and contains 122 genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 5 ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 tRNA genes. Coding regions comprise 45.02%; 4.96% correspond to rRNAs and tRNAs, and 50.02% of the genome encompasses non-coding regions. Genes found in inverted repeat (IR) are present as single copy, with exceptions to rrn5 and trnI-CAU loci. The typical LSC, SSC, IRa and IRb organization reported in several land-plant groups is not present in A. angustifolia cpDNA.

Methylation of the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is a post-transcriptional epigenetic modification of RNA. To investigate the role of m6A methylation in parthenogenetic (PA) embryonic development, we analyzed METTL3, METTL14, FTO, ALKBH5, YTHDF2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP2 expression by quantitative real-time PCR. These genes were dynamically expressed during the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst stages of the embryo. Compared to normally fertilized embryos, the expression of these genes was perturbed in PA embryos, especially at the 8-cell stage. Furthermore, immunofluorescence was used to detect m6A expression. The results demonstrated that m6A expression decreased in the 2-cell stage, whereas it increased in the 8-cell stage of PA embryos. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of RNA methylation-related genes was perturbed, leading to abnormal m6A modification during early development in PA embryos.",[PROVISIONAL] Association of long non-coding RNA MIAT and MALAT1 expression profiles in peripheral blood of coronary artery disease patients with previous cardiac events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188931,Genetics and molecular biology,2019 06 12,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in various cellular and pathological processes.

Here, we aimed to determine the relative circulating levels of MIAT and MALAT1 in 110 stable CAD patients and 117 controls and to correlate their levels with the clinical and laboratory data. Peripheral blood expression levels were quantified by Real-Time qPCR. The median MIAT expression level in CAD patients was significantly 12-fold higher than controls (p<0.001). Otherwise, the median MALAT1 expression level was comparable in patient and control groups. Both lncRNAs showed significantly higher relative expression levels in patients with positive history of previous cardiac ischemic events, and MIAT showed significantly higher expression in diabetic CAD patients. The area under the curve of MIAT (0.888±0.02 with sensitivity 95.5% and specificity 72.7%), was significantly larger than that of MALAT1 (0.601±0.04 with sensitivity 50 % and specificity 63.6%) for detecting the presence of significant CAD.

PubMed, SCOPUS, EBSCO, LILACS, and other Latin-specific databases were searched for case-control studies that investigated the association between these polymorphisms and hematologic malignancies until November 2017. Genotype distributions were extracted and either Fixed-Effects or Random-Effects models were used to calculate the pooled crude odds ratios (ORs) for the heterozygous, homozygous, dominant, recessive, and allelic genetic models. No publication bias was detected by the Begg-Mazumdar's test and Egger's test. From 290 publications, we identified 15 studies for C677T polymorphism and 13 studies for the A1298C polymorphism. We observed a significant decrease in risk for the C677T polymorphism (OR range=0.54-0.75, p<0.01) and a significant increase risk for the A1298C polymorphism (OR range=1.28-2.52, p<0.05) for developing ALL for all genetic models. No associations were determined for CML, AML, or MM for either polymorphism. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the A1298C polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of developing ALL, whereas the C677T polymorphism was associated with a decrease risk (protective factor) for the Latino population.",[PROVISIONAL] Mapping of QTL for total spikelet number per spike on chromosome 2D in wheat using a high-density genetic map.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188928,Genetics and molecular biology,2019 06 12,"Total spikelet number per spike (TSS) is one of the key components of grain yield in wheat.

To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TSS, we constructed an integrated high-density genetic map of chr. 2D containing two simple sequence repeats, 35 diversity array technology markers, and 143 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We identified three stable QTL for TSS that individually explained 9.7-19.2% of the phenotypic variation and predicted 23 putative candidate genes within the QTL mapping interval. Overall, our results provide insight into the genetic basis of TSS in synthetic hexaploid wheat that may be useful in breeding high-yielding wheat cultivars."

Of the 629 patients screened, 300 high-risk older adults with NSTEACS managed by an invasive strategy were recruited. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at index presentation. The primary outcome was defined as 1-year composite of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unplanned repeat revascularisation, significant bleeding or stroke. Mean age was 80.5±4.8 years (61.9% male).

In the context of complex genomes, such as herpesviruses where there is extensive genic overlap, identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) is particularly problematic and cannot be comprehensively accessed by standard RNA sequencing approaches. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic gammaherpesvirus and the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and the B cell lymphoma primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Here, we leverage RNA annotation and mapping of promoters for analysis of gene expression (RAMPAGE) and define KSHV TSSs transcriptome-wide and at nucleotide resolution in two widely used models of KSHV infection, namely iSLK.219 cells and the PEL cell line TREx-BCBL1-RTA. By mapping TSSs over a 96 h time course of reactivation we confirm 48 of 50 previously identified TSSs. Moreover, we identify over 100 novel transcription start site clusters (TSCs) in each cell line. Our analyses identified cell-type specific differences in TSC positions as well as promoter strength, and defined motifs within viral core promoters. Collectively, by defining TSSs at high resolution we have greatly expanded the transcriptional landscape of the KSHV genome and identified transcriptional control mechanisms at play during KSHV lytic reactivation."

Women of reproductive age and pregnant women are at a high risk of anemia, which in turn may contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality. We aimed to describe the prevalence of anemia and the factors associated with the risk of developing anemia in women of reproductive age in Nepal. Additionally, we examined the association of women's decision-making autonomy regarding healthcare and experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) with anemia. Data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) were used in this study. The data were adjusted for sampling weight, stratification, and cluster sampling design. A battery-operated portable HemoCue was used to measure hemoglobin and detect anemia. Using complex sample logistic regression, the association between dependent and independent variables were examined; crude and adjusted odds ratio were reported. The mean (± SD) hemoglobin concentration was 12.13 g/dL (± 1.48). Overall, about 41% (95% CI 38.6-43.0%) of women aged 15-49 years were anemic. Women in households with wells as the source of drinking water (aOR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58-2.37) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing anemia. While women who were currently using hormonal contraceptives (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.76) were significantly less likely to be anemic. After adjusting for background characteristics among women who were married at the time of the survey, decision-making autonomy regarding healthcare, and experience of IPV did not have a significant association with anemia. The high prevalence of anemia suggests the need for substantial improvement in the nutritional status of women.

The present research addresses this issue by incorporating a new axiological path in a novel predictive model of collective action, named AICAM. The axiological path is formed by two constructs: ideology and moral obligation. The model has been tested for real normative participation (Study 1) and intentional non-normative participation (Study 2). The sample for Study 1 included 531 randomly selected demonstrators and non-demonstrators at the time of a protest that took place in Madrid, May 2017. Study 2 comprised 607 randomly selected participants who filled out an online questionnaire. Structural equation modelling analysis was performed in order to examine the fit and predictive power of the model. Results show that the model is a good fit in both studies. It has also been observed that the new model entails a significant addition of overall effect size when compared with alternative models, including SIMCA. The present research contributes to the literature of collective action by unearthing a new, independent path towards collective action that is nonetheless compatible with previous motives. Implications for future research are discussed, mainly stressing the need to include moral and ideological motives in the study of collective action engagement.","The contingent use of cell-free fetal DNA for prenatal screening of trisomies 21, 18, 13 in pregnant women within a national health service: A budget impact analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188879,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) is highly accurate in the detection of common fetal autosomal trisomies.

In humans, mutations in TCF12 lead to craniosynostosis, a congenital birth disorder characterized by the premature fusion of one or several of the cranial sutures. Current research has been primarily focused on functional studies of TCF12, hence the cellular expression profile of this gene during embryonic development and early stages of ossification remains poorly understood. Here we present the establishment and detailed analysis of two transgenic tcf12:EGFP fluorescent zebrafish (Danio rerio) reporter lines. Using these transgenic lines, we analyzed the general spatiotemporal expression pattern of tcf12 during different developmental stages and put emphasis on skeletal development and cranial suture patterning. We identified robust tcf12 promoter-driven EGFP expression in the central nervous system (CNS), the heart, the pronephros, and the somites of zebrafish embryos. Additionally, expression was observed inside the muscles and bones of the viscerocranium in juvenile and adult fish. During cranial vault development, the transgenic fish show a high amount of tcf12 expressing cells at the growth fronts of the ossifying frontal and parietal bones and inside the emerging cranial sutures. Subsequently, we tested the transcriptional activity of three evolutionary conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) located in the tcf12 locus by transient transgenic assays and compared their in vivo activity to the expression pattern determined in the transgenic tcf12:EGFP lines. We could validate two of them as tcf12 enhancer elements driving specific gene expression in the CNS during embryogenesis. Our newly established transgenic lines enhance the understanding of tcf12 gene regulation and open up the possibilities for further functional investigation of these novel tcf12 enhancer elements in zebrafish.","Visceral fat, but not subcutaneous fat, is associated with lower core temperature during laparoscopic surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188877,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Previous studies suggest that lower BMI is a risk factor for intraoperative core hypothermia.

Diseases have been implicated in population declines over large geographic areas, with severe disease outbreaks leading to either local or complete extinctions of wild populations. Ophidiomycosis, commonly known as snake fungal disease, is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, which has been documented in snake populations across the eastern and southern United States. We collected swab samples from the federally threatened Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi) in populations across the species' Georgia range. We used quantitative PCR to determine the presence of O. ophiodiicola DNA and also recorded skin abnormalities characteristic of ophidiomycosis. From 1 September 2016 to 4 August 2018, Eastern Indigo Snakes tested positive for O. ophiodiicola DNA on 47 of 107 occasions (43.9%) and tested negative for fungal DNA but had skin lesions consistent with ophidiomycosis on 42 occasions (39.3%). Symptomatic and qPCR positive individuals were more likely to be encountered during January and February when compared to November and December. We found no effect of sex (p = 0.517), age-class (p = 0.106), or body size (snout-vent length: p = 0.083; mass: p = 0.206; body condition: p = 0.063) on ophidiomycosis status. Over the two-year study, we encountered individuals in which infection was clearly negatively impacting overall health and also documented individuals in which infection apparently cleared from one year to the next. These results demonstrate that O. ophiodiicola and lesions characteristic of ophidiomycosis are widespread in Georgia's Eastern Indigo Snake populations. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding this disease, including the effects of disease on populations and individuals, the presence of infection vectors, and the change in prevalence over time. More research is needed to address ophidiomycosis and understand its impacts on ongoing conservation efforts.",Do cancer risk and benefit-harm ratios influence women's consideration of risk-reducing mastectomy?

We predicted that increased tree canopy cover and a subsequent decrease in meadows and flowering plants would limit bees but not flies at higher elevations. We tested and supported this prediction by examining changes in both abundance and species richness for 128 bee species and 96 fly species at key points along an elevational gradient in Northern Arizona represented by distinct vegetation life zones. In addition to an increase in fly species and abundance relative to bees with increasing elevation, there were changes in community structure). To better understand factors that might influence this transition we examined how tree canopy cover changed along the elevational gradient and how this influenced the change in insect pollinator communities. While bee communities were progressively divergent between forest and meadow habitats with increasing elevation and tree canopy cover, there was no significant pattern with flies between meadow and forest habitats. However, fly abundance did increase with increasing elevation relative to bees. Along a comparable elevational gradient on an adjacent mountain with no tree canopy cover (i.e., a fire burned mountain), the bee-to-fly transition did not occur; bees persisted as the dominant pollinator into the highest life zone. This suggests that tree canopy cover can in part explain the transition from bee-to fly-dominated communities. In conclusion, this is the first study in North America to document a bee-fly transition for both abundance and species richness and show that tree canopy cover may play a role in determining pollinator community composition, by restricting bees to open meadow habitats.","""Age matters""-German claims data indicate disparities in lung cancer care between elderly and young patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188861,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Although lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in elderly patients, evidence about tumor-directed therapy in elderly patients is sparse, and it is unclear to what extent this affects treatment and care.

Devices that assist in the MTC could reduce such risks. However, the development of effective assistive methods and their evaluation in the elderly might jeopardize their safety. To address this, young adults could take the place of the elderly. We present Muscle Activity Restriction Taping Technique (MARTT) that was devised to simulate the healthy-elderly gait characteristics in the young adults, particularly the lower MTC, by restricting the activity of lower-limb muscles. Two different restriction approaches, one that restricts muscles at the shank and the other at the shank and thigh, simultaneously, were tested at different walking speeds. Both approaches achieved a reduction in the MTC, regardless of the walking speed. The MTC was reduced to a median value lower than 10.1 mm, which is within the range of the MTC values reported for the elderly. The reduction of the MTC significantly increased toe contact to the ground. With the restriction of the shank muscles, the toe-contact frequency was more than twice as that in normal walking, and with the restriction of both the shank and thigh muscles, more than five times. In addition, MARTT reproduced the lower step length, the lower single support phase, and the joint motion compensation characteristic of the elderly gait, in the youth.",Thumb and finger movement is reduced after stroke: An observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188859,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Hand motor impairment is common after stroke but there are few comprehensive data on amount of hand movement. This study aimed to compare the amount of thumb and finger movement over an extended period of time in people with stroke and able-bodied people. Fifteen stroke subjects and 15 able-bodied control subjects participated. Stroke subjects had impaired hand function. Movement of the thumb and index finger was recorded using stretch sensors worn on the affected hand (stroke subjects) or the left or right hand (control subjects) for ∼4 hours during the day. A digit movement was defined as a monotonic increase or decrease in consecutive sensor values. Instantaneous digit position was expressed as a percentage of maximal digit flexion. Mixed linear models were used to compare the following outcomes between groups: (1) average amplitude of digit movement, (2) digit cadence and average digit velocity, (3) percentage of digit idle time and longest idle time. Amplitude of digit movement was not different between groups. Cadence at the thumb (between-group mean difference, 95% CI, p value: -0.6 movements/sec, -1.0 to -0.2 movements/sec, p = 0.003) and finger (-0.5 movements/sec, -0.7 to -0.3 movements/sec, p<0.001) was lower in stroke than control subjects. Digit velocity was not different between groups. Thumb idle time was not different between groups, but finger idle time was greater in stroke than control subjects (percentage of idle time: 6%, 1 to 11%, p = 0.02; longest idle time: 375 sec, 29 to 721 sec, p = 0.04). Rehabilitation after stroke should encourage the performance of functional tasks that involve movements at faster cadences, and encourage more frequent movement of the digits with shorter periods of inactivity.","Endemicity of Toxoplasma infection and its associated risk factors in Cebu, Philippines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188858,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled intracellular apicomplexan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. It is capable of infecting humans and nearly all warm-blooded animals including pigs, but cats are the only known definitive host. This ubiquitous zoonotic pathogen can cause abortion, stillbirth and fetal abnormalities, and has been associated with mental and behavioral changes in humans. Acute infection is potentially fatal in immunocompromised individuals. The present study aimed to assess the Toxoplasma seroprevalence in pigs, humans and cats after its initial reported detection in pigs about three decades ago in Cebu, Philippines. A total of 924 humans, 104 cats and 514 slaughter pigs were tested for antibodies against T. gondii using a commercial latex agglutination test. The results revealed positive detection rates of 26.3% (244/924) for humans, 42.3% (44/104) for cats and 13.4% (69/514) for slaughter pigs. Statistical analyses revealed that the area (P = 0.004), cat ownership (P = 0.020), the frequency of contact with cats (P < 0.0001) and consumption of street foods (P = 0.043) were significantly associated with seropositivity for T. gondii in humans. Meanwhile, the use of litter trays (P = 0.001) and contact with other animals (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with seropositivity in cats. The odds ratio for selected significant factors revealed that living in suburban areas (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.20-2.31), owning a cat (OR 1.482, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07) and eating street foods (OR 1.585, 95% CI: 1.01-2.48) were associated with an increased risk of T. gondii exposure in humans. In cats, the use of a litter tray (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 1.73-11.71) was associated with an increased risk of exposure. None of the profile parameters were found to be significantly associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs (P > 0.05). This study is the first report of the serological detection of T. gondii in humans and cats in Cebu, Philippines, and the first assessment of the prevalence of the parasite in pigs in the area since its initial detection in 1982. This is also the first report documenting the seropositivity of T. gondii in pregnant women in the country. The confirmed seropositivity of T. gondii in Cebu, Philippines, in the present study implies the endemicity of toxoplasmosis in this area and highlights the need for routine testing and increased public awareness.",Disorders of Bulldogs under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2013.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188857,PloS one,2019 06 12,"The Bulldog is a popular companion breed in the UK despite widely reported disease predispositions. This study aimed to characterise the demography, mortality and common disorders of Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK during 2013.

Many of the sites are distributed along a palaeoshoreline which is now 2-3 m above present sea level. Others form clusters with some sites on the shoreline and others located inland over distances of c. 30 m to 1 km. We refer to these inland sites as 'post-shore' sites. Following Meehan, who observed a similar spatial separation in shell deposition in her ethnographic study of Anbarra shellgathering in the Northern Territory of Australia, we hypothesise that the shoreline sites are specialised sites for the processing or immediate consumption of shell food, and the post-shore sites are habitation sites used for a variety of activities. We test this proposition through a systematic analysis of 55 radiocarbon dates and measurement of shell quantities from the excavation of 15 shell matrix sites in a variety of locations including shoreline and post-shore sites. Our results demonstrate large differences in rates of shell accumulation between these two types of sites and selective removal of shoreline sites by changes in sea level. We also discuss the wider implications for understanding the differential preservation and visibility of shell-matrix deposits in coastal settings in other parts of the world extending back into the later Pleistocene in association with periods of lowersea level. Our results highlight the importance of taphonomic factors of post-depositional degradation and destruction, rates of shell accumulation, the influence on site location of factors other than shell food supply, and the relative distance of deposits from their nearest palaeoshorelines as key variables in the interpretation of shell quantities. Failure to take these variables into account when investigating shells and shell-matrix deposits in late Pleistocene and early Holocene contexts is likely to compromise interpretations of the role and significance of shell food in human evolutionary and socio-cultural development.",A qualitative systematic review of experiences and perceptions of youth suicide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188855,PloS one,2019 06 12,"Suicide remains a global issue with over 800,000 people dying from suicide every year.

V. cholerae can switch between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Biofilm formation is determinant for transmission, virulence and antibiotic resistance. Due to the enhanced antibiotic resistance observed by bacterial pathogens, antimicrobial nanomaterials have been used to combat infections by stopping bacterial growth and preventing biofilm formation. In this study, the effect of the nanocomposites zeolite-embedded silver (Ag), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) nanoparticles (NPs) was evaluated in V. cholerae planktonic cells, and in two biofilm states: pellicle biofilm (PB), formed between air-liquid interphase, and surface-attached biofilm (SB), formed at solid-liquid interfaces. Each nanocomposite type had a distinctive antimicrobial effect altering each V. cholerae lifestyles differently. The ZEO-AgNPs nanocomposite inhibited PB formation at 4 μg/ml, and prevented SB formation and eliminated planktonic cells at 8 μg/ml. In contrast, the nanocomposites ZEO-CuNPs and ZEO-ZnNPs affect V. cholerae viability but did not completely avoid bacterial growth. At transcriptional level, depending on the nanoparticles and biofilm type, nanocomposites modified the relative expression of the vpsL, rbmA and bap1, genes involved in biofilm formation. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the outer membrane proteins OmpT, OmpU, OmpA and OmpW also differs among treatments in PB and SB.

RNA switches include bacterial riboswitches, where ligand binding can stabilize a bound structure. For RNAs with only one stable structure, structural prediction usually just requires a straightforward free energy minimization, but for an RNA switch, the prediction of a less stable alternative structure is often computationally costly and even problematic. The current sampling-clustering method predicts stable and alternative structures by partitioning structures sampled from the energy landscape into two clusters, but it is very time-consuming. Instead, we predict the alternative structure of an RNA switch from conditional probability calculations within the energy landscape. First, our method excludes base pairs related to the most stable structure in the energy landscape. Then, it detects stable stems (""seeds"") in the remaining landscape. Finally, it folds an alternative structure prediction around a seed. While having comparable riboswitch classification performance, the conditional-probability computations had fewer adjustable parameters, offered greater predictive flexibility, and were more than one thousand times faster than the sampling step alone in sampling-clustering predictions, the competing standard. Overall, the described approach helps traverse thermodynamically improbable energy landscapes to find biologically significant substructures and structures rapidly and effectively."

Treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) seems to be a promising solution, however the results from clinical studies are still equivocal. Better selection of candidate patients and improving monitoring of patients following MSC administration can increase treatment effectiveness. In order to determine which characteristics can be used to predict a good response and better monitoring of patients, blood samples were taken prior to therapy, one week and one month after therapy, from 26 allogeneic HSCT patients whom contracted GvHD and were treated with MSCs. Samples were examined for differential blood counts, bilirubin levels and cell surface markers. Serum cytokine levels were also measured. We found that the level of lymphocytes, in particular T and NK cells, may predict a good response to therapy. A better response was observed among patients who expressed low levels of IL-6 and IL-22, Th17 related cytokines, prior to therapy. Patients with high levels of bilirubin prior to therapy showed a poorer response. The results of this study may facilitate early prediction of success or failure of the treatment, and subsequently, will improve selection of patients for MSC therapy.",How does vertical integration promote innovation corporate social responsibility (ICSR) in the coal industry?

Despite the importance of floral diversity for proper bee nutrition, urban development has drastically altered resource availability and diversity for these important pollinators. Therefore, understanding the floral resources foraged by bees in urbanized areas is key to identifying and promoting plants that enhance colony health in those environments. In this study, we identified the pollen foraged by bees in four developed areas of the U.S., and explored whether there were spatial or temporal differences in the types of floral sources of pollen used by honey bees in these landscapes. To do this, pollen was collected every month for up to one year from colonies located in developed (urban and suburban) sites in California, Texas, Florida, and Michigan, except during months of pollen dearth or winter. Homogenized pollen samples were acetolyzed and identified microscopically to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Once identified, each pollen type was classified into a frequency category based on its overall relative abundance. Species richness and diversity indices were also calculated and compared across states and seasons. We identified up to 64 pollen types belonging to 39 plant families in one season (California). Species richness was highest in CA and lowest in TX, and was highest during spring in every state. In particular, ""predominant"" and ""secondary"" pollen types belonged to the families Arecaceae, Sapindaceae, Anacardiaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Fagaceae, Lythraceae, Myrtaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, Saliaceae, and Ulmaceae.

Sustainable ocean development requires knowledge and data across disciplines, scales and knowledge types. Although several disciplines are generating large amounts of data on marine socio-ecological systems, such information is often underutilized due to fragmentation across institutions or stakeholders, limited standardization across scale, time or disciplines, and the fact that information is often not searchable within existing databases. Compiling metadata, the information which describes existing sets of data, is an effective tool that can address these challenges, particularly when metadata corresponding to multiple datasets can be combined to integrate, organize and classify multidisciplinary data. Here, using Mexico as a case study, we describe the compilation and analysis of a metadatabase of ocean knowledge that aims to improve access to information, facilitate multidisciplinary data sharing and integration, and foster collaboration among stakeholders. We also evaluate the knowledge trends and gaps for informing ocean management. Analysis of the metadatabase highlights that past and current research in Mexico focuses strongly on ecology and fisheries, with biological data more consistent over time and space compared to data on human dimensions. Regional imbalances in available information were also evident, with most available information corresponding to the Gulf of California, Campeche Bank and Caribbean and less available for the central and south Pacific and the western Gulf of Mexico. Despite existing knowledge gaps in Mexico and elsewhere, we argue that systematic efforts such as this can often reveal an abundance of information for decision-makers to develop policies that meet key commitments on ocean sustainability. Surmounting current cross-scale social and ecological challenges for sustainability requires transdisciplinary approaches.

We investigated if young rats can learn to associate the presence of an odour with the experience of being tickled (i.e. using an experimenter's hand to mimic rough-and-tumble play), shown to elicit 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), which are indicative of positive affect. Male, pair-housed Wistar rats (N = 24) were all exposed to two neutral odours (A and B) presented in a perforated container on alternate days in a test arena. Following 60s of exposure, the rats were either tickled on days when odour A (n = 8) or odour B (n = 8) was present, or never tickled (n = 8). When tickled, rats produced significantly more 50 kHz USVs compared to the days when not being tickled, and compared to control rats. The level of anticipatory 50 kHz USVs in the 60s prior to tickling did not differ significantly between the tickled and control rats. As a retrieval test following the odour conditioning, rats were exposed successively in the same arena to three odours: an unknown neutral odour, extract of fox faeces, and either odours A or B. Compared to controls, 50 kHz USVs of tickled rats increased when exposed to the odour they had previously experienced when tickled, indicating that these rats had learned to associate the odour with the positive experience of being tickled. In a test with free access for 5 min to both arms of a T-maze, each containing one of the odours, rats tickled with odour A spent more time in the arm with this odour. This work is the first to test in a fully balanced design whether rats can learn to associate an odour with tickling, and indicates that positive odour conditioning has potential to be used as an alternative to negative conditioning tests."

MCL relies upon B-cell receptor signaling through Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK); therefore, the development of the BTK inhibitors ibrutinib and acalabrutinib represents a therapeutic breakthrough. In this review, we provide a summary of the efficacy and safety data from the landmark trials of single-agent ibrutinib and acalabrutinib that led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of these agents for patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Toxicities of interest observed with ibrutinib include bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and increased risk for infection. The selectivity of acalabrutinib for BTK is greater than that of ibrutinib, which mitigates the risk for certain off-target toxicities, including atrial fibrillation; however, these toxicities, along with frequent headaches, still occur. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating both alternate BTK inhibitors and BTK inhibitors in combination with chemo-immunotherapy or other targeted agents in an effort to enhance the depth and duration of response. Trials to evaluate the use of these agents in the frontline setting are emerging and are likely to build upon the success of BTK inhibitors in patients with MCL.",The evolving understanding of prognosis in post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis and post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis vs primary myelofibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188809,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,2019 06 12,"Myelofibrosis (MF) is the most aggressive of the classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In some patients with essential thrombocytopenia or polycythemia vera, which are relatively benign MPNs, MF develops as a natural evolution of their disease, resulting in post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF) or post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF). Presenting with the same clinical features, including debilitating symptoms and signs of bone marrow failure, PET/PPV-MF has traditionally been considered akin to primary myelofibrosis (PMF). However, recent observations that PET/PPV-MF may be a distinct clinical entity from PMF have triggered efforts to improve prognostication in these diseases. Novel predictive models that incorporate rapidly emerging clinical and molecular data are being developed to improve outcomes in patients with PMF or PET/PPV-MF.

Following adequate surgical resection of lymph node-positive colon cancer, the standard of care since 2004 has been to administer an oxaliplatin-containing regimen (eg, FOLFOX or CAPOX) for 6 months. These regimens have consistently improved oncologic outcomes compared with non-oxaliplatin therapies in multiple adjuvant randomized controlled trials. However, oxaliplatin-induced cumulative dose-dependent neurotoxicity is a major cause of morbidity that can persist years after treatment. The IDEA collaboration is a study that pooled data from 6 concurrent phase 3 trials comparing 3 vs 6 months of adjuvant FOLFOX or CAPOX to evaluate whether a shorter duration of therapy could maintain efficacy while reducing neurotoxicity. In this article, we review the history of adjuvant therapy in stage III colon cancer and comprehensively detail the results of the IDEA collaboration. A risk-based approach focusing on efficacy, toxicity, and patient selection is emphasized to guide discussions regarding the optimal duration of adjuvant therapy in stage III colon cancer.",One-Year Results Evaluating the Effects of Concentrated Growth Factors on the Healing of Intrabony Defects Treated with or without Bone Substitute in Chronic Periodontitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188801,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 12,"BACKGROUND The restoration of damaged periodontium, especially one-wall intrabony defects, is a major challenge for clinicians. Concentrated growth factors (CGF) are a 100% autologous fibrin with multiple concentrated growth factors. The rigid fibrin structure of CGF makes it possible to preserve or reconstruct the initial bone volume. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical healing patterns after surgical application of CGF with and without a Bio-Oss graft in one-wall infrabony defects. MATERIAL AND METHODS We randomly divided 120 one-wall intrabony defects in 54 patients into 4 groups: flap surgery alone (Group 1), flap surgery with autologous CGF (Group 2), flap surgery with Bio-Oss (Group 3), and flap surgery with CGF+Bio-Oss (Group 4). Clinical parameters such as probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) change were recorded at baseline and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS At 12 months postoperatively, Group 2 showed significant improvement in clinical parameters over Group 1 (P<0.05) and the results were significantly greater in Groups 3 and 4 compared to the other groups (P<0.05). Although no significant difference was noted between Groups 3 and 4 in clinical parameters (P>0.05) compared to Group 3, the mean change of CAL at 6-12 months in Group 4 was not significant (P>0.05).

The treatment of bladder cancer has remained unchanged for the last several decades. However, in recent years the availability of comprehensive genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other large projects have considerably improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of these tumors. These studies demonstrated that bladder cancers can be grouped into 2 broad categories namely basal and luminal molecular subtypes with recognizable subgroups in each of these categories. Clinical data suggest that invasive basal cancers are more sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), such that most patients with basal cancers who are aggressively managed with NAC have excellent outcomes. Patients with luminal cancers do not appear to derive much clinical benefit from NAC, but some may appear to be sensitive to anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) antibodies and possibly other immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is hoped that future studies will also identify biomarkers such as immunohistochemical markers which may be used to predict therapeutic response of these tumors. This will contribute substantially toward efficient and cost-effective diagnosis and management of these neoplasms.","Using Trauma Triage Score to Risk Stratify Inpatient Triage, Hospital Quality Measures, and Cost in Middle-Aged and Geriatric Orthopaedic Trauma Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188798,Journal of orthopaedic trauma,2019 06 12,Investigate the efficacy of a novel geriatric trauma risk assessment tool (STTGMA) designed to predict inpatient mortality to risk stratify measures of hospital quality and cost of care in middle-aged and geriatric orthopaedic trauma patients.

The effects of hydroalcoholic extract of the plant seeds and metformin against the diabetes-induced memory impairment were investigated. Materials and methods The rats were treated: (1) control, (2) diabetic (3-6) and diabetic rats treated by 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of the plant extract or metformin. The rats were diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg). After the passive avoidance test, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, total thiol (SH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined in the brain. Results In the diabetic group, at 3, 24 and 48 h after receiving a shock, the latency to enter the dark room was lower than for the controls (p < 0.001). All doses of the extract and metformin increased the latencies to enter the dark at 3 and 24 h after the shock treatment (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Additionally, the two higher doses of the extract and metformin increased the latency at 48 h after the shock (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Diabetes also elevated MDA and NO metabolites, while it reduced thiol, SOD and CAT in the hippocampal and cortical tissues (p < 0.001). Treatment of the diabetic animals by the highest dose of the extract and also metformin reduced the MDA and NO metabolites, while it improved thiols, SOD and CAT (p < 0.01-p < 0.001). Conclusions Based on our findings, metformin and the hydro-alcoholic extract from the T. foenum-graceum seed prevented memory deficits resulting from diabetes. Preventing oxidative damage in the brain may at least, in part, be responsible for the positive effects of the extract and metformin.",Structural and Functional MRI Techniques in Multiple Sclerosis Related Cognitive Dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188776,Folia medica,2019 06 12,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is prevalent in young adults and therefore with significant social impact.

Methods In a case series study performed during the recent epidemic of lead poisoning in Iran, lead-poisoned patients referring to our outpatient clinic were treated with 250-mg D-penicillamine capsules administered every 6 h for 5 or 10 days based on availability of the medication. They were recommended to re-check blood lead level (BLL) 4 weeks after cessation of the treatment and refer to our clinic again. Results In 63 patients with lead poisoning but without signs and symptoms of lead encephalopathy, median BLL was 106 [84, 131] μg/dL on presentation, which declined to a mean of 52.6 ± 28.8 μg/dL after a median treatment period of 7 [5, 10] days (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 5- and 10-day treatment protocols regarding complications and recovery. Treatment had resulted in a median decrease of 54 μg/dL [33, 90] (range: -20 to 231 μg/dL) in the patients' BLLs (33.9% declined in BLL measurements; range: -29.69% to 99.06%). Conclusions D-penicillamine may be an acceptable substitute treatment in adult lead poisoning. Although our sample size was limited, we could not detect any serious adverse effects in our cases showing that D-penicillamine resulted in acceptable recovery rates. This may be helpful especially in epidemics with limitations in antidote access.","Exertional hematuria: definition, epidemiology, diagnostic and clinical considerations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188754,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 14,"Exertional hematuria can be considered a subcategory of exercise-induced hematuria, characterized by painless appearance of erythrocytes in urine after recent physical exercise, not directly attributable to external traumatic injuries to the genitourinary system, and spontaneously resolving with rest. Although its frequency has enormous heterogeneity, depending on the athlete population, duration and intensity of exercise, technique used for identifying or quantifying hematuria and relative diagnostic thresholds, what clearly emerges from the scientific literature is that a certain degree of hematuria is commonplace after non-contact sports, especially running. This exertional hematuria, which appears self-limiting, may be attributable to some frequently concomitant causes, involving organs of the genitourinary system, and mostly encompassing bladder or urethral injuries. Renal injuries caused by internal movements, vascular spasm and ischemia are also potential causes of increased glomerular permeability to erythrocytes, whilst the presence of preexisting genitourinary diseases cannot be ruled out, especially when post-exercise hematuria is recurrent or endures. Therefore, whenever hematuria is observed in a random urine specimen, recent sports performance (especially running) should be investigated and urinalyses scheduled for the following days. When no temporal association of hematuria with exercise can be found, when genitourinary traumas have been excluded or hematuria persists for >72 h, specific diagnostic investigations should be planned to identify possible genitourinary diseases.",Variable and inaccurate serum IgG4 levels resulting from lack of standardization in IgG subclass assay calibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188751,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 14,"Background The quantification of serum IgG4 is commonly performed during the diagnostic workup of IgG4-related diseases (IgG4-RD).

In addition, we assessed the accuracy of both assays using purified polyclonal and monoclonal IgG4 preparations. Results Our data show significant discrepancies between the two IgG subclass assays for the measurement of IgG4 and, to a lesser extent, IgG3. Conclusions The lack of standardization between the two main providers of commercially available IgG4 assays leads to significant inter-assay result discrepancies, which might potentially cause unnecessary clinical workup. We conclude that serum IgG4 assay-specific decision limits, and not an assay-independent single cut-off level for IgG4 (e.g. 1.35 g/L), should be used when assessing patients for IgG4-RD. An internationally recognized, certified reference material for IgG subclasses is urgently needed, and assay manufactures are encouraged to undertake steps toward standardization of measurements of IgG4 and other IgG subclasses.","Performance evaluation of an Indoxyl Sulfate Assay Kit ""NIPRO"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188750,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 14,"Background The relationship between renal disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently known as cardiorenal syndrome. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is one of the uremic toxins that accelerates the progression of cardiorenal syndrome. This report presents a new method for measuring IS in a simpler way. Methods We evaluated the analytical performance of an IS Assay Kit ""NIPRO"" loaded on LABOSPECT 008. The evaluated analytical performances included accuracy, precision, dilution linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), recovery test, interference test and comparison against assays performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Total precision showed a <5.3% coefficient of variation at IS concentrations of 3.57-277.73 μmol/L, and satisfactory results were observed in the dilution linearity, LOD, LOQ, recovery and interference tests. The IS Assay Kit ""NIPRO"" showed a high correlation with the HPLC conventional method (r = 0.993). Conclusions The IS Assay Kit ""NIPRO"" demonstrated satisfactory analytical performance, and this suggests it could shortly become another common method to measure circulating IS.",CYP24A1 and SLC34A1 genetic defects associated with idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia: from genotype to phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188746,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 14,"Loss of function mutations in the CYP24A1 gene, involved in vitamin D catabolism and in calcium homeostasis, are known to be the genetic drivers of both idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH) and adult renal stone disease. Recently, also defects in the SLC34A1 gene, encoding for the renal sodium-phosphate transporter NaPi-IIa, were associated with the disease. IIH typically affects infants and pediatric patients with a syndrome characterized by severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, suppressed parathyroid hormone level and nephrolithiasis. In SLC34A1 mutated carriers, hypophosphatemia is also a typical biochemical tract. IIH may also persist undiagnosed into adulthood, causing an increased risk of nephrocalcinosis and renal complication. To note, a clinical heterogeneity characterizes IIH manifestation, principally due to the controversial gene-dose effect and, to the strong influence of environmental factors. The present review is aimed to provide an overview of the current molecular findings on the IIH disorder, giving a comprehensive description of the association between genotype and biochemical and clinical phenotype of the affected patients. We also underline that patients may benefit from genetic testing into a targeted diagnostic and therapeutic workflow.",Reference interval by the indirect approach of serum thyrotropin (TSH) in a Mediterranean adult population and the association with age and gender.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188745,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,2019 06 14,"Background The serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH) represents a first-line test in diagnostic algorithms. The estimation of TSH reference intervals (RIs) is still a matter of debate due to the high prevalence of subclinical disease making difficult the definition of truly healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to estimate TSH RIs in healthy subjects and to evaluate the effect of age and gender on TSH concentration. Methods Forty-four thousand one hundred and fifty-six TSH data were collected between July 2012 and April 2018 at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, University-Hospital, Palermo. Common and sex-specific RIs were estimated by Arzideh's indirect method after exclusion of individuals younger than 15 years, subjects with repeated TSH tests and with abnormal free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3) or anti-thyroid-peroxidase antibodies. The combined effect of age and gender on TSH values was evaluated. Results RIs estimated in the selected individuals (n = 22602) were, respectively, 0.18-3.54 mIU/L (general), 0.19-3.23 mIU/L (men) and 0.18-3.94 mIU/L (women). Women showed significantly higher median TSH than men (1.46 vs. 1.39 mIU/L; p < 0.0001). Both in men and in women, median TSH decreased along with age; however, although up to 60 years in both men and women showed similar values, afterwards women showed constantly higher TSH than men. Accordingly, statistical analysis showed a significant interaction between gender and age (p = 0.001), suggesting that the effect of age on TSH is different between genders. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the indirect method, with appropriate cleaning of data, could be useful to define TSH RIs.",Only serum pepsinogen I and pepsinogen I/II ratio are specific and sensitive biomarkers for screening of gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188744,Biomolecular concepts,2019 06 12,"Purpose We aimed to determine optimal cut-off points of plasma levels of ghrelin and serum levels of pepsinogen I, II, and their ratio for screening of gastric cancer (GC). Methods Blood samples were taken from 41 patients with confirmed gastric cancer along with 82 patients without malignancy. Serum levels of pepsinogen I and II, plus plasma levels of acylated ghrelin were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Results The case group had significant lower plasma levels of ghrelin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen I/II ratio in comparison to the control group (P<0.001). In the control group, there was significant higher serum pepsinogen I (P=0.028) and pepsinogen II (P=0.003) and lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.020) in males versus females; significantly higher serum pepsinogen II (P=0.047) and lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.030) in overweight compared to normal weight patients; and significantly lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.030) in smokers versus non-smoker. In the case group, there was only significantly lower pepsinogen I (P=0.006) in males versus females, and significantly lower plasma ghrelin (P=0.017) in overweight compared to normal weight patients. The characteristic curve analysis indicated that pepsinogen I at a cut-off of 70.95 μg/L and pepsinogen I/II ratio at cut-off of 2.99, had good sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions Just serums levels of pepsinogen I and the ratio of pepsinogen I/II can be used as biomarker to screen GC."

The focus of this study was on the emotional responses evoked by such framing and their relationship to perceived effectiveness, as mechanisms that may underpin how health messages impact health decisions. Methods: A web-based study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform was conducted with a sample of 132 younger adults and 106 older adults. Participants were asked to read exercise-related messages framed in terms of gains or losses, and to rate each message for affect and effectiveness. Results: Relative to younger adults, older adults showed less negative reactions to loss-framed messages and to messages that described undesirable outcomes. Importantly, younger and older adults differentially used affective cues to gauge effectiveness of framed messages: for gain-framed messages (which tended to evoke positive affect), older adults found messages that made them feel good to be more effective; but for loss-framed messages (which tend to evoke negative affect), younger adults found messages that made them feel bad to be more effective. Conclusions: These results suggest that in processing health messages, older adults may be more motivated by positive affect, while younger adults may be more motivated by negative affect.",Comparing the effects of three cognitive tasks on indicators of mental fatigue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188721,The Journal of psychology,2019 06 12,"This investigation assessed the impact of three cognitively demanding tasks on cognitive performance, subjective, and physiological indicators of mental fatigue. Following familiarization, participants completed four testing sessions, separated by 48 h. During each session, participants watched a 45-min emotionally neutral documentary (control) or completed one of the following computer tasks: Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT); AX-Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT); or Stroop Task. Mental fatigue was assessed before and at regular periods for 60 min following the 45-min treatments. Cognitive performance was assessed using 3-min PVT, and task performance. Subjective assessments were conducted using the Brunel Mood Scale, and visual analog scales (VAS). Physiological indicators of mental fatigue included electroencephalography (EEG), and heart rate variability (HRV). Subjective ratings of mental fatigue increased from pre to 0-min post in all-treatments, but not the documentary (p < 0.05). Subjective fatigue (VAS) remained higher (p < 0.05) than pretreatment values for 20-, 50-, and 60-min following the PVT, Stroop, and AX-CPT respectively. The cognitively demanding tasks had unclear effects on 3-min PVT, EEG, and HRV assessments. Tasks requiring response inhibition appear to induce fatigue for longer durations than a simple vigilance task. Simple VAS appear to be the most practical method for assessing mental fatigue.",Exploring Lesbian and Bisexual Catholic Women's Narratives of Religious and Sexual Identity Formation and Integration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188720,Journal of homosexuality,2019 06 12,"Many LGBT people with a Christian upbringing experience conflict between their religious and sexual identities. Many resolve this conflict by leaving Christianity, others by moving to affirming churches. Some research has examined the experiences of LGBT people who choose to attend conservative churches; however, there has been very little research on the experiences of non-heterosexual women in the Catholic Church. Narrative and thematic analyses of data collected through qualitative interviews with six non-heterosexual Catholic women revealed several ways participants had integrated their faith and sexuality: acceptance from other Catholics, distinguishing between the Church and God, meeting other LGBT Christians, and developing a personal relationship with God. These reflect strategies adopted by gay Catholic men and LGBT Christians attending Protestant churches. Nonetheless, participants reported that their experiences varied from those of gay Catholic men due to gay men being more visible and more subject to prejudice within the Church."

It is a multi-step process involving de novo formation of double membrane autophagosomes that capture cytosolic constituents (cargo) and eventually fuse with lysosomes wherein the cargo gets degraded and resulting simpler biomolecules get recycled. In addition to their autophagy function, several of the autophagy related proteins work at the interface of other vesicular trafficking pathways. Hence, development of specific autophagy modulators that do not perturb general endo-lysosomal traffic possesses unique challenges. In this paper, we report a novel small molecule EACC which inhibits autophagic flux by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Strikingly, unlike other late stage inhibitors, EACC does not have any effect on lysosomal properties or on endocytosis mediated degradation of EGF receptor. EACC affects the translocation of SNAREs Stx17 and SNAP29 on autophagosomes without impeding the completion of autophagosomes. EACC treatment also reduces the interaction of Stx17 with the HOPS subunit VPS33A and the cognate lysosomal R-SNARE VAMP8. Interestingly, this effect of EACC although quite robust is reversible and hence EACC can be used as a tool to study autophagosomal SNARE trafficking. Our results put forward a novel method to block autophagic flux by impeding the action of the autophagosomal SNAREs.",The adhesion modulation domain of C. elegans α-catenin regulates actin binding during morphogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188702,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 06 12,"Maintaining tissue integrity during epidermal morphogenesis depends on α-catenin, which connects the cadherin complex to F-actin. We show that the adhesion modulation domain (AMD) of C. elegans HMP-1/α-catenin regulates its F-actin binding activity and organization of junctional proximal actin in vivo. Deleting the AMD increases F-actin binding in vitro and leads to excess actin recruitment to adherens junctions in vivo. Reducing actin binding through a compensatory mutation in the C terminus leads to improved function. Based on the effects of phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutations phosphorylation of S509, within the AMD, may regulate F-actin binding. Taken together, these data establish a novel role for the AMD in regulating the actin binding ability of an α-catenin and its proper function during epithelial morphogenesis.",Effects of Weighted Vest Loading during Daily Living Activities on Countermovement Jump and Sprint Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188701,International journal of sports physiology and performance,2019 06 12,"Wearing a weighted vest (WV) during daily living and training can enhance jump and sprint performance, however, studies examining the efficacy of this method in female populations is limited.

Smoking initiation among people with MI is poorly understood. However, the sensations experienced during smoking initiation predict continued smoking and nicotine dependence. Yet, few studies have examined the initial experiences of smoking among people with MI. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore factors associated with the initial sensations of smoking in people with MI. Smokers in an inpatient psychiatric facility (n = 123) were surveyed. Data obtained included information on demographics, smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, psychiatric diagnoses, and sensations of initial smoking. Spearman correlations explored associations among initial smoking sensation variables; and binary logistic regression analyses examined the associations between study variables and groupings derived from initial sensations (i.e., ""pleasant + buzz,"" ""unpleasant + buzz,"" and ""all"" sensations). The most frequently reported initial smoking sensation was feeling dizzy (87%) and there were low to moderate correlations between unpleasant (e.g., cough, sick, nervous) and pleasant (e.g., good, relaxed) sensations. In logistic regression analyses, having higher perceived SHS exposure was significantly associated with the ""pleasant + buzz"" sensation grouping; and lower past week SHS exposure was associated with the ""unpleasant + buzz"" sensation grouping; but, no variables were associated with ""all"" sensation group. Initial smoking sensations are an uncharted avenue of exploration in understanding smoking initiation among people with MI. SHS exposure may be an important factor associated with the report of both unpleasant and pleasant initial sensations. Future studies are needed to further explore initial sensations in relation to the context of smoking initiation among people with MI.",Effects of Ginkgo leaf tablets on the pharmacokinetics of atovastatin in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188698,Pharmaceutical biology,2019 06 12,"Context: Ginkgo leaf tablets (GLT), an effective traditional Chinese multi-herbal formula, are often combined with atorvastatin calcium (AC) for treating coronary heart disease in clinic. Objective: This study investigated the effects of GLT on the pharmacokinetics of AC and the potential mechanism. Materials and methods: The pharmacokinetics of AC (oral administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg) with or without pre-treatment of GLT (oral administered at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 10 days) were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of GLT on the metabolic stability of AC were also investigated using rat liver microsome incubation systems. Results: The results indicated that the Cmax increased from 36.84 ± 4.21 to 48.68 ± 6.35 ng/mL, and the AUC(0-t) increased from 135.82 ± 21.05 to 77.28 ± 12.92 ng h/mL, and t1/2 also increased from 2.62 ± 0.31 to 3.32 ± 0.57 h when GLT and AC were co-administered. The metabolic stability of AC was also increased (48.2 ± 6.7 vs. 36.7 ± 5.3 min) with the pre-treatment of GLT. Discussion: This study indicated that the main components in GLT could accelerate the metabolism of AC in rat liver microsomes and change the pharmacokinetic behaviours of AC. So these results showed that the herb-drug interaction between GLT and AC might occur, and the clinical efficacy could increase when they were co-administered. Therefore, the clinical dose of AC should be decreased when GLT and AC are co-administered.",Identifying Athlete Body-Fluid Changes During a Competitive Season With Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188697,International journal of sports physiology and performance,2019 06 12,To analyze the association between body-fluid changes evaluated by bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) and dilution techniques over a competitive season in athletes.

However, most of them only evaluate offline social skills and consider them as equivalents to online social skills. So far, no instrument allowed differentiating social skills depending on online versus offline contexts. This study aimed to develop and validate the Real and Electronic Communication Skills questionnaire (RECS), a new measure evaluating several dimensions of social skills in two different contexts (i.e., face-to-face and computer-mediated communication). Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses among a sample of 657 adolescents and young adults (mean age = 17.68 years; 67% female) showed that the best fitting model for each context is a bifactor solution, with one general factor (Social Competence) and four specific factors (Sociability, Emotion Decoding, Disclosure, and Assertiveness). Each specific factor was differentially correlated with theoretically relevant subscales of the Social Skills Inventory, confirming the external validity of the RECS. The RECS is the first instrument allowing not only to assess social competence in online settings but also to quantify the relationships between offline social skills and their online counterpart. Given its ease of use and brevity, the RECS is a useful and promising instrument to capture social skills in both online and offline contexts.","Can Hyperoxic Preconditioning in Normobaric Hypoxia (3500m) Improve All-Out Exercise Performance in Highly Skilled Skiers?

The positive predictive value of a ratio of >38 for ruling in preeclampsia within 4 weeks was 30.3% (95% CI, 23.0%-38.5%), with 62.0% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity. An sFlt-1/PlGF ratio of ≤38 had a negative predictive value of 98.9% (95% CI, 97.6%-99.6%) for ruling out fetal adverse outcomes within 1 week and a ratio of >38 had a positive predictive value of 53.5% (95% CI, 45.0%-61.8%) for ruling in fetal adverse outcomes within 4 weeks. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio cutoff of 38 demonstrated clinical value for the short-term prediction of preeclampsia in Asian women with suspected preeclampsia, potentially helping to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and intervention.",Sympathetic Transduction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188673,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 06 12,"Approximately 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) develop hypertension. Recent work also indicates greater blood pressure (BP) excursions throughout the day in T2D. Collectively, these findings suggest altered BP control in T2D. Although muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) recordings in T2D have provided equivocal results, quantification of MSNA alone does not account for ensuing vasoconstriction and BP responses elicited by MSNA. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that patients with T2D exhibit enhanced sympathetic transduction to BP. MSNA (microneurography) and beat-to-beat BP (Finometer) were measured at rest in 21 T2D and 13 age-matched and body mass index-matched control subjects and, signal-averaging was performed to quantify the mean arterial pressure and total vascular conductance responses to spontaneous bursts of MSNA. The peak mean arterial pressure and total vascular conductance responses to spontaneous MSNA were similar between T2D and control (both P>0.05). However, further analysis, separating T2D into those taking statins (n=13, T2D +statin) and not taking statins (n=8, T2D -statin), indicated that T2D -statin patients (4.2±0.6 mm Hg) exhibited greater peak mean arterial pressure responses compared with both T2D +statin patients (2.5±0.3 mm Hg, P=0.01) and control (control: 2.8±0.3 mm Hg, P=0.02). Likewise, nadir total vascular conductance responses to spontaneous MSNA bursts were greater in T2D -statin patients (T2D -statin: -3.3±0.6 mL/(min·mm Hg), T2D +statin: -1.6±0.3 mL/(min·mm Hg), P=0.03; control -2.2±0.3 mL/(min·mm Hg), P=0.08). Notably, T2D +statin patients exhibited similar peak mean arterial pressure and total vascular conductance responses to MSNA compared with control. Collectively, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that patients with T2D exhibit augmented sympathetic transduction and this effect seems to be offset by statin therapy.",Impact of a compassionate care leadership programme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188670,British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),2019 06 12,"Compassionate care delivery enhances patient satisfaction and quality of life and reduces nurse burnout.

The incidence and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) has increased. An NET remains a rare cancer requiring specialist care and the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) team is ideally placed to support these patients. Oncology clinics are becoming increasingly pressured and the need to think of innovative ways of reducing pressure while maintaining and enhancing the patient's experience is important. A new multidisciplinary team (MDT) systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) clinic for NET patients was developed that incorporated a CNS SACT non-medical prescriber (NMP) to improve patient experience and reduce the number of oncologist clinic reviews. Methods and analysis: the clinic was designed and a protocol developed to help ensure safe practice and support for the CNS NMP. The patient experience was prioritised and the medical team was involved in the design. All NMP SACT prescriptions were reviewed and questionnaires were given to patients after 3 months. A questionnaire was also given to all oncologists within the clinic and to the oncology pharmacist for analysis. Findings: 29 SACT NMP prescriptions for 15 patients were written. Patient and medical colleague feedback was positive. Discussion: this experience has helped to highlight the positive impact of innovative clinics that combine the expertise of both independent nurse practitioners and the medical team. This has paved the way for further clinics of this kind within the author's trust and the NET service."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 06 12,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance affecting over 30 million people in the US alone. Previous work has hypothesized that mitochondria are dysfunctional in T2D and results in both reduced ATP production and glucose disposal. However, a direct link between mitochondrial function and T2D has not been determined. In the current study, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of T2D was used to quantify mitochondrial function in vitro and in vivo over a broad range of contraction-induced metabolic workloads. During high frequency sciatic nerve stimulation hindlimb muscle contractions at 2 and 4 Hz intensities the GK rat failed to maintain similar bioenergetic steady-states to Wistar controls (WC) measured by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy despite similar force production. Differences were not due to changes in mitochondrial content in red (RG) or white gastrocnemius (WG) muscles (cytochrome c oxidase, RG: 22.2 ± 1.6 versus 23.3 ± 1.7 U/gWW, WG: 10.8 ± 1.1 versus 12.1 ± 0.9 U/gWW;GK versus WC, respectively). Mitochondria isolated from muscles of GK and WC rats also showed no difference in mitochondrial ATP production capacity in vitro measured by high-resolution respirometry. At lower intensities (0.25-1 Hz) there were no detectable differences between GK and WC rats in sustained energy balance. There were similar phosphocreatine concentrations during steady-state contraction and post-contractile recovery (t=72 ± 6 GK vs. 71 ± 2 s WC). Taken together these results suggest that deficiencies in skeletal muscle energetics seen at higher intensities are not due to mitochondrial dysfunction in the Goto-Kakizaki rat.",Skeletal muscle LINE-1 retrotransposon activity is upregulated in older versus younger rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188650,"American journal of physiology.

Herein, gastrocnemius muscle from male Fischer 344 rats that were 3, 12, and 24 months (mo) (n=9 per group) were analyzed for LINE-1 mRNA, DNA, promoter methylation and DNA accessibility. qPCR primers were designed for active (L1.3) and inactive (L1.Tot) LINE-1 elements as well as part of the ORF1 sequence. L1.3, L1.Tot and ORF1 mRNAs were higher (p<0.05) in 12/24 versus 3 mo rats. L1.3 DNA was higher in the 24 mo rats versus other groups, and ORF1 DNA was greater in 12/24 versus 3 mo rats. ORF1 protein was higher in 12/24 versus 3 mo rats. RNA-sequencing indicated mRNAs related to DNA methylation (TET1) and histone acetylation (HDAC2) were lower in 24 versus 3 mo rats. L1.3 DNA accessibility was higher in 24 versus 3 mo rats. No age-related differences in nuclear histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity existed, although nuclear DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity was lower in 12/24 versus 3 mo rats (p<0.05). In summary, markers of skeletal muscle LINE-1 activity increase across the age spectrum of rats, and this may be related to deficits in DNMT activity and/or increased LINE-1 DNA accessibility.",DL-3-n-butylphthalide protected retinal Müller cells dysfunction from oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188648,Current eye research,2019 06 12,"Purpose: To observe the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in retinal Müller cells. Methods: Cultured human Müller cell line (MIO-M1line) were exposed to H2O2 for 2 hours. Cell survival was evaluated by Calcein AM cell viability assay. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) + endoplasmic reticulum (ER) red fluorescent probe (ER-Tracker Red) staining was used to observe the expression level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ER of cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential detection (JC-1) was used to observe cell membrane potential change and early apoptosis. Cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst33258 staining. The expressions of Nrf2, HO-1 were documented by Western blot analysis. Results: NBP effectively improved the survival ability of Müller cells shown by MTT assay. NBP effectively alleviated the morphological and apoptotic changes induced by H2O2 stimulation by Calcein AM assay, HE staining, Hoechst 33258, JC-1 staining. H2O2 induction increased the expression level of ROS, whereas, the treatment with NBP could remarkably lower the expression level of ROS. Cell immunofluorescence staining indicated that the fluorescence staining intensity of HO-1 in the NBP group was significantly higher than that in the control group. While the western blotting results showed that the expression level of HO-1 could be increased by NBP in a time-dependent manner. The translocation of Nrf2 in nuclei was observed within 2 h and Nrf2 was identified in nuclei for up to 48h. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that NBP had a protective effect on H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in retinal Müller cells in vitro and that it was a potent activator of Nrf2 and HO-1signaling.",Changes in Skeletal Muscle Oxidative Capacity After a Trail Running Race.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188647,International journal of sports physiology and performance,2019 06 12,to evaluate the effects of a trail-running race on muscle oxidative function by measuring pulmonary gas exchange variables and muscle fractional O2 extraction.,An unusual presentation of intraosseous malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour of mandible.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188646,Dento maxillo facial radiology,2019 06 13,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) is a rare mesenchymal tumour which usually presents high grade malignancy. We report an atypical case of intraosseous malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour on mandible in a 36-year-old male. Patient presented with an incidentally discovered radiolucency on the left anterior mandible and did not complain of any symptoms. Panoramic radiograph and computed tomography showed enlargement of inferior alveolar nerve canal, thinning of the cortex and calcified foci within an expansile mass. Magnetic resonance images revealed heterogeneous hyperintense signal intensity with a well-defined margin on T2 weighted images, heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1 weighted images and intermediate signal intensity and inferior alveolar nerve canal enlargement on T1 weighted images. In spite of benign radiologic characteristics as mentioned above, histopathologic examination of biopsied specimen otherwise revealed a low-grade malignancy. Wide excision of mandible was performed and there has been no loco-regional recurrence or distant metastasis over 1 year following surgery.

Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 06 12,Recent advances in the fields of electronics and microfabrication techniques have led to the development of implantable medical devices for use within the field of precision medicine. Monitoring visceral surface tissue O2 tension (ptO2) by means of an implantable sensor is potentially useful in many clinical situations including the peri-operative management of patients undergoing intestinal resection and anastomosis. This concept could provide a means by which treatment could be tailored to individual patients. This study describes the in vivo validation of a novel miniaturised electrochemical O2 sensor to provide real-time data on intestinal ptO2. A single O2 sensor was placed onto the serosal surface of the small intestine of anaesthetised rats that were exposed to ischaemic (superior mesenteric artery occlusion) and hypoxaemic (alterations in inspired fractional O2 concentrations) insults. Control experiments demonstrated that the sensors function and remain stable in an in vivo environment. Intestinal ptO2 decreased following superior mesenteric artery occlusion and with reductions in inspired O2 concentrations. These results were reversible after reinstating blood flow or increasing inspired O2 concentrations. We have successfully developed an anaesthetised rat intestinal ischaemic and hypoxic model for validation of a miniaturised O2 sensor to provide real-time measurement of intestinal ptO2. Our results support further validation of the sensors in physiological conditions using a large animal model to provide evidence of their use in clinical applications where monitoring visceral surface tissue O2 tension is important.,Celiac disease: Should we care about microbes?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188640,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 06 12,"The prevalence of celiac disease has increased in the last decades suggesting a role for environmental factors in addition to gluten. Several cohort studies have shown that different gastrointestinal infections increase CeD risk. However, the mechanisms by which microbes participate in CeD have been remained elusive. Recently, using animal models, both viral and bacterial opportunistic pathogens were shown to induce immune activation relevant for CeD. The hypothesis that viral and or bacterial infections can contribute to immune activation and breakdown of tolerance towards gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is thus reinforced. Here, we discuss the evidence regarding the role of microbes in promoting CeD, and the specific pathways triggered by microbes that could participate in CeD pathogenesis. Understanding these pathways will allow us to develop optimal microbiota modulating strategies to help prevent CeD.",Sirtuin 3 silencing impairs mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism in colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188638,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 06 12,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the main mitochondrial deacetylase and targets several crucial enzymes against oxidative stress. Recent reports suggest that SIRT3 could also participate in the quality and quantity control of mitochondria. The aim of this study was to analyze whether SIRT3 silencing in colon cancer cells could affect mitochondrial biogenesis and impair mitochondrial function. For this purpose, metastatic colon cancer cell line SW620 was transfected with a specific shRNA against SIRT3 to obtain a stable knockdown. Gene expression and protein levels of several proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis and function were determined by RT-qPCR and Western Blot. Mitochondrial function was studied by analyzing COX, ATPase and LDH enzymatic activities, oxygen consumption, superoxide levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Confocal images were also taken to study mitochondrial morphology, and cell motility and clonogenicity were also studied. SIRT3 silencing resulted in a reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as evidenced by the decrease in proteins such as PGC-1α and TFAM, and lower levels of OXPHOS complexes. Furthermore, COX activity and oxygen consumption were also diminished after SIRT3 knockdown. Finally, SIRT3-silenced cells showed mitochondrial aggregation compared to control cells, as well as reduced motility and colony formation ability. In conclusion, SIRT3 silencing in SW620 cancer cells leads to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately affecting cell viability, and could be a therapeutic strategy to render cells more sensitive to treatment."

Herein, Au nanorods (GNRs)-based platforms functionalised with polyelectrolyte (PE) layers were developed and analysed as potential siRNA nanocarriers. The polymeric layers were successfully assembled on the particle surfaces by means of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique through the alternating deposition of oppositely charged poly(styrene) sulfonate, PSS, poly(lysine), PLL, and siRNA biopolymers, with a final hyaluronic acid (HA) layer in order to provide the nanoconstructs with a potential targeting ability as well as colloidal stability in physiological medium. Once the hybrid nanocarriers were obtained, their release, colloidal stability, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and gene silencing potential were studied. In this regard, these hybrid particles release the genetic material inside cells by means of a protease-assisted and/or a light-triggered release mechanism in order to control the delivery of the oligonucleotides on demand. In addition, the hybrid nanovectors were observed to be non-toxic to cells and could efficiently deliver the genetic material in the cell cytoplasms. The GNR-based nanocarriers here proposed can provide a suitable environment to load and protect sufficient amount of the genetic material to allow an efficient and sustained knockdown gene expression for a prolonged period of time (up to 93% for 72 h) thanks to the slow degradation of PLL, and without the observation of adverse side toxic effects.

By employing both thickness and In substitution as two independent ""knobs"" to control the gap change, we identify the evolution between several topological phases, i.e., dimensional crossover from a three-dimensional topological insulator to its two-dimensional counterpart with gapped surface state, and topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a normal semiconductor with increasing In concentration. Furthermore, by introducing In substitution, we experimentally demonstrated the trivial topological nature of Bi2Se3 thin films (below 6 quintuple layers) as two-dimensional gapped systems, consistent with our theoretical calculations. Our results provide not only a comprehensive phase diagram of (Bi1- xIn x)2Se3 and a route to control its phase evolution but also a practical way to experimentally determine the topological properties of a gapped compound by a topological phase transition and band gap engineering.","Design, Synthesis, and Conformational Analysis of Oligobenzanilides as Multifacial α-Helix Mimetics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188616,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"The design, synthesis, and conformational analysis of an oligobenzanilide helix mimetic scaffold capable of simultaneous mimicry of two faces of an α-helix is reported.

Additionally, using de novo ligand design and deep learning we show that the chemical compounds that can bind several different receptors have common structural characteristics, and that halogens, and fragments similar to the building blocks existing antimicrobials are overrepresented in them.

Furthermore, addition of iodine to the double bond or a putative iodine-catalyzed cis- trans isomerization of the employed olefins seem not to be an important side reaction here.",Are we Opening the Door to a New Era of Medicinal Chemistry or Being Collapsed to a Chemical Singularity?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188596,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 12,"The paradigm of ""drug likeness"" dramatically altered the behavior of the medicinal chemistry community for a long time. In recent years, scientists have empirically found a significant increase in key properties of drugs that have moved structures closer to the periphery or the outside of the rule-of-five ""cage"". Herein, we show that for the past decade, the number of molecules claimed in patent records by major pharmaceutical companies has dramatically decreased, which may lead to a ""chemical singularity"". New compounds containing fragments with increased 3D complexity are generally larger, slightly more lipophilic and more polar. A core difference between this study and recently published papers is that we consider the nature and quality of sp3-rich frameworks rather than sp3 count. We introduce the original descriptor MCE-18, which stands for Medicinal Chemistry Evolution, 2018, and this measure can effectively score molecules by novelty in terms of their cumulative sp3 complexity.",Vibrational Spectroscopy in Solution Through Perturbative Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188595,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 12,We have developed a method that allows computing the vibrational spectra at high quantum mechanical level for molecules in solution or other complex systems. The method is based on the use of configurational samplings from combined QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations and the use of perturbation theory to calculate accurate molecular properties. Such calculations provide in addition accurate free energy gradient vectors and Hessian matrices and thus open the door for the characterization of stationary points in free energy landscapes and the study of chemical reaction mechanisms in large disordered systems. The vibrational spectrum of the water molecule in liquid water has been computed as a test case. It has been obtained using a weighted average of instantaneous signals assuming the instantaneous normal modes approach. Vibrational frequencies are also computed by diagonalizing the Hessian of the free energy surface. Comparison is made with experimental data and with calculations using the Fourier transform of the time autocorrelation function of the dipole moment. The discussion emphasizes the advantages of the developed methodology compared to other techniques in terms of the accuracy/computational cost ratio.,"Radical α,β-Dehydrogenation of Saturated Amides via α-Oxidation with TEMPO under Transition Metal-Free Conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188594,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 12,"A transition metal-free radical process for the selective α,β-dehydrogenation of saturated amides under mild conditions is developed.

Here we analyze 37 target proteins that have bRo5 drugs or clinical candidates. Targets can benefit from bRo5 drugs if they have ""Complex"" hot spot structure with four or more hots spots, including some strong ones. Complex I targets show positive correlation between binding affinity and molecular weight. These targets are conventionally druggable, but reaching additional hot spots enables improved pharmaceutical properties. Complex II targets, mostly protein kinases, also have strong hot spots but show no correlation between affinity and ligand molecular weight, and the primary motivation for creating larger drugs is to increase selectivity. Each target considered as Complex III has some specific reason for requiring bRo5 drugs.

First, the NH2-H2BDC linkers and Zr6-based [Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4]12+ nodes of UiO-66-NH2 were transformed into amorphous N-doped carbon skeletons(NC) and ZrO2 nanoclusters under an argon atmosphere, respectively. The NC supports can simultaneously reduce and anchor the Pd sites, forming isolated Pd1-N/C sites. Then, switching the argon to air, the carbonaceous skeletons will be gasified and the ZrO2 nanoclusters were welded into a rigid and porous nanonet. Moreover, the reductive carbon will result in abundant oxygen (O*) defects, which could help to capture the migratory Pd1 species, leaving a sintering-resistant Pd1@ZrO2 catalysts via atom trapping. This Pd1@ZrO2 nanonet can act as a semihomogeneous catalyst to boost the direct synthesis of indole through hydrogenation and intramolecular condensation processes, with an excellent TOF (1109.2 h-1) and 94% selectivity.","Photodegradation of myrigalone A, an allelochemical from Myrica gale: photoproducts and effect of terpenes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188589,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 12,"This study investigated the environmental fate of myrigalone A, a light absorbing natural herbicide found on leaves and fruits of Myrica gale.

The phototransformation was fast (t1/2 = 35 min in water). Analyses by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution orbitrap electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography-MS revealed the formation of 11 photoproducts in water and solid and 9 in gaseous phase. Some were detected in the leaf glands and oil covering the fruits of Myrica gale suggesting that photodegradation occurs in the field. Moreover, myrigalone A photoinduced the oxidation of terpenes that in turn protected it against photolysis.

However, glycation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the most abundant amine-containing lipids in blood plasma, is under explored and so far only a few glycated PEs have been reported. Herein, we report comprehensive profiling of Amadori-PE and -LysoPE species in human plasma. Using synthetic standards, we first optimized the enrichment procedure for extracting Amadori-PE/LysoPE from plasma. Based on the characteristic neutral losses of 303 Da in positive and 162 Da in negative ionization mode, we then applied neural loss scanning-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-NLS-MS) to identify potentially glycated PE and LysoPE, which was followed by targeted product ion scanning (LC-PIS-MS) to confidently confirm the fatty acyl substitutions of the modified lipids. A total of 20 Amadori-LysoPE and 62 Amadori-PE species, including diacyl, plasmanyl and plasmenyl, were identified.

However, this method is ineffective for producing highly enhanced silver deposition for use in ultrasensitive detection. Herein, we report a fast silver deposition method that simultaneously uses three signal amplification processes: (i) enzymatic amplification, (ii) chemical-chemical (CC) redox cycling, and (iii) chemical-enzymatic (CN) redox cycling. DT-diaphorase (DT-D) is used for enzymatic amplification to convert a nitroso compound, a species incapable of directly reducing Ag+ to an amine compound, which can directly reduce Ag+. NADH acts as a reducing agent for the indirect reduction of Ag+ via the two redox cycling processes. 4-Nitroso-1-naphthol is converted to 4-amino-1-naphthol (NH2-N) in the presence of DT-D. NH2-N initiates two redox cycling processes: NH2-N, along with Ag+ and NADH, are involved in the CC redox cycling, whereas NH2-N, along with Ag+, DT-D, and NADH, are involved in the CN redox cycling. Finally, the deposited silver is electrochemically oxidized to produce a signal. When this triple signal amplification strategy for fast silver deposition is applied to an electrochemical immunosensor for detecting parathyroid hormone (PTH), a detection limit as low as ∼100 fg/mL is obtained. The concentrations of PTH in clinical serum determined using the developed immunosensor are found to agree with those measured using a commercial instrument. Thus, the use of this strategy for fast silver deposition is highly promising for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection and biosensing applications.",Substrate-based Allosteric Regulation of a Homodimeric Enzyme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188575,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 12,"Many enzymes operate through half-of-the sites reactivity wherein a single protomer is catalytically engaged at one time. In the case of the homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase, substrate binding triggers closing of a regulatory cap domain in the empty protomer, preventing substrate access to the remaining active site. However, the empty protomer serves a critical role by acquiring more disorder upon substrate binding, thereby entropically favoring the forward reaction. Empty protomer dynamics are also allosterically coupled to the bound protomer, driving conformational exchange at the active site and progress along the reaction coordinate. Here, we show that at high concentrations, a second substrate binds along the substrate-access channel of the occupied protomer, thereby dampening interprotomer dynamics and inhibiting catalysis. While a mutation (K152I) abrogates second site binding and removes inhibitory effects, it also precipitously lowers the maximum catalytic rate, implying a role for the allosteric pocket at low substrate concentrations, where only a single substrate engages the enzyme at one time. We show that this outer pocket first desolvates the substrate, whereupon it is deposited in the active site. Substrate binding to the active site then triggers the empty outer pocket to serve as an inter-protomer allosteric conduit, enabling enhanced dynamics and sampling of activation states needed for catalysis. These allosteric networks and the ensuing changes resulting from second substrate binding are delineated using rigidity-based allosteric transmission theory and validated by NMR and functional studies. The results illustrate the role of dynamics along allosteric networks in facilitating function.",Traceless Electrophilic Amination for the Synthesis of Unprotected Cyclic β-Amino Acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188574,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 12,"Electrophilic aminations involve an umpolung of a nitrogen atom, providing an alternate, distinctive synthetic strategy. The recent advent of various designed O-substituted hydroxylamines has significantly advanced this research field. An underappreciated issue is atom economy of the transformations: The necessary activating group on the oxygen atom is left in coproduced waste. Herein, we describe Rh-catalyzed electrophilic amination of substituted isoxazolidin-5-ones for the synthesis of unprotected, cyclic β-amino acids featuring either benzo-fused or spirocyclic scaffolds. Using the cyclic hydroxylamines allows for retaining both nitrogen and oxygen functionalities in the product. The traceless, redox neutral process proceeds on a gram scale with as little as 0.1 mol% catalyst loading. In contrast to related electrophilic aminations in the literature, a series of mechanistic experiments suggests a unique pathway involving spirocyclization, followed by the skeletal rearrangement. The insights provided herein shed light on a nuanced reactivity of the active species, Rh-nitrenoid generated from the activated hydroxylamine, and extend the knowledge on electrophilic aromatic substitutions.",Fine-Tuning of Luminescence through Changes in Au-S Bond Lengths as a Function of Temperature or Solvent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188573,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 12,"The luminescent properties of gold(I)-sulfur compounds have received much attention for their potential applications in the sensing field.

Compound 1, if solvated with H2O and alcohol, possesses the shorter Au-S bonds and enhanced luminescence. The close relationship between luminescence intensity and Au-S length serves as a complement to existing luminescent gold(I)-sulfur systems and provides some insight into understanding the thermochromism and solvatochromism of the gold(I)-sulfur compounds.",In-Situ Capture of Mercury in Coal-Fired Power Plants Using High Surface Energy Fly Ash.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188572,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 12,"Coal-fired power plants represent the largest source of mercury emissions worldwide. Using fly ash, a byproduct of these plants, as a sorbent to remove mercury has proven to be difficult. Here, we found that the fresh surface of modified fly ash has good adsorption performance, and it declines obviously with time because of unsaturation characteristics on surface. On the basis of this mechanism, our study provides a method to in situ capture mercury with high surface energy modified fly ash by mechanochemical and bromide treatment. Fresh modified fly ash with active sites is injected into the flue to directly adsorb mercury. A continuous system within a full-scale 300 MWe plant showed that the mercury adsorption performance of the modified fly ash is similar to that of activated carbon, which is the industry benchmark for the treatment of mercury emission in fossil power generation units. This is a breakthrough and indicates that modified fly ash can become an efficient and convenient industrial sorbent for the removal of mercury.",Robust Piezo-Phototronic Effect in Multilayer γ-InSe for High-Performance Self-Powered Flexible Photodetectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188571,ACS nano,2019 06 14,"The piezo-phototronic effect has been promising as an effective means to improve the performance of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor based optoelectronic devices. However, the current reported monolayer 2D semiconductors are not regarded as suitable for actual flexible piezotronic photodetectors due to their insufficient optical absorption and mechanical durability, although they possess strong piezoelectricity. In this work, we demonstrate that, unlike 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides, γ-phase InSe with a hexagonal unit cell possesses broken inversion symmetry in all the layer numbers and has a strong second-harmonic generation effect. Moreover, driven by the piezo-phototronic effect, a flexible self-powered photodetector based on multilayer γ-InSe, which can work without any energy supply, is proposed. The device exhibited ultrahigh photon responsivity of 824 mA/W under light illuminations of 400 nm (0.368 mW/cm2). Moreover, the responsivity and response speed of this photodetector were enhanced further by as much as 696% and 1010%, respectively, when a 0.62% uniaxial tensile strain was applied. Our devices exhibit high reliability and stability during a 6 month test time.

Here we report evidence that AHBA is first loaded onto an MmcB acyl carrier protein (ACP) by a MitE acyl ACP synthetase, followed by a transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc by MitB. The results suggest that the early steps of mitomycin biosynthesis proceed via intermediates linked to MmcB.",Quantification of Aldehydes on Polymeric Microbead Surfaces via Catch and Release of Reporter Chromophores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188569,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 12,"Aldehyde moieties on 2D-supports or micro- and nanoparticles can function as anchor groups for the attachment of biomolecules or as reversible binding sites for proteins on cell surfaces. The use of aldehyde-based materials in bioanalytical and medical settings calls for reliable methods to detect and quantify this functionality. We report here on a versatile concept to quantify the accessible aldehyde moieties on particle surfaces through the specific binding and subsequent release of small reporter molecules such as fluorescent dyes and nonfluorescent chromophores utilizing acylhydrazone formation as a reversible covalent labeling strategy. This is representatively demonstrated for a set of polymer microparticles with different aldehyde labeling densities. Excess reporter molecules can be easily removed by washing, eliminating inaccuracies caused by unspecific adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces. Cleavage of hydrazones at acidic pH assisted by a carbonyl trap releases the fluorescent reporters rapidly and quasi-quantitatively and allows for their fluorometric detection at low concentration. Importantly, this strategy separates the signal-generating molecules from the bead surface. This circumvents common issues associated with light scattering and signal distortions that are caused by binding-induced changes in reporter fluorescence as well as quenching dye-dye interactions on crowded particle surfaces. In addition, we demonstrate that the release of a nonfluorescent chromophore via disulfide cleavage and subsequent quantification by absorption spectroscopy gives comparable results, verifying that both assays are capable of rapid and sensitive quantification of aldehydes on microbead surfaces. These strategies enable a quantitative comparison of bead batches with different functionalization densities, and a qualitative prediction of their coupling efficiencies in bioconjugations, as demonstrated in reductive amination reactions with Streptavidin.",Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188568,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 12,"We present the first quadruple borylation reaction of terminal alkynes, affording functionalized 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(boronate) derivatives in a chemo-/regioselective manner.

Due to a paucity of data on the molecular-level details and mechanisms involved, we leveraged a realistic air-liquid interface model of inhalation exposure, to investigate global transcriptomic responses in reconstituted three-dimensional airway epithelia of healthy and asthmatic subjects exposed to pristine (nCuO) and carboxylated (nCuOCOOH) copper oxide nanoparticles. A dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity (highest in asthmatic donor cells) and pro-inflammatory signalling within 24 hours, confirmed the reliability and sensitivity of the system to detect acute inhalation toxicity. Gene expression changes between nanoparticle-exposed versus air-exposed cells were investigated. Hierarchical clustering based on the expression profiles of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs), cell-death-associated DEGs (567 genes) or a subset of 48 highly overlapping DEGs, categorized all samples according to 'exposure severity', wherein nanoparticle surface chemistry and asthma are incorporated into the dose-response axis. For example, asthmatics exposed to low and medium dose nCuO clustered with healthy donor cells exposed to medium and high dose nCuO, respectively. Of note, a set of genes with high relevance to mucociliary clearance, were observed to distinctly differentiate asthmatic and healthy donor cells. These genes also responded differently to nCuO and nCuOCOOH nanoparticles. Additionally, because response to transition metal nanoparticle was a highly enriched Gene Ontology term (FDR 8E-13) from the subset of 48 highly overlapping DEGs, these genes may represent biomarkers to a potentially large variety of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles.",Structural basis of leader peptide recognition in lasso peptide biosynthesis pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188556,ACS chemical biology,2019 06 12,"Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with a unique 3D-interlocked structure, in which an N-terminal macrolactam ring is threaded by a linear C-terminal part. The unique structure of lasso peptides is introduced into ribosomally translated precursor peptides by lasso peptide synthetase encompassing proteins B and C, or B1, B2, and C when the B enzyme is split into two distinct proteins. The B1 protein recognizes the leader sequence of the precursor peptide, and then the B2 protein cleaves it. The C protein catalyzes the formation of the macrolactam ring. However, the detailed mechanism of lasso peptide maturation has remained elusive, due to the lack of structural information about the responsible proteins. Here we report the crystal structure of the B1 protein from the thermophilic actinobacteria, Thermobifida fusca (TfuB1), complexed with the leader peptide (TfuA-Leader), which revealed the detailed mechanism of leader peptide recognition. The structure of TfuB1 consists of an N-terminal -sheet and three C-terminal helices. The leader peptide is docked on one edge of the N-terminal -sheet of TfuB1, as an additional  strand. Three conserved amino acid residues of the leader peptide (TfuA Tyr-17, Pro-14, and Leu-12) fit well on the hydrophobic cleft between the -sheet and adjacent helices. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that these conserved residues are essential for affinity between TfuB1 and the TfuA-Leader. Furthermore, we found that TfuB1 and the leader peptide jointly form a hydrophobic patch on the -sheet, which includes the highly conserved TfuA Phe-6 and TfuB1 Tyr33. Homology modeling and mutational analysis of the B1 protein from a firmicute, Bacillus pseudomycoides (PsmB1), revealed that the hydrophobic patch is conserved in wide range of species and involved in the cleavage activity of the B2 protein, indicating it forms the interaction surface for the B2 protein or the core part of the precursor peptide.",In vivo Assessment of Decellularized Porcine Myocardial Slice as Acellular Cardiac Patch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188555,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"Acellular cardiac patches made of various biomaterials have been shown to improve heart function after myocardial infarction (MI).

We found that the implanted dPMS firmly attached to host myocardium after implantation and prevented thinning of the left ventricular (LV) wall after an MI. A large number of host cells were identified to infiltrate into the implanted dPMS and a significant number of vessel structures were observed in the dPMS and infarcted area. We detected a significantly higher density of M2 macrophages in the groups treated with dPMSs as compared to the MI group. Contraction of the LV wall and cardiac functional parameters (Left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening) were significantly improved in the treatment groups (300 µm and 600 µm dPMS) four weeks after surgery.

Herein, natural polysaccharide was used to construct the surface wrinkled microsphere with controllable wrinkling patterns. A robust microsphere with an average size of about 55 μm fabricated from chitosan in alkali/urea aqueous solution was swelled and then coated orderly by introducing rigid silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with an average size of about 5 nm as the shell onto the surface through electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly followed by deswelling, resulting in a surface wrinkled microsphere. The significant difference in the swelling behaviors between the stiff Ag shell and swelled chitosan microsphere could generate enough driving forces to form 3D micro- and nanoscale wrinkling surface topography. The surface wrinkled microspheres exhibited the hierarchically porous structure and hydrophobicity, and the topographical patterns could be adjusted by controlling the thickness of the Ag NP layer to achieve the sizes of wrinkling ranging from 60 to 300 nm. It was demonstrated that the wrinkled microspheres were superior as 3D surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates, in which the wrinkled structure with spatial periodicity was proved to be effective for enhancing the SERS signal.

In this context, plasmons, the collective electron oscillations in conducting materials, are important because they allow the manipulation of optical fields at the nanoscale. The advent of graphene and other two-dimensional crystals has pushed plasmons down to genuinely atomic dimensions, displaying appealing properties such as a large electrical tunability. However, plasmons in these materials are either too broad or lying at low frequencies, well below the technologically relevant near-infrared regime. Here, we demonstrate sharp near-infrared plasmons in lithographically patterned wafer-scale atomically thin silver crystalline films. Our measured optical spectra reveal narrow plasmons (quality factor of ∼4), further supported by a low sheet resistance comparable to bulk metal in few-atomic-layer silver films down to seven Ag(111) monolayers. Good crystal quality and plasmon narrowness are obtained despite the addition of a thin passivating dielectric, which renders our samples resilient to ambient conditions.

Spatiotemporal harmonization of solid precursor dissolution and MOF crystallization enabled precise replication of the precursor layer morphology to form a continuous MOF coating composed of intergrown crystals. The resulting flexible, highly robust, and processable fibrous MOF/textile composites demonstrated tremendous potential for industrially relevant applications such as continuous removal of the organosulfur compound dibenzothiophene from simulated gasoline and ammonia capture.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to recommend counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. However, screening by a physician may be warranted in high-risk patients. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians counsel young adults, adolescents, children, and parents of young children about minimizing exposure to UV radiation for individuals ages 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types to reduce the risk of skin cancer. It also recommends selectively offering counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. In determining whether counseling is appropriate, the presence of risk factors for skin cancer should be considered.",Skin Cancer: Precancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188549,FP essentials,2019 06 12,"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are common skin lesions caused by cumulative sun exposure. Rates of lesion progression to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been reported to be between 0.025% and 16%, some lesions may regress. Atypical moles are melanocytic nevi that indicate a higher risk of melanoma and, on rare occasions, transform into malignant melanoma, particularly in patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome or familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma syndrome. Precancerous lesions can be identified by physical examination; diagnostic accuracy is enhanced by dermatoscopy. Biopsy is indicated when definitive diagnosis is deemed necessary for suspicious lesions. AKs can be managed with surgical methods, topical chemotherapeutic drugs, or photodynamic therapy. Complications of AKs include itching, pain, cosmetic concerns, and progression to SCC. Management of dysplastic nevi depends on the degree of atypia present. Lesions may be observed in cases of mild atypia with positive histologic margins but negative clinical margins. Dysplastic nevi with a high degree of atypia should be surgically excised or the patient should be referred to a dermatology subspecialist. Complications of atypical nevi include cosmetic concerns, recurrence, and rare progression to melanoma. Surveillance of precancerous lesions should include patient self-examination and regular follow-up skin examinations performed by the physician.",Skin Cancer: Squamous and Basal Cell Carcinomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188548,FP essentials,2019 06 12,"Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer during their lifetime; 97% of these cancers will be nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) comprises approximately 80% of NMSCs and most of the remainder are cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The predominant risk factor for NMSC is exposure to solar UV radiation. Skin type also plays a role, with a higher incidence of NMSCs among fairer-skinned individuals. Immunocompromise can increase the risk. Biopsy of suspicious lesions should be obtained to determine histologic subtype and guide treatment. Surgical techniques include excision, curettage and electrodessication, and Mohs micrographic surgery. Nonsurgical therapies such as topical therapy or photodynamic therapy may be used for BCC lesions if surgical techniques are not appropriate. Staging and sentinel lymph node biopsy are reserved for patients with large infiltrative lesions. The prognosis for patients with NMSC is extremely favorable. Because of the low risk of metastasis, significant morbidity or mortality is rare. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends skin examinations for all patients with NMSC at least annually. Primary interventions for prevention include counseling on reducing sun exposure, use of UV-protective clothing and sunscreen, and discouragement of tanning bed use."

Correlation structure can be conveniently captured in a matrix that indicates the relationships among brain regions, which could involve electroencephalogram sensors, electrophysiology recordings, calcium imaging data, or functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data-We call this type of analysis matrix-based analysis, or MBA. Although different methods have been developed to summarize such matrices across subjects, including univariate general linear models (GLMs), the available modeling strategies tend to disregard the interrelationships among the regions, leading to ""inefficient"" statistical inference. Here, we develop a Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling framework that simultaneously integrates the analyses of all regions, region pairs (RPs), and subjects. In this approach, the intricate relationships across regions as well as across RPs are quantitatively characterized. The adoption of the Bayesian framework allows us to achieve three goals: (a) dissolve the multiple testing issue typically associated with seeking evidence for the effect of each RP under the conventional univariate GLM; (b) make inferences on effects that would be treated as ""random"" under the conventional linear mixed-effects framework; and (c) estimate the effect of each brain region in a manner that indexes their relative ""importance"". We demonstrate the BML methodology with an FMRI dataset involving a cognitive-emotional task and compare it to the conventional GLM approach in terms of model efficiency, performance, and inferences.

Our aim was to estimate the association between this intervention and the dispensing patterns of asthma medications among children. Dispensing data on asthma medications for all children living in Stockholm County during 2014-2017 were selected to include two years before (January 2014-December2015) and after (January 2016-December 2017) the intervention. In an uncontrolled before-and-after study, the measures of utilization were: the proportion of children with at least one dispensed asthma medication (prevalence); the number of children initiated on treatment after an 18-month drug-free period (incidence); the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) dispensed per child; and the number of children with at least two prescriptions with controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonist) dispensed during 18 months (persistence). In an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis, all measures were included except for persistence. Socioeconomic status was defined using Mosaic data. The prevalence increased after the intervention (from 11.9% to 13.0%). However, the ITS analysis showed a positive trend already before the intervention and, consequently, the increase was not attributable to the intervention. For incidence, similar patterns were observed. There was an increase in dispensed volumes related to the intervention, 46.3 DDDs/child/month before and 51.1 after the intervention (p-value 0.01). The proportion of children with persistent asthma medication increased from 46.0% to 51.9% in children with low socioeconomic status. In conclusion, the intervention was only modestly associated with changes in the dispensing patterns of asthma medication, with the volume dispensed per child increasing slightly, particularly in children with low socioeconomic status.

Respiratory phenotype (Respiratory Severity Score, RSS), serum and urine metabolomics were assessed before and after treatment. Ten infants provided nine matched serum and nine matched urine samples. There was a significant decrease in RSS with steroid treatment. Serum gluconic acid had the largest median fold-change (140 times decreased, p 0.008). In Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis, in both serum and urine, the urea cycle, ammonia recycling and malate-aspartate shuttle pathways were most significantly enriched when comparing pre and post-treatment (p-value < 0.05). In regression analyses, six serum and twenty-eight urine metabolites were significantly associated with change in RSS. Urine gluconic acid lactone was the most significantly correlated with clinical response (correlational coefficient 0.915).

Some species are chemolithoautotrophic, obtaining energy through oxidation of inorganic substrates, sulfur in particular, and acquiring carbon through the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) CO2 fixation cycle. The current model for sulfur oxidation in the Sulfolobales is based on biochemical analysis of specific proteins from Acidianus ambivalens, including sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) that disproportionates S° into H2 S and sulfite (SO32- ). Initial studies indicated SOR catalyzes the essential first step in oxidation of elemental sulfur, but an ancillary role for SOR as a ""recycle"" enzyme has also been proposed. Here, heterologous expression of both SOR and membrane-bound thiosulfate-quinone oxidoreductase (TQO) from Sulfolobus tokodaii 'restored' sulfur oxidation capacity in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM639, but not autotrophy, though earlier reports indicate this strain was once capable of chemolithoautotrophy. Comparative transcriptomic analyses of Acidianus brierleyi, a chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizer, and S. acidocaldarius DSM639 showed that while both share a strong transcriptional response to elemental sulfur, S. acidocaldarius DSM639 failed to up-regulate key 3-HP/4-HB cycle genes used by A. brierleyi to drive chemolithoautotrophy. Thus, the inability for S. acidocaldarius DSM639 to grow chemolithoautotrophically may be rooted more in gene regulation than biochemical capacity. This article is protected by copyright.

Depending on various national guidelines and accessibility of techniques, only selected psychoactive substances are routinely tested in urine of MMT patients. In general, they belong to the few groups of compounds; THC, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, PCP and benzodiazepines. It is, however, well known that patients enrolled in such replacement programs take psychoactive substances that are not routinely detected by the toxicology laboratories, to escape unexpected tests. Here, we report semiquantitative detection of legal highs taken by the MMT patient, using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to the flowing atmospheric pressure afterglow ion source (LC-FAPA-MS). To demonstrate effectivity of this technique, the data were confirmed by quantitative analysis using LC-ESI-MS/MS. In the analysed sample of MMT patient, a mixture of psychoactive compounds was found, namely 3-MMC (3-methylmethcathinone), pentedrone and methcathinone and determined at the concentrations of 670; 50, and 0.2 μg mL-1 , respectively. Such fast analytical technique may be useful for the efficient control of substances taken intentionally by MMT patients. This article is protected by copyright.

With the accumulation of whole genome sequence data, it became clear that some strains belong to a group intermediate between the F and B2 phylogroups, designated as phylogroup G. Here, we studied the complete sequences of 112 strains representative of the G phylogroup diversity and showed that it is composed of one main sequence type complex (STc)117 and four other STcs (STc657, STc454, STc738 and STc174). STc117, which phylogeny is characterised by very short internal branches, exhibits extensive O diversity, but little H-type and fimH allele diversity while the other STcs are characterised by a main O, H and fimH type. STc117 strains possess many traits associated with extra-intestinal virulence, are virulent in a mouse sepsis model and exhibit multi-drug resistance such as CTX-M production. Epidemiologic data on 4524 Australian and French strains suggest that STc117 is a poultry associated lineage that can also establish in humans and cause extra-intestinal diseases. We propose an easy identification method that will help to trace this potentially virulent and resistant phylogroup in epidemiologic studies. This article is protected by copyright.

The magnetic minerals identified in prokaryotic magnetosomes are magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) and greigite (Fe3 S4 ). Magnetosome crystals, regardless of composition, have consistent, species-specific morphologies and single-domain size range. Because of these features, magnetosome magnetite crystals possess specific properties in comparison to abiotic, chemically-synthesized magnetite. Despite numerous discoveries regarding MTB phylogeny over the last decades, this diversity is still considered underestimated. Characterization of magnetotactic microorganisms is important as it might provide insights into the origin and establishment of magnetoreception in general, including eukaryotes. Here we describe the magnetotactic behavior and characterize the magnetosomes from a flagellated protist using culture-independent methods. Results strongly suggest that, unlike previously described magnetotactic protists, this flagellate is capable of biomineralizing its own anisotropic magnetite magnetosomes which are aligned in complex aggregations of multiple chains within the cell. This organism has a similar response to magnetic field inversions as MTB. Therefore, this eukaryotic species might represent an early origin of magnetoreception based on magnetite biomineralization. It should add to the definition of parameters and criteria to classify biogenic magnetite in the fossil record. This article is protected by copyright.

Reporting of this research adheres to the COREQ guidelines BACKGROUND: The care provided by the ambulance team is often associated with emergency medicine, traumatology and disaster medicine. But to develop care in the ambulance service it is imperative to understand what the parents want and value in the care for their child RESULTS: The parents described the importance of giving the family enough time in the situation, creating a safe environment, and involving the parents in the care. In cases where the parents felt insecure, there had been lack of communication, lack of sensitivity, and the ambulance team did not invite the parents to be participate in the care CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to strengthen the family-centred care in the ambulance service. Not inviting the parents in the care, and use of equipment that was non-functioning or not adjustable for the children's age caused lack of trust, and increased the level of stress among the parents.

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the CES contained a large amount of OH groups and had a favorable structure for adsorbing heavy metals. The value of pHpzc of CES was estimated at 7.08. In the neutral pH region, the surface of CES is negatively charged and favorable for adsorption of Pb(II). The maximum Langmuir adsorption amount was 155.67 mg/g, and the adsorption process of Pb(II) using CES fitted Pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model. Moreover, the analysis of adsorption energy, free energy, enthalpy, and entropy found that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto CES was physical and a spontaneous exothermic reaction. CES is a hybrid adsorbent using general municipal waste and has great advantages in terms of environmental conservation and sustainable environmental circulation. This allows it to compete with other adsorbents. This article is protected by copyright.

We 3D-scanned scapholunars and measured articular surface areas and angles between articular facets using GeoMagic and Rhino 3D-software. We analyzed the difference in these metrics using multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis. Results show that the scapholunar reflects ecological signal, with clear groupings of cursorial carnivorans and grappling/climbing carnivorans; however, phylogenetic signal was also present in the results with hyaenids, canids, and large felids in distinct morphospaces. Extinct species Miracinonyx trumani (American cheetah) and Smilodon fatalis (sabertooth cat) showed surprising results with M. trumani grouping with pantherines instead of Acinonyx or Puma, suggesting it runs but still retains the ability to grapple prey. S. fatalis groups with pantherines, but also shows some unique adaptations, suggesting it had a different range of wrist motion than living cats.

Additionally, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot technique to analyze their expression profiles at different stages of sheep estrous cycle in the endometrium and myometrium. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ERα, ERβ, AR, and PGR were present in sheep uterus in estrus, mainly in the uterine luminal epithelium, stroma, gland, and myometrium. RT-qPCR results showed that in the endometrium, ERα expression level was highest in estrus. ERβ and PGR, instead, were highly expressed in proestrus. In the myometrium, ERα was highly expressed in both estrus and proestrus, and ERβ was highly expressed in estrus and diestrus. PGR expression was highest in estrus, followed by metestrus. In the endometrium, both receptors ERα and ERβ were abundant in proestrus, while the maximum AR protein content was found in estrus. At this stage of the estrous cycle, PGR protein concentration in the myometrium was significantly lower than those observed in other stages. These results suggest that these receptors are important for sheep reproductive function, as their expression at mRNA and protein levels exhibit particular time- and tissue-specific profiles along the estrous cycle.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism underling the cardioprotective effect of propofol against myocardial I/R injury (MIRI) in vivo and in vitro. Rat heart I/R injury was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery for 30 min followed by 2-hr reperfusion. Propofol pretreatment (0.01 mg/g) was performed 10 min before reperfusion. In vitro MIRI was investigated in cultured cardiomyocytes H9C2 following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injuries. Propofol pretreatment in vitro was achieved in the medium supplemented with 25 μmol/L propofol before H/R injuries. Propofol pretreatment significantly increased miRNA-451 expression, decreased HMGB1 expression, reduced infarct size, and I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in rat hearts undergoing I/R injuries. Knockdown of miRNA-451 48 hr before I/R injury was found to increase HMGB1 expression, infarct size, and I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in rat hearts in the presence of propofol pretreatment. These in vivo findings were reproduced in vivo that knockdown of miRNA-451 48 hr before H/R injuries increased HMGB1 expression and H/R-induced apoptosis in cultured H9C2 supplemented with propofol. In addition, luciferase activity assays and gain-of-function studies found that propofol could decrease HMGB1, the target of miRNA-541. Taken together our findings provide a first demonstration that propofol-mediated cardioprotection against MIRI is dependent of microRNA-451/HMGB1. The study provides a novel target to prevent I/R injury during propofol anesthesia.",Potential antigen candidates for subunit vaccine development against Helicobacter pylori infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188484,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 06 12,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a resident bacterium in the stomach that accounts for 75% cases of gastric cancer. In this review, we comprehensively studied published papers on H. pylori vaccines using Google Scholar and NCBI databases to gather information about vaccines against H. pylori. Considering the pivotal roles of the enzyme urease (in production of NH3 and neutralization of the acidic medium of the stomach), cytotoxin-associated gene A, and vacuolating cytotoxin A proteins in H. pylori infection, they could be the best candidates for the construction of recombinant vaccines. The outer membrane porins (Hop), blood group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA), sialic acid-binding adhesin (SabA), and outer inflammatory protein A, play significant roles in binding of bacterium to human gastric tissues, and because binding is the first step in bacterial fixation and colonization, these antigens also can be considered as suitable candidates for designing vaccines. Likely, other significant bacterial antigens, such as NapA (chemotactic factor for recruitment of human neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection), duodenal ulcer promoting protein A (to promote duodenal ulcer), and Hsp60 (as a molecular chaperon for activation of urease enzyme), can be used in the construction of subunit vaccines. New vaccines in use currently, such as DNA vaccines and subunit vaccines, can efficiently replace the dead and attenuated vaccines. Nonetheless, the results show that urease enzyme is most used compared with bacterial components in the designing and construction of recombinant vaccines. The BabA and SabA antigens belong to the outer membrane porins family in H. pylori and are required for binding and fixation of the bacterium to the human gastric tissues.",Balloon pulmonary angioplasty vs riociguat in patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188483,Clinical cardiology,2019 06 12,No previous meta-analyses have compared the efficacy and safety of BPA with riociguat therapy in inoperable CTEPH patients.,Fitness of an allopolyploid rupicolous fern compared with its diploid progenitors: from sporogenesis to sporophyte formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188481,American journal of botany,2019 06 12,"When two populations of related cytotypes grow in sympatry, the rarer cytotype tends to be excluded due to a frequency-dependent mating disadvantage.

A retrospective review of subject characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients who received ECLS at Penn State Health Children's Hospital (PSHCH) from 2000 to 2016 was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare PSHCH outcomes and complications to the ELSO Registry report. Data from 118 patients was included. Survival to discontinuation of ECLS was 70.3% and 65.2% to discharge/transfer. Following circuitry equipment changes, the survival to discharge/transfer improved for both neonatal (<29 days) and pediatric (29 days to <18 years) patients. The most common complications associated with ECLS were clinical seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, and culture-proven infection. ECLS for pulmonary support appeared to be associated with a higher risk of circuit thrombus and cannula problems. When compared to the ELSO Registry, low volume ECLS centers, like our institution, can have outcomes that are no different or statistically better as noted with neonatal and pediatric cardiac patients. Pediatric patients requiring pulmonary support appeared to experience more mechanical complications during ECLS suggesting the need for ongoing technological improvement.

Starling-like control (SLC) of VADs mimics the healthy ventricular flow regulation and automatically adjusts VAD speed to meet varying patient cardiac demand. The use of a fixed control line (CL - the relationship between ventricular preload and VAD flow) limits the flow regulating capability of the controller, especially in the case of exercise. Adaptive SLC (ASLC) overcomes this limitation by allowing the controller to adapt the CL to meet a diverse range of circulatory conditions. This study evaluated ASLC, SLC and CSC in a biventricular supported mock circulation loop under the simulated conditions of exercise, sleep, fluid loading and systemic hypertension. Each controller was evaluated on its ability to remain within predefined limits of VAD flow, preload, and afterload. The ASLC produced superior cardiac output (CO) during exercise (10.1 L/min) compared to SLC (7.3 L/min) and CSC (6.3 L/min). The ASLC produced favourable haemodynamics during sleep, fluid loading and systemic hypertension and could remain within a predefined haemodynamic range in three out of four simulations, suggesting improved haemodynamic performance over SLC and CSC.

Veterans are more likely to be divorced, unemployed, and experience difficulties with parenting. Some research has suggested that improvement in PTSD-specific symptoms can also improve psychosocial functioning. An integrative review was conducted to explore the content and effectiveness of evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) interventions to improve psychosocial functions and investigate conditions for symptom change. The Socio-Interpersonal Framework Model of PTSD was used to synthesize and organize findings. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched and seven articles met inclusion criteria. The main results indicate that EBP interventions can improve psychosocial functioning in Veterans with PTSD. Treating Veterans until they no longer meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD may be beneficial to improve psychosocial functioning. The current integrative review revealed that this area is neglected in research.

But far less understood are the processes governing in situ diversification on the world's mega islands, where large and isolated land masses produced morphologically distinct radiations from related taxa on continental regions. Madagascar has long been recognized as a natural laboratory due to its isolation, lack of influence from adjacent continents, and diversification of spectacular vertebrate radiations. However, only a handful of studies have examined rate shifts of in situ diversification for this island. Here, we examine rates of diversification in the Malagasy snakes of the family Pseudoxyrhophiinae (gemsnakes) to understand if rates of speciation were initially high, enhanced by diversification into distinct biomes, and associated with key dentition traits. Using a genomic sequence-capture data set for 366 samples, we determine that all previously described and newly discovered species are delimitable and therefore useful candidates for understanding diversification trajectories through time. Our analysis detected no shifts in diversification rate between clades or changes in biome or dentition type. Remarkably, we demonstrate that rates of diversification of the gemsnake radiation, which originated in Madagascar during the early Miocene, remained steady throughout the Neogene. However, we do detect a significant slowdown in diversification during the Pleistocene. We also comment on the apparent paradox where most living species originated in the Pleistocene, despite diversification rates being substantially higher during the earlier 15 myr.

The tarsal chemosensilla located on the legs of workers are sensitive to nonvolatile compounds and proposed to be involved in gustatory detection. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the gustatory recognition of foods in honey bees. In the present study, RNA-seq was performed with RNA samples extracted from the legs of 1-, 10-, and 20-d-old workers of Apis cerana cerana Fabricius, a dominant indigenous crop pollinator with a keen perception ability for phytochemicals. A total of 124 candidate chemosensory proteins (CSPs), including 15 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 5 CSPs, 7 gustatory receptors (GRs), 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), and 95 odorant receptors (ORs), were identified from the assembled leg transcriptome. In silico analysis of expression showed that 36 of them were differentially expressed among the three different ages of A. c. cerana workers. Overall, the genes encoding OBPs and CSPs had great but extremely variable FPKM values and thus were highly expressed in the legs of workers, whereas the genes encoding ORs, GRs, and SNMPs (except SNMP2) were expressed at low levels. Tissue-specific expression patterns indicated that two upregulated genes, AcerOBP15 and AcerCSP3, were predominately expressed in the legs of 20-d-old foragers, suggesting they may play an essential role in gustatory recognition and selection of plant nectars and pollens.

Herein we report that in the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, the adaptive response to Mn limitation is controlled by a DtxR family metalloregulator, MtsR. Genes upregulated by MtsR during Mn limitation include Mn (mtsABC) and Fe acquisition systems (sia operon), and a metal-independent DNA synthesis enzyme (nrdFEI.2). To elucidate the mechanism of metal sensing and gene regulation by MtsR, we determined the crystal structure of MtsR. MtsR employs two Mn-sensing sites to monitor metal availability, and metal occupancy at each site influences MtsR regulatory activity. The site 1 acts as the primary Mn sensing site, and loss of metal at site 1 causes robust upregulation of mtsABC. The vacant site 2 causes partial induction of mtsABC, indicating that site 2 functions as secondary Mn sensing site. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal FeoA domains of adjacent dimers participate in the oligomerization of MtsR on DNA, and multimerization is critical for MtsR regulatory activity. Finally, the mtsR mutant strains defective in metal sensing and oligomerization are attenuated for virulence in a mouse model of invasive infection, indicating that Mn sensing and gene regulation by MtsR are critical processes during S. pyogenes infection.",Structural and functional imaging of large and opaque plant specimens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188449,Journal of experimental botany,2019 06 12,"Three- and four-dimensional imaging techniques are a prerequisite for spatially resolving the form-structure-function relationships in plants.

Developmental exposure produces changes in behavior and gene expression in brain. Here we examined social recognition behaviors in mice, three generations (F3) after exposure to gestational BPA. Second generation mice were bred in one of four mating combinations to reveal whether characteristics in F3 were acquired via maternal or paternal exposures. After repeated habituation to the same mouse, offspring of dams from the BPA-lineage failed to display increased investigation of a novel mouse. Genes involved in excitatory post-synaptic densities (PSD) were examined in F3 brains using qPCR. Differential expression of genes important for function and stability of PSDs were assessed at three developmental ages. Several related PSD genes - SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 1 (Shank1), Homer scaffolding protein 1c (Homer1c), DLG associated protein 1 (Gkap), and discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (PSD95) - were differentially expressed in control- versus BPA-lineage brains. Using a second strain of F3 inbred mice exposed to BPA, we noted the same differences in Shank1 and PSD95 expression found in C57BL/6J mice. In sum, transgenerational BPA exposure disrupted social interactions in mice and dysregulated normal expression of PSD genes during neural development. The fact that the same genetic effects were found in two different mouse strains and in several brain regions, increased potential for translation. The genetic and functional relationship between PSD and abnormal neurobehavioral disorders is well established and our data suggest that BPA may contribute, in a transgenerational manner, to neurodevelopmental diseases.",Thrombolytic Salvage of Threatened Frostbitten Extremities and Digits: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188429,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2019 06 12,"Frostbite is a cold injury that results in soft tissue loss and can lead to amputation. Vascular thrombosis following injury causes ischemic tissue damage.  Despite understanding the pathology, its treatment has remained largely unchanged for over 30 years.

In addition, activation of the GnRH receptor regulates transcription and translation of multiple factors that regulate the signaling response and synthesis of gonadotropins. GnRH stimulation results in a broad redistribution of mRNA between active and inactive polyribosomes within the cell, but the mechanism of redistribution is not known. The RNA-binding protein ELAVL1 binds to AU-rich elements in mRNA and is one of the most abundant mRNA-binding proteins in eukaryotic cells. It is known to serve as a core component of RNA-binding complexes that direct the fate of mRNA. In LβT2 gonadotropes, we show that ELAVL1 binds to multiple mRNAs encoding factors which are crucial for gonadotropin synthesis and release. Association with some mRNAs is GnRH-sensitive but does not correlate with abundance of binding. We also show MAP Kinase-dependent changes in intracellular localization of ELAVL1 in response to GnRH stimulation. Knockdown of ELAVL1 gene expression results in reduced Lhb and Gnrhr mRNA levels, reduced cell surface expression of GnRHR, and reduced LH secretion in response to GnRH stimulation. Overall, these observations support the role of ELAVL1 in GnRH receptor-mediated regulation of gene expression and LH secretion but also indicate that other factors may contribute to the precise fate of mRNA in response to GnRH stimulation of gonadotropes.",Apamin Improves Prefrontal Nicotinic Impairment in Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188425,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2019 06 12,"Disruption of attention is an early and disabling symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood and treatment options for patients are limited. These early attention deficits are evident in the TgCRND8 mouse, a well-established murine model of AD that recapitulates several features of the disease. Here, we report severe impairment of the nicotinic receptor-mediated excitation of prefrontal attentional circuitry in TgCRND8 mice relative to wild-type littermate controls. We demonstrate that this impairment can be remedied by apamin, a bee venom neurotoxin peptide that acts as a selective antagonist to the SK family of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. We probe this seeming upregulation of calcium-sensitive inhibition and find that the attenuated nicotinic firing rates in TgCRND8 attention circuits are mediated neither by greater cellular calcium signals nor by elevated SK channel expression. Instead, we find that TgCRND8 mice show enhanced functional coupling of nicotinic calcium signals to inhibition. This SK-mediated inhibition exerts a powerful negative feedback on nicotinic excitation, dampening attention-relevant signaling in the TgCRND8 brain. These mechanistic findings identify a new cellular target involved in the modulation of attention and a novel therapeutic target for early attention deficits in AD.",Dengue infection complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Experiences from 180 severe dengue patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188423,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 06 12,"Globally approximately 500,000 people with severe dengue (SD) require hospitalization yearly; about 12,500 (2.5%) die.

Herein, we propose a novel Mg-induction strategy, which is low cost and efficiently generates BNNTs by separating Mg from diverse boron sources (B2O3, H3BO3, borates, and so on). After careful analysis and discussion of the prepared BNNTs, the corresponding in situ generation of MgB2, an effective catalyst for the growth of BNNTs, was proposed and verified. This contribution will provide a low-cost, highly efficient and large-scale method for the preparation of BNNTs with the CVD method. The prepared BNNTs can be widely used in thermal interface materials, as demonstrated by the high thermal conductivity of the poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) composite filled with these BNNTs. Therefore, our work offers a new strategy that is low cost and highly efficient for large-scale fabrication of BNNTs, and demonstrates that the prepared BNNTs have great potential applications in thermal interface materials.",Miniaturized nanohole array based plasmonic sensor for the detection of acetone and ethanol with insights into the kinetics of adsorptive plasmonic sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188375,Nanoscale,2019 06 12,"The present work demonstrates development of a miniaturized plasmonic platform comprised of a Au nanohole array (NHA) on a Si/Si3N4 substrate. Plasmonic responses of the NHA platform, which is coated with Cu-benzenetricarboxylate metal organic framework (MOF), are found to be promising even towards 500 nmol mol-1 (ppb) of acetone or ethanol vapors at room temperature. The sensing characteristics are further investigated by varying the operating temperature (296 K to 318 K) of the sensor and the concentrations of vapors (500 nmol mol-1 to 320 μmol mol-1). The plasmonic responses for the sensors are correlated with the adsorption of vapors on the MOF surface and modeled in accordance to Langmuir-type adsorption. Kinetic parameters are estimated for the adsorption of fixed concentrations of acetone and ethanol vapors within the studied operating temperature range. The linear variation of characteristic response time constants with the operating temperature provides Arrhenius activation energies for the adsorption of acetone and ethanol vapors. The comparatively lower activation energy estimated for the adsorption of ethanol results in faster and more sensitive response of the sensor towards that analyte. The plasmonic sensor for the detection of nmol mol-1 level acetone and ethanol vapors at room temperature along with the kinetic correlation on plasmonic response with the adsorption of the analytes described herein offer new insights to existing reports on surface modification and plasmonic detection.",Size distribution of airborne particle-bound PAHs and o-PAHs and their implications for dry deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188374,Environmental science. Processes & impacts,2019 06 13,"The present study was conducted to examine the potential mechanisms responsible for the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their oxygenated derivatives (o-PAHs) in size fractionated particles and their environmental implications. Size-fractionated atmospheric particles were collected at urban Shanghai, China and analyzed for 5 PAHs and 6 o-PAHs. The concentrations of particle-bound ∑6o-PAHs (sum of 6 o-PAH congeners, 19.1 ± 4.5 ng m-3) were significantly higher than those of ∑5PAHs (sum of 5 PAHs, 9.5 ± 1.9 ng m-3). The size-fractionated distributions of airborne ∑5PAHs and ∑6o-PAHs displayed bimodal peaks at 0.7-1.1 and 9.0-10.0 μm. Emission sources and volatility were important factors influencing the size distribution of particle-bound 5 PAHs and 6 o-PAHs. The dry deposition fluxes of particle-bound 6 o-PAHs estimated from the measured data (3087 ± 467 ng m-2 d-1) were approximately 2 times higher than those of PAHs (1531 ± 344 ng m-2 d-1), with a total deposition flux of 4618 ± 743 ng m-2 d-1. The relative contributions of particles to dry deposition were also size-dependent, e.g., coarse (aerodynamic diameters (Dp) > 2.1 μm) particles dominated the dry deposition fluxes of PAHs and o-PAHs. These results highlight the significance of providing a comprehensive understanding of particle size distribution of PAHs and o-PAHs and their implication for dry deposition in China.",Color tunable room temperature phosphorescent carbon dot based nanocomposites obtainable from multiple carbon sources via a molten salt method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188373,Nanoscale,2019 06 12,"A molten salt (MS) method is designed for the preparation of carbon dot-based room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. Carbon dots (CDs) are in situ formed and confined in inorganic salts during the recrystallization process. The composite materials CDs@MS and their RTP were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and low temperature (77 K) fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy. The as-prepared CDs@MS exhibits long lifetime RTP (up to 886 ms) and excitation dependent phosphorescence, i.e., the emission can be facilely tuned from 510 nm to 573 nm (green to yellow color) by changing the excitation wavelength. The RTP phenomenon is ascribed to the fact that the crystallization of molten salts forms a rigid structure, which preserves the triplet state of CDs and suppresses the nonradiative transition. It was found that the high charge density of metal ions plays a critical role in reducing the energy gap for realizing effective intersystem crossing. CD-based RTP materials with yellow phosphorescent emission are achieved from a variety of carbon sources and a gram-scale synthetic method. The excitation dependent RTP feature of CDs@MS nanocomposites could provide a novel dual security protection strategy in high-level information anticounterfeiting.",Amphiphilic surface chemistry of fullerenols is necessary for inhibiting the amyloid aggregation of alpha-synuclein NACore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188372,Nanoscale,2019 06 14,"Featuring small sizes, caged structures, low cytotoxicity and the capability to cross biological barriers, fullerene hydroxy derivatives named fullerenols have been explored as nanomedicinal candidates for amyloid inhibition. Understanding the surface chemistry effect of hydroxylation extents and the corresponding amyloid inhibition mechanisms is necessary for enabling applications of fullerenols and also future designs of nanomedicines in mitigating amyloid aggregation. Here, we investigated effects of C60(OH)n with n = 0-40 on the aggregation of NACore (the amyloidogenic core region of the non-amyloid-β component in α-synuclein), the amyloidogenic core of α-synuclein, by computational simulations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence kinetics and viability assays. Computationally, NACore assembled into cross-β aggregates via intermediates including β-barrels, which are postulated as toxic oligomers of amyloid aggregation. Hydrophobic C60 preferred to self-assemble, and NACore bound to the surface of C60 nano-clusters formed β-sheet rich aggregates - i.e., having little inhibition effect. Amphiphilic C60(OH)n with n = 4-20 displayed significant inhibition effects on NACore aggregation, where hydrogen bonding between hydroxyls and peptide backbones interrupted the formation of β-sheets between peptides adsorbed onto the surfaces of fullerenols or fullerenol nano-assemblies due to hydrophobic interactions. Thus, both cross-β aggregates and β-barrel intermediates were significantly suppressed. With hydroxyls increased to 40, fullerenols became highly hydrophilic with reduced peptide binding and thus an inhibition effect on amyloid aggregation. ThT, FTIR and TEM characterization of C60(OH)n with n = 0, 24, & 40 confirmed the computational predictions. Our results and others underscore the importance of amphiphilic surface chemistry and the capability of polar groups in forming hydrogen bonds with peptide backbones to render amyloid inhibition, offering a new insight for de-novo design of anti-amyloid inhibitors.",Ambient electrochemical N2 reduction to NH3 under alkaline conditions enabled by a layered K2Ti4O9 nanobelt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188371,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 12,"Using electrocatalytic N2 reduction to make NH3 is considered to be an attractive environmentally-friendly alternative to the Haber-Bosch process, which is rather energy-intensive and has heavy CO2 emissions.

To develop SCs with high energy densities, Fe3+ modified V2O5@GQDs (m-V2O5@GQDs) and ZIF-67-derived nanoporous carbon loaded with Mn3O4 (C/N-Mn3O4) were synthesized. After their detailed characterization using electron microscopy, X-ray methods and electrochemical techniques, they were further utilized as the anode and the cathode, respectively, to construct asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The as-synthesized m-V2O5@GQDs improve the poor conductivity of V2O5, contributing greatly to a specific capacitance of 761 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1. With application of a cell voltage of 2 V, an energy density of up to 99.4 W h kg-1 is achieved at a power density of 1000 W kg-1. Such ASCs also exhibit outstanding cycling performance (95% of initial capacitance even after 10 000 charging/discharging cycles).

A syringe-pump injected small volumes of Cu(i)/L activator/monomer solution directly into the bottom of the setup while ATRP at the frontal initiator-substrate was simultaneously initiated. The trace amount of injection solution locally confined polymerization to occur only on areas in contact with the solution which resulted in the spontaneous formation of gradient structures. A surface-attached polymer gradient was regulated via either the solution injection rate or monomer/catalysis concentration, thereby yielding a controllable gradient with uniformly grafted polymers."

A lack of health care provider education and comfort with transgender medicine further challenges the ability of this population to obtain competent, gender-affirming medical care. As with all patients, a thorough patient history with avoidance of assumptions of sexual orientation based on gender identity is integral to providing appropriate care for transgender individuals. Vaginal bleeding in transgender men should be evaluated in a similar manner to natal women, and with knowledge of the individual's present reproductive organs. The majority of transgender men receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy will have cessation of menses by 6 months of continuous use; thus, bleeding beyond this interval warrants measurement of hormone levels and further evaluation. Progesterone-only contraceptive methods including progesterone-only pills, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or a levonorgestrel intrauterine device can be used in transgender men and nonbinary patients with continued menses despite physiologic testosterone levels, or to act as a bridge method for menstrual cessation at the time of testosterone initiation. For bleeding refractory to progesterone methods, health care providers should discuss surgical options or the use of aromatase inhibitors with their patients. Counseling on fertility desires and family planning is integral to improving the reproductive care of transgender patients. Contraceptive counseling for transgender patients should include not only the efficacy and ease of use of available methods, but also discussion of advantages and disadvantages of contraceptive options with regard to the patient's gender identity.",Prognostic Performance of the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Cervical Cancer Staging Guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188324,Obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 12,To examine the prognostic performance of the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) cervical cancer staging schema.,Intrauterine Foley Balloon Catheter to Manage Acute Heavy Menstrual Bleeding in a Perimenarchal 10-Year-Old Girl.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188323,Obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 12,Intrauterine balloon tamponade is commonly used to treat postpartum hemorrhage refractory to pharmacologic interventions.

Solutions overcoming the unique challenges associated with imaging the human torso are reviewed as are current studies capitalizing on the benefits of UHF in several anatomies and applications. As the field progresses, strategies associated with the RF system architecture, calibration methods, RF pulse optimization, and power monitoring need to be further integrated into the MRI systems making what are currently complex processes more streamlined. Meanwhile, the UHF MRI community must seize the opportunity to build upon what have been so far proof of principle and feasibility studies and begin to further explore the true impact in both research and the clinic.",A randomized controlled trial testing a virtual perspective-taking intervention to reduce race and SES disparities in pain care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188269,Pain,2019 06 12,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial of an individually-tailored, virtual perspective-taking intervention to reduce race and socioeconomic (SES) disparities in providers' pain treatment decisions. Physician residents and fellows (n=436) were recruited from across the United States for this two-part online study. Providers first completed a bias assessment task in which they made treatment decisions for virtual patients with chronic pain who varied by race (Black/White) and SES (low/high). Providers who demonstrated a treatment bias were randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of personalized feedback about their bias, real-time dynamic interactions with virtual patients, and videos depicting how pain impacts the patients' lives. Treatment bias was re-assessed one week later. Compared to the control group, providers who received the tailored intervention had 85% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against Black patients and 76% lower odds of demonstrating a treatment bias against low SES patients at follow-up. Providers who received the intervention for racial bias also showed increased compassion for patients compared to providers in the control condition. Group differences did not emerge for provider comfort in treating patients. Results suggest an online intervention that is tailored to providers according to their individual treatment biases, delivers feedback about these biases, and provides opportunities for increased contact with Black and low SES patients, can produce substantial changes in providers' treatment decisions, resulting in more equitable pain care. Future studies should examine how these effects translate to real-world patient care, and the optimal timing/dose of the intervention.","A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of the influence of the HCN channel blocker ivabradine in a healthy volunteer pain model: an enriched population trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188268,Pain,2019 06 12,"Preclinical studies suggest that type 2 hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (HCN2) are necessary for neuropathic pain. This trial assessed the influence of ivabradine, a non-selective HCN channel blocker, on capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and pain in healthy human subjects. An enriched population comprising subjects who developed >20cm2 of punctate hyperalgesia from topical capsaicin (0.5% cream applied onto 9cm2 area) was identified. These subjects then received ivabradine (15mg) or placebo one hour prior to capsaicin application in randomly allocated order in a crossover study. The forearm site for capsaicin alternated with each application of the cream. The interval of time from screening to the 1st and to the 2nd treatment visits were at least 3 and 5 weeks respectively to minimize carry-over effects. 55 participants were screened, of which 25 completed at least one treatment visit. Intention-to-treat hierarchical analysis revealed no significant effects of the drug on primary trial outcome, defined as a difference in effects of placebo and ivabradine on the area of punctate hyperalgesia (ivabradine - placebo: mean=3.22 cm2, 95% CI: = -4.04, 10.48, p=0.37). However, ivabradine caused a slowing of heart rate (difference of 10.10 beats per min (95% CI - 6.48, - 13.73; p-value <0.0001)). We conclude that ivabradine lacks analgesic effects in the capsaicin pain model at a dose that caused appreciable slowing of heart rate, and hence is unlikely to prove a useful analgesic in humans. More selective drugs are required to establish a role of HCN2 for pain in humans.",Assessing pain in critically ill brain-injured patients: a psychometric comparison of three pain scales and videopupillometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188267,Pain,2019 06 12,"Three clinical scales (the Nociception-Coma-Scale adapted for Intubated-patients (NCS-I), its Revised version (NCS-R-I), and the Behavioral-Pain-Scale (BPS)) and videopupillometry were compared for measuring pain in intubated, non-communicating, critically ill, brain-injured (CIBI) patients. Pain assessment was performed before, during, just after and 5-min after three procedures: the reference non-nociceptive procedure (assessment of the Richmond-Agitation-Sedation-Scale), and two nociceptive procedures (turning and tracheal-suctioning). The primary-endpoint was construct validity (discriminant and criterion validation), determined by comparing pain measurements between different times/procedures. Secondary-endpoints were internal consistency, interrater reliability and feasibility. Fifty patients (54% women, median age 63-yr [56-68]) were included 13 [7-24] days after brain-injury (76% hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes). All tools increased significantly more (p<0.001) during the nociceptive procedures versus the non-nociceptive procedure. The BPS was the only pain tool that did not increase significantly during the non-nociceptive procedure (p=0.41), suggesting that it was the most discriminant tool. BPS, NCS-I and NCS-R-I were good predictors of nociception with areas-under-thecurves (AUC) ≥0.96, contrary to videopupillometry (AUC=0.67). The BPS, NCS-I and NCS-I-R had high interrater reliabilities (weighted-kappa=0.86, 0.82 and 0.84, respectively). Internal consistency was moderate (>0.60) for all pain-scales. Factor-analysis represented a majority of information on a first dimension, with motor domains represented on a second dimension. Scale feasibility was better for NCS-I and NCS-R-I than for BPS. In conclusion, BPS, NCS-I and NCS-R-I are valid, reliable and acceptable pain-scales for use in intubated CIBI patients, unlike videopupillometry. Future research requires tool design centered on domains of observation adapted to this very specific population.",Family history of pain and risk of musculoskeletal pain in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188266,Pain,2019 06 12,"Emerging evidence suggests that MSK should be viewed from a biopsychosocial perspective and consider the influence of family factors. We conducted a review with meta-analysis to provide summary estimates of effect of family history of pain on childhood MSK pain, and explore whether specific family pain factors influence the strength of the association (PROSPERO CRD42018090130). Included studies reported associations between family history of pain and non-specific MSK pain in children (age <19 years). The outcome of interest was MSK pain in children. We assessed the methodological quality using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies instrument, and quality of evidence for the main analyses using the GRADE criteria. After screening of 7281 titles; six longitudinal and 23 cross-sectional studies were included. Moderate quality evidence from five longitudinal studies (n=42131) showed that children with family history of MSK pain had 58% increased odds of experiencing MSK pain themselves (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.09). Moderate quality evidence from 18 cross-sectional studies (n=17274) supported this finding (OR 2.02, 95% 1.69 to 2.42). Subgroup analyses showed that the relationship was robust regardless of whether a child's mother, father or sibling experienced pain. Odds were higher when both parents reported pain compared to one [(mother OR=1.61; father OR=1.59); both parents OR=2.0]. Our findings show moderate quality evidence that children with a family history of pain are at higher risk of experiencing MSK pain. Understanding the mechanism by which this occurs\ would inform prevention and treatment efforts.",TGF-β Pathway Inhibition Protectsthe Diaphragm From Sepsis-Induced Wasting and Weakness in Rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188263,"Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",2019 06 12,"Sepsis is a frequent complication in patients in intensive care units (ICU). Diaphragm weakness,one of the most common symptoms observed, can lead to weaning problemsduring mechanical ventilation. Over the last couple of years, members of thetransforming growth factor (TGF) β family,such as myostatin, activin A and TGF-β1,have beenreported to strongly trigger the activation of protein breakdown involved in muscle wasting. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TGF-βinhibitorLY364947on the diaphragm during chronic sepsis.Rats were separated into four groups exposed to different experimental conditions: (i) Control group, (ii) Septic group, (iii) Septic group with inhibitor from day 0 (LY D0), and (iv) Septic group with inhibitor from day 1 (LY D1). Sepsis was induced in ratsby cecal ligation and puncture, and carried out for seven days.Chronic sepsis was responsible for a decrease inbody weight, food intake anddiaphragm's mass. The inhibitor was able to abolish diaphragm wasting only in the LY D1 group. Similarly, LY364947 had a beneficial effect on the diaphragm contraction only for the LY D1 group. SMAD3 was over-expressed and phosphorylated within rats in the Septic group;however this effect was reversed by LY364947. Calpain-1 and -2 as well as MAFbx were over-expressedwithin individuals in theSeptic group. Yet, calpain-1 and MAFbx expressions were decreased by LY364947With this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the inhibition of TGF-β pathway during chronic sepsisprotects the diaphragm from wasting and weaknessas early asone day post infection. This could lead to more efficient treatment and care for septic patients in ICU.",The Predictive Value of the Clinical Frailty Scale on Discharge Destination and Complications in Older Hip Fracture Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188261,Journal of orthopaedic trauma,2019 06 12,"To determine if the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), a validated frailty tool, was associated with discharge destination.

Nine of patients have had composite reconstruction (CR). The DAOR has been needed for 23 of patients.The follow-up period has been 2 months to 3 years. The authors have obtained satisfactory results in 24 cases but some untoward progress in 8 cases. A questionnaire was prepared and asked all patients for the assessment of the satisfaction from appearance, breathing, self-esteem, and positive psychological effect.The learning curve for rhinoplasty should be calculated for, hump reduction, crooked nose, augmentation rhinoplasty, and so on. separately which is also relevant for the use of a DC-F graft. Placing the DC-F over a straight platform, choosing the accurate graft and fascia material wisely, proper tailoring of DC-F, sliding it under the skin-superficial musculoaponeurotic system properly etc. determine the quality of the end result and the degree of PS. Operating on the DAOR are relatively more comfortable compared to CRs but responses to our questionnaire denote higher degrees of satisfaction in CR cases.Utilization of the DC-F graft in secondary rhinoplasties for dorsum augmentation provides satisfactory results.

To analyze the clinical characteristics and microsurgery treatment of anterior cranial fossa DAVFs, a retrospective review of 21 patients with anterior cranial fossa DAVFs undergoing microsurgery was performed, including 8 bleeding patients and 13 non-bleeding patients. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) scores were used to evaluate the conscious states of 8 bleeding patients before and after operation. All patients had no obvious complications and the clinical symptoms were improved after operation. No abnormal fistulas and drainage veins were detected by digital subtraction angiography postoperatively. The GCS scores of 8 bleeding patients showed that the conscious states became better than pre-operation. Of the 21 patients, 9 patients were followed up without recurrence.

Our previous study found that platelet surface glycosylation is altered in coronary heart disease. In this study, we further investigated whether altered glycosylation affects platelet function. Platelets were obtained from ten healthy volunteers. The platelet surface terminal sialic acid was removed by neuraminidase A, and N-linked oligosaccharides was removed by PNGase F. The function of the enzyme-treated platelet was measured. The activation and platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor (vWF) was measured by flow cytometry. Platelet aggregation induced by ADP, arachidonic acid and collagen was detected through light transmission aggregometry, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) was detected by flow cytometry. Neuraminidase A treatment caused sialic acid level decrease and β-galactose level increase significantly on platelet surface. Activation marker CD62P did not change. Platelet adhesion to vWF was increased significantly (P < 0.05). ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Platelet-granulocytes aggregates and platelet-monocytes aggregates increased (P < 0.05). Platelet surface sialic acid was increased after PNGase F treatment. Platelet aggregation by all agonists were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). There is no difference in the binding of vWF and PLAs for PNGase F treated platelet. We demonstrated that asialoglycosylation enhances platelet binding to vWF and forming PLAs, suggest that it may be associated with high platelet reactivity and the increased risk of thrombosis.",An Unusual Presentation of Pyemotes ventricosus Dermatitis Presenting With Umbilicated Papules Mimicking Poxvirus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188143,The American Journal of dermatopathology,2019 06 12,"Pyemotes ventricosus mites are an uncommon cause of pruritic dermatitis seen most commonly in occupational exposure, prominently found in professionals such as farmers, landscapers, and factory workers who work with grains, wheat, dried beans, or grasses. The clinical description of the rash has typically been described as papular, erythematous, with a central vesicular lesion. We describe a case of Pyemotes dermatitis with an atypical clinical presentation. A 30-year-old man presented with pruritic, umbilicated papules, which involved his right lateral trunk and upper thigh leading to the submitted clinical impression of molloscum contagiosum. A biopsy of the skin was taken, and fragments of arthropod consistent with P. ventricosus were identified within umbilicated indentations of skin.

Neurotropin, an extract from the inflamed skin of rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus, has been used for pain relief. Decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain is one of the proposed mechanisms for the major depressive disorders, and Neurotropin has been reported to restore the decreased BDNF in the hippocampus. In this experiment, we examined whether Neurotropin had an antidepressant-like effect in a model of fibromyalgia and whether BDNF in the brain was altered after repeated cold stress (RCS) and Neurotropin treatment. Rats were exposed to RCS because these animals have been used as a model for fibromyalgia syndrome. Depression-like behavior was evaluated using elongation of immobility time in a forced swimming test. Change in expression of BDNF in the brain was also examined by western blot analysis of several brain areas. Depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test was significantly increased 10-14 days after RCS, and this increase was reversed by a single injection of an antidepressant, imipramine, but not by PBS. Increased depression-like behavior was also dose-dependently suppressed by a single administration of Neurotropin (50-200 NU/kg, subcutaneously). BDNF expression was not changed in the brain areas examined (hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and striatum) either after RCS or by Neurotropin injected after RCS. These results suggest that RCS induced a depression-like state in rats, and Neurotropin reversed this state. However, we did not observe a BDNF-related mechanism for these effects.",First report of ranavirus mortality in a common snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188138,Diseases of aquatic organisms,2019 06 12,"An adult male snapping turtle with marked palpebral edema and multifocal skin ulceration was found alive in a marsh in southern Ontario in summer 2017. The turtle was transported to a rehabilitation facility and died 4 d after arrival. The carcass was submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative for post-mortem examination. Gross lesions included ulcerative conjunctivitis, necrotizing stomatitis, and splenomegaly. Microscopically, this corresponded to multisystemic fibrinonecrotizing vasculitis and severe fibrinous splenic necrosis. Liver tissue tested positive for frog virus 3-like ranavirus and negative for herpesvirus via polymerase chain reaction. The gross and microscopic lesions were consistent with previous reports of ranavirus infection in turtles and were severe enough to have been the cause of death in this case. This is the first report of morbidity and mortality in a common snapping turtle with a ranavirus infection, and the first reported case of ranavirus infection in a reptile in Canada.

Unlike previous outbreaks occurring in the Mediterranean Sea in 2011 and 2013, we observed typical pathological changes suggestive of morbilliviral infection in an acute/subacute phase and immunohistochemical reactivity. The same findings were observed in 13 other specimens beached along the Italian coastline during 2016 with no temporal and geographical relationship with the ongoing epidemic outbreak. Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis showed that DMV sequences detected in Italy in 2016 clustered with those identified in Portugal and Galicia (Spain), representing a novel DMV strain of Atlantic origin which entered the Mediterranean Sea and affected a naïve striped dolphin population. DMV sequences detected in the previous Mediterranean outbreaks exhibited a marked genetic relatedness and diverged from those detected in cetaceans stranded along the Galician and Portuguese coasts since 2007.",Taillessness and skeletal deformity in striped piggy Pomadasys stridens (Osteichthyes: Haemulidae) from the Persian Gulf.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188136,Diseases of aquatic organisms,2019 06 12,"Taillessness (absence of the caudal fin and some of the caudal peduncle) and skeletal deformity is described in 2 striped piggy Pomadasys stridens (Haemulidae) specimens collected from the Persian Gulf along the coast of Hormuz Island, Iran.

Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 06 12,"Objective: The prevalence of depression and anxiety is increasing worldwide. Diet as a modifiable factor for mental health has received great attention. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of vitamin B6 intake with depression and anxiety. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed among 3362 adults in 2011. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using an Iranian validated version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Dietary intakes were evaluated by a validated 106 item self-administered Willett-format dish-based semi quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (DFQ). Results: The mean intake of vitamin B6 (mg/day) was significantly lower in anxious (1.93 ± 0.74 vs. 2.0 ± 0.74; P = 0.02) and depressed (1.86 ± 0.72 vs. 1.99 ± 0.74; P = 0.001) people than healthy participants.

Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung. Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 06 12,"Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282) has been associated with metabolic syndrome components in some studies. Moreover, the PPARγ gene may mediate the physiological response to dietary fat intake in a ligand-dependent manner. Methods: Metabolic syndrome components (body mass index, waist circumference, and lipid profile) were determined in 290 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in a cross-sectional study. DNA genotyping for determining PPARγ Pro12Ala polymorphism was conducted using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism method. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the participants' dietary intakes in the previous year. Results: There were significant differences between the two genotype groups of PPARγ Pro12Ala polymorphism, Ala carriers (Pro/Ala + Ala/Ala) versus non-Ala carriers (Pro/Pro), in terms of mean body mass index (p = 0.04) and waist circumference (p = 0.02). Below the median percentage of energy from monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, Ala carriers had a higher body mass index (p = 0.01) compared to non-Ala carriers. Furthermore, a significant interaction between this single-nucleotide polymorphism and polyunsaturated fatty acids intake on serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.01) was seen, and in higher polyunsaturated fatty acids intake (≥ median) Ala carriers had lower triglyceride levels than non-Ala carriers (p = 0.007). Conclusions: The findings of the current study support a significant association between PPARγ Pro12Ala polymorphism and metabolic syndrome components, and they suggest that this polymorphism can modulate the biological response of dietary fat intake on body mass index and triglyceride levels.",Polyketide Synthase Plays a Conserved Role in Otolith Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188077,Zebrafish,2019 06 12,"Otoliths (ear stones) are biomineralized complexes essential for the balancing and hearing function of the inner ears in fish. Their formation is controlled by a genetically programmed biological process that is yet to be defined. We have isolated and characterized a spontaneous genetic mutant zebrafish with a complete absence of otoliths, named no otolith 1 (not1). not1 mutants are unable to develop otoliths during embryonic stages and fail to respond to acoustic stimuli, indicating an inner ear defect. We identified a deleterious mutation (G239R) that altered a highly conserved amino acid residue in the zebrafish ortholog of type I polyketide synthase (pks1) to underlie these phenotypes and showed that expression of the polyketide synthase gene of Japanese medaka fish could rescue the otolith deficiency in not1 mutant zebrafish. Our finding highlights a critical and conserved role of type I polyketide synthase in the initiation of otolith formation. Given the functional homology between otoliths in teleost fish and otoconia in mammals and humans, not1 mutants provide a new animal model for the study of human otoconia-related diseases.",Role of the Innate Cytokine Storm Induced by the Influenza A Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188076,Viral immunology,2019 06 12,"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be classified into dozens of subtypes based on their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. To date, 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes of IAVs that spread in animals and humans have been found. Following infection, the IAV first induces the innate immune system, which can rapidly recruit innate immune cells and cytokines to the site of infection. Influenza-induced cytokine storms have been associated with uncontrolled proinflammatory responses, which may lead to significant immunopathy and severe disease. Cytokine storms are complicated by several types of cytokines and chemokines that have various activities. In addition to their direct effects, their crossregulation causes cytokine networks to form; these networks determine the outcome of viral infections. In this review, we focus on cytokine storms and their signaling pathways that are triggered by the different subtypes of IAV.",How will this help me?

To attain the 50 Million Strong by 2029 goal, it is vital to acknowledge that physical education is a social justice issue. Without consideration of the historical, political, and social contexts that permeate and frame physical education, along with the social identities and lived experiences of our future teachers and students, it is unlikely that this goal will be sustained. While concerns have been voiced relative to the standards-based teaching movement, in a country that espouses standards-based education, a first step in moving any educational reform forward is to formalize its inclusion in the national standards that serve to guide our discipline. A philosophical shift may be what is needed for change to occur regarding social justice education in an attempt to enhance the learning opportunities for all students. A forward step in creating this change is to address the research and pedagogical practices of our current physical education teacher education and K-12 programs, along with the physical education standards and policies at the national and state levels.

The recognition of P. brassicae by host plants is thought to occur at the primary infection stage, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Secretory proteins, as effector candidates, play critical roles in the recognition of pathogens and in the interactions between pathogens and hosts. In this study, thirty-three P. brassicae secretory proteins expressed during primary infection were identified through transcriptome, secretory protein prediction and yeast signal sequence trap analyses. Furthermore, the proteins that could suppress or induce cell death were screened through an Agrobacterium-mediated plant virus transient expression system and a protoplast transient expression system. Two secretory proteins, PBCN_002550 and PBCN_005499, were found to be capable of inducing cell death associated with H2O2 accumulation and electrolyte leakage in Nicotiana benthamiana. Moreover, PBCN_002550 could also induce cell death in Chinese cabbage. In addition, twenty-four of the remaining thirty-one tested secretory proteins could suppress mouse Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)-induced cell death, and 28 proteins could suppress PBCN_002550-induced cell death."

Adaptive optics (AO) is an imaging technique that enables correction of over 90% of the optical aberrations of an individual eye induced primarily by the tear film, cornea and lens. The two major tasks of any AO system are to measure the optical imperfections of the eye and to then compensate for these aberrations to generate a corrected wavefront of reflected light from the eye. AO scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides a theoretical lateral resolution limit of 1.4 μm, allowing the study of microscopic features of the retinal vascular and neural tissue.

Background: E-cigarette use among adolescents and young adults has grown rapidly in recent years, yet little research has examined the beliefs that may underlie this behavior among nationally representative samples. Methods:N = 1,298 adolescents (13-17) and 2,219 young adults (18-25) were surveyed using a probability-based web panel. Participants completed a survey that included a new outcome expectancy measure examining 3 positive (enjoyment, social influences, advantage over cigarettes) and 2 negative (health concerns, smoker association) expectancy domains and ever having used e-cigarettes [ever use]. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a good fit of the outcome expectancies' factor structure to the data. All outcome expectancies were associated with e-cigarette use in both populations in univariate analyses. In multiple logistic regression models controlling for several covariates, higher expected enjoyment was positively associated with a greater likelihood of e-cigarette use (aOR = 2.10, p < .05) among adolescents. Among young adults, enjoyment (aOR = 3.08, p < .001) was positively associated with a greater likelihood of use while both health concerns (aOR = 0.70, p < .01) and smoker association (aOR = 0.73, p < .05) were negatively associated with e-cigarette use. Conclusions: This study suggests that expected enjoyment is robustly associated with e-cigarette use among both adolescents and young adults. Health concerns may also play a role in e-cigarette use. Implications for e-cigarette prevention efforts and future research directions are discussed.",C-Reactive Protein/Albumin Ratio Is an Independent Prognostic Predictor of Survival in Advanced Cancer Patients Receiving Palliative Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188054,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 06 12,"
Background:
 The C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio has been reported as a prognostic factor of survival for patients with a variety of cancers. However, its prognostic impact for advanced cancer patients receiving palliative care remains presently unknown. 
Objective:
 The present study assessed the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio, and compared this with that of the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI) in a cohort of advanced cancer patients receiving palliative therapy. 
Methods:
 The medical records of 262 eligible patients who died of advanced cancer from February 1, 2013 to December 30, 2017 in the palliative care unit of the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed for the analysis. 
Results:
 The present results revealed that a CRP/Alb ratio ≥1.31 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33 [1.78-3.05], p < 0.001) can predict poor prognosis through univariate analysis. In addition, the multivariate analysis revealed that CRP/Alb (HR, 2.09 [1.54-2.84], p < 0.001), GPS (HR, 1.81 [1.07-3.07], p < 0.001), and PPI (HR, 3.35 [2.25-4.99], p < 0.001) were all independent prognosis factors. To compare the discriminatory performance of the CRP/Alb ratio with that of other established prognostic indexes in palliative care settings, the c-statistics, integrated discriminatory improvement index, net reclassification index, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and it was demonstrated that the CRP/Alb ratio (c-statistics, 0.64 [0.61-0.68]) was able to discriminate advanced cancer patients with different survivals, with analogous discriminatory ability as GPS (c-statistics, 0.63 [0.59-0.66]) and PPI (c-statistics, 0.64 [0.60-0.68]). Notably, the combination of multiple prognostic indexes exerted higher discriminatory ability, compared with any single predictive index (c-statistics, 0.69 [0.66-0.73], p < 0.001). 
Conclusions:
 The present study suggests that the CRP/Alb ratio is a promising prognostic factor in predicting cancer patient survival in palliative care settings. Incorporating both objective parameters and the subjective index may improve the prediction accuracy of prognosis.","Gender Difference in Intraocular Pressure and Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome: A Community-Based Cohort Study in Matsu, Taiwan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188053,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,2019 06 12,"
Background:
 We aimed to assess the effect of intraocular pressure (IOP) on incident metabolic syndrome (MetS) using a longitudinal follow-up of screening cohort in contrast to most of previous studies addressing the association between both. 
Methods:
 The empirical data were derived from a community-based integrated screening program in Matsu during the period 2003 to 2010. A total of 1347 participants older than 30 years were enrolled in this study. With the enrollment of 1056 participants with MetS free at baseline, the cohort with IOP measurement in 2003 were followed up over time to identify incident MetS to elucidate the temporal sequence of both. 
Results:
 The statistically significant effect noted was that elevated IOP (≥15 mmHg vs. <15 mmHg) had 1.46-fold risk for developing incident MetS (adjusted relative ratio [aRR]: 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.99) for both sex combined, particularly in men (aRR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.13-2.45) but not in women. The finding that elevated IOP occurred before the presence of high blood pressure was noted in both men and women, whereas men with elevated IOP may be concomitant with more individual components (severity) of MetS earlier than women with elevated IOP. 
Conclusions:
 Elevated IOP leading to the risk for incident or severe MetS was noted in men but not in women. Evidence on this temporal sequence revealed the possibility of showing signs of elevated IOP before the development of MetS, which indicates the necessity of monitoring IOP in routine health check-up for prevention of MetS-related chronic diseases.",Current Stem-Cell Approaches for the Treatment of Inherited Retinal Degenerations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188052,Seminars in ophthalmology,2019 06 12,"Stem cells provide a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of multiple acquired and inherited retinal conditions. While to date, there have been numerous clinical trials examining the ability of stem cells to treat the geographic atrophy found in advanced non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration, fewer clinical trials have specifically examined stem-cell therapy for inherited retinal disease. Moreover, it remains to be seen if human stem cells will be able to regenerate the lost retinal cell populations that represent a final common pathway for most of the inherited retinal diseases, or if stem cells will secrete a neuroprotective paracrine factor that will delay progression of these diseases. Here, we will review a number of the current clinical trials, either completed or in process, that have been designed to specifically treat inherited retinal conditions. There was considerable initial concern that using human stem cells as therapeutic agents might have the potential to form benign tumors or trigger an immune response that would have deleterious effects on the patient's retina. Currently, the majority of the clinical trials reviewed share the conclusion that intraocular stem-cell approach is generally well tolerated and safe for patients. While there are some efficacy data that have been published for a few of the reviewed trials, none of the completed studies have been empowered to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy in humans.",Metabolic Syndrome Components and Long-Term Incidence of Cardiovascular Disease in Eastern Mediterranean Region: A 13-Year Population-Based Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188051,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,2019 06 12,"
Background:
 The risk of cardiovascular events in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) is higher than in general populations. We aimed at assessing the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and MetS and at identifying triple components that are the most predictive of future CVD events. 
Methods:
 Data on 1387 CVD-free individuals recruited in an ongoing cohort in Isfahan, Iran (ICS) were analyzed. This included serum tests and health and lifestyle questionnaires measured at baseline in 2001, 2007, and 2013. The association between CVD and MetS, irrespective of composing components, was evaluated by using logistic regression. The hazard ratio (HR) of CVD events after MetS diagnosis was calculated for different combinations by using Cox PH regression. 
Results:
 The prevalence of MetS was 34.4% at baseline, 19.5% of which was with diabetes. The prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure [BP]) and hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) increased over time. Irrespective of composing components, the odds of developing CVD in MetS individuals was higher than in those who did not develop MetS with adjusted odds ratio = 1.76; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.22-2.55. Among the five most prevalent triple combinations, there was a significant association between CVD incidence and high-density lipoprotein + BP + waist circumference combination only with HR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.04-2.67. 
Conclusion:
 Some MetS components are more likely to result in CVD. Identifying the most predictive components could help in the timely initiation of proper interventions rather than waiting for all MetS components or symptoms of CVD.",Robot-Assisted Thoracoscopic Mediastinal Parathyroidectomy: A Single Surgeon Case Series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188050,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A,2019 06 12,"
Objective:
 Minimally invasive (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) mediastinal parathyroidectomy has been described as a technique for surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism due to ectopic parathyroid adenoma. Herein, we present the largest cohort of patients (n = 8) treated with robot-assisted mediastinal parathyroidectomy and describe our technique for this procedure, pre- and intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes. 
Materials and Methods:
 A single surgeon, single institution case series of eight consecutive robot-assisted mediastinal parathyroidectomies performed from April 2013 to March 2018. Preoperative workup, intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. 
Results:
 Of the eight patients, seven were women. Average age was 54 years (range: 28-69) and average body mass index 33.6 (range: 24.8-42.9). Seven patients had a preoperative diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism with preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels (PTH: 137 (70-192); Ca2+: 10.9 (10.2-12), and one patient had preoperative diagnosis of thymoma. Preoperative imaging studies included computed tomography (CT)-sestamibi (n = 3), CT neck (n = 4), CT chest (n = 6), and neck ultrasound (n = 6). Intraoperative PTH measurements found >50% reduction in all cases. Average length of surgery was 108.6 minutes (range: 76-186); average blood loss 26 cc. All specimens were parathyroid adenomas, with an average size of 16 mm (range: 7-35 mm). Seven of eight patients were discharged on postoperative day 1. No complications or recurrences occurred at a median follow-up of 18.5 days (range: 15-1,066 days). 
Conclusions:
 Robot-assisted thoracoscopic parathyroidectomy is a safe and effective technique, with immediate improvement in PTH levels. Thorough clinical, biochemical, and radiologic preoperative workup assists in operative planning and may improve diagnostic accuracy of anterior mediastinal masses.","The interaction of immune checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer: subadditivity, additivity or synergism?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188048,Immunotherapy,2019 06 12,The hypothesis that the interaction of chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is synergistic has not been formally validated. The frontline ICI Phase II/III trials in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were reviewed for the objective response rates (ORRs) and grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) of ICI-chemotherapy combinations and those of each individual drug. The expected ORR and grade 3-5 AE of ICI-chemotherapy combinations were computed as the arithmetic sum of the pooled effects of each drug. Statistical pooling was performed using a double arcsine transformation and a random-effects model. Our findings suggest an enhanced effect that is less than additive for the ICI-chemotherapy combinations since the actual ORR and grade 3-5 AE were found to be less than the expected additive effect.,Anterior Segment Applications of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188047,Seminars in ophthalmology,2019 06 12,"Purpose: To review the current literature regarding optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) applications in the anterior segment. Methods: A literature search was performed for terms including OCT-Angiography, anterior segment, cornea, conjunctiva, iris, applications and use in ophthalmology. Results: Fifteen studies were identified, 14 in human subjects. Studies with OCT-A of the conjunctiva, episclera, cornea, and iris were identified, some with normal eyes imaged and others with various pathologies. Most of these studies imaged corneal neovascularization. Three studies described protocols used for image acquisition, one of which was referenced by two later papers. Conclusions: OCT-A is a noninvasive technology with recent applications in the anterior segment. Several pilot studies have been performed on various anterior segment structures and disease states however standardization of image acquisition techniques is still needed. Future imaging could allow noninvasive and serial monitoring of pathology as well as recurrence after therapeutic intervention."

To further our understanding of Hnf1b in the developing zebrafish kidney, we have performed RNA-Seq of proximal tubules from hnf1b-deficient larvae. This analysis revealed an enrichment of gene transcripts encoding transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, including multiple members of the slc2 and slc5 glucose transporters. An investigation of the expression of slc2a1a, slc2a2, slc5a2, as well as a poorly studied glucose/mannose transporter encoded by slc5a9, revealed that these genes undergo dynamic spatiotemporal changes during tubule formation and maturation. A comparative analysis of zebrafish SLC genes with those expressed in mouse proximal tubules showed a substantial overlap at the level of gene families, indicating a high degree of functional conservation between zebrafish and mammalian proximal tubules. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a role for Hnf1b as a critical determinant of proximal tubule transport function by acting upstream of a large number of SLC genes and validate the zebrafish as a physiologically relevant model of the mammalian proximal tubule.",Gene and microRNA Signatures Are Associated with the Development and Survival of Glioblastoma Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188028,DNA and cell biology,2019 06 12,"This study was aimed to identify hub genes associated with the development of glioblastoma (GBM) by conducting a bioinformatic analysis. The raw gene expression data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and The Cancer Genome Atlas project. After the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, the functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, molecular complex detection clusters, and transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA-target regulatory network were constructed, respectively. Furthermore, the survival analysis of prognostic outcomes and genes was analyzed. In addition, the expression of key genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. A total of 884 DEGs, including 418 upregulated and downregulated genes, were identified between GBM and normal samples. The PPI network comprised a set of 3418 pairs involving 751 nodes, and AKT1 and CDK2 were the critical genes in the network. A total of seven clusters were identified, the genes in which were intensively associated with cell cycle, cholinergic synapse, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that AKT1 and CDK2 were significantly upregulated, and NRXN3 and NPTX2 were significantly downregulated in GBM samples. The TF-miRNA-target regulatory networks were built, in which CCNB1, RFC5, microRNA524, and microRNA34b were key regulators. There were 43 genes, including NPTX2 and NRXN3, significantly related to the prognostic outcomes of GBM patients.

The transcriptome analysis showed 700 genes with significant differential expression in the affected skin as compared with normal skin. Pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of genes involved in tumor necrosis factor signaling, the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, platelet activation, and Huntington's disease. A gene network was constructed, and the hub nodes such as PTGS2, THBS1, COL1A1, FOS, and NOS3 were found through PPI network analysis, which may contributed to the unusual localized skin laxity in sika deer. Abnormal expression patterns of genes during the development of the affected sika deer were successfully uncovered in the present study, which provides a reference for revealing the related mechanism underlying cutis laxa in sika deer and human beings.",Pharmacogenetics of Metformin for Medication-Induced Weight Gain in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188026,Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,2019 06 12,"
Objectives:
 We recently found that metformin attenuated weight gain due to mixed dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonists, commonly termed atypical antipsychotics, in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies have found that genetic variation predicts response to metformin in diabetes. In this study, we aimed to assess whether response to metformin for weight gain in this population is associated with variants in five genes previously implicated in metformin response in diabetes. 
Methods:
 Youth with ASD who experienced significant weight gain while taking mixed receptor antagonist medications were randomly assigned to metformin or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by open-label metformin treatment for 16 weeks. In the 53 participants with available DNA samples, we used a linear, mixed model analysis to assess response in the first 16 weeks of metformin treatment, whether in the randomized or open-label period, based upon genotypes at polymorphisms in five genes previously associated with metformin response in diabetes: ATM, SLC2A2, MATE1, MATE2, and OCT1. 
Results:
 In the primary analysis, both ATM and OCT1 showed significant effects of genotype on change in body mass index z-scores, the primary outcome measure, during the first 16 weeks of treatment with metformin. No other polymorphism showed a significant difference. 
Conclusion:
 As has been shown for metformin treatment in diabetes, genetic variation may predict response to metformin for weight gain in youth with ASD treated with mixed receptor antagonists. Further work is needed to replicate these findings and evaluate whether they can be used prospectively to improve outcomes.",Psychometric Properties and Construct Validity of the Short Version of the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale in a Southern European Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188025,Journal of personality assessment,2019 06 12,"The Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-Short Form (SRP-SF) is a brief measure of psychopathy, developed via model-based test theory. The SRP-SF has a 4-factor structure with items reflecting affective, interpersonal, lifestyle, and antisocial domains, in line with the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), which can be aggregated to form the traditional F1 and F2 dimensions of psychopathy. Previous research indicates the SRP is a viable tool for examining the prevalence of psychopathic propensities and their correlates in nonoffender populations. Currently, a substantial amount of nonoffender research on psychopathy is conducted in North America. Here, we inspect the psychometric properties of the SRP-SF and probe its association with general personality and empathy in a large southern European (Portuguese) community sample. Consistent with previous studies, results indicated good fit for the 4-factor model, including for separate female and male subsamples, good internal consistency across its scales and subscales, and the predicted pattern of associations with the correlates of psychopathy.

Thousands of opioid-related cases with impending trial dates may stimulate opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to seek new deals to escape historic liability. Objectives: Against a backdrop of massive damage potential of a two decade opioid epidemic, reaching appropriate settlements is key. Parties to opioid lawsuits must balance an array of factors to assure industry accountability while preserving access to opioids among legitimate patients seeking palliative care. Methods: We examined major bases for opioid litigation across the U.S. Thousands of cases have been filed against opioid manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, and others. Hundreds of these cases are consolidated in a federal district court in Cleveland, Ohio where trials are scheduled as early as October 2019. Grounds for litigation are highly varied. Results: Multiple factors underlying responsible settlements include (1) a primary focus on contemporary treatment and prevention strategies supplemented by research innovations; (2) primary access to life-saving treatments for at-risk individuals; (3) fair and equitable allocation of settlement resources; (4) dedication to lawful, efficacious interventions; (5) cross-sharing of industry data and practices to promote good faith compliance; and (6) continued assurance of access to palliative care for deserving patients.

Thio induced cell death, and the combination of Thio and cisplatin led to the highest percentage of dead cells in four cells lines. Thio and the combined modality led to cell apoptosis by inducing G0/G1 arrest. The collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase 9, upregulation of Bax protein, and downregulation of Bcl-2 protein demonstrated that apoptosis was mitochondria dependent. These data indicated that Thio could be used to modulate cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimen in lung and ovary cancers.",Investing in Food Safety for Developing Countries: Opportunities and Challenges in Applying Whole-Genome Sequencing for Food Safety Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188022,Foodborne pathogens and disease,2019 06 12,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become a significant tool in investigating foodborne disease outbreaks and some countries have incorporated WGS into national food control systems. However, WGS poses technical challenges that deter developing countries from incorporating it into their food safety management system. A rapid scoping review was conducted, followed by a focus group session, to understand the current situation regarding the use of WGS for foodborne disease surveillance and food monitoring at the global level and identify key limiting factors for developing countries in adopting WGS for their food control systems. The results showed that some developed nations routinely use WGS in their food surveillance systems resulting in more precise understanding of the causes of outbreaks. In developing nations, knowledge of WGS exists in the academic/research sectors; however, there is limited understanding at the government level regarding the usefulness of WGS for food safety regulatory activities. Thus, incorporation of WGS is extremely limited in most developing nations. While some countries lack the capacity to collect and analyze the data generated from WGS, the most significant technical gap in most developing countries is in data interpretation using bioinformatics. The gaps in knowledge and capacities between developed and developing nations regarding use of WGS likely introduce an inequality in international food trade, and thus, relevant international organizations, as well as the countries that are already proficient in the use of WGS, have significant roles in assisting developing nations to be able to fully benefit from the technology and its applications in food safety management.",Exploration of Responsive Feeding During Breastfeeding Versus Bottle Feeding of Human Milk: A Within-Subject Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188021,Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,2019 06 12,"
Background:
 Responsive feeding promotes optimal feeding patterns and growth trajectories. Breastfeeding is thought to facilitate responsive feeding, but research to date has been limited to comparing formula-feeding and breastfeeding dyads. Using a within-subject approach, we aimed to assess maternal responsiveness to infant cues during two human milk feeding sessions differing by feeding modality (breastfeeding versus bottle feeding). 
Materials and Methods:
 Nine mother-infant dyads (infants ≤6 months) were recruited from the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, from April to May 2018. Two human milk-feeding sessions, directly from the breast and from a bottle, were video-recorded in participants' homes, then scored using the validated Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) Caregiver/Parent-Child Interaction Feeding Scale. The second half of feeding sessions were coded for infant satiation cues. 
Results:
 All women earned a college degree or higher, and were partnered. Mothers were aged mean ± standard deviation 33.2 ± 4.0 years; infants were 14.6 ± 6.9 weeks old and six (67%) were female. Mothers were more sensitive to infant cues during breastfeeding (NCAST Maternal Sensitivity to Cues sub-scale score, 15.0 ± 1.0) than bottle feeding (13.4 ± 1.6; p = 0.016). There was a significantly longer latency from feeding session midpoint to the first satiation cue during breastfeeding (minutes:seconds; 3:00 ± 1:53 versus 0:45 ± 1:18 bottle feeding, p = 0.038). There was no difference in the number of infant cues by feeding modality. 
Conclusions:
 Despite the small sample with high socioeconomic status, this pilot study highlights differences in maternal responsiveness to infant cues by feeding modality with human milk, which warrants further investigation.",Progressing from Recurring Tissue Injury to Genomic Instability: A New Mechanism of Neutrophil Pathogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188020,DNA and cell biology,2019 06 12,"Aberrant neutrophil (PMN) infiltration of the intestinal mucosa is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While the genotoxic function of PMNs and its implications in carcinogenesis have been primarily associated with oxidative stress, recent work by Butin-Israeli and colleagues has defined a novel mechanism where PMN-derived microparticles through the delivery and activity of specific miRNAs promoted formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), and in parallel, suppressed DSB repair through the downregulation of lamin B1 and Rad51. Respective downregulation of these two proteins compromised the nuclear envelope and high-fidelity repair by homologous recombination, increasing DSB accumulation and aneuploidy. This discovery defined a novel mode of action where PMN-mediated suppression of DSB repair leading to genomic instability in the injured mucosa may facilitate progression toward colorectal cancer."

The particle deposition is dependent on the internal flow dynamics, such as the capillary flow and Marangoni vortex (MV), of the droplet. Particle migration and self-assembly on a substrate are interesting phenomena that have critical implications in many applications such as inkjet printing, coating, and many other droplet-based industrial processes. In this work, we observed the formation of bands of particles in a rotating MV during the evaporation of a water droplet containing particles. We investigated the mechanism underlying the formation of banded MV caused by capillary meniscus forces between two particles near the air-liquid interface. In particular, we show that the banded MV can be manipulated by tuning the surfactant concentration and particle concentration. Our findings would provide a new direction in understanding the particle deposition pattern of a colloidal droplet.","Penerpenes A-D, Four Indole Terpenoids with Potent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Inhibitory Activity from the Marine-Derived Fungus Penicillium sp.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to HCC development and progression is highly desirable for improved surveillance, diagnosis and treatment. Liver tissue metabolomics has the potential to reflect the physiological changes behind HCC development. Also, it allows identification of candidate biomarkers for future evaluation in bio fluids and investigation of racial disparities in HCC. Tumor and non-tumor tissues from 40 patients were analyzed by both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms to increase the metabolome coverage. The levels of the metabolites extracted from solid liver tissue of the HCC area and adjacent non-HCC area were compared. Among the analytes detected by GC-MS and LC-MS with significant alterations, 18 were selected based on biological relevance and confirmed metabolite identification. These metabolites belong to TCA cycle, glycolysis, purines, and lipid metabolism, and have been previously reported in liver metabolomic studies where high correlation with HCC progression is implied. We demonstrated that metabolites related to HCC pathogenesis can be identified through liver tissue metabolomic analysis. Additionally, this study has led to the identification of race-specific metabolites associated with HCC.","Diborative Reduction of Alkynes to 1,2-Diboryl-1,2-Dimetalloalkanes: Its Application for the Synthesis of Diverse 1,2-Bis(boronate)s.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187999,Organic letters,2019 06 12,"Reduction of alkynes with alkali metals in the presence of B2pin2 results in diboration of alkynes.

Invoking stimulated emission through the molecule-exciton transition, we can quantify all the remarkable gain characteristics of CQWs using only experimentally determined parameters, an advance that highlights a fundamental difference between multi-excitons in CQWs and CQDs. While strong confinement prohibits the dissociation of multi-excitons into separate excitons in 0D CQDs, excitons and excitonic molecules coexist in a 2D CQW at room temperature, with densities governed by an association/dissociation equilibrium, not by state-filling.

New Routes across Old Boundaries in Computational Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187984,Chemical reviews,2019 06 12,"The past decade has witnessed an increasing interaction between experiment and theory in the field of molecular spectroscopy. On the computational side, ongoing developments of hardware and software have moved computational spectroscopy from a highly specialized research area to a general tool for researchers in different fields of chemical science. However, since its dawn, computational spectroscopy has been characterized by the dichotomies of qualitative and quantitative description, and of interpretation and accuracy. Indeed, the analysis of experiments is seldom straightforward because of the subtle interplay of several different effects, which are not easy to evaluate and isolate, and/or the complexity of the system under consideration. Often, the accuracy has to be set aside for a more qualitative analysis that will provide the means for a broad interpretation. In such a scenario, the most recent advances in theoretical treatments as well as computational tools have opened the way to the reconciliation of accuracy and interpretability, resulting in unequivocal analyses and assignments of experimental spectra and their unbiased interpretation. This Review aims at being a comprehensive, authoritative, critical, and readable account of general interest to the chemistry community because of the wealth of qualitative and quantitative information that can be obtained from spectroscopic investigations. Limiting ourselves to rotational and vibrational spectroscopy, emphasis will be put on accuracy and interpretability as well as on the routes toward their reconciliation and integration.",All ion differential analysis refines the detection of terminal and internal diagnostic fragment ions for the characterization of biologics product-related variants and impurities by middle-down mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187983,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 12,"Characterization and monitoring of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key analytical requirements during the development of biologics. Top and middle-down (MD) approaches aim at capturing a direct snapshot of all proteoforms with their combinatorial distribution. However, classical MD data analysis is predominantly limited to the interpretation of terminal ion series and PTMs matched by mass. In this study, time-resolved deconvolution (TRD) maps were produced to detect variants and impurities in Fd, Fc/2 and LC subunits of an IgG1 consistently across multiple samples. Classical MD analysis retrieved terminal ions suggesting a deamidation at a NN motif for a LC+1Da species, and inconclusive information for a LC+40Da species. Additionally, we performed differential analysis of all MS2 ions across unmodified and variant subunit spectra to focus data analysis on spectral differences and reveal diagnostic ions (present, absent, enriched, or depleted ions) before fragment assignment. This sensitive methodology was able to detect diagnostic ions in a chimeric spectrum pointing at a Proline to Histidine sequence variant (+40Da) missed by classical MD analysis. This methodology was pivotal to unravel relevant terminal ions and internal fragments N-terminal to Proline as diagnostic ions to confirm the deamidation site. Moreover, different cleavage propensities were revealed at the deamidated DN site compared to the native NN motif for terminal and internal fragments, which may be tracked as a diagnostic behavior. Differential analysis may refine the detection of novel diagnostic ions and leverage the sequence information of internal fragments for the characterization of product-related variants and impurities by MD mass spectrometry.",Next generation glycan microarray enabled by DNA-coded glycan library and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187982,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 12,"Interactions of glycans with proteins, cells and microorganisms play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and host-pathogen interaction. Recently, glycan microarray technology, in which multiple glycan structures are immobilized on a single glass slide and interrogated with glycan binding proteins (GBPs), has become an indispensable tool in the study of protein-glycan interactions. Despite its great success, the current format of the glycan microarray requires expensive, specialized instrumentation and labor-intensive assay and image processing procedures, which limit automation and possibilities for high throughput analyses. Furthermore, current microarray is not suitable for assaying interaction with intact cells due to their large size compared to the two dimensional microarray surface. To address these limitations, we developed the Next Generation Glycan Microarray (NGGM) based on artificial DNA-coding of glycan structures. In this novel approach, a glycan library is presented as a mixture of glycans and glycoconjugates, each of which is coded with a unique oligonucleotide sequence (code). The glycan mixture is interrogated by GBPs followed by the separation of un-bound coded glycans. The DNA sequences that identify individual bound glycans are quantitatively sequenced (decoded) by powerful next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and copied numbers of the DNA codes represent relative bind-ing specificities of corresponding glycan structures to GBPs. We demonstrate that NGGM generates glycan-GBP binding data that are consistent with that generated in a slide-based glycan microarray. More importantly, the solution phase binding assay is directly applicable to identifying glycan binding to intact cells, which is not generally attempted using glass slide-based microarrays.",Advanced porous membranes with tunable morphology regulated by ionic strength of nonsolvent for flow battery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187981,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"A simple salt-induced phase separation method is presented to prepare porous polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes with tunable morphology for vanadium flow batteries (VFBs). This method is based on the traditional nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method, where salt is introduced into the coagulation bath to change the ionic strength of nonsolvent. The change of ionic strength will affect phase separation rate and finally the morphology of porous membranes is well tuned from finger-like voids to sponge-like pores in site. And the membrane with sponge-like pores created multiple barriers to the transfer of vanadium ions, offering the membrane with super high selectivity, meanwhile spongy cells filled with sulfuric acid could provide the membrane with high proton conductivity. As a result, the membrane with sponge-like pores demonstrated a much better performance than that with finger-like voids. The resultant sponge-like porous PBI membrane exhibited a very impressive VFB performance with an energy efficiency (EE) of 89.9% at a current density of 80 mA cm-2, which was close to the highest values ever reported. And the battery kept very stable performance even after continuously running for more than 10000 cycles at 160 mA cm-2, showing excellent stability.

The emergence of these new technologies is owed to great advances in the physical sciences. However, evaluating and improving these methods to new standards requires a joint effort with life sciences and clinical practice. In this Account, we give an overview of the probes that have been developed for measuring a few highly relevant parameters at the subcellular scale: temperature, pH, oxygen, free radicals, inorganic ions, genetic material, and biomarkers. Luminescent probes are available in many varieties, which can be used for measuring temperature, pH, and oxygen. Since they are influenced by virtually any metabolic process in the healthy or diseased cell, these quantities are extremely useful to understand intracellular processes. Probes for them can roughly be divided into molecular dyes with a parameter dependent fluorescence or phosphorescence and nanoparticle platforms. Nanoparticle probes can provide enhanced photostability, measurement quality, and potential for multiple functionalities. Embedding into coatings can improve biocompatibility or prevent nonspecific interactions between the probe and the cellular environment. These qualities need to be matched however with good uptake properties, colloidal properties and eventually intracellular targeting to optimize their practical applicability. Inorganic ions constitute a broad class of compounds or elements, some of which play specific roles in signaling, while others are toxic. Their detection is often difficult due to the cross-talk with similar ions, as well as other parameters. The detection of free radicals, DNA, and biomarkers at extremely low levels has significant potential for biomedical applications. Their presence is linked more directly to physiological and clinical manifestations. Since existing methods for free radical detection are generally poor in sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, new reliable methods that are generally applicable can contribute greatly to advancing this topic in biology. Optical methods that detect DNA or RNA and protein biomarkers exist for intracellular applications, but are mostly relevant for the development of rapid point-of-care sample testing. To elucidate the inner workings of cells, focused multidisciplinary research is required to define the validity and limitations of a nanoparticle probe, in both physical and biological terms. Multifunctional platforms and those that are easily made compatible with conventional research equipment have an edge over other techniques in growing the body of research evidencing their versatility.",Single-Crystalline Monolayer Graphene Wafer on Dielectric Substrate of SiON without Metal Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187979,ACS nano,2019 06 12,"Many scientific and engineering efforts have been made to realize graphene electronics by fully utilizing intrinsic properties of ideal graphene for last decades.

Here, we report an epitaxial growth of single-crystalline monolayer graphene directly on a single-crystalline dielectric SiON-SiC(0001) with a full coverage via epitaxial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without metal catalyst. The dielectric surface of SiON provides atomically flat and chemically inert interface by passivation of dangling bonds, which keeps intrinsic properties of graphene. Atomic structures with a clean interface, full coverage of single-crystalline monolayer, and the epitaxy of graphene on SiON were confirmed macroscopically by mapping low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Raman spectroscopy, and atomically by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Both of measured and calculated local density of states (LDOS) exhibit a symmetric and sharp Dirac cone with a Dirac point located at a Fermi level.

Aβ aggregation can result in a myriad of distinct aggregate species, from soluble oligomers to insoluble fibrils. Aβ strongly interacts with membranes, which can be linked to a variety of potential toxic mechanism associated with AD. Oxidative damage accompanies the formation of Aβ aggregates, with a 10-50% proportion of Aβ aggregates being oxidized in vivo. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence has demonstrated that H2O2 concentration fluctuates rapidly in the brain, resulting in large concentration spikes, especially in the synaptic cleft. Here, the impact of environmental H2O2 on Aβ aggregation in the presence and absence of lipid membranes is investigated. Aβ40 was exposed to H2O2, resulting in the selective oxidation of methionine-35 (Met35) to produce Aβ40Met35[O]. While oxidation mildly reduced the rate of Aβ aggregation and produced a distinct fibril morphology at large H2O2 concentrations, H2O2 had a much more pronounced impact on Aβ aggregation in the presence of total brain lipid extract vesicles (TBLE). The impact of H2O2 on Aβ aggregation in the presence of lipids was associated with a reduced affinity of Aβ for the vesicle surface. However, this reduced vesicle affinity was predominately associated with lipid peroxidation rather than Aβ oxidation.",Solution-Processed Highly Efficient Bluish-Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Bearing Asymmetric Oxadiazole-Difluoroboron Double Acceptor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187977,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"Difluoroboron (BF2)-containing dyes have attracted great interests owing to their exceptionally high luminescence efficiency and good electron-withdrawing properties. However, only few reports on difluoroboron-based thermally activated delayed fluores-cence (TADF) have been addressed. In this contribution, a novel BF2-containing TADF molecule of BFOXD, which contains two acceptor fragments of oxadiazole (OXD) and BF2 and one donor unit of 9,9-dimethylacridine, was synthesized and characterized. For comparison, the precursor of OHOXD bearing one acceptor unit was also investigated. Both molecules clearly show TADF characteristics with sky-blue emission in solution and film state. Additionally, OHOXD undergoes excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) coupled intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes. Using 9-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3,6-bis(triphenylsilyl)-9H-carbazole (CzSi) as the host, the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricating via solution process show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.98 and 13.8% for OHOXD- and BFOXD-based devices, respectively. While the bipolar TADF host of 10-(4-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)sulfonyl)phenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (CzAcSF) is utilized instead of CzSi, the OHOXD- and BFOXD-based devices exhibit better performances with the maximum EQE of 12.1% and 20.1%, respectively, which renders the most efficient and the bluest emission ever reported for the BF2-based TADF mole-cules. This research demonstrates that introduction of one more acceptor unit into TADF molecule could play a positive effect on the emission efficiency, which opens a new way for design high efficiency TADF molecules.",Artificial Thiophdiyne Ultrathin Layer as Enhanced Solid Electrolyte Interphase for the Aluminum Foil of Dual-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187976,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"In this study, we design a novel carbon-based material containing thiophene and acetylenic linkers as functional groups named thiophdiyne (Thi-Dy) and apply as an ultrathin artificial protective layer for the commercial-available aluminum (Al) foil of dual-ion batteries (DIBs). The Thi-Dy films can be grown easily and directly on the Al foil through a mild Glaser-Hay coupling reaction. The as-proposed thiophene and acetylenic linker functional groups in Thi-Dy layers act as energetic active sites for effectively fabrication of stable hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the electrochemical process, which is revealed through ex-situ measurement. The Thi-Dy enhanced SEI layer contributes to offer a more effective and regulated lithium intercalation and diffusion pathway, and delay the pulverization and huge volume expansion of Al-Li alloy during long cycles, which are confirmed by the improvement on the cyclic stability of DIBs. Those studies are expected to provide novel thiophene containing functional materials and mass-produced surface modification approach for metal anode protection, which will promote the research for next-generation rechargeable battery."

Primary aldosteronism may therefore have distinct adverse effects on cardiovascular structure and function, independent of hypertension. However, current data on such effects of primary aldosteronism are conflicting. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of primary aldosteronism on vascular structure and endothelial function, using intima-media thickness as a vascular remodeling index and flow-mediated dilation as a functional parameter. In total, 70 participants were recruited from patients with resistant hypertension. Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with primary aldosteronism and 41 patients with essential hypertension were prospectively enrolled. Primary aldosteronism was due to aldosterone-producing adenoma in 10 cases and due to idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia in 19 cases. All patients underwent ultrasound of the common carotid intima-media thickness and flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery. Primary aldosteronism patients had significantly lower flow-mediated dilation (3.3 [2.4-7.4] % vs 14.7 [10.3-19.9] %, P < 0.01) and significantly higher carotid intima-media thickness (0.9 [0.7-1.0] mm vs 0.8 [0.6-0.9] mm, P = 0.02) compared to patients with essential hypertension.

In addition, we discovered that the reaction outcome can be steered from extended 2DPs to discrete macrocycles or catenular structures by exchanging the position of the hydroxyl and aldehyde group. These results indicate that the relative positions of hydroxyl and aldehyde groups on the biphenyl ring play a determining role in the control and selection of the final products of the surface-confined Schiff base coupling reaction.",High Energy Capacitors Based on All Metal-Organic Frameworks Derivatives and Solar-Charging Station Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187934,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 12,"High energy and efficient solar charging stations using electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are a promising portable power source for the future.

Measurements in three models of tissue injury including drug toxicity, artery occlusion, and acute hyperglycemia were used to test the efficacy of this system. With this hybrid apparatus, a series of structured light patterns at low and high spatial frequencies are projected onto the tissue surface and diffuse reflected light is captured by a CCD camera. A six position filter wheel, equipped with four bandpass filters centered at wavelengths of 650, 690, 800, and 880 nm is placed in front of the camera. Then, light patterns are blocked and a laser source at 650 nm illuminates the tissue while the diffusely reflected light is captured by the camera through the two remaining open holes in the wheel. In this manner, near-infrared (NIR) and laser speckle images are captured and stored together in the computer for off-line processing to reconstruct the tissue's properties. Spatial patterns are used to differentiate the effects of tissue scattering from those of absorption, allowing accurate quantification of tissue hemodynamics and morphology, while a coherent light source is used to study blood flow changes, a feature which cannot be measured with the NIR structured light. This combined configuration utilizes the strengths of each system in a complementary way, thus collecting a larger range of sample properties. In addition, once the flow and hemodynamics are measured, tissue oxygen metabolism can be calculated, a property which cannot be measured independently. Therefore, this merged platform can be considered a multi-parameter wide-field imaging and spectroscopy modality. Overall, experiments demonstrate the capability of this spatially co-registered imaging setup to provide complementary, useful information of various tissue metrics in a simple and non-contact manner, making it attractive for use in a variety of biomedical applications.

We investigated whether the network diffusion model, which models transneuronal spread as diffusion of pathological proteins via the brain connectome, can determine the severity of neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD) (N = 26) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 26) to measure neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. The network diffusion model was used to test whether disease spread, via the human brain connectome, is a viable mechanism to explain the distribution of pathology across the brain. We found that an eigenmode identified in the healthy human brain connectome Laplacian matrix, accurately predicts the cortico-striatal spatial pattern of degeneration in HD. Furthermore, the spread of neural degeneration from sub-cortical brain regions, including the accumbens and thalamus, generates a spatial pattern which represents the typical neurodegenerative characteristics in HD. The white matter connections connecting the nodes with the highest amount of disease factors, when diffusion based disease spread is initiated from the striatum, were found to be most vulnerable to disconnection in HD. These findings suggest that trans-neuronal diffusion of mutant huntingtin protein across the human brain connectome may explain the pattern of gray matter degeneration and white matter disconnection that are hallmarks of HD.",Qualitative analysis of smear layer treated with different etidronate concentrations: A scanning electron microscopy study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187914,Microscopy research and technique,2019 06 12,"The aim of this study was to examine the smear layer removal capacity of various etidronate treatments.

Drug resistance in cancer cells is closely related to their redox status. The role of ROS and its impact on cancer cell survival seems far from elucidation. The mechanisms through which glioblastoma cells overcome aberrant ROS and oxidative stress in a milieu of hyper-metabolic state is still elusive. We hypothesize that formidable growth potential of glioma cells is through manipulation of tumor microenvironment for its survival and growth, which can be attributed to an astute redox regulation through a nexus between activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and glutathione-based antioxidant prowess. Hence, we examined the NMDAR activation on intracellular ROS level, and cell viability on exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), and antioxidants in glutamate-rich microenvironment of glioblastoma. Activation of NMDAR attenuated the intracellular ROS production in LN18 and U251-MG glioma cells. MK-801 significantly reversed this effect. On evaluation of glutathione redox cycle in these cells, level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity were significantly increased. NMDAR significantly enhanced the cell viability in LN18 and U251-MG glioblastoma cells, by attenuating exogenous H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress, and significantly increased catalase activity, the key antioxidant which detoxifies H2 O2 . We hereby report an unexplored role of NMDAR activation induced protection of the rapidly multiplying glioblastoma cells against both endogenous ROS as well as exogenous oxidative challenges. We propose potentiation of reduced GSH, GR and catalase in glioblastoma cells through NMDAR as a novel rationale of chemoresistance in glioblastoma. This article is protected by copyright.

Many metals are essential for viability, since they act as cofactors of indispensable enzymes. But on the other hand, they are potentially toxic because they generate reactive oxygen species or displace other metals from proteins, turning them inactive. This dual effect of metals forces cells to maintain homeostasis by using a variety of systems to import and export them. These systems are usually inducible, and their expression is regulated by metal sensors and signal-transduction mechanisms, one of which is mediated by extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. In this review we have focused on the metal-responsive ECF sigma factors, several of which are activated by iron depletion (FecI, FpvI, and PvdS), while others are activated by excess of metals such as nickel and cobalt (CnrH), copper (CarQ and CorE), or cadmium and zinc (CorE2).

A total of 69 common discrepant TFs with similar variation trends in two TF response element (TFRE) experiments were identified, 18 of which were matched to known key signaling pathways of cardiac regeneration after pathway enrichment of downstream genes. Validation using RT-qPCR selected DACH1, RBL1 (P107), and TBX20, and further validation with WB selected RBL1 (P107) and TBX20. We therefore identified two candidates for key TFs in the loss of mouse cardiac apex regeneration capacity. TBX20 has been biologically validated, and RBL1 (P107) needs to be validated in the future.

Twenty-one ejaculates were collected from 7 adult male dogs; semen was extended, fixed with ethanol 96° and stained with TB using 2 staining times: 15 and 30 minutes. In addition, 3 incubation times with 1% DTT were assayed (2, 5 and 30 minutes). Three staining patterns were established: light blue coloring (TB negative, normal chromatin condensation), light violet (TB intermediate, some degree of chromatin decondensation) and dark blue-violet (TB positive, high degree of chromatin decondensation). No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed between the staining times (15 and 30 minutes) for any of the TB patterns. All DTT incubation times (2, 5 and 30 minutes) showed 100% sperm positive to TB. To conclude, it was possible to simplify the TB stain and determine the different patterns in canine spermatozoa. Also, DTT can be used both as a positive control for the stain and to evaluate individual susceptibility to decondensation in vitro. This article is protected by copyright.

Pyr-HAC, Anth-HAC and Ben-HAC containing pyrene, anthracene and benzene residues, respectively, on their periphery, for their interaction with different planar electron deficient organic guests (PEDOGs). We observed strong and highly selective charge-transfer interactions (CTI) between the host Pyr-HAC and the guest 1, 2, 4, 5-tetracyano-benzene (TCNB) leading to a yellow-to-bright red color change in solubilized state as well as solid state. The interaction between Pyr-HAC and TCNB also induced profound structural and morphological changes. Pyr-HAC self-assembled into belt-like morphology created by homochiral stacking of the host molecules , but in the Pyr- HAC⊃TCNB complex, square bipyramids containing intertwined heterochiral C2-double helices of Pyr-HAC were observed. Other PEDOGs did not induce any of the above changes in Pyr-HAC. Detailed UV-vis, fluorescence, NMR and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed this selectivity, which arises due to CTI assisted by complementary, directional intermolecular hydrogen-bonding (DIHB) between Pyr-HAC and TCNB. This allowed the exclusive extraction of TCNB from a solution enriched in other PEDOGs. Thus, this study provides a ground work for designing responsive helical hosts towards CTI-driven selective ""catch-and-release"" of guests.",Assessment of the optimal age for a preventive ultrasonographic screening of the uterine health in bitches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187907,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,2019 06 12,"Studies about prevalence of uterine pathologies in bitches are scarce.

Prevalence of 3 categories of ultrasonographic findings was as follows: cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) 18%; uterine collections (UC) 10.5%; masses (M) 1.3%. By the cut-off age ratio (0.325), derived by ROC curve (AUC=0.91; SP 84.23%; SE 79.2%; PPV 83.4%; NPV 80%), 228 cases were divided in 2 subgroups: bitches over (exposed group: n.83) and below cut-off (control group: n.145). All abnormalities resulted more frequent in exposed group: OR was 24.96 (P<0.0001: 71.1% over vs 9% below cut-off) for overall abnormalities; 13.68 (P<0.0001: 40.9%vs4.8%) for CEH; 6.13 (P<0.002: 21.7%vs4.1%) for UC; 12.65 (P=0.09: 3.6%vs0%) for M. CEH represents the most common finding in adult bitches, followed by UC. A preventive sonographic screening for uterine abnormalities should start from 33% of expected longevity to preventively select animals requiring further evaluations.

The pulmonary circulation carries the cardiac output with a relatively low driving pressure, and so differs considerably in structure and function from the systemic circulation to maintain a low-resistance vascular system. The pulmonary circulation is often considered to be a quasi-static system in both experimental and computational studies of pulmonary perfusion and its matching to ventilation (air flow) for exchange. However, the system is highly dynamic, with cardiac output and regional perfusion changing with posture, exercise, and over time. Here we review this dynamic system, with a focus on understanding the physiology of pulmonary vascular dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, and the changes to these dynamics that are reflective of disease. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

The developmental origin, anatomical orientation, mechanical action, innervation, and pattern of activation are described for each respiratory muscle fulfilling this broad definition. In addition, the circumstances in which each muscle is called upon to assist ventilation are discussed. The number of ""respiratory"" muscles is large, and the coordination of respiratory muscles with ""nonrespiratory"" muscles and in nonrespiratory activities is complex-commensurate with the diversity of activities that humans pursue, including sleep (8.27). The capacity for speech and adoption of the bipedal posture in human evolution has resulted in patterns of respiratory muscle activation that differ significantly from most other animals. A disproportionate number of respiratory muscles affect the nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx, reflecting the vital importance of coordinated muscle activity to control upper airway patency during both wakefulness and sleep. The upright posture has freed the hands from locomotor functions, but the evolutionary history and ontogeny of forelimb muscles pervades the patterns of activation and the forces generated by these muscles during breathing. The distinction between respiratory and nonrespiratory muscles is artificial, as many ""nonrespiratory"" muscles can augment breathing under conditions of high ventilator demand. Understanding the ontogeny, innervation, activation patterns, and functions of respiratory muscles is clinically useful, particularly in sleep medicine. Detailed explorations of how the nervous system controls the multiple muscles required for successful completion of respiratory behaviors will continue to be a fruitful area of investigation. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

The endothelium has a number of functions including the control of blood vessels diameter through the production and release of potent vasoactive substances or direct electrical communication with underlying smooth muscle cells, regulates the permeability of the vascular barrier, stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, and influences inflammatory and thrombotic processes. Endothelial cells that make up the endothelium express a variety of cell-surface receptors and ion channels on the plasma membrane that are capable of detecting circulating hormones, neurotransmitters, oxygen tension, and shear stress across the vascular wall. Changes in these stimuli activate signaling cascades that initiate an appropriate physiological response. Increases in the global intracellular Ca2+ concentration and localized Ca2+ signals that occur within specialized subcellular microdomains are fundamentally important components of many signaling pathways in the endothelium. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of cation-permeable ion channels that act as a primary means of increasing cytosolic Ca2+ in endothelial cells. Consequently, TRP channels are vitally important for the major functions of the endothelium. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of Ca2+ -permeable TRP channels in the endothelium and their role in vascular regulation. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

The population of patients at risk for cardiovascular disease is steadily increasing, as five-year survival rates for all types of childhood cancers continue to improve. Doxorubicin affects the developing heart differently from the adult heart and in a subset of exposed patients, childhood exposure leads to late, irreversible cardiomyopathy. Notably, the prevalence of late-onset toxicity is increasing in parallel with improved survival. By the year 2020, it is estimated that there will be 500,000 childhood cancer survivors and over 50,000 of them will suffer from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The majority of the research to-date, concentrated on childhood cancer survivors, has focused mostly on clinical outcomes through well-designed epidemiological and retrospective cohort studies. Preclinical studies have elucidated many of the cellular mechanisms that elicit acute toxicity in cardiomyocytes. However, more research is needed in the areas of early- and late-onset cardiotoxicity and more importantly improving the scientific understanding of how other cells present in the cardiac milieu are impacted by doxorubicin exposure. The overall goal of this review is to succinctly summarize the major clinical and preclinical studies focused on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. As the prevalence of patients affected by doxorubicin exposure continues to increase, it is imperative that the major gaps in existing research are identified and subsequently utilized to develop appropriate research priorities for the coming years. Well-designed preclinical research models will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and directly lead to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

A comparative study between different biomarkers of renal damage in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187885,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,2019 06 12,"Methotrexate (MTX) is commonly used in the treatment of malignant diseases and autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. Along with its effective therapeutic power, MTX has adverse effects on the kidneys. Discovery of new biomarkers is required to improve the early detection of renal damage and optimize the effectiveness of treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time course of MTX-induced nephrotoxicity and to compare the urinary excretion of the organic anion transporter 5 (uOat5) with alterations in other markers of renal function, and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms involved in uOat5. Animals were exposed to a unique dose of MTX (80 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal). Experiments were carried out at day 2, 4, 8 or 14 after MTX administration. Markers of renal damage, such as creatinine and urea plasma levels, urinary activity of alkaline phosphatase, microalbuminuria, urinary excretion of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (uNGAL) and histopathology were evaluated. Renal Oat5 and its presence in different urine fractions abundance were assessed by Western blotting. uOat5 was significantly increased 2 days after MTX treatment, before than any alteration in other parameters of kidney injury or renal morphology occurred. uNGAL showed an inverted pattern of urinary excretion compared to uOat5. Exosomal pathway is involved in the urinary excretion of Oat5 and depends on the degree of damage induced by MTX. These experimental data allow proposing uOat5 as a potential noninvasive biomarker for early detection of MTX-induced nephrotoxicity. This article is protected by copyright.

Thalidomide was first developed as a sedative in 1950s, but it was withdrawn from the market because of teratogenicity. In 1990s, however, thalidomide received attention due to the discovery of its anticancer potential derived from antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, and its therapeutic effect on myeloma. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of thalidomide under strict control for the treatment of multiple myeloma. After that, two new IMiDs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, were developed for the sake of more antitumor activity and less adverse events than thalidomide. The molecular mechanism of action of IMiDs remained unclear for a long time until 2010 when the protein cereblon (CRBN) was identified as a primary direct target. IMiDs binds to CRBN and alters the substrate specificity of the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, resulting in breakdown of intrinsic downstream proteins such as IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos). There are many clinical trials of multiple myeloma using IMiDs under various conditions, and most of them show the efficacy of IMiDs. Nowadays lenalidomide plays a central role in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory settings, mainly in combination with other novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies.

This UL has been employed in the decision-making process used by more than 80 countries to establish programs to fortify staple foods with folic acid to prevent neural tube birth defects. Some have claimed that this UL is flawed and has become an obstacle to the wider adoption of neural tube defect prevention programs and have called for re-evaluation of the scientific validity of this UL. Case reports cannot establish causality, but they can reveal patterns in the timing of the onset and treatment of patients with pernicious anemia. These patterns can be compared with secular trends of usual medical practice for the treatment of pernicious anemia and with the changes in usage of folic acid preparations, including recommended therapeutic dosage and precautions for its usage surrounding the synthesis of folic acid in 1945 and vitamin B12 in 1948. Folic acid package inserts, early editions of hematology textbooks, and international expert reports provide valuable historical information. The recommended therapeutic daily dosage for folic acid of 5-20 mg was unchanged from 1946 through to 1971. The likely cause of the neurological problems encountered is the development of vitamin B12 neuropathy when pernicious anemia was treated with high-dosage folic acid before vitamin B12 was widely available in the early 1950s. Thus, the historical record does not provide compelling evidence that folic acid can potentially cause neurologic complications among those with low vitamin B12 status and lends support for reconsidering the basis for the UL of folic acid.","The evolution of self-esteem before, during and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents with dental malocclusion, a prospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187855,European journal of orthodontics,2019 06 12,"This study aimed (1) to investigate the evolution of self-esteem through orthodontic treatment, and (2) to study how key demographic factors would affect these evolutions and to assess relationships between self-esteem and orthodontic treatment need.",Healthy diet is associated with gene expression in blood: the Framingham Heart Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187853,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 06 12,Genes in metabolic and nutrient signaling pathways play important roles in lifespan in model organisms and human longevity.,The role of conserved arginine in the GH70 family: a computational study of the structural features and their implications on the catalytic mechanism of GTF-SI from Streptoccocus mutans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187851,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 12,"In this work, molecular dynamics and QM/MM calculations were employed to examine the structural and catalytic features of the retaining glucosyltransferase GTF-SI from the GH70 family, which participates in the process of caries formation. Our goal was to obtain a deeper understanding of the role of R475 in the mechanism of sucrose breakage. This residue is highly conserved in the GH70 family and so far there has been no evidence that shows what could be the role of this residue in the catalysis performed by GTF-SI. In order to understand the structural role of R475 in the native enzyme, we built full enzyme models of the wild type and the mutants R475A and R475Q. These models were addressed by means of molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed the assessment of the dynamical effect of the R475 mutation on the active site. Then, representative structures were chosen for each one of the mutant models and QM/MM calculations were carried out to unravel the catalytic role of R475. Our results show that the R475 mutation increases the flexibility of the enzyme, which triggers the entrance of water molecules in the active site. In addition, QM/MM calculations indicate that R475 is able to provide a great stabilization to the carboxylate moiety of the acid/base E515, which is an essential characteristic favoring the proton transfer process that promotes the glycosidic bond breakage of sucrose."

Processes & impacts,2019 06 13,"The terminal oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate groups in the uranyl peroxide nanocluster U24Pp12 ([(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12]48-) are not fully satisfied by bond valence considerations and can become protonated. This functionality could allow for specific interactions with mineral surfaces, as opposed to the electrostatically-driven interactions observed between non-functionalized uranyl peroxide nanoclusters and mineral surfaces. The sorption of U24Pp12 to goethite and hematite was studied using batch sorption experiments as a function of U24Pp12 concentration, mineral concentration, and pH. A suite of spectroscopic techniques, scanning electron microscopy, and electrophoretic mobility measurements were used to examine the minerals before and after reaction with U24Pp12, leading to a proposed conceptual model for U24Pp12 interactions with goethite. The governing rate laws were determined and compared to those previously determined for a non-functionalized uranyl peroxide nanocluster. The rate of uranyl peroxide nanocluster sorption depends on the charge density and functionalized component of the uranyl peroxide cage. Electrophoretic mobility and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses show that an inner-sphere complex forms between the U24Pp12 cluster and the goethite surface through the terminal pyrophosphate groups, leading to a proposed conceptual model in which U24Pp12 interacts with the triply-coordinated reactive sites on the (110) plane of goethite. These results demonstrate that the behavior of U24Pp12 at the iron (hydr)oxide-water interface is unique relative to interactions of the uranyl ion and non-functionalized uranyl peroxide nanoclusters.",Tailoring frequency-insensitive large field-induced strain and energy storage properties in (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3-modified (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 lead-free ceramics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187834,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 06 12,"Lead-free (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-based relaxor ferroelectrics are attracting growing research interest due to their very large field-induced strain response and excellent energy storage performance.

Optimal field-induced strain performances were realized in 0.92BNT-0.08BCZT ceramics with not only a high strain of 0.46% but also an impressive frequency stability (0.5 Hz-100 Hz), superior to those of other reported BNT-based materials under a similar frequency range. Moreover, the 0.5BNT-0.5BCZT compositions in the complete ER region delivered a relatively high Wrec of 0.95 J cm-3 and η of 69%, while still remaining insensitive to changes in temperature, frequency, and cycle number. More importantly, a short discharge time (of ∼0.41 μs) was also measured for this composition. Introducing BCZT into the composition was found to promote a non-ergodic-to-ergodic relaxor (NR-ER) phase transition and the formation of dynamic polar nanoregions (PNRs), generating the high strain responses and superior energy storage performances of the given compositions.

Yet, the nature of such functionalized sp3 nanodots remains unknown. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations alone cannot differentiate between two plausible structures, namely true graphane and substrate stabilized graphane-like nanodots. These two structures, however, interact dramatically differently with the underlying substrate. Discriminating which type of nanodots forms on the surface is thus of paramount importance for the applications of such prepared nanostructures. By comparing X-ray standing wave measurements against theoretical model structures obtained by DFT calculations we are able to exclude the formation of true graphane nanodots and clearly show the formation graphane-like nanodots.","Quick mass-production of MAX (Ti2AlC) book with pages separated by stacking faults benefiting removal of ""A"" layer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187826,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 12,"A creative and universal technique, magnetism and vortex current coupling growth (MVC), has been developed for the super-rapid mass-production of the layered MAX (Ti2AlC) phase.

Contrary to its ancestor, purine, which is a UVC chromophore, 2-oxopurine shows a red-shifted absorption spectrum centered in the UVA region. In 2-oxopurine, relaxation along the ππ* spectroscopic state directs the population from the Franck-Condon (FC) region towards a minimum, which acts as a crossroad for the further decay of the system either to triplet states or, alternatively, to the ground state through a C6-puckered S1/S0 funnel. A comparison of the optical properties and excited state potential energy surfaces of purine, 2-oxopurine, 2-aminopurine, 6-oxopurine and adenine, allows establishing how the position and nature of substituent tune the photophysics of purine. For this series, we conclude that both C2 and C6 substitution redshift the absorption spectrum of purine, with 2-oxo substitution exhibiting the largest shift. An important exception is the canonical nucleobase adenine, which presents a blue shifted absorption spectrum. The topography of purine's ππ* potential energy surface experiences major changes when functionalized at the C6 position. In particular, the disappearance of the minimum along the ππ* potential energy surface efficiently funnels the excited state population from the FC region to the ground state and increases the photostability of 6-aminopurine (adenine) and 6-oxopurine (hypoxanthine) nucleobases."

Traditional methods for MG assay, such as chromatography and spectroscopy, have been criticized for expensive instrumentation and complicated pretreatments. An MG RNA aptamer (MGA) is a powerful tool for immediate and rapid detection of MG. However, RNA is easily degraded by nucleases and is unstable in the environment, making accurate and reliable detection of MG difficult. In order to address the problems, an innovative levo (l)-MGA with excellent stability is designed to perform the specific recognition function. Interestingly, the gel electrophoresis and fluorescence measurement results indicate that this unnaturally occurring l-aptamer is resistant to nuclease degradation and it can be kept intact in the standard buffer solution under room temperature for quite a long time. A label-free, simple, and efficient method has been developed for sensitive detection of MG in fish tissue, which holds promising potential in food analysis and environmental monitoring.",Self-assisted membrane-penetrating helical polypeptides mediate anti-inflammatory RNAi against myocardial ischemic reperfusion (IR) injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187803,Biomaterials science,2019 06 12,"Anti-inflammatory RNA interference (RNAi) provides a promising paradigm for the treatment of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. To overcome the membrane barriers against intracardial siRNA delivery, various guanidinated helical polypeptides with potent and aromaticity-assisted membrane activities were herein developed and used for the delivery of siRNA against RAGE (siRAGE), a critical regulator of the pro-inflammatory cascade. Aromatic modification of the polypeptide led to notably enhanced trans-membrane siRNA delivery efficiencies, and more importantly, allowed more siRNA cargoes to get internalized via non-endocytosis, an effective pathway toward gene transfection. Subsequently, benzyl-modified polypeptide (P-Ben) was identified as the top-performing material with the highest RAGE silencing efficiency yet lowest cytotoxicity in H9C2 cells. Intracardial injection of the P-Ben/siRAGE polyplexes at 150 μg siRNA per kg led to remarkable RAGE knockdown by ∼85%, thereby attenuating the inflammatory cytokine release and reducing the cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as myocardium fibrosis to recover the cardiac function after IR injury. This study therefore provides an effective strategy for the design of membrane-penetrating gene delivery materials, and may provide a promising addition to the anti-inflammatory treatment of myocardial IR injury.",Raman spectroscopic screening of high and low molecular weight fractions of human serum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187802,The Analyst,2019 06 12,"This study explores the suitability of Raman spectroscopy as a bioanalytical tool, when coupled with ultra-filtration and multivariate analysis, to detect imbalances in both high molecular weight (total protein content, γ globulins and albumin) and low molecular weight (urea and glucose) fractions of the same samples of human patient serum, in the native liquid form. Ultracentrifugation was employed to separate and concentrate the high and low molecular weight fractions of the serum. Initially, aqueous solutions of the respective molecular species, covering physiologically relevant concentration ranges, were analysed to optimise the measurement protocols. An adapted Extended Multiplicative Signal Correction (EMSC) algorithm was applied to raw spectra to remove water background signal and spectral interferents (β-carotene). Using a validated partial least squares regression modelling method, R2 values, Root Mean Square Error of Cross Validation (RMSECV) and standard deviations were established for the quantification of γ globulin, total protein, albumin, urea and glucose content of the patient serum samples. The study demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy in the liquid form is a viable alternative and/or adjunct to current clinical practice for the parallel analysis of high and low molecular weight fractions, and simultaneous analysis of multiple analytes in the low molecular weight fraction, of human serum for diagnostic applications.",Membrane deformation and layer-by-layer peeling of giant vesicles induced by the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187801,Biomaterials science,2019 06 12,"Protein-membrane interactions that modify the shape of membranes are important for generating curvature, membrane deformation by protein-protein crowding or trafficking of vesicles.

In this study, we investigated the interaction of pneumolysin (PLY), a pore-forming toxin secreted by Streptococcus pneumoniae, with multilamellar and unilamellar membranes. It reveals an enlargement of membrane area due to the insertion of pores into the bilayer and protein-membrane aggregations that induce membrane deformation and wrinkling. Moreover, we demonstrate that PLY peel-off layers from multilamellar giant vesicles in a hitherto unknown layer-by-layer peeling mechanism, which reveals the structure and number of membrane lamellae. We employed microfluidic methods to capture giant vesicles and confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission microscopy, dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy to disclose the structure of multilamellar vesicles. Based on our findings we suggest how back-to-back pore arrangements stabilize large PLY-membrane entities and that pore-displaced lipids possibly remain in the membrane."

Prefabrication of buccal mucosa lined flap has theoretical indications for constructing neourethra with an independent blood supply. The efficacy of using a tissue expander capsule as an induced vascular bed to prefabricate an axial vascularized buccal mucosa-lined flap for tubularized urethral reconstruction in a rabbit model was tested. The experiments were performed in three stages. First, silicone tissue expanders were inserted into the groin to induce vascularized capsule pouch formation. Next, buccal mucosa grafts were transplanted to the newly formed capsular tissue supplied by the axial vessel for buccal mucosa-lined flap prefabrication. Then, circumferential urethral defects were created and repaired by buccal mucosa graft (Group 1), capsule flap (Group 2) and prefabricated capsule buccal mucosa composite flap (Group 3). With retrograde urethrography, no rabbits in Group 1 maintained a wide urethral caliber. In Group 2, the discontinued epithelial layer regenerated at 1 month, and the constructed neourethra narrowed even though the lumen surface formed intact urothelial cells at 3 months. In Group 3, buccal mucosa formed the lining in the neourethra and kept a wide urethral caliber for 3 months. The capsule may serve as an induced vascular bed for buccal mucosa-lined flap prefabrication.

The survival rate of the mice was 100%. When the mice were treated with 40 mg kg-1 busulfan, dramatic SSC depletion occurred 18 days later and all of the germ cells were cleared by day 36.

Health workers at primary care level can detect RB in early life if red reflex test and/or squint (Hirschberg) tests are deployed as part of wellness checks done especially during routine immunisation and well-baby clinics in the first 24 months of life. In most cases of RB, biopsies for histological confirmation are not required for diagnosis and treatment decisions to be made. Clinical information, ophthalmic evaluation and imaging modalities are typically used. There have been significant changes in the management of RB using various treatment modalities such as enucleation with orbital implant, use of chemotherapy delivered through intravenous, intravitreal, periocular and intra-arterial routes and targeted treatment with laser, cryotherapy and brachytherapy. Algorithm for management and development of the national RB program within the context of a low-resource country is presented from review of data extracted from Mendeley library, PubMed library, Google Scholar and One Network; full-text articles were mostly retrieved through the American Academy of Ophthalmology."

According to previous research, dead juvenile seahorses (4-6 cm) showed symptoms of suspected enteritis, including abdominal depression, raised cloaca, partial hepatic congestion, and yellow sticky liquid filling the intestine. Here, we isolated a Gram-negative bacterium from diseased juvenile seahorses and tentatively named the strain HEL-5. Healthy juvenile seahorses were then challenged with the strain through intraperitoneal injection, with results confirming that HEL-5 was pathogenic for seahorses at a median lethal dose of 5.81 × 105 CFU g-1 fish weight. Based on morphological observations, biochemical characteristics, and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and housekeeping genes (gyrB, ftsZ, and gapA), we identified HEL-5 as Vibrio tubiashii. Histopathological observations revealed that V. tubiashii was capable of causing lytic necrosis of hepatocytes and forming obvious necrotic foci, and renal pathology was characterized by tubular collapse and tubular epithelial-cell shedding into the lumen accompanied by a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the tissues of the intestines and kidneys. Antimicrobial-susceptibility testing showed that the strain was highly sensitive to macrolides, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins. These findings represent the first report of isolation of V. tubiashii from diseased juvenile seahorses and provide a foundation for the prevention and treatment of vibrio disease in seahorse aquaculture.",Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium pinnipedii in a wild South American sea lion Otaria flavescens stranded in southern Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187733,Diseases of aquatic organisms,2019 06 12,"Tuberculosis (TB) in pinnipeds is typically caused by Mycobacterium pinnipedii, which has also been associated with infections in other species, such as cattle and humans. As a result, this pathogen has zoonotic potential and is a public health concern. In 2016, a female South American sea lion Otaria flavescens in southern Brazil presented with emaciation and severe dyspnea and died within 3 h of capture. Gross pathology identified pulmonary granulomas, and Ziehl-Neelsen stain identified acid-fast bacilli. M. tuberculosis complex bacteria were confirmed by a BD BACTEC™ MGIT™ 320 detection system using fibrinous exudate, lung granulomas and thoracic fluid. Molecular characterization by spoligotyping showed a hybridization pattern characteristic of M. pinnipedii (SIT593/PINI1). Currently, there is a paucity of data concerning the transmission and epidemiology of M. pinnipedii in pinniped populations in South America. The case report shows that the disease appeared in a free-ranging beached sea lion on the coast, and further surveillance is needed to determine the origin of this TB because of its potential impact on public health.",MHC Class IIB gene polymorphisms associated with resistance/susceptibility to Streptococcus agalactiae in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187732,Diseases of aquatic organisms,2019 06 12,"Genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class IIB was tested in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, and the association between the MHC IIB alleles and disease resistance was also studied. F3 fry offspring (n = 1200) from 12 full-sib families were challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae, which caused significantly different mortalities in different Nile tilapia families (11.00-81.10%). Twenty fry (F1) from each of the 12 families were selected to study the polymorphisms of the MHC Class IIB gene using PCR followed by cloning and sequencing methods. The results showed that the size of the amplified fragment was 770-797 bp. Thirty-seven sequences from 240 individuals revealed 22 different alleles, which belonged to 9 major allele types. Up to 63.58% of nucleotide positions were variable, while the proportion of the amino acid variable positions was up to 68.73%. According to the survival rate of offspring (F3) from 12 full-sib families, we deduced that the alleles Orni-DAB*0107, Orni-DAB*0201 and Orni-DAB*0302 were highly associated with resistance to S. agalactiae, while the allele Orni-DAB*0701 was associated with susceptibility to S. agalactiae. In addition, our previous study found that the allele Orni-DAB*0201 was more frequently distributed in the disease-resistant groups. Therefore, the allele Orni-DAB*0201 could be used as an S. agalactiae resistance-related MHC marker in molecular marker-assisted selective breeding programs for S. agalactiae-resistant Nile tilapia.",Epithelial geometry regulates spindle orientation and progenitor fate during formation of the mammalian epidermis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187731,eLife,2019 06 12,"The control of cell fate through oriented cell division is imperative for proper organ development. Basal epidermal progenitor cells divide parallel or perpendicular to the basement membrane to self-renew or produce differentiated stratified layers, but the mechanisms regulating the choice between division orientations are unknown. Using time-lapse imaging to follow divisions and fates of basal progenitors, we find that mouse embryos defective for the planar cell polarity (PCP) gene, Vangl2, exhibit increased perpendicular divisions and hyperthickened epidermis. Surprisingly, this is not due to defective Vangl2 function in the epidermis, but to changes in cell geometry and packing that arise from the open neural tube characteristic of PCP mutants. Through regional variations in epidermal deformation and physical manipulations, we find that local tissue architecture, rather than cortical PCP cues, regulates the decision between symmetric and stratifying divisions, allowing flexibility for basal cells to adapt to the needs of the developing tissue.",A counter gradient of Activin A and follistatin instructs the timing of hair cell differentiation in the murine cochlea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187730,eLife,2019 06 14,"The mammalian auditory sensory epithelium has one of the most stereotyped cellular patterns known in vertebrates. Mechano-sensory hair cells are arranged in precise rows, with one row of inner and three rows of outer hair cells spanning the length of the spiral-shaped sensory epithelium. Aiding such precise cellular patterning, differentiation of the auditory sensory epithelium is precisely timed and follows a steep longitudinal gradient. The molecular signals that promote auditory sensory differentiation and instruct its graded pattern are largely unknown. Here, we identify Activin A and its antagonist follistatin as key regulators of hair cell differentiation and show, using mouse genetic approaches, that a local gradient of Activin A signaling within the auditory sensory epithelium times the longitudinal gradient of hair cell differentiation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Activin-type signaling regulates a radial gradient of terminal mitosis within the auditory sensory epithelium, which constitutes a novel mechanism for limiting the number of inner hair cells being produced.",Plasmid Localization and Partition in Enterobacteriaceae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187729,EcoSal Plus,2019 06 12,"Plasmids are ubiquitous in the microbial world and have been identified in almost all species of bacteria that have been examined. Their localization inside the bacterial cell has been examined for about two decades; typically, they are not randomly distributed, and their positioning depends on copy number and their mode of segregation. Low-copy-number plasmids promote their own stable inheritance in their bacterial hosts by encoding active partition systems, which ensure that copies are positioned in both halves of a dividing cell. High-copy plasmids rely on passive diffusion of some copies, but many remain clustered together in the nucleoid-free regions of the cell. Here we review plasmid localization and partition (Par) systems, with particular emphasis on plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae and on recent results describing the in vivo localization properties and molecular mechanisms of each system. Partition systems also cause plasmid incompatibility such that distinct plasmids (with different replicons) with the same Par system cannot be stably maintained in the same cells. We discuss how partition-mediated incompatibility is a consequence of the partition mechanism.","Estimates of the prevalence, incidence and severity of dementia in Ireland.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187725,Irish journal of psychological medicine,2019 06 12,"In this paper we provide revised estimates of the prevalence of dementia in Ireland, the number of new cases per year and the severity mix.

Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata (RRP) is a popular medicinal herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat CVDs. However, the development of this novel therapeutic product has been stagnant, and its molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effective ingredients of RRP against CVDs, especially atherosclerosis (AS). Using the AutoDock Vina software, the RRP's ingredients were docked with the targets which can be collected by RCSB and UniProt. Then the screened ingredients and targets could be used to dispose the pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We used GEO, GCBI and DAVID databases to analyze the microarray data of AS which could be used to verify the results of molecular docking, all of which could show the molecular mechanism of RRP on CVDs. We also constructed a compound-target interaction network of CVD with 85 nodes and 272 edges on the basis of molecular docking analysis through Cytoscape. The network showed that forsythiaside, acteoside and stigmasterol are the most important compounds and 2HRR (ACAT (Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl transferase) protein), 4ATB (MMP13) and 1JBQ (cystathionine beta-synthase) are the most valuable targets in the action of RRP against CVD. We also examined the biological functions involved in the biological process, molecular function and cellular components. In accordance with the analysis of GSE6054 microarray data of AS disease, the 20 most specifically expressed genes (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) and the top 10 pathways of DEGs were discovered. Five key pathways, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, were also explored. Amongst these pathways, the top three were the pathways in cancer, MAPK signalling pathway and human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection. The pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were found simultaneously in the pathway analysis for CVD on RRP and for AS on microarray data. This study provided a new potential herbal medicine against CVD and has increased the understanding on the molecular mechanisms of RRP-mediated protection against CVD, especially AS.",Protein Misfolding Diseases and Therapeutic Approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187709,Current protein & peptide science,2019 06 12,"Protein folding is the process by which a polypeptide chain acquires its functional, native 3D structure. Protein misfolding, on the other hand, is a process in which proteins fails to fold into its native functional conformation. This misfolding of proteins may lead to precipitation of number of serious diseases such as Cystic fibrosis (CF), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) etc. Protein quality-control (PQC) systems, consisting of molecular chaperones, proteases and regulatory factors, help in protein folding and prevent its aggregation. At the same time PQC syatems also do sorting and removal of improperly folded polypeptides. Among the major types of PQC systems involved in protein homeostasis are cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial ones. The cytosol PQC system includes a large number of component chaperones, such as nascent-polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), Hsp40, Hsp70, prefoldin and T Complex Protein-1 (TCP-1) ring complex (TRiC). Protein misfolding diseases caused due to defective cytosolic PQC system includes diseases involving keratin/collagen proteins, cardiomyopathies, phenylketonuria, PD and ALS. The components of PQC system of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) includes Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP), calnexin (CNX), calreticulin (CRT), glucose-regulated protein Grp94, the thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and ERp57. ER-linked misfolding diseases include CF and familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI). The components of mitochondrial PQC system include mitochondrial chaperones such as the Hsp70, the Hsp60/Hsp10 and a set of proteases having AAA+ domains similar to the proteasome that are situated in the matrix or the inner membrane. Protein misfolding diseases caused due to defective mitochondrial PQC system include medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)/short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency diseases, hereditary spastic paraplegia. Therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of various protein misfolding diseases using molecular, chemical and pharmacological classes of chaperones are also discussed.",The Effect of Dihydroartemisinin on the Malignancy and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Gastric Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187708,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2019 06 12,"To observe the effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 cultured in vitro.",Comparison Among Five Eucalyptus Species Based on Their Leaf Contents of Some Primary and Secondary Metabolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187707,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2019 06 12,"Eucalyptus belongs to the Myrtaceae family; it is the most planted hardwood forest crop worldwide, representing a global renewable resource of fiber, pharmaceuticals and energy.","Delivery of Local Anesthesia: Current Strategies, Safety, and Future Prospects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187706,Current drug metabolism,2019 06 12,"The systemic administration of anesthesia associated with severe and undesirable side effects such as sedation, vomiting, nausea, allergies, respiratory problems, and neutrophil dysfunction.

The brain capillary endothelial cells, one of the structures of the BBB, have a variety of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), among which the most widely investigated is P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that can efflux numerous substances out of the brain. The expression and activity of P-gp are regulated by various signal pathways, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/protein kinase C-β (PKC-β)/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/Src kinase, etc. However, the hypoxic signaling pathway of P-gp has never been studied in brain microvascular endothelial cells so far. According to the previous researches, hypoxia affects the expression and activity of the transporter. If the transporter is up-regulated, some drugs enter the brain's endothelial cells and are pumped back into the blood by transporters such as P-gp before they enter the brain tissue, consequently influencing the drug delivery in CNS; If the transporter is down-regulated, the centrally toxic drug would enter the brain tissue and cause serious adverse reactions. Therefore, studying the mechanism of hypoxia-regulating P-gp can provide an important reference for the treatment of CNS diseases with a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) component. This article summarized the mechanism of regulation of P-gp in BBB in normoxia and explored that of hypoxia.",Repositioning of HIV Aspartyl Peptidase Inhibitors for Combating the Neglected Human Pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187704,Current medicinal chemistry,2019 06 12,"Chagas disease, caused by the flagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a well-known neglected tropical disease. This parasitic illness affects 6-7 million people and can lead to severe myocarditis and/or complications of the digestive tract. The changes in its epidemiology facilitate co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), making even more difficult the diagnosis and prognosis. The parasitic infection is reactivated in T. cruzi/HIV co-infection, with the appearance of unusual manifestations in the chronic phase and the exacerbation of classical clinical signs. The therapeutic arsenal to treat Chagas disease, in all its clinical forms, is restricted basically to two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both drugs are extremely toxic and the therapeutic efficacy is still unclear, making the clinical treatment a huge issue to be solved. Therefore, it seems obvious the necessity of new tangible approaches to combat this illness. In this sense, the repositioning of approved drugs appears as an interesting and viable strategy. The discovery of HIV aspartyl peptidase inhibitors (HIV-PIs) represented a milestone in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and, concomitantly, a marked reduction in both the incidence and prevalence of important bacterial, fungal and parasitic co-infections was clearly observed. Taking all these findings into consideration, the present review summarizes the promising and beneficial data concerning the effects of HIV-PIs on all the evolutionary forms of T. cruzi and in important steps of the parasite's life cycle, which highlight their possible application as alternative drugs to treat Chagas disease.",19F-NMR in target-based drug discovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187703,Current medicinal chemistry,2019 06 12,"Solution NMR spectroscopy plays important roles in understanding protein structures, dynamics and protein-protein/ligand interactions.

Accumulated studies demonstrate that 19F-NMR will be playing important roles in fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) and probing protein-ligand interactions. This review summarizes the application of 19F-NMR in understanding protein-ligand interactions and drug discovery. Several examples are included to show the roles of 19F-NMR in confirming identified hits/leads in the drug discovery process. In addition to identifying hits from fluorine-containing compound libraries, 19F-NMR will play an important role in drug discovery by providing a fast and robust way in novel hit identification.

The objective of this article was to identify the facilitators and barriers that bariatric patients perceived to do PA one year after finishing a PA programme for the promotion of a long-term active lifestyle. This objective was addressed from a socio-ecological and qualitative perspective. Methods: Nine patients (eight women and one man), aged between 31 and 59 years, participated in semi-structured interviews directly following the PA programme and one year after it. A content analysis was carried out to analyze the qualitative data. Results: Weight loss, improvement of physical fitness, perceived competence, and enjoyment were the main facilitators of PA. Complexes related to skin folds, osteoarthritis, perceived unfavourable weather conditions, lack of social support and economic resources, long workdays, lack of specific PA programmes, and other passive leisure preferences were the main barriers to participate in PA. Conclusions: Results highlight the important interplay between personal, social environmental, and physical environmental factors to explain (in)active behaviours of bariatric patients. The findings of this article could be useful for future research and interventions aimed at promoting PA in bariatric patients.",Utilizing platelet-rich fibrin bioscaffold at the graft site improves the structure and function of mice ovarian grafts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187701,Regenerative medicine,2019 06 12,"Aim: The effect of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) bioscaffold on the structure and function of mice-autotransplanted ovaries was investigated.
