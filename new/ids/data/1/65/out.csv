The mechanism underlying development of CRPC with NED, however, remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we explored and characterized the functional role of neurotensin (NTS) in cell line and animal models of CRPC with NED. NTS was acutely induced by androgen deprivation in animal models of prostate cancer (PCa) and activated downstream signaling leading to NED through activation of neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) and neurotensin receptor 3 (NTSR3), but not neurotensin receptor 2 (NTSR2). Our findings also revealed the existence of a CK8+/CK14+ subpopulation in the LNCaP cell line that expresses high levels of both NTSR1 and NTSR3, and displays an enhanced susceptibility to develop neuroendocrine-like phenotypes upon treatment with NTS. More importantly, NTSR1 pathway inhibition prevented the development of NED and castration resistance in vivo. We propose a novel role of NTS in the development of CRPC with NED, and a possible strategy to prevent the onset of NED by targeting the NTS signaling pathway.",Latent infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus enhances retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770900,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a gamma-2 herpesvirus, is the causative agent of KS, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and a plasma cell variant of multicentric Castleman's disease. Although KSHV latency is detected in KS-related tumors, oncogenic pathways activated by KSHV latent infection are not fully understood. Here, we found that retrotransposition of long interspersed element-1 (L1), a retrotransposon in the human genome, was enhanced in PEL cells. Among the KSHV latent genes, viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP) enhanced L1 retrotransposition in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an NF-κB target, regulated the vFLIP-mediated enhancement of L1 retrotransposition. Furthermore, ICAM-1 downregulated the expression of Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), an L1 restriction factor. Knockdown of ICAM-1 or overexpression of MOV10 relieved the vFLIP-mediated enhancement of L1 retrotransposition. Collectively, during KSHV latency, vFLIP upregulates ICAM-1 in an NF-κB-dependent manner, which, in turn, downregulates MOV10 expression and thereby enhances L1 retrotransposition. Because active L1 retrotransposition can lead to genomic instability, which is commonly found in KS and PEL, activation of L1 retrotransposition during KSHV latency may accelerate oncogenic processes through enhancing genomic instability. Our results suggest that L1 retrotransposition may be a novel target for impeding tumor development in KSHV-infected patients.",Resistance to anti-microtubule drug-induced cell death is determined by regulation of BimEL expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770899,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"Anti-microtubule agents are frequently used as anticancer therapeutics. Cell death induced by these agents is considered to be due to sustained mitotic arrest caused by the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, some cell types are resistant to mitotic cell death. Cells' ability to escape mitotic arrest (mitotic slippage) is thought to be a major mechanism contributing to this resistance. Here, we show that resistance to cell death induced by anti-mitotic agents is not linked to cells' capacity to undergo mitotic slippage as generally believed but is dependent on the state of BimEL regulation during mitosis. While transcriptional repression of BimEL in the mitotic death-resistant cells involves polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated histone trimethylation, the BimEL protein is destabilized by cullin 1/4A-βTrCP-dependent degradation involving activation of cullin 1/4A by neddylation. These results imply that pharmacological augmentation of BimEL activity in anti-microtubule drug-resistant tumors may have important therapeutic implications.",Regulatable adenovector harboring the GFP and Yamanaka genes for implementing regenerative medicine in the brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770896,Gene therapy,2019 02 16,"Biological rejuvenation by partial cell reprogramming is an emerging avenue of research. In this context, regulatable pluripotency gene expression systems are the most widely used at present. We have constructed a regulatable bidirectional adenovector expressing the humanized green fluorescent protein (GFP) and oct4, sox2, klf4, and c-myc genes (known as the Yamanaka genes or OSKM). The OSKM genes are arranged as a bicistronic tandem (hSTEMCCA tandem), which is under the control of a Tet-Off bidirectional promoter that also controls the expression of the gFP gene. Separately, a constitutive cassette expresses the regulatory protein tTA. Vector DNA was transfected in HEK293 Cre cells, which were additionally infected with the helper adenovector H14, unable to package its DNA due to the Cre recombinase produced by the HEK293 Cre cells. The newly generated vector was expanded by six iterated coinfections of the above cells which were lysed at the end of the process and the adenovector purified by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl gradient. The titer of the initial preparation was 1.2 × 1012 physical viral particles/ml. As expected, GFP fluorescence in vector-transduced rat fibroblast cultures declined with the dose of doxycycline (DOX) present in the medium. Immunocytochemical analysis of transduced cells confirmed the expression of the four Yamanaka genes. Additionally, 3 days after vector injection in the hypothalamus of rats, a significant level of fluorescence was observed in the region. Addition of 2 mg/ml DOX to the drinking water reduced the GFP expression. This adenovector constitutes a promising tool for implementing nonintegrative partial cell reprogramming.",scFv6.C4 DNA vaccine with fragment C of Tetanus toxin increases protective immunity against CEA-expressing tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770895,Gene therapy,2019 02 16,"The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the main tumor-associated antigen of colorectal cancers. Previously, we developed a DNA vaccine using scFv6.C4, a CEA surrogate, against CEA-expressing tumors; 40% of the vaccinated mice were tumor-free after tumor challenge. In order to enhance vaccine efficacy, fragment C of Tetanus Toxin (FrC) was tested as adjuvant. C57BL/6J-CEA2682 mice were electroporated intramuscularly 4 times with uP-PS/scFv6.C4-FrC or uP-PS/scFv6.C4, challenged by s.c. injection of 1 × 105 MC38-CEA cells, and tumor growth was monitored over 100 days. The humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed by ELISA, immunocytochemistry, in-vitro lymphocyte proliferation, and CTL cytotoxicity assays. Immunization with uP-PS/scFv6.C4-FrC or uP-PS/scFv6.C4 induced similar anti-CEA antibody titers. However, immunocytochemistry analysis showed stronger staining with uP-PS/scFv6.C4-FrC-immunized mice sera. When challenged with MC38-CEA cells, 63% of the FrC-vaccinated mice did not develop tumors, half of the rest had a significant tumor growth delay, and the probability of being free of tumors was on average 40% higher than that of scFv6.C4-immunized mice. Addition of the adjuvant led to higher CD4+ and CD8+ proliferative responses and strong CD8+ CTL response against MC38-CEA cells. DNA immunization with scFv6.C4 and FrC increased antitumor effect via induction of high and specific humoral and cellular immune responses to CEA.",T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition in cardiovascular disease: a double-edged sword.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770894,Nature reviews. Cardiology,2019 05 17,"The role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now widely accepted. Immune cells, including T cells, are influenced by inflammatory signals and contribute to the onset and progression of CVD. T cell activation is modulated by T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition pathways. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting T cell inhibition pathways have revolutionized cancer treatment and improved survival in patients with cancer. However, ICIs might induce cardiovascular toxicity via T cell re-invigoration. With the rising use of ICIs for cancer treatment, a timely overview of the role of T cell co-stimulation and inhibition molecules in CVD is desirable. In this Review, the importance of these molecules in the pathogenesis of CVD is highlighted in preclinical studies on models of CVD such as vein graft disease, myocarditis, graft arterial disease, post-ischaemic neovascularization and atherosclerosis. This Review also discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting T cell co-stimulation and inhibition pathways to treat CVD, as well as the possible cardiovascular benefits and adverse events after treatment. Finally, the Review emphasizes that patients with cancer who are treated with ICIs should be monitored for CVD given the reported association between the use of ICIs and the risk of cardiovascular toxicity.",Deep neural networks in psychiatry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770893,Molecular psychiatry,2019 02 16,"Machine and deep learning methods, today's core of artificial intelligence, have been applied with increasing success and impact in many commercial and research settings. They are powerful tools for large scale data analysis, prediction and classification, especially in very data-rich environments (""big data""), and have started to find their way into medical applications. Here we will first give an overview of machine learning methods, with a focus on deep and recurrent neural networks, their relation to statistics, and the core principles behind them. We will then discuss and review directions along which (deep) neural networks can be, or already have been, applied in the context of psychiatry, and will try to delineate their future potential in this area. We will also comment on an emerging area that so far has been much less well explored: by embedding semantically interpretable computational models of brain dynamics or behavior into a statistical machine learning context, insights into dysfunction beyond mere prediction and classification may be gained. Especially this marriage of computational models with statistical inference may offer insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms that could open completely novel avenues for psychiatric treatment.",Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol increases striatal glutamate levels in healthy individuals: implications for psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770892,Molecular psychiatry,2019 03 29,"The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the association between cannabis use and acute or long-lasting psychosis are not completely understood. While some evidence suggests altered striatal dopamine may underlie the association, direct evidence that cannabis use affects either acute or chronic striatal dopamine is inconclusive. In contrast, pre-clinical research suggests that cannabis may affect dopamine via modulation of glutamate signaling. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used to investigate whether altered striatal glutamate, as measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, underlies the acute psychotomimetic effects of intravenously administered delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; 1.19 mg/2 ml), the key psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, in a set of 16 healthy participants (7 males) with modest previous cannabis exposure. Compared to placebo, acute administration of Δ9-THC significantly increased Glutamate (Glu) + Glutamine (Gln) metabolites (Glx) in the left caudate head (P = 0.027). Furthermore, compared to individuals who were not sensitive to the psychotomimetic effects of Δ9-THC, individuals who developed transient psychotic-like symptoms (~70% of the sample) had significantly lower baseline Glx (placebo; P 7= 0.023) and a 2.27-times higher increase following Δ9-THC administration. Lower baseline Glx values (r = -0.55; P = 0.026) and higher previous cannabis exposure (r = 0.52; P = 0.040) were associated with a higher Δ9-THC-induced Glx increase. These results suggest that an increase in striatal glutamate levels may underlie acute cannabis-induced psychosis while lower baseline levels may be a marker of greater sensitivity to its acute psychotomimetic effects and may have important public health implications.",Kainate receptor auxiliary subunit NETO2 is required for normal fear expression and extinction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770891,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 02 21,"NETO1 and NETO2 are auxiliary subunits of kainate receptors (KARs). They interact with native KAR subunits to modulate multiple aspects of receptor function. Variation in KAR genes has been associated with psychiatric disorders in humans, and in mice, knockouts of the Grik1 gene have increased, while Grik2 and Grik4 knockouts have reduced anxiety-like behavior. To determine whether the NETO proteins regulate anxiety and fear through modulation of KARs, we undertook a comprehensive behavioral analysis of adult Neto1-/- and Neto2-/- mice. We observed no differences in anxiety-like behavior. However, in cued fear conditioning, Neto2-/-, but not Neto1-/- mice, showed higher fear expression and delayed extinction compared to wild type mice. We established, by in situ hybridization, that Neto2 was expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons throughout the fear circuit including the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrated that the relative amount of synaptosomal KAR GLUK2/3 subunit was 20.8% lower in the ventral hippocampus and 36.5% lower in the medial prefrontal cortex in Neto2-/- compared to the Neto2+/+ mice. The GLUK5 subunit abundance was reduced 23.8% in the ventral hippocampus and 16.9% in the amygdala. We conclude that Neto2 regulates fear expression and extinction in mice, and that its absence increases conditionability, a phenotype related to post-traumatic stress disorder and propose that this phenotype is mediated by reduced KAR subunit abundance at synapses of fear-associated brain regions.",The myeloarchitecture of impulsivity: premature responding in youth is associated with decreased myelination of ventral putamen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770890,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 10,"Impulsivity has been suggested as a neurocognitive endophenotype conferring risk across a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance and behavioural addictions, eating disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We used a paradigm with interspecies translation validity (the four-choice serial reaction time task, 4CSRTT) to assess 'waiting' impulsivity in a youth sample (N = 99, aged 16-26 years). We collected magnetization prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP2RAGE) scans, which enabled us to measure R1, the longitudinal relaxation rate, a parameter closely related to tissue myelin content, as well as quantify grey matter volume. We also assessed inhibitory control (commission errors) on a Go/NoGo task and measured decisional impulsivity (delay discounting) using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). We found R1 of the bilateral ventral putamen was negatively correlated with premature responding, the index of waiting impulsivity on the 4CSRTT. Heightened impulsivity in youth was significantly and specifically associated with lower levels of myelination in the ventral putamen. Impulsivity was not associated with grey matter volume. The association with myelination was specific to waiting impulsivity: R1 was not associated with decisional impulsivity on the MCQ or inhibitory control on the Go/NoGo task. We report that heightened waiting impulsivity, measured as premature responding on the 4CSRTT, is specifically associated with lower levels of ventral putaminal myelination, measured using R1. This may represent a neural signature of vulnerability to diseases associated with excessive impulsivity and demonstrates the added explanatory power of quantifying the mesoscopic organization of the human brain, over and above macroscopic volumetric measurements."

The LINC00346 gene was recurrently amplified and upregulated in GC, and its expression was positively correlated with poor pathologic stage, large tumor size, and poor prognosis. In addition, the oncogenic transcription factors KLF5 and MYC could bind to the LINC00346 promoter and enhance its expression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in the GEO datasets revealed that cell cycle and focal adhesion genes were enriched in patients with high LINC00346 expression. In vitro and in vivo assays of LINC00346 alterations revealed a complex integrated phenotype affecting cell growth, migration and invasion. Strikingly, high-throughput sequencing analysis after LINC00346 alterations highlighted alterations in cell cycle and focal adhesion pathways in GC cells. Mechanistically, argonaute 2 (Ago2) was recruited by LINC00346, which functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-34a-5p by antagonizing its ability to repress CD44, NOTCH1, and AXL protein translation. Taken together, our findings support a model in which the KLF5, MYC/LINC00346/miR-34a-5p cross-talk served as critical effectors in GC tumorigenesis and progression, suggesting a new therapeutic direction in the treatment of GC.",Connexin43 dephosphorylation at serine 282 is associated with connexin43-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770876,Cell death and differentiation,2019 06 10,"Gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) plays an important role in regulating cardiomyocyte survival in addition to regulating electrical coordination. Cx43 dephosphorylation, found in severe cardiac pathologies, is thought to contribute to myocardial injury. However, the mechanisms underlying Cx43 mediation of cell survival and myocardial lesions remain unknown. Here, we found that transfecting an adenovirus carrying a mutant gene of Cx43-serine 282 substituted with alanine (S282A) into neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) induced cell apoptosis and Ca2+ transient desynchronization, whereas using gap junction inhibitor or knocking down Cx43 expression with Cx43-miRNA caused uncoupled Ca2+ signaling without cell death. Similarly, while Cx43-S282A+/+ failed in generation, Cx43-S282A+/- mice exhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular arrhythmias dependent on S282 dephosphorylation. Further, Cx43 dephosphorylation at S282 activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), factor-associated suicide and the caspase-8 apoptotic pathway by physically interacting with p38 MAPK. These findings uncovered a specific Cx43 phosphorylation residue involved in regulating cardiomyocyte homeostasis. S282 phosphorylation deficiency acts as a trigger inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac arrhythmias, providing a potential mechanism for Cx43-mediated myocardial injury in severe cardiac diseases.","In the absence of apoptosis, myeloid cells arrest when deprived of growth factor, but remain viable by consuming extracellular glucose.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770875,Cell death and differentiation,2019 04 16,"Withdrawal of the growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) from IL-3-dependent myeloid cells causes them to undergo Bax/Bak1-dependent apoptosis, whereas factor-deprived Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells remain viable, but arrest and shrink. It was reported that withdrawal of IL-3 from Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glut1 is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which is induced in IL-3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glut1 expression in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (~0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL-3. Thus, Bax-/-Bak1-/- myeloid cells deprived of growth factor consume extracellular glucose to maintain long-term viability, without a requirement for Atg5-dependent autophagy.",Loss of glutathione redox homeostasis impairs proteostasis by inhibiting autophagy-dependent protein degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770874,Cell death and differentiation,2019 02 16,"In the presence of aggregation-prone proteins, the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergo a dramatic shift in their respective redox status, with the cytosol becoming more oxidized and the ER more reducing. However, whether and how changes in the cellular redox status may affect protein aggregation is unknown. Here, we show that C. elegans loss-of-function mutants for the glutathione reductase gsr-1 gene enhance the deleterious phenotypes of heterologous human, as well as endogenous worm aggregation-prone proteins. These effects are phenocopied by the GSH-depleting agent diethyl maleate. Additionally, gsr-1 mutants abolish the nuclear translocation of HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor, a key inducer of autophagy, and strongly impair the degradation of the autophagy substrate p62/SQST-1::GFP, revealing glutathione reductase may have a role in the clearance of protein aggregates by autophagy. Blocking autophagy in gsr-1 worms expressing aggregation-prone proteins results in strong synthetic developmental phenotypes and lethality, supporting the physiological importance of glutathione reductase in the regulation of misfolded protein clearance. Furthermore, impairing redox homeostasis in both yeast and mammalian cells induces toxicity phenotypes associated with protein aggregation. Together, our data reveal that glutathione redox homeostasis may be central to proteostasis maintenance through autophagy regulation.",Regulation of miRNAs by Snail during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in HT29 colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770873,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, represents early stages of metastasis and is a promising target in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy. There have been many attempts to identify markers and key pathways induced throughout EMT but the process is complex and depends on the cancer type and tumour microenvironment. Here we used the colon cancer cell line HT29, which stably overexpressed Snail, the key transcription factor in early EMT, as a model for colorectal adenocarcinoma cells with a pro-metastatic phenotype. We investigated miRNA expression regulation during that phenotypic switching. We found that overexpression of Snail in HT29 cells triggered significant changes in individual miRNA levels but did not change the global efficiency of miRNA processing. Snail abundance repressed the expression of miR-192 and miR-194 and increased miR-205, let-7i and SNORD13 levels. These identified changes correlated with the reported transcriptomic alterations in Snail-overexpressing HT29 cells. We also investigated how Snail affected the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the presence of Snail significantly alters the complex mRNA/miRNA interactions in the early steps of metastasis and also has an impact on the content of EVs released from HT29 cells.",Author Correction: CHD3 helicase domain mutations cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome with macrocephaly and impaired speech and language.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770872,Nature communications,2019 03 22,"The original version of this Article contained an error in the spelling of the author Laurence Faivre, which was incorrectly given as Laurence Faive.

Here, we examine the outcome of patients with various hematological disorders undergoing HaploSCT with high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. We performed a retrospective study on 381 patients from 30 centers between January 2013 and December 2015. At the last follow-up, a total of 1058 infectious episodes were diagnosed, affecting 90.3% of the cohort. Median time to first infection was 13 days for bacterial, 32 days for viral and 20 days for fungal infections. Around 41% of these infections were of bacterial origin and 35% of viral origin, among which 48.8% of patients presented CMV reactivation. Median of GVHD relapse-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.1 months, 19.9 months and 33.5 months, respectively. HSCT procedure was the primary or contributing cause of death (55.6%), followed by relapse of the original disease (34.2%). Infections accounted for 45.7% of the HSCT-related deaths.

To pinpoint the origin of device degradation, here we apply multiple techniques to monitor the electric-field distribution and space-charge accumulation across the multilayered structure before and after lifetime tests. Evident by charge-modulated electro-absorption and capacitance-voltage characteristics, the excited electrons in blue quantum dots (QD) are prone to cross the type II junction between the QD emission layer and the electron-transporting layer (ETL) due to the offset of conduction band minimum, leading to space-charge accumulation and operating-voltage rise in the ETL. Therefore, unlike those very stable red devices, of which the lifetime is primarily limited by the slow degradation of hole-transporting layer, the poor lifetime of blue QLED originates from the fast degradation at the QD-ETL junction. Materials engineering for efficient electron injection is prerequisite for the boost of operating lifetime."

Thin film sensor technology is proposed as an excellent candidate to measure the cell temperature during operation due to its negligible mass, minimal disturbance to normal operation and higher temporal and spatial resolutions. However, the effective application of such sensors in SOFC systems is a challenging endeavour and predicated on incorporating the external wire attachments to complete the electrical circuit. This is because of the high sensitivity of SOFC materials to any interference to operation, limited available space and harsh operating conditions. In this paper, a new concept of packaging external wire attachments to the thin film sensor is described to enable the integration of the sensor in the SOFC system. Temperature measurements have been monitored under OCV and operating condition with the thin film sensor directly from SOFC cathode surface via proposed spring-based wire connection, from room temperature to SOFC operating temperature. The impact of the parameters including contact resistance (Rc) between sensor pads and attached wire on monitored temperature has also been analysed with the contribution of conductive paste. High temporal and spatial resolutions have been obtained with the implemented sensor.","MapB, the Brucella suis TamB homologue, is involved in cell envelope biogenesis, cell division and virulence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770847,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"Brucella species are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens responsible for a worldwide zoonosis. The envelope of Brucella exhibits unique characteristics that make these bacteria furtive pathogens and resistant to several host defence compounds. We have identified a Brucella suis gene (mapB) that appeared to be crucial for cell envelope integrity. Indeed, the typical resistance of Brucella to both lysozyme and the cationic lipopeptide polymyxin B was markedly reduced in a ∆mapB mutant. MapB turned out to represent a TamB orthologue. This last protein, together with TamA, a protein belonging to the Omp85 family, form a complex that has been proposed to participate in the translocation of autotransporter proteins across the outer membrane (OM). Accordingly, we observed that MapB is required for proper assembly of an autotransporter adhesin in the OM, as most of the autotransporter accumulated in the mutant cell periplasm. Both assessment of the relative amounts of other specific outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and a proteome approach indicated that the absence of MapB did not lead to an extensive alteration in OMP abundance, but to a reduction in the relative amounts of a protein subset, including proteins from the Omp25/31 family. Electron microscopy revealed that ∆mapB cells exhibit multiple anomalies in cell morphology, indicating that the absence of the TamB homologue in B. suis severely affects cell division. Finally, ∆mapB cells were impaired in macrophage infection and showed an attenuated virulence phenotype in the mouse model. Collectively, our results indicate that the role of B. suis TamB homologue is not restricted to participating in the translocation of autotransporters across the OM but that it is essential for OM stability and protein composition and that it is involved in cell envelope biogenesis, a process that is inherently coordinated with cell division.",Applicability of Aerosol Deposition Process for flexible electronic device and determining the Film Formation Mechanism with Cushioning Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770846,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of the Aerosol Deposition (AD) method which can be adapted as a future fabrication process for flexible electronic devices. On the basis of this method's noticeable advantages such as room-temperature processing, suitability for mass production, wide material selectivity, and direct fabrication on a flexible substrate, we fabricated and evaluated a flexible conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM) to confirm the feasibility of this method. The CBRAM was fabricated by the AD-method, and a novel film formation mechanism was observed and analyzed. Considering that the analyzed film formation mechanism is notably different with previously reported for film formation mechanisms of the AD method, these results of study will provide strong guidance for the fabrication of flexible electronic device on ductile substrate.",A method using electroporation for the protein delivery of Cre recombinase into cultured Arabidopsis cells with an intact cell wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770845,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"Genome engineering in plants is highly dependent on the availability of effective molecular techniques. Despite vast quantities of research, genome engineering in plants is still limited in terms of gene delivery, which requires the use of infectious bacteria or harsh conditions owing to the difficulty delivering biomaterial into plant cells through the cell wall. Here, we describe a method that uses electroporation-mediated protein delivery into cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells possessing an intact cell wall, and demonstrate Cre-mediated site-specific recombination. By optimizing conditions for the electric pulse, protein concentration, and electroporation buffer, we were able to achieve efficient and less-toxic protein delivery into Arabidopsis thaliana cells with 83% efficiency despite the cell wall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the electroporation-mediated protein delivery of Cre recombinase to achieve nucleic acid-free genome engineering in plant cells possessing an intact cell wall.",Quantification of frequency-dependent genetic architectures in 25 UK Biobank traits reveals action of negative selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770844,Nature communications,2019 04 01,"Understanding the role of rare variants is important in elucidating the genetic basis of human disease. Negative selection can cause rare variants to have larger per-allele effect sizes than common variants. Here, we develop a method to estimate the minor allele frequency (MAF) dependence of SNP effect sizes. We use a model in which per-allele effect sizes have variance proportional to [p(1 - p)]α, where p is the MAF and negative values of α imply larger effect sizes for rare variants. We estimate α for 25 UK Biobank diseases and complex traits. All traits produce negative α estimates, with best-fit mean of -0.38 (s.e. 0.02) across traits. Despite larger rare variant effect sizes, rare variants (MAF < 1%) explain less than 10% of total SNP-heritability for most traits analyzed. Using evolutionary modeling and forward simulations, we validate the α model of MAF-dependent trait effects and assess plausible values of relevant evolutionary parameters.","A computational study of Anthracyclines interacting with lipid bilayers: Correlation of membrane insertion rates, orientation effects and localisation with cytotoxicity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770843,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"Anthracyclines interact with DNA and topoisomerase II as well as with cell membranes, and it is these latter interactions that can cause an increase in their cytotoxic activity. In the present study a detailed computational analysis of the initial insertion, orientation and nature of the interaction occurring between Anthracyclines and two different lipid bilayers (unsaturated POPC and saturated DMPC) is explored through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; four Anthracyclines: Doxorubicin (DOX), Epirubicin (EPI), Idarubicin (IDA) and Daunorubicin (DAU) were examined. The results indicate that the increased cytotoxicity of DOX, in comparison to the other three analogues, is correlated with its ability to diffuse at a faster rate into the bilayers. Additionally, DOX exhibited considerably different orientational behaviour once incorporated into the bilayer and exhibited a higher propensity to interact with the hydrocarbon tails in both lipids indicating a higher probability of transport to the other leaflet of the bilayer.",Predictors of residential mobility and its impact on air pollution exposure among children diagnosed with early childhood leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770842,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 02 16,"Epidemiology studies relying on one address to assign exposures over time share common methodological limitations in failing to account for mobility that may introduce potential exposure misclassification. Using Texas birth certificate and cancer registry data, we identified predictors of residential mobility among mothers of children diagnosed with early childhood leukemia in Texas from 1995 to 2011. We used U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Air Toxics Assessment data to estimate residential levels of benzene and 1,3-butadiene based on addresses at birth and diagnosis and applied mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to evaluate differences in exposure classification between the two time periods. In total, 55% of children moved from time of birth to diagnosis, although they generally did not move far (median distance moved was 8 km). Predictors of mobility, at delivery, included younger age, being unmarried and living in neighborhoods with high benzene levels, and, at diagnosis, increasing child's age and living in neighborhoods with low poverty rates. We observed that the odds of being assigned to a higher exposure quartile at diagnosis relative to the time of birth decreased by 31% for 1,3-butadiene (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.82) and by 12% for benzene (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.75, 1.05).",Understanding skin absorption of common aldehyde vapours from exposure during hazardous material incidents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770841,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 02 16,"The toxic release of aldehyde vapours during a hazardous material (HAZMAT) incident primarily results in respiratory concerns for the unprotected public. However, skin absorption may be an important concurrent exposure route that is poorly understood for this scenario. This study provides experimental data on the skin absorption properties of common aldehydes used in industry, including acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde and formaldehyde, in gaseous or vapour form using an adapted in vitro technique. Two of the four tested aldehydes were found to penetrate the skin in appreciable amounts following 30-min exposure at HAZMAT relevant atmospheric concentrations: acetaldehyde (5.29 ± 3.24 µg/cm2) and formaldehyde (3.45 ± 2.58 µg/cm2). Whereas only low levels of acrolein (0.480 ± 0.417 µg/cm2) and benzaldehyde (1.46 ± 0.393 µg/cm2) skin penetration was noted. The aldehydes demonstrated differing levels of interaction with fabric. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde adsorbed strongly to denim, whereas benzaldehyde and acrolein displayed no sink properties. However, denim was shown to be an initial protective barrier and reduced penetration outcomes for all aldehydes. This study provides important information to assist first responders and confirms the relevance of using physicochemical properties (e.g. solubility, molecular weight, partition coefficient) to predict skin permeation potential in the absence of empirical data during HAZMAT incidents involving different types of aldehydes.","Comparative studies of catalytic pathways for Streptococcus pneumoniae sialidases NanA, NanB and NanC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770840,Scientific reports,2019 02 22,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a leading human pathogen, which takes large responsibility for severe otitis media, acute meningitis and septicaemia. It encodes up to three distinct sialidases: NanA, NanB and NanC, which are promising drug targets. Recent experimental studies have shown that these three sialidases might work together up to the ultimate step, where NanA and NanB produce N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac following the functions of sialidase and intramolecular trans-sialidase, whilst NanC carries on a ping-pong mechanism that produces or removes 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-Neu5AC. It is intriguing that these sialidases have similar active sites but operate via three distinct reaction pathways. To clarify this issue, herein we present the first systematic computational investigation on the catalytic pathways for S. pneumoniae NanA, NanB and NanC based on combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, and propose the most preferred routes for the three S. pneumoniae sialidases. Our findings support the mechanisms of NanA and NanC that were proposed by previous experimental studies, whereas the role of water in NanB was found to differ slightly from our current understandings. The mechanistic insights obtained from this work are expected to assist in the design of potent inhibitors targeting these key enzymes for therapeutic applications.",Reverse immunodynamics: a new method for identifying targets of protective immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770839,Scientific reports,2019 03 05,"Despite a dramatic increase in our ability to catalogue variation among pathogen genomes, we have made far fewer advances in using this information to identify targets of protective immunity. Epidemiological models predict that strong immune selection can cause antigenic variants to structure into genetically discordant sets of antigenic types (e.g. serotypes). A corollary of this theory is that targets of immunity may be identified by searching for non-overlapping associations of amino acids among co-circulating antigenic variants. We propose a novel population genetics methodology that combines such predictions with phylogenetic analyses to identify genetic loci (epitopes) under strong immune selection. We apply this concept to the AMA-1 protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find evidence of epitopes among certain regions of low variability which could render them ideal vaccine candidates. The proposed method can be applied to a myriad of multi-strain pathogens for which vast amounts of genetic data has been collected in recent years."

Understanding the forms in which carbon existed in the molten early Earth is a critical step towards quantifying the carbon budget of Earth's deep interior. Here we employ first-principles molecular dynamics to study the evolution of carbon species as a function of pressure in a pyrolite melt. We find that with increasing pressure, the abundance of CO2 and CO3 species decreases at the expense of CO4 and complex oxo-carbon polymers (CxOy) displaying multiple C-C bonds. We anticipate that polymerized oxo-carbon species were a significant reservoir for carbon in the terrestrial magma ocean. The presence of Fe-C clusters suggests that upon segregation, Fe-rich metal may partition a significant fraction of carbon from the silicate liquid, leading to carbon transport into the Earth's core.",A functional subset of CD8+ T cells during chronic exhaustion is defined by SIRPα expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770827,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Prolonged exposure of CD8+ T cells to antigenic stimulation, as in chronic viral infections, leads to a state of diminished function termed exhaustion. We now demonstrate that even during exhaustion there is a subset of functional CD8+ T cells defined by surface expression of SIRPα, a protein not previously reported on lymphocytes. On SIRPα+ CD8+ T cells, expression of co-inhibitory receptors is counterbalanced by expression of co-stimulatory receptors and it is only SIRPα+ cells that actively proliferate, transcribe IFNγ and show cytolytic activity. Furthermore, target cells that express the ligand for SIRPα, CD47, are more susceptible to CD8+ T cell-killing in vivo. SIRPα+ CD8+ T cells are evident in mice infected with Friend retrovirus, LCMV Clone 13, and in patients with chronic HCV infections. Furthermore, therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 to reinvigorate CD8+ T cells during chronic infection expands the cytotoxic subset of SIRPα+ CD8+ T cells.",Resolution limit of image analysis algorithms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770826,Nature communications,2019 04 01,"The resolution of an imaging system is a key property that, despite many advances in optical imaging methods, remains difficult to define and apply. Rayleigh's and Abbe's resolution criteria were developed for observations with the human eye. However, modern imaging data is typically acquired on highly sensitive cameras and often requires complex image processing algorithms to analyze. Currently, no approaches are available for evaluating the resolving capability of such image processing algorithms that are now central to the analysis of imaging data, particularly location-based imaging data. Using methods of spatial statistics, we develop a novel algorithmic resolution limit to evaluate the resolving capabilities of location-based image processing algorithms. We show how insufficient algorithmic resolution can impact the outcome of location-based image analysis and present an approach to account for algorithmic resolution in the analysis of spatial location patterns.",A mathematical-descriptor of tumor-mesoscopic-structure from computed-tomography images annotates prognostic- and molecular-phenotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770825,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"The five-year survival rate of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is approximately 35-40% despite maximal treatment efforts, highlighting a need for stratification biomarkers for personalized treatment. Here we extract 657 quantitative mathematical descriptors from the preoperative CT images of 364 EOC patients at their initial presentation. Using machine learning, we derive a non-invasive summary-statistic of the primary ovarian tumor based on 4 descriptors, which we name ""Radiomic Prognostic Vector"" (RPV). RPV reliably identifies the 5% of patients with median overall survival less than 2 years, significantly improves established prognostic methods, and is validated in two independent, multi-center cohorts. Furthermore, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis from two independent datasets elucidate that stromal phenotype and DNA damage response pathways are activated in RPV-stratified tumors. RPV and its associated analysis platform could be exploited to guide personalized therapy of EOC and is potentially transferrable to other cancer types.",Oxygen vacancy associated single-electron transfer for photofixation of CO2 to long-chain chemicals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770824,Nature communications,2019 03 22,"The photofixation and utilization of CO2 via single-electron mechanism is considered to be a clean and green way to produce high-value-added commodity chemicals with long carbon chains. However, this topic has not been fully explored for the highly negative reduction potential in the formation of reactive carbonate radical. Herein, by taking Bi2O3 nanosheets as a model system, we illustrate that oxygen vacancies confined in atomic layers can lower the adsorption energy of CO2 on the reactive sites, and thus activate CO2 by single-electron transfer in mild conditions. As demonstrated, Bi2O3 nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies show enhanced generation of •CO2- species during the reaction process and achieve a high conversion yield of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with nearly 100% selectivity in the presence of methanol. This study establishes a practical way for the photofixation of CO2 to long-chain chemicals via defect engineering.",Barcoding reveals complex clonal behavior in patient-derived xenografts of metastatic triple negative breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770823,Nature communications,2019 04 25,"Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are prone to dissemination but sub-clonal relationships between tumors and resulting metastases are poorly understood. Here we use cellular barcoding of two treatment-naïve TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track the spatio-temporal fate of thousands of barcoded clones in primary tumors, and their metastases. Tumor resection had a major impact on reducing clonal diversity in secondary sites, indicating that most disseminated tumor cells lacked the capacity to 'seed', hence originated from 'shedders' that did not persist. The few clones that continued to grow after resection i.e. 'seeders', did not correlate in frequency with their parental clones in primary tumors. Cisplatin treatment of one BRCA1-mutated PDX model to non-palpable levels had a surprisingly minor impact on clonal diversity in the relapsed tumor yet purged 50% of distal clones. Therefore, clonal features of shedding, seeding and drug resistance are important factors to consider for the design of therapeutic strategies.",The short-chain fatty acid pentanoate suppresses autoimmunity by modulating the metabolic-epigenetic crosstalk in lymphocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770822,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have immunomodulatory effects, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that pentanoate, a physiologically abundant SCFA, is a potent regulator of immunometabolism. Pentanoate induces IL-10 production in lymphocytes by reprogramming their metabolic activity towards elevated glucose oxidation. Mechanistically, this reprogramming is mediated by supplying additional pentanoate-originated acetyl-CoA for histone acetyltransferases, and by pentanoate-triggered enhancement of mTOR activity. In experimental mouse models of colitis and multiple sclerosis, pentanoate-induced regulatory B cells mediate protection from autoimmune pathology. Additionally, pentanoate shows a potent histone deacetylase-inhibitory activity in CD4+ T cells, thereby reducing their IL-17A production. In germ-free mice mono-colonized with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), pentanoate inhibits the generation of small-intestinal Th17 cells and ameliorates SFB-promoted inflammation in the central nervous system. Taken together, by enhancing IL-10 production and suppressing Th17 cells, the SCFA pentanoate might be of therapeutic relevance for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",Stress-induced inactivation of the Staphylococcus aureus purine biosynthesis repressor leads to hypervirulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770821,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Staphylococcus aureus is a significant cause of human infection. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in the transcriptional repressor of purine biosynthesis, purR, enhance the pathogenic potential of S. aureus. Indeed, systemic infection with purR mutants causes accelerated mortality in mice, which is due to aberrant up-regulation of fibronectin binding proteins (FnBPs). Remarkably, purR mutations can arise upon exposure of S. aureus to stress, such as an intact immune system. In humans, naturally occurring anti-FnBP antibodies exist that, while not protective against recurrent S. aureus infection, ostensibly protect against hypervirulent S. aureus infections. Vaccination studies support this notion, where anti-Fnb antibodies in mice protect against purR hypervirulence. These findings provide a novel link between purine metabolism and virulence in S. aureus.",Multi-cohort study identifies social determinants of systemic inflammation over the life course.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770820,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Chronic inflammation has been proposed as having a prominent role in the construction of social inequalities in health. Disentangling the effects of early life and adulthood social disadvantage on inflammation is key in elucidating biological mechanisms underlying socioeconomic disparities. Here we explore the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) across the life course and inflammation (as measured by CRP levels) in up to 23,008 participants from six European cohort studies from three countries conducted between 1958 and 2013. We find a consistent inverse association between SEP and CRP across cohorts, where participants with a less advantaged SEP have higher levels of inflammation. Educational attainment is most strongly related to inflammation, after adjusting for health behaviours, body mass index and later-in-life SEP. These findings suggest socioeconomic disadvantage in young adulthood is independently associated with later life inflammation calling for further studies of the pathways operating through educational processes.",Extortion strategies resist disciplining when higher competitiveness is rewarded with extra gain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770819,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Cooperative strategies are predicted for repeated social interactions. The recently described Zero Determinant (ZD) strategies enforce the partner's cooperation because the 'generous' ZD players help their cooperative partners while 'extortionate' ZD players exploit their partners' cooperation. Partners may accede to extortion because it pays them to do so, but the partner can sabotage his own and his extortioner's score by defecting to discipline the extortioner. Thus, extortion is predicted to turn into generous and disappear. Here, we show with human volunteers that an additional monetary incentive (bonus) paid to the finally competitively superior player maintains extortion. Unexpectedly, extortioners refused to become disciplined, thus forcing partners to accede. Occasional opposition reduced the extortioners' gain so that using extortion paid off only because of the bonus. With no bonus incentive, players used the generous ZD strategy. Our findings suggest that extortion strategies can prevail when higher competitiveness is rewarded with extra gain."

We and others have shown however, that infection with apparently cytopathic viruses does not necessarily lead to cell death; some cells can intrinsically clear the virus and persist in the host long-term. To determine if any cells can survive direct IBV infection, we here generate a recombinant IBV capable of activating a host-cell reporter to permanently label all infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that IBV infection leads to the formation of a survivor cell population in the proximal airways that are ciliated-like, but transcriptionally and phenotypically distinct from both actively infected and bystander ciliated cells. We also show that survivor cells are critical to maintain respiratory barrier function.

Here we show that Drosophila ASPP is part of a multiprotein PP1 complex and that PP1 association is necessary for several in vivo functions of Drosophila ASPP. We solve the crystal structure of the human ASPP2/PP1 complex and show that ASPP2 recruits PP1 using both its canonical RVxF motif, which binds the PP1 catalytic domain, and its SH3 domain, which engages the PP1 C-terminal tail. The ASPP2 SH3 domain can discriminate between PP1 isoforms using an acidic specificity pocket in the n-Src domain, providing an exquisite mechanism where multiple motifs are used combinatorially to tune binding affinity to PP1.",Evidence of cooperative effect on the enhanced superconducting transition temperature at the FeSe/SrTiO3 interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770805,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"At the interface between monolayer FeSe films and SrTiO3 substrates the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is unexpectedly high, triggering a surge of excitement.

We now show that a different approach, originally proposed by Kagan, in which a collection of structurally distinct substrates are evaluated in a single reaction vessel, can not only provide information on the substrate scope at a much earlier stage in methodology development, but even lead to a broadly applicable synthetic methodology. Using this multi-substrate screening approach, we have identified an efficient and stereoselective imidodiphosphorimidate organocatalyst for scalable Diels-Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene with different classes of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.",Gigaxonin E3 ligase governs ATG16L1 turnover to control autophagosome production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770803,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Autophagy is an essential self-digestion machinery for cell survival and homoeostasis. Membrane elongation is fundamental, as it drives the formation of the double-membrane vesicles that engulf cytosolic material. LC3-lipidation, the signature of autophagosome formation, results from a complex ubiquitin-conjugating cascade orchestrated by the ATG16L1 protein, whose regulation is unknown. Here, we identify the Gigaxonin-E3 ligase as the first regulator of ATG16L1 turn-over and autophagosome production. Gigaxonin interacts with the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 to drive its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Gigaxonin depletion induces the formation of ATG16L1 aggregates and impairs LC3 lipidation, hence altering lysosomal fusion and degradation of the main autophagy receptor p62. Altogether, we demonstrate that the Gigaxonin-E3 ligase controls the production of autophagosomes by a reversible, ubiquitin-dependent process selective for ATG16L1. Our findings unveil the fundamental mechanisms of the control of autophagosome formation, and provide a molecular switch to fine-tune the activation of autophagy.",Multimaterial actinic spatial control 3D and 4D printing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770802,Nature communications,2019 03 22,"Production of objects with varied mechanical properties is challenging for current manufacturing methods. Additive manufacturing could make these multimaterial objects possible, but methods able to achieve multimaterial control along all three axes of printing are limited. Here we report a multi-wavelength method of vat photopolymerization that provides chemoselective wavelength-control over material composition utilizing multimaterial actinic spatial control (MASC) during additive manufacturing. The multicomponent photoresins include acrylate- and epoxide-based monomers with corresponding radical and cationic initiators. Under long wavelength (visible) irradiation, preferential curing of acrylate components is observed. Under short wavelength (UV) irradiation, a combination of acrylate and epoxide components are incorporated. This enables production of multimaterial parts containing stiff epoxide networks contrasted against soft hydrogels and organogels. Variation in MASC formulation drastically changes the mechanical properties of printed samples. Samples printed using different MASC formulations have spatially-controlled chemical heterogeneity, mechanical anisotropy, and spatially-controlled swelling that facilitates 4D printing.",Ripplocations provide a new mechanism for the deformation of phyllosilicates in the lithosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770801,Nature communications,2019 03 20,"Deformation in Earth's lithosphere is localised in narrow, high-strain zones. Phyllosilicates, strongly anisotropic layered minerals, are abundant in these rocks, where they accommodate much of the strain and play a significant role in inhibiting or triggering earthquakes. Until now it was understood that phyllosilicates could deform only by dislocation glide along layers and could not accommodate large strains without cracking and dilation. Here we show that a new class of atomic-scale defects, known as ripplocations, explain the development of layer-normal strain without brittle damage. We use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to resolve nano-scale bending characteristic of ripplocations in the phyllosilicate mineral biotite. We demonstrate that conjugate delamination arrays are the result of elastic strain energy release due to the accumulation of layer-normal strain in ripplocations. This work provides the missing mechanism necessary to understand phyllosilicate deformation, with important rheological implications for phyllosilicate bearing seismogenic faults and subduction zones.",Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway attenuates β-catenin-dependent pro-parasitic role of STING-TICAM2-IRF3-IDO1 signalosome in Toxoplasma gondii infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770800,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"Recent studies have documented the diverse role of host immunity in infection by the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. However, the contribution of the β-catenin pathway in this process has not been explored. Here, we show that AKT-mediated phosphorylated β-catenin supports T. gondii multiplication which is arrested in the deficiency of its phosphorylation domain at S552 position. The β-catenin-TCF4 protein complex binds to the promoter region of IRF3 gene and initiates its transcription, which was also abrogated in β-catenin knockout cells. TBK-independent phosphorylation of STING(S366) and its adaptor molecule TICAM2 by phospho-AKT(T308S473) augmented downstream IRF3-dependent IDO1 transcription, which was also dependent on β-catenin. But, proteasomal degradation of IDO1 by its tyrosine phosphorylation (at Y115 and Y253) favoured parasite replication. In absence of IDO1, tryptophan was catabolized into melatonin, which supressed cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and boosted parasite growth. Conversely, when tyrosine phosphorylation was abolished by phosphosite mutations, IDO1 escaped its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation system (UPS) and the stable IDO1 prevented parasite replication by kynurenine synthesis. We propose that T. gondii selectively utilizes tryptophan to produce the antioxidant, melatonin, thus prolonging the survival of infected cells through functional AKT and β-catenin activity for better parasite replication. Stable IDO1 in the presence of IFN-γ catabolized tryptophan into kynurenine, promoting cell death by suppressing phospho-AKT and phospho-β-catenin levels, and circumvented parasite replication. Treatment of infected cells with kynurenine or its analogue, teriflunomide suppressed kinase activity of AKT, and phosphorylation of β-catenin triggering caspase-3 dependent apoptosis of infected cells to inhibit parasite growth. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin regulate phosphorylated STING-TICAM2-IRF3-IDO1 signalosome for a cell-intrinsic pro-parasitic role. We propose that the downstream IRF3-IDO1-reliant tryptophan catabolites and their analogues can act as effective immunotherapeutic molecules to control T. gondii replication by impairing the AKT and β-catenin axis.",Long noncoding RNA EGFR-AS1 promotes cell growth and metastasis via affecting HuR mediated mRNA stability of EGFR in renal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770799,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but remain largely unclear. Using publicly available transcriptome sequencing data from renal cancer (n = 703) and integrating bioinformatics analyses, we screened and identified a valuable lncRNA, EGFR-AS1. In our validation cohort (n = 204), EGFR-AS1 was significantly upregulated in RCC tissues (P < 0.001). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that EGFR-AS1 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Based on previous studies and sequence complementarity of EGFR with EGFR-AS1, we demonstrated that EGFR-AS1 directly bound to EGFR mRNA and inhibited its degradation. Furthermore, RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry analyses showed that EGFR-AS1 interacted with HuR, which was responsible for the mRNA stability of EGFR. Multivariate analysis suggested that higher EGFR-AS1 expression predicted a poor prognosis in RCC patients (high vs low: P = 0.018, HR = 2.204, 95% CI: 1.145-4.241). In conclusion, EGFR-AS1 enhances the malignant phenotype of RCC cells by enhancing HuR-mediated mRNA stability of EGFR. Our data also provide biological rationales for EGFR-AS1 as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for RCC."

To date, few studies have quantified the advantage of resting state functional MRI (fMRI) at 7 T compared to 3-Tesla (3 T). We conducted a series of experiments that demonstrate the improvement in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of a multi-echo multi-band fMRI protocol with ultra-high field 7 T MRI, compared to a similar protocol using 3 T MRI in healthy controls (HC). We also directly tested the enhancement in ultra-high field 7 T fMRI signal power by examining the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a small midbrain structure that is critical to the expected neuropathology of MDD but difficult to discern with standard 3 T MRI. We demonstrate up to 300% improvement in TSNR and resting state functional connectivity coefficients provided by ultra-high field 7 T fMRI compared to 3 T, indicating enhanced power for detection of functional neural architecture. A multi-echo based acquisition protocol and signal denoising pipeline afforded greater gain in signal power compared to classic acquisition and denoising pipelines. Furthermore, ultra-high field fMRI revealed mood-related neurocircuit disturbances in patients with MDD compared to HC, which were not detectable with 3 T fMRI. Ultra-high field 7 T fMRI may provide an effective tool for studying functional neural architecture relevant to MDD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",Brain region-specific alterations of RNA editing in PDE8A mRNA in suicide decedents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770787,Translational psychiatry,2019 02 23,"Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are key modulators of signal transduction and are involved in inflammatory cell activation, memory and cognition. There is a two-fold decrease in the expression of phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) in the temporal cortex of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Here, we studied PDE8A mRNA-editing profile in two architectonically distinct neocortical regions in a clinically well-characterized cohort of age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls and depressed suicide decedents. By using capillary electrophoresis single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), a previously validated technique to identify A-to-I RNA modifications, we report the full editing profile of PDE8A in the brain, including identification of two novel editing sites. Editing of PDE8A mRNA displayed clear regional difference when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24). Furthermore, we report significant intra-regional differences between non-psychiatric control individuals and depressed suicide decedents, which could discriminate the two populations. Taken together, our results (i) highlight the importance of immune/inflammatory markers in major depressive disorder and suicide and (ii) establish a direct relationship between A-to-I RNA modifications of peripheral markers and A-to-I RNA editing-related modifications in brain. This work provides the first immune response-related brain marker for suicide and could pave the way for the identification of a blood-based biomarker that predicts suicidal behavior.",Oocyte-derived E-cadherin acts as a multiple functional factor maintaining the primordial follicle pool in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770786,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"In mammals, female fecundity is determined by the size of the primordial follicle (PF) pool, which is established during the perinatal period. As a non-renewable resource, the preservation of dormant PFs is crucial for sustaining female reproduction throughout life. Although studies have revealed that several oocyte-derived functional genes and pathways, such as newborn ovary homeobox (NOBOX) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, participate in maintaining the PF pool, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that E-cadherin (E-cad) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of PFs in mice. E-cad is specifically localized to the cytomembrane of oocytes in PFs. Knockdown of E-cad in neonatal ovaries resulted in significant PF loss owing to oocyte apoptosis. In addition, the expression pattern of NOBOX is similar to that of E-cad. Knockdown of E-cad resulted in a decreased NOBOX level, whereas overexpression of Nobox partially rescued the follicle loss induced by silencing E-cad. Furthermore, E-cad governed NOBOX expression by regulating the shuttle protein, β-catenin, which acts as a transcriptional co-activator. Notably, E-cad, which is a transmembrane protein expressed in the oocytes, was also responsible for maintaining the PF structure by facilitating cell-cell adhesive contacts with surrounding pregranulosa cells. In conclusion, E-cad in oocytes of PFs plays an indispensable role in the maintenance of the PF pool by facilitating follicular structural stability and regulating NOBOX expression. These findings shed light on the physiology of sustaining female reproduction.",Applying an innovative biodegradable self-assembly nanomicelles to deliver α-mangostin for improving anti-melanoma activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770785,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"α-Mangostin (αM), a traditional natural product with promising application of treating a series of diseases, was limited use in clinical due to its hydrophobicity. Herein, MPEG-PCL nanomicelles were used to embed the αM for resolving hydrophobicity and improving the anti-melanoma effect of the αM. The anti-melanoma activity and potential mechanisms of biodegradable αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles were investigated. The αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles possessed a stronger effect on anti-melanoma compared to the free αM both in vitro and in vivo with a low cytotoxicity in non-tumor cell lines. In the research of mechanisms, the αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell, induced apoptosis via both apoptosis pathways of intrinsic and exogenous in vitro, as well as suppressed tumor growth and restrained angiogenesis in vivo, which implied that the αM/MPEG-PCL nanomicelles have potential application as a novel chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma therapy.",Lysophosphatidic acid increases mesangial cell proliferation in models of diabetic nephropathy via Rac1/MAPK/KLF5 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770784,Experimental & molecular medicine,2019 04 24,"Mesangial cell proliferation has been identified as a major factor contributing to glomerulosclerosis, which is a typical symptom of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) levels are increased in the glomerulus of the kidney in diabetic mice. LPA is a critical regulator that induces mesangial cell proliferation; however, its effect and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The proportion of α-SMA+/PCNA+ cells was increased in the kidney cortex of db/db mice compared with control mice. Treatment with LPA concomitantly increased the proliferation of mouse mesangial cells (SV40 MES13) and the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. On the other hand, the expression of p27Kip1 was decreased. The expression of Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) was upregulated in the kidney cortex of db/db mice and LPA-treated SV40 MES13 cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of KLF5 reversed these effects and inhibited the proliferation of LPA-treated cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were activated, and the expression of early growth response 1 (Egr1) was subsequently increased in LPA-treated SV40 MES13 cells and the kidney cortex of db/db mice. Moreover, LPA significantly increased the activity of the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac1) GTPase in SV40 MES13 cells, and the dominant-negative form of Rac1 partially inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and upregulation of Egr1 and KLF5 induced by LPA. LPA-induced hyperproliferation was attenuated by the inhibition of Rac1 activity. Based on these results, the Rac1/MAPK/KLF5 signaling pathway was one of the mechanisms by which LPA induced mesangial cell proliferation in DN models.",Soft fibrin matrix downregulates DAB2IP to promote Nanog-dependent growth of colon tumor-repopulating cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770783,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"Colon cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been shown to be responsible for the recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). As a crucial microenvironmental factor, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is known to affect the stemness of CSCs. Recently, fibrin deposition in the stroma of CRC was demonstrated to be responsible for tumor development. In this study, we used salmon fibrin gel to provide a 3D ECM for colon cancer cells and investigated its effects on cell growth as well as the underlying mechanisms. Compared with stiff 420 Pascal (Pa) and 1 050 Pa gels, 90 Pa soft fibrin gel was most efficient at isolating and enriching tumor colonies. The size and number of colony formation negatively correlated with gel stiffness. Specifically, these tumor colonies exhibited efficient tumorigenicity, upregulated stem cell markers, and had anti-chemotherapeutic properties and were thus named tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs). More importantly, the self-renewal molecule Nanog was sharply induced in 3D-cultured colon TRCs; further, Nanog siRNA significantly inhibited colony formation, suggesting the indispensable role of Nanog in TRC growth. A subsequent mechanistic study illustrated that Nanog expression could be modulated through fibrin gel stiffness-induced DAB2IP/PI3K/FOXA1 signaling in colon TRCs.",Establishing a generalized polyepigenetic biomarker for tobacco smoking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770782,Translational psychiatry,2019 03 06,"Large-scale epigenome-wide association meta-analyses have identified multiple 'signatures'' of smoking. Drawing on these findings, we describe the construction of a polyepigenetic DNA methylation score that indexes smoking behavior and that can be utilized for multiple purposes in population health research. To validate the score, we use data from two birth cohort studies: The Dunedin Longitudinal Study, followed to age-38 years, and the Environmental Risk Study, followed to age-18 years. Longitudinal data show that changes in DNA methylation accumulate with increased exposure to tobacco smoking and attenuate with quitting. Data from twins discordant for smoking behavior show that smoking influences DNA methylation independently of genetic and environmental risk factors. Physiological data show that changes in DNA methylation track smoking-related changes in lung function and gum health over time. Moreover, DNA methylation changes predict corresponding changes in gene expression in pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and cellular trafficking. Finally, we present prospective data about the link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and epigenetic modifications; these findings document the importance of controlling for smoking-related DNA methylation changes when studying biological embedding of stress in life-course research. We introduce the polyepigenetic DNA methylation score as a tool both for discovery and theory-guided research in epigenetic epidemiology.",Sphingomyelin synthase 2 promotes an aggressive breast cancer phenotype by disrupting the homoeostasis of ceramide and sphingomyelin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770781,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"Breast cancer is the most common type of carcinoma in women worldwide, but the mechanisms underlying tumour development and progression remain unclear. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2) is a crucial regulator involved in ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM) homoeostasis that is mostly studied for its role in lipid metabolism. Our primary study indicated that high SGMS2 expression is associated with breast cancer metastasis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo revealed that SGMS2 promotes cancer cell proliferation by suppressing apoptosis through a Cer-associated pathway and promotes cancer cell invasiveness by enhancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiation through the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway. Further study determined that SGMS2 activated the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway primarily by increasing TGF-β1 secretion, which was likely associated with aberrant expression of SM. Thus, our findings indicate that SGMS2-mediated activation of the TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway is important in breast cancer progression, which provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis and suggests a possible anticancer therapy for breast cancer.",Expectation effects on brain dopamine responses to methylphenidate in cocaine use disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770780,Translational psychiatry,2019 02 23,"The response to drugs of abuse is affected by expectation, which is modulated in part by dopamine (DA), which encodes for a reward prediction error. Here we assessed the effect of expectation on methylphenidate (MP)-induced striatal DA changes in 23 participants with an active cocaine use disorder (CUD) and 23 healthy controls (HC) using [11C]raclopride and PET both after placebo (PL) and after MP (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). Brain dopamine D2 and D3 receptor availability (D2R: non-displaceable binding potential (BPND)) was measured under four conditions in randomized order: (1) expecting PL/receiving PL, (2) expecting PL/receiving MP, (3) expecting MP/receiving PL, and (4) expecting MP/receiving MP. Expecting MP increased pulse rate compared to expecting PL. Receiving MP decreased D2R in striatum compared to PL, indicating MP-induced striatal DA release, and this effect was significantly blunted in CUD versus HC consistent with prior findings of decreased striatal dopamine responses both in active and detoxified CUD. There was a group × challenge × expectation effect in caudate and midbrain, with expectation of MP increasing MP-induced DA release in HC but not in CUD, and expectation of PL showing a trend to increase MP-induced DA release in CUD but not in HC. These results are consistent with the role of DA in reward prediction error in the human brain: decreasing DA signaling when rewards are less than expected (blunted DA increases to MP in CUD) and increasing them when greater than expected (for PL in CUD reflecting conditioned responses to injection). Our findings also document disruption of the expectation of drug effects in dopamine signaling in participants with CUD compared to non-addicted individuals.",MiR-30a regulates cancer cell response to chemotherapy through SNAI1/IRS1/AKT pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770779,Cell death & disease,2019 02 20,"Despite gemcitabine being the leading chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer, many patients still relapse due to the drug resistance.

However, the upstream regulator of this pathway, especially the involvement of non-coding RNAs in gemcitabine response is still not clear. Here we delineated the miRNA expression profile and key signaling pathways associated with gemcitabine response. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-30a, one node of this network, regulated cellular response to gemcitabine through SNAI1-IRS1-AKT pathway. MiR-30a directly targeted SNAI1, which activates AKT and ERK through regulating IRS1 in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, miR-30a is downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissue and associated with overall patient survival. We also identified miR-30a as an AKT-FOXO3a-regulated gene that forms a feedback loop. Together, these results demonstrate that miR-30a is an upstream regulator of the Akt pathway with a critical role in cancer etiology and chemoresistance."

The aim of this systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was to identify published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that quantified the effectiveness of adjunctive acupuncture treatment in patients with angina due to CAD who were also treated with Western or Chinese medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review of the literature included a search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, from their inception to September 2018. Published findings from RCTs were included that investigated the effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for angina due to CAD in combination with Western or traditional Chinese medicine. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model to determine the outcomes of markedly and moderately effective rates for the use of acupuncture. RESULTS Twenty-four published RCTs were identified that included 1,916 patients with CAD. Patients who received adjunctive acupuncture treatment had a significantly increased markedly effective rate. However, the moderately effective rate between adjunctive acupuncture combined with standard treatment for angina and standard treatment alone was not statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled results for the markedly and moderately effective rates were robust. Subgroup analysis in most subsets supported the main findings.

Phantom models that replicate complex 3-D geometries with both structural and molecular contrast, with resolution and lateral dimensions equivalent to those of imaging techniques (<20  μm), have proven elusive. We present a method for fabricating phantom models using a combination of two-photon polymerization (2PP) to print scaffolds, and microinjection of tailored tissue-mimicking materials to simulate healthy and diseased tissue. We provide a first demonstration of the capabilities of this method with intravascular optical coherence tomography, an imaging technique widely used in clinical practice. We describe the design, fabrication, and validation of three types of phantom models: a first with subresolution wires (5- to 34-μm diameter) arranged circumferentially, a second with a vessel side-branch, and a third containing a lipid inclusion within a vessel. Silicone hybrid materials and lipids, microinjected within a resin framework created with 2PP, served as tissue-mimicking materials that provided realistic optical scattering and absorption.

The current study provides psychometric evaluation of 11 frequently used measures encompassing different subdomains of social cognition. Adults with autism (N = 103) and typically developing controls (N = 95) completed 11 commonly used social cognitive tasks spanning the domains of emotion processing, social perception, and mentalizing/theory of mind. We examined each measure's internal reliability and sensitivity to group differences, how performance related to general intellectual ability, and alignment of measures with a proposed two-factor structure of social cognition in ASD. Controls outperformed the ASD group on 8 of the 11 social cognitive tasks, with the largest group differences occurring on two mentalizing measures, The awareness of social inference task (TASIT) and hinting task. In ASD, all tasks demonstrated strong internal consistency and avoided ceiling and floor effects. Social cognitive performance was also related to, but not redundant with, intellectual functioning. We also found support for a two-factor structure of social cognition, with basic social perception and emotional processing aligning into a lower-order social perception factor, while mentalizing tasks aligned into a higher-order social appraisal factor. In sum, eight tasks showed adequate to strong psychometric properties.

The objectives of this study were to (a) determine whether matrix stabilization with exogenous lysyl oxidase-like protein-2 (LOXL2) with recombinant hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein-1 (LINK) would result in increased compressive and tensile properties in self-assembled articular cartilage constructs, (b) evaluate whether label-free, non-destructive fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) could be used to infer changes in both biochemical composition and biomechanical properties, (c) form quantitative relationships between destructive and non-destructive measurements to determine whether the strength of these correlations is sufficient to replace destructive testing methods, and (d) determine whether support vector machine (SVM) learning can predict LOXL2-induced collagen crosslinking. The combination of exogenous LOXL2 and LINK proteins created a synergistic 4.9-fold increase in collagen crosslinking density and an 8.3-fold increase in tensile strength as compared with control (CTL). Compressive relaxation modulus was increased 5.9-fold with addition of LOXL2 and 3.4-fold with combined treatments over CTL. FLIm parameters had strong and significant correlations with tensile properties (R2  = 0.82; p < 0.001) and compressive properties (R2  = 0.59; p < 0.001). SVM learning based on FLIm-derived parameters was capable of automating tissue maturation assessment with a discriminant ability of 98.4%. These results showed marked improvements in mechanical properties with matrix stabilization and suggest that FLIm-based tools have great potential for the non-destructive assessment of tissue-engineered cartilage.",Intrasurgical Protein Layer on Titanium Arthroplasty Explants: From the Big Twelve to the Implant Proteome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770655,Proteomics.

In this study, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) dual gene coexpression vector that encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed from an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-modified adenovirus. Silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds loaded with adenovirus vectors were fabricated by freeze-drying method. In vitro, the human endothelial-derived cell line EA.hy926 was infected with adenovirus vectors and then expressed GFP, secreted VEGF165 and Ang-1, and promoted cell proliferation effectively. The VEGF165 and Ang-1 genes loaded in the SF scaffolds significantly promoted the formation of abundant microvascular networks in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. In vivo, angiogenic genes loaded in the scaffolds promoted vascularization and collagen deposition in scaffolds, thus effectively accelerating dermal tissue regeneration in a dorsal full-thickness skin defect wound model in Sprague-Dawley rats. In conclusion, SF scaffolds loaded with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-modified adenovirus vectors encoding VEGF165 and Ang-1 could stimulate the formation of vascular networks through the effective expression of target genes in vascular endothelial cells, thereby accelerating the regeneration of dermal tissue.","Oxidation-Resistant, Cost-Effective Epoxide-Modified Polyamine Adsorbents for CO2 Capture from Various Sources Including Air.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770652,ChemSusChem,2019 05 24,"CO2 adsorbents based on the reaction of pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) or tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) with propylene oxide (PO) were easily prepared in ""one pot"" by impregnation on a silica support in water. The starting materials were readily available and inexpensive, facilitating the production of the adsorbents on a large scale. The prepared polyamine/epoxide adsorbents were efficient in capturing CO2 and could be regenerated under mild conditions (50-85 °C). They displayed a much-improved stability compared with their unmodified amine counterparts, especially under oxidative conditions. Leaching of the active organic amine became minimal or nonexistent after treatment with the epoxide. The adsorption as well as desorption kinetics were also greatly improved. The polyamine/epoxide adsorbents were able to capture CO2 from various sources including ambient air and indoor air with CO2 concentrations of only 400-1000 ppm. The presence of water, far from being detrimental, increased the adsorption capacity. Their use for indoor air quality purposes was explored."

LIG shows various pharmacological properties associated with anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in several kinds of cell lines. However, the therapeutic effects of LIG on chondrocyte apoptosis remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether LIG had an anti-apoptotic activity in sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-stimulated chondrocyte apoptosis and could delay cartilage degeneration in a surgically induced rat OA model, and elucidated the potential mechanisms. In vitro studies revealed that LIG significantly suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis and cytoskeletal remodelling, which maintained the nuclear morphology and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential. In terms of SNP, LIG treatment considerably reduced the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax and inducible nitric oxide synthase and increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner. The LIG-treated groups presented a significantly suppressed expression of activating transcription factor 2 and phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The inhibitory effect of LIG was enhanced by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and offset by the agonist anisomycin. In vivo studies demonstrated that LIG attenuated osteoarthritic cartilage destruction by inhibiting the cartilage chondrocyte apoptosis and suppressing the phosphorylation levels of activating transcription factor 2, JNK and p38 MAPK. This result was confirmed by histological analyses, micro-CT, TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical analyses. Collectively, our studies indicated that LIG protected chondrocytes against SNP-induced apoptosis and delayed articular cartilage degeneration by suppressing JNK and p38 MAPK pathways.",Application of 3-Dimensional Printing in Pediatric Living Donor Liver Transplantation: A Single-Center Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770639,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,2019 05 21,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been used to support organ transplantations. However, whether it helps remains unclear. This study aimed to present and assess the application of 3D-printed liver models in pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The 3D images were printed to touchable liver models with transparent liver parenchyma, specifically colored hepatic vessels, and biliary structures. A total of 30 consecutive recipients were enrolled in the study: 10 were operated on with the support of 3D printing (3D-printing group) and 20 (control group) were operated on without it. Detailed photographs and data of the cases in the 3D-printing group were presented. One patient underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation using the left lobe graft, in which the abdominal cavity model was also printed to test whether the planned graft fit the recipient's abdominal cavity. The 3D-printed models facilitated surgical planning and procedures, particularly in the management of hepatic veins and in the prevention of large-for-size syndrome. The operative time of donors in the 3D-printing group was significantly shorter compared with the control group (2.3 ± 0.4 versus 3.0 ± 0.4 hours; P < 0.001). Inpatient costs for donors in the 3D-printing group were 17.1% lower than those in the control group (34.6 ± 6.6 versus 41.7 ± 10.4 thousand ¥; P = 0.03). In conclusion, in small infants and complicated pediatric LDLT patients, 3D-printed models can help minimize the risk of large-for-size syndrome and graft reduction. The 3D-printed models may be conducive to liver graft procurement and intraoperative assistance in pediatric LDLT.",Ordered and Isomerically Stable Bicyclic Peptide Scaffolds Constrained through Cystine Bridges and Proline Turns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770638,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,2019 06 14,"Bicyclic peptides are attractive scaffolds for the design of potent protein binders and new therapeutics. However, peptide bicycles constrained through disulfide bonds are rarely stable or tolerant to sequence manipulation owing to disulfide isomerization, especially for peptides lacking a regular secondary structure. Herein, we report the discovery and identification of a class of bicyclic peptide scaffolds with ordered but irregular secondary structures. These peptides have a conserved cysteine/proline framework for directing the oxidative folding into a fused bicyclic structure that consists of four irregular turns and a 310 helix (characterized by NMR spectroscopy). This work shows that bicyclic peptides can be stabilized into ordered structures by manipulating both the disulfide bonds and proline-stabilized turns. In turn, this could inspire the design and engineering of multicyclic peptides with new structures and benefit the development of novel protein binders and therapeutics.","Molecular epidemiology of acute HCV infection in HIV-positive patients from Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770636,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 05 25,Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have been increasingly reported among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Asia-Pacific region.

While polymer monoliths are well-known supports for the separation of large molecules, recent developments have been made to improve their features for the separation of small molecules. The selectivity and performance of organic polymer monoliths has been improved by the incorporation of different materials, such as metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, or other types of nanostructured materials (carbon nanohorns, nanodiamonds, polyoxometalates, layered double hydroxides, or attapulgite). The surface area of polymer monoliths has been significantly increased by polymer hypercrosslinking, resulting in increased efficiency when applied to the separation of small molecules. In addition, recent exploration of less conventional supports for casting polymer monoliths, including photonic fibres and 3D printed materials, has opened new avenues for the applications of polymer monoliths in the field of separation science. Recent developments made in these topics are covered, focusing on the strategies followed by the authors to prepare the polymer monoliths and the effect of these modifications on the developed analytical applications.","Hexacoordinated Tetrel-Bonded Complexes between TF4 (T=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and NCH: Competition between σ- and π-Holes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770634,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 05 17,"In order to accommodate the approach of two NCH bases, a tetrahedral TF4 molecule (T=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) distorts into an octahedral structure in which the two bases can be situated either cis or trans to one another. The square planar geometry of TF4 , associated with the trans arrangement of the bases, is higher in energy than its see-saw structure that corresponds to the cis trimer. On the other hand, the square geometry offers an unobstructed path of the bases to the π-holes above and below the tetrel atom and hence enjoys a higher interaction energy than is the case for the σ-holes approached by the bases in the cis arrangement. When these two effects are combined, the total binding energies are more exothermic for the cis than for the trans complexes. This preference amounts to some 3 kcal mol-1 for Sn and Pb, but is amplified for the smaller tetrel atoms.",The Renew® anal insert for passive faecal incontinence: a retrospective audit of our use of a novel device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770633,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,2019 06 01,The Renew® anal insert is a recent treatment for patients who suffer from passive faecal incontinence (FI).

While 17β-estradiol is the most potent sex steroid hormone in the body and has almost equal affinity for estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (α) and beta (β), there appears to be specific ER-mediated effects on scalp hair follicles/growth, etc. Additionally, the newly discovered G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30 or GPER) and the orphan receptor, estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gamma (γ), in skin and other tissue sites have potential impacts of how estrogens via these receptors may alter scalp hair characteristics, but this remains to be elucidated. Conversely, the negative impact of the 5α-reductase enzyme and its steroid product, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, on scalp hair growth is clear. Less clear is how 17β-estradiol is stimulatory in some scalp hair studies, but inhibitory in others. This brief summary examines the potential influences of steroidogenesis via aromatase (estrogen biosynthesis) and 5α-reductase expression, their enzyme activities, and steroid products along with the concepts of how steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) and estrone sulfate may be involved in the complex hormonal, cellular/molecular signaling cascade of the hair follicle in growth and cycling.",Parry-Romberg syndrome treatment with fat transfer and a new bleaching formula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770631,Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2019 02 16,"Parry-Romberg syndrome is a hemifacial atrophy which can be complicated by melasma.

The tedious synthesis of DATB, however, has significantly diminished its utility as a catalyst, and thus the inherent chemical properties of the ring system have remained virtually unexplored. Here, a general and facile synthetic strategy that harnesses a pyrimidine-containing scaffold for the reliable installation of boron atoms is disclosed, giving rise to a series of Pym-DATBs from inexpensive materials in a modular fashion. The identification of a soluble Pym-DATB derivative allowed for the investigation of the dynamic nature of the B3 NO2 ring system, revealing differential ring-closing and -opening behaviors depending on the medium. Readily accessible Pym-DATBs proved their utility as efficient catalysts for dehydrative amidation with broad substrate scope and functional-group tolerance, offering a general and practical catalytic alternative to reagent-driven amidation.","Healthier rhythm, healthier brain?

As part of our long-term research programme on the nonmodel teleost fish Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), we aim to build one of the first catalogues of genomic variants (SNPs and indels, and deletions, duplications and inversions) in fishes and evaluate overlap of genomic variants with regions under putative selection (Tajima's D and π), and coding sequences (genes). For this, we analysed six males and six females from three locations in New Zealand and generated a high-resolution genomic variation catalogue. We characterized 20,385 SVs and found they intersected with almost a third of all annotated genes. Together with small indels, SVs account for three times more variation in the genome in terms of bases affected compared to SNPs. We found that a sizeable portion of detected SVs was in the upper and lower genomic regions of Tajima's D and π, indicating that some of these have an effect on the phenotype. Together, these results shed light on the often neglected genomic variation that is produced by SVs and highlights the need to go beyond the mere measure of SNPs when investigating evolutionary processes, such as species diversification and adaptation.",The burden of proof: The process of involving young people in research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770609,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,2019 06 10,"Patient and public involvement in research includes non-academics working with researchers, on activities from consultative tasks, to joint working, and on user-led initiatives.

One-third were included 1-year post-transplant during a cross-sectional investigation. Adherence was assessed using multiple methods: The ""Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale"" (BAASIS© ) questionnaire was used to assess self-reported adherence. The treating clinician scored patient's adherence and tacrolimus trough-concentration variability was calculated. In the analyses, the data from the different tools were dichotomized (adherent/nonadherent). The BAASIS© overall response rate was over 80%. Intensive BAASIS© assessment early after transplantation increased the chance of capturing a nonadherence event, but did not influence the 1-year adherence prevalence. The adherence tools generally captured different populations. Combining the tools, the nonadherence prevalence at 1 year was 38%. The different tools identified to a large degree different patients as nonadherent.

Xenotransplantation is considered to be an effective way to resolve the problem. Immune rejection and coagulation dysfunction are two major hurdles for the successful survival of pig xenografts in primate recipients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17, play important roles in many diseases and in allotransplantation. However, the pathological roles of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in xenotransplantation remain unclear. Here, we briefly review the signaling transduction and expression regulation of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 and evaluate their potential pathological roles in in vitro and in vivo models of xenotransplantation. We found that IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 were induced in most in vitro or in vivo xenotransplantation model. Blockade of these cytokines using gene modification, antibody, or inhibitor had different effects in xenotransplantation. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling with tocilizumab decreased CRP but did not increase xenograft survival. The one possible reason is that tocilizumab can not suppress IL-6 signaling in porcine cells or organs. Other drugs which inhibit IL-6 signaling need to be investigated in xenotransplantation model. Inhibition of TNF-α was beneficial for the survival of xenografts in pig-to-mouse, rat, or NHP models. Blockade of IL-17 using a neutralizing antibody also increased xenograft survival in several animal models. However, the role of IL-17 in the pig-to-NHP xenotransplantation model remains unclear and needs to be further investigated. Moreover, blockade of TNF-α and IL-6 together has got a better effect in pig-to-baboon kidney xenotransplantation.

To achieve a wide range of droplet manipulation, hydrophilic patterns, known as surface energy traps, are introduced onto the Teflon-coated hydrophobic substrate. However, the Teflon-coated substrate is difficult to modify because it is nonwettable, and existing techniques for patterning surface energy traps have many limitations. Inspired by the mussel adhesion mechanism, we use polydopamine, a bioinspired substance that adheres strongly to almost any materials, to pattern surface energy traps on the Teflon-coated substrate with a great ease. We have optimized the polydopamine coating protocol and characterized the surface properties of the polydopamine surface energy traps. Droplet operations including particle extraction, liquid dispensing, liquid shaping, and cross-platform transfer have been demonstrated on the polydopamine surface energy trap-enabled magnetic digital microfluidic platform in both single-plate and two-plate configurations. Furthermore, the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen using ELISA has been demonstrated on the new magnetic dgitial microfluidic platform. This new bioinspired magnetic digital microfluidic platform is easy to fabricate and operate, showing a great potential for point-of-care applications.",PPAR-γ: Its ligand and its regulation by microRNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770587,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 16,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARs are categorized into three subtypes, PPARα, β/δ, and γ, encoded by different genes, expressed in diverse tissues and participate in various biological functions and can be activated by their metabolic derivatives in the body or dietary fatty acids. The PPAR-γ also takes parts in the regulation of energy balance, lipoprotein metabolism, insulin sensitivity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling. It has been implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancers. Among various cellular and molecular targets that are able to regulate PPAR-γ and its underlying pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs) appeared as important regulators. Given that the deregulation of these molecules via targeting PPAR-γ could affect initiation and progression of various diseases, identification of miRNAs that affects PPAR-γ could contribute to the better understanding of roles of PPAR-γ in various biological and pathological conditions. Here, we have summarized the function and various ligands of PPAR-γ and have highlighted various miRNAs involved in the regulation of PPAR-γ.",Improvements cardiometabolic risk factors in Latin American Amerindians (the Mapuche) with concurrent training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770586,Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2019 06 06,"Our aim was to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of CT (ie, high-intensity interval and resistance training) in Mapuche adults from Chile and in their peers of European descent. In total, 96 hyperglycemic adult women (mean age 46 years [95% confidence interval; 38, 53]) were divided in four groups: Mapuche CT (Map-CT, n = 14) or control group (Map-CG, n = 44), and European CT (Eur-CT, n = 14) or control group (Eur-CG, n = 23). The following endpoints were analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks: anthropometric (body mass, body mass index, waist circumference), body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, lean mass), cardiovascular (systolic [SBP]/diastolic [DBP] blood pressure), metabolic (blood fasting glucose and total cholesterol), and muscle strength (handgrip of dominant/non-dominant arm). There were significant positive changes in body mass, body fat, and muscle mass (P < 0.0001) in both Map-CT and Eur-CT groups, whereas waist circumference was decreased significantly only in the Eur-CT group (P < 0.0001). Both Map-CT and Eur-CT groups showed decreased levels of fasting glucose (P < 0.05) and total cholesterol after the intervention (P < 0.0001). Also, both Map-CT (P < 0.05) and Eur-CT (P = 0.01) groups showed a lowered SBP. Finally, significant increases were observed after training in handgrip strength (dominant arm) in Map-CT and Eur-CT groups (both P < 0.0001). CT led to similar improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors for metabolic syndrome development in Mapuche and European participants, with additional improvements in other anthropometric, body composition, cardiovascular, metabolic, and muscle strength parameters related to the prevention of metabolic syndrome.

The molecular reorientation processes for anions and cations alike are found to be significantly affected by the presence of the glass interface at high temperatures. In this respect, the ionic liquid behaves similarly to polar liquids where proton NMR relaxation is governed by reorientations mediated by translational displacements (RMTDs). This process becomes less significant towards lower temperatures when the characteristic translational correlation times of the ions approach a timescale comparable with those of the RMTD process, and the relaxation dispersions in bulk and in confinement become similar below a temperature corresponding to about 1.2Tg , a value where the onset of dynamic heterogeneity has been observed before. The self-diffusion coefficient, on the other hand, is found to be strongly reduced than the bulk within the accessible temperature range of 248 K and above and is significantly slower than expected from the tortuosity effect, suggesting that ion-surface interactions affect the macroscopic properties.",Emotional feeding as interpersonal emotion regulation: A developmental risk factor for binge-eating behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770584,The International journal of eating disorders,2019 05 03,"Emotional feeding is an interpersonal emotion regulation strategy wherein people provide food to others as a means of influencing the recipient's emotional response.

These reactions work as fundamental gear to accomplish the CO2 fixation and thus to build up more complex molecules through different technological and biochemical processes. In this context, a correct description of the CO2 electronic structure turns out to be crucial to study the chemical and electronic properties associated with this kind of reactions. Here, a systematic study of CO2 electronic structure and its contribution to different carboxylation reaction electronic energies has been carried out by means of several high-level ab initio post-Hartree Fock (post-HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a set of biochemistry and inorganic systems. We have found that for a correct description of the CO2 electronic correlation energy it is necessary to include post-CCSD(T) contributions (beyond the gold standard). These high-order excitations are required to properly describe the interactions of the four π-electrons associated with the two degenerated π-molecular orbitals of the CO2 molecule. Likewise, our results show that in some reactions it is possible to obtain accurate reaction electronic energy values with computationally less demanding methods when the error in the electronic correlation energy compensates between reactants and products. Furthermore, the provided post-HF reference values allowed to validating different DFT exchange-correlation functionals combined with different basis sets for chemical reactions that are relevant in biochemical CO2 fixing enzymes. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Thyroid hormone receptors are required for the action of thyroid hormone in fetal cardiomyocytes. Loss of thyroid hormone receptor (TR)α1 abolishes T3 signalling via extracellular signal-related kinase and Akt in fetal cardiomyocytes. The expression of TRα1 and TRβ1 in ovine fetal myocardium increases with age, although TRα1 levels always remain higher than those of TRβ1. Near term fetal cardiac myocytes are more sensitive than younger myocytes to thyroid receptor blockade by antagonist, NH3, and to the effects of TRα1/α2 short interfering RNA. Although T3 is known to abrogate ovine cardiomyocyte proliferation stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1, this effect is mediated via the genomic action of thyroid hormone receptors, with little evidence for non-genomic mechanisms.",Exotic plant species are locally adapted but not to high ultraviolet-B radiation: a reciprocal multispecies experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770567,Ecology,2019 04 29,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation intensities differ among global regions, with significantly higher levels in the southern hemisphere. UV-B may act as an environmental filter during plant invasions, which might particularly apply to plant species from Europe introduced to New Zealand. Just like for any other abiotic or biotic filter, successful invaders can cope with novel environmental conditions via plastic responses and/or through rapid adaptation by natural selection in the exotic range. We conducted a multispecies experiment with herbaceous plants in two common gardens located in the species' native and exotic ranges, in Germany and New Zealand, respectively. We used plants of German and New Zealand origin of eight species to test for adaptation to higher UV-B radiation in their new range. In each common garden, all plants were exposed to three radiation treatments: (1) ambient sunlight, (2) exclusion of UV-B while transmitting ambient UV-A, and (3) combined exclusion of UV-B and UV-A. Linear mixed-effect models revealed significant effects of UV-B on growth and leaf traits and an indication for UV-B-induced biomass reduction in both common gardens pointing to an impact of natural, ambient UV radiation intensities experienced by plants in the northern and in the southern hemisphere. In both common gardens, the respective local plants (i.e., German origins in Germany, New Zealand origins in New Zealand) displayed enhanced productivity and aboveground biomass allocation, thus providing evidence for recent evolutionary processes in the exotic range. Genetic differentiation between different origins in consequence of divergent local selection pressures was found for specific leaf area. This differentiation particularly hints at different selective forces in both ranges while only little evidence was found for an immediate selective effect of high UV-B intensities in the exotic range. However, reaction norm slopes across ranges revealed higher plasticity of exotic individuals in functional leaf traits that might allow for a more sensitive regulation of photoprotection measures in response to UV-B. During the colonization, New Zealand populations might have been selected for the observed higher phenotypic plasticity and a consequently increased ability to successfully spread in the exotic range.",Design and synthesis of novel celastrol derivative and its antitumor activity in hepatoma cells and antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770566,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 16,"Two series of celastrol derivatives were designed and synthesized by modifying carboxylic acid at the 28th position with amino acid, and their intermediates with isobutyrate at the third position. All compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferation activity by four human cancer cell lines (SCG7901, HGC27, HepG2, and Bel7402) and one normal cell LO2. The most promising compound, compound 8, showed superior bioactivity and lower toxicity than others including celastrol. Further underlying tests illustrated that compound 8 induced apoptosis and cell arrest at G2/M and inhibited proliferation and mobility of human hepatoma cells by suppressing the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 signaling pathway. Besides these, a highly accurate and reproducible high performance liquid chromatography protocol was established to determine celastrol and compound 8 absorption in zebrafish, and results demonstrated that their concentration increased rapidly within 4 hr in a time-dependent manner and the concentration of compound 8 was higher than that of celastrol. In addition, without detection at 12 hr, compound 8 was rapidly metabolized in vivo. These findings are very helpful for the structural modification of celastrol and other bioactive compounds to improve their bioactivity, toxicity, and absorption.",Negative frequency-dependent growth underlies the stable coexistence of two cosmopolitan aquatic plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770565,Ecology,2019 04 29,"Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms influencing species coexistence remains a major challenge for the study of community ecology. These mechanisms, which stem from species' differential responses to competition and their environments, promote coexistence if they give each species a growth advantage when rare. Yet despite the widespread assumption that co-occurring species stably coexist, there have been few empirical demonstrations in support of this claim. Likewise, coexistence is often assumed to result from interspecific differences in life-history traits, but the relative contributions of these trait differences to coexistence are rarely quantified, particularly across environmental gradients. Using two widely co-occurring and ecologically similar species of freshwater duckweed plants (Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor), we tested hypotheses that interspecific differences in facultative dormancy behaviors, thermal reaction norms, and density-dependent growth promote coexistence between these species, and that their relative influences on coexistence change as average temperatures and fluctuations around them vary. In competition experiments, we found strong evidence for negative frequency-dependent growth across a range of both static and fluctuating temperatures, suggesting a critical role of fluctuation-independent stabilization in coexistence. This negative frequency dependence could be explained by our observation that for both species, intraspecific competition was over 1.5 times stronger than interspecific competition, granting each species a low-density growth advantage. Using an empirically parameterized competition model, we found that while coexistence was facilitated by environmental fluctuations, fluctuation-independent stabilization via negative frequency dependence was crucial for coexistence. Conversely, the temporal storage effect, an important fluctuation-dependent mechanism, was relatively weak in comparison. Contrary to expectations, differences in the species' thermal reaction norms and dormancy behaviors did not significantly promote coexistence in fluctuating environments. Our results highlight how coexistence in two ubiquitous and ostensibly similar aquatic plants is not necessarily a product of their most obvious interspecific differences, and instead results from subtle niche differences causing negative frequency-dependent growth, which acts consistently on both species across environmental gradients.","Relativism or tolerance?

Histone acetylation at H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ac) is closely associated with gene expression and DNA damage. However, whether H3K14ac participates in mediating Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell proliferation and migration in uveal melanoma cells remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of H3K14ac on Ras-ERK1/2 affected uveal melanoma cell phenotypes. MP65 cells were transfected with Ras WT and Ras G12V/T35S , the unloaded plasmid of pEGFP-N1 served as a negative control. Protein levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 Thr202 and H3K14ac were assessed by western blot assay. Cell viability, number of colonies, migration, and the downstream genes of ERK1/2 were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, soft-agar colony formation, transwell, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. HA-tag vectors of CLR3 and TIP60 and the small interfering RNAs that specific for CLR3 and MDM2 were transfected into MP65 cells to uncover the effects of CLR3, TIP60, and MDM2 on Ras-ERK1/2 mediated H3K14ac expression and MP65 cell phenotypes. We found that, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac expression in MP65 cells, and H3K14ac significantly suppressed Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell viability, colony formation, and migration in MP65 cells. Moreover, the transcription of CYR61, IGFBP3, WNT16B, NT5E, GDF15, and CARD16 was regulated by H3K14ac. Additionally, CLR3 silence recovered H3K14ac expression and reversed the effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on MP65 cell proliferation, migration and the mRNAs of ERK1/2 downstream genes. Besides, Ras-ERK1/2 decreased H3K14ac expression by MDM2-mediated TIP60 degradation.

The focus of our current study was to mechanistically understand PS80 oxidation by studying the impact of temperature, light, stainless steel and the role of citrate and EDTA. Additionally, PS80 oxidation was studied in three different buffer sytems: histidine, citrate, and phosphate. When the PS80 containing buffers were exposed to elevated temperature of 50 °C in glass containers, no PS80 oxidation was observed in either histidine and citrate buffer systems after 30 days; however, PS80 oxidation was observed in phosphate buffer within 14 days. This study demonstrated that temperature does not initiate PS80 oxidation in histidine or citrate buffer systems, but may be a factor in phosphate buffer. When the 3 buffer systems containing PS80 were exposed to 20, 50, and 100 % ICH Q1B light conditions and subsequently incubated at 50°C (dark), the PS80 in phosphate buffer underwent oxidation within 7 days, whereas the PS80 in histidine and citrate buffer systems showed oxidation products only after 14 and 35 days, respectively. While PS80 in phosphate buffer seemed to be most vulnerable to light, PS80 in both histidine and citrate buffers underwent oxidation to a lesser extent, with the histidine buffer showing rapid oxidation compared to citrate buffer. Finally, the ability of citrate and EDTA to act not only as chelators, but also as a radical quencher/scavengers was demonstrated when metal ions such as Fe (2+) were spiked into histidine buffer containing PS80. While radicals could not be unambiguously identified by NMR or EPR, the observation of PS80 oxidation products indicate their presence.",Provable Data Integrity in the Pharmaceutical Industry based on Version Control Systems and the Blockchain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770485,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,2019 02 16,"In the pharmaceutical industry, process validation tasks are based on the generated process raw and derived analytical results. Risks to fail in process validation, affect both, the patient's safety as well as the economic success of the manufacturing company. Hence, data integrity is highly critical in this area. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, reacted to past data integrity breaches, by publishing new guidelines on data integrity for the correct handling of data in the pharmaceutical context. In this contribution, we want to show how data integrity can be improved on a technological level, removing the need for trusted third parties and centralized systems for this task. Therefore, we implemented an approach that uses existing tools, today mostly used by software developers, and combined them with a new smart contract built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. In a case study, we test how data manipulation or back-dating of results can be easily detected and how regulatory agencies can audit the complete data flow, from the regulatory report back to the original raw data. The results of this contribution outline a possible roadmap for the development of production-ready tools, like versioned database systems that natively interoperate with distributed ledgers. This will improve the trustworthiness of pharmaceutical manufacturing data by doing both, protecting the intellectual property of the industrial company and improving the safety of the patients.","What Does It Really Look Like to Properly Address a ""Human Error Problem"" in Biopharma? The Human Performance Blue-Sky Description That Will Help Improve Industry Performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770484,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,2019 02 16,"Human Performance is an integrated risk management approach to improving systems, that includes human factors and systems safety, that leads to higher reliability and enhanced operational resilience. A clear picture of what Human Performance looks like in biopharma is available from the BioPhorum Operations Group (BPOG), where members of the Human Performance workstream have defined a blue-sky for the industry. This blue-sky document is both a guide and an assessment tool that will help to identify the steps to effective human performance integration with operations. The effort to improve reliable operations within biopharma using elements of human performance borrowed from other industries has experienced uneven results and slow progress across the last seven years and has been bogged down for multiple significant reasons. These include a mental model that persists within the industry where workers are assumed to be the problem that needs fixing, the mistaken belief that Lean practices (intended to improve productivity & efficiency) is a cure-all and nearly equivalent to human performance, neglecting the need to fundamentally rethink why and how investigations are performed, and truly underestimating the time, effort, strength of sponsor support needed to change how work is designed, executed, and then later learned from.",Enabling Robust and Rapid Raw Material Identification and Release by Handheld Raman Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770483,PDA journal of pharmaceutical science and technology,2019 02 16,"A fast, reproducible, non-destructive method is desired to confirm raw material identification in real-time upon receipt within a warehouse environment. Current practices in pharmaceutical manufacturing often employs compendia methods for raw material identification tests, which require sample preparation prior to time consuming chemical analysis and often employ subjective spectral comparisons. We have developed, qualified and validated a rapid objective identity method (""Rapid ID"") by Raman spectroscopy using the Bruker BRAVO handheld Raman spectrometer for forty-six (46) common raw materials used in upstream and downstream biopharmaceutical cell culture based processes. Materials in the Raman identification library include amino acids and other solid neat organic chemicals, liquid organics, polyatomic salts, polymers, emulsifiers, peptides, aqueous solutions and buffers. Selection of reference spectra and hit quality index limit(s) was based upon a comprehensive spectral survey across multiple suppliers and lots to account for normal cause spectral variation. Method repeatability and reproducibility, selectivity, and robustness against various operational and environmental factors (e.g., instrumental variance, material packaging, and thermal effects) were evaluated. Benefits of a handheld Raman Rapid ID approach include significant time reduction of raw material quality release from weeks to minutes, enhanced objectivity, and robust data integrity via autonomous electronic reporting. Additionally, routine collection of rich spectroscopic data on raw materials can be leveraged to support further continuous improvement initiatives, including routine monitoring of method performance, continuous improvement of the library, proactively detecting shifts in raw material properties and providing data for investigations focused on raw materials. Rapid ID methods are consistent with the move toward the principles of Pharma 4.0: high automated processes with continuous process verification and a holistic control strategy."

This process is poorly defined and likely requires the participation of host proteins in concert with viral proteins. In this study, we employed a proteomics-based approach, named RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID), to comprehensively screen for host proteins that bind to a conserved motif within the rotavirus (RV) 3' terminus. Using this assay, we identified ATP5B, a core subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, as having high affinity to the RV 3'UTR consensus sequences. During RV infection, ATP5B bound to the RV 3'UTR and co-localized with viral RNA and viroplasm. Functionally, siRNA-mediated genetic depletion of ATP5B or other ATP synthase subunits such as ATP5A1 and ATP5O reduced the production of infectious viral progeny without significant alteration of intracellular viral RNA levels or RNA translation. Chemical inhibition of ATP synthase diminished RV yield in both conventional cell culture and in human intestinal enteroids, indicating that ATP5B positively regulates late-stage RV maturation in primary intestinal epithelial cells. Collectively, our results shed light on the role of host proteins in RV genome assembly and particle formation and identify ATP5B as a novel pro-RV RNA-binding protein, contributing to our understanding of how host ATP synthases may galvanize virus growth and pathogenesis.","Cholesterol depletion inhibits Na+,K+-ATPase activity in a near-native membrane environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770471,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 10,"Cholesterol's effects on Na+,K+-ATPase reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles have been extensively studied. However, previous studies have reported both cholesterol-mediated stimulation and inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Here, using partial reaction kinetics determined via stopped-flow experiments, we studied cholesterol's effect on Na+,K+-ATPase in a near-native environment in which purified membrane fragments were depleted of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD). The mβCD-treated Na+,K+-ATPase had significantly reduced overall activity and exhibited decreased observed rate constants for ATP phosphorylation (ENa3+ → E2P, i.e. phosphorylation by ATP and Na+ occlusion from the cytoplasm) and K+ deocclusion with subsequent intracellular Na+ binding (E2K2+ → E1Na3+). However, cholesterol depletion did not affect the observed rate constant for K+ occlusion by phosphorylated Na+,K+-ATPase on the extracellular face and subsequent dephosphorylation (E2P → E2K2+). Thus, partial reactions involving cation binding and release at the protein's intracellular side were most dependent on cholesterol. Fluorescence measurements with the probe eosin indicated that cholesterol depletion stabilizes the unphosphorylated E2 state relative to E1, and the cholesterol depletion-induced slowing of ATP phosphorylation kinetics was consistent with partial conversion of Na+,K+-ATPase into the E2 state, requiring a slow E2 → E1 transition before the phosphorylation. Molecular dynamics simulations of Na+,K+-ATPase in membranes with 40 mol % cholesterol revealed cholesterol interaction sites that differ markedly among protein conformations. They further indicated state-dependent effects on membrane shape, with the E2 state being likely disfavored in cholesterol-rich bilayers relative to the E1P state because of a greater hydrophobic mismatch. In summary, cholesterol extraction from membranes significantly decreases Na+,K+-ATPase steady-state activity.",HDAC6 regulates DNA damage response via deacetylating MLH1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770470,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 13,"MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) is a key DNA mismatch repair protein, which plays an important role in maintenance of genomic stability and the DNA damage response. Here, we report that MLH1 is a novel substrate of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). HDAC6 interacts with and deacetylates MLH1 both in vitro and in vivo Interestingly, deacetylation of MLH1 blocks the assembly of the MutSα-MutLα complex. Moreover, we have identified four novel acetylation sites in MLH1 by MS analysis. The deacetylation mimetic mutant, but not the WT and the acetylation mimetic mutant, of MLH1 confers resistance to 6-thioguanine. Overall, our findings suggest that the MutSα-MutLα complex serves as a sensor for DNA damage response and that HDAC6 disrupts the MutSα-MutLα complex by deacetylation of MLH1, leading to the tolerance of DNA damage.",Polyglutamylation of tubulin's C-terminal tail controls pausing and motility of kinesin-3 family member KIF1A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770469,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 01,"The kinesin-3 family member KIF1A plays a critical role in site-specific neuronal cargo delivery during axonal transport. KIF1A cargo is mislocalized in many neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that KIF1A's highly efficient, superprocessive motility along axonal microtubules needs to be tightly regulated. One potential regulatory mechanism may be through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of axonal microtubules. These PTMs often occur on the C-terminal tails of the microtubule tracks, act as molecular ""traffic signals"" helping to direct kinesin motor cargo delivery, and include C-terminal tail polyglutamylation important for KIF1A cargo transport. KIF1A initially interacts with microtubule C-terminal tails through its K-loop, a positively charged surface loop of the KIF1A motor domain. However, the role of the K-loop in KIF1A motility and response to perturbations in C-terminal tail polyglutamylation is underexplored. Using single-molecule imaging, we present evidence that KIF1A pauses on different microtubule lattice structures, linking multiple processive segments together and contributing to KIF1A's characteristic superprocessive run length. Furthermore, modifications of the KIF1A K-loop or tubulin C-terminal tail polyglutamylation reduced KIF1A pausing and overall run length. These results suggest a new mechanism to regulate KIF1A motility via pauses mediated by K-loop/polyglutamylated C-terminal tail interactions, providing further insight into KIF1A's role in axonal transport.",Specificity of the chromophore-binding site in human cone opsins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770468,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 18,"The variable composition of the chromophore-binding pocket in visual receptors is essential for vision. The visual phototransduction starts with the cis-trans isomerization of the retinal chromophore upon absorption of photons. Despite sharing the common 11-cis-retinal chromophore, rod and cone photoreceptors possess distinct photochemical properties. Thus, a detailed molecular characterization of the chromophore-binding pocket of these receptors is critical to understanding the differences in the photochemistry of vision between rods and cones. Unlike for rhodopsin (Rh), the crystal structures of cone opsins remain to be determined. To obtain insights into the specific chromophore-protein interactions that govern spectral tuning in human visual pigments, here we harnessed the unique binding properties of 11-cis-6-membered-ring-retinal (11-cis-6mr-retinal) with human blue, green, and red cone opsins. To unravel the specificity of the chromophore-binding pocket of cone opsins, we applied 11-cis-6mr-retinal analog-binding analyses to human blue, green, and red cone opsins. Our results revealed that among the three cone opsins, only blue cone opsin can accommodate the 11-cis-6mr-retinal in its chromophore-binding pocket, resulting in the formation of a synthetic blue pigment (B6mr) that absorbs visible light. A combination of primary sequence alignment, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis experiments revealed the specific amino acid residue 6.48 (Tyr-262 in blue cone opsins and Trp-281 in green and red cone opsins) as a selectivity filter in human cone opsins. Altogether, the results of our study uncover the molecular basis underlying the binding selectivity of 11-cis-6mr-retinal to the cone opsins.",The malate-activated ALMT12 anion channel in the grass Brachypodium distachyon is co-activated by Ca2+/calmodulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770467,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 17,"In plants, strict regulation of stomatal pores is critical for modulation of CO2 fixation and transpiration. Under certain abiotic and biotic stressors, pore closure is initiated through anionic flux, with calcium (Ca2+) playing a central role. The aluminum-activated malate transporter 12 (ALMT12) is a malate-activated, voltage-dependent member of the aluminum-activated malate transporter family that has been implicated in anionic flux from guard cells controlling the stomatal aperture. Herein, we report the characterization of the regulatory mechanisms mediating channel activities of an ALMT from the grass Brachypodium distachyon (BdALMT12) that has the highest sequence identity to Arabidopsis thaliana ALMT12. Electrophysiological studies in a heterologous cell system confirmed that this channel is malate- and voltage-dependent. However, this was shown to be true only in the presence of Ca2+ Although a general kinase inhibitor increased the current density of BdALMT12, a calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor reduced the Ca2+-dependent channel activation. We investigated the physiological relevance of the CaM-based regulation in planta, where stomatal closure, induced by exogenous Ca2+ ionophore and malate, was shown to be inhibited by exogenous application of a CaM inhibitor. Subsequent analyses revealed that the double substitutions R335A/R338A and R335A/K342A, within a predicted BdALMT12 CaM-binding domain (CBD), also decreased the channels' ability to activate. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and CBD-mimetic peptides, as well as CaM-agarose affinity pulldown of full-length recombinant BdALMT12, we confirmed the physical interaction between the CBD and CaM. Together, these findings support a co-regulatory mechanism of BdALMT12 activation by malate, and Ca2+/CaM, emphasizing that a complex regulatory network modulates BdALMT12 activity.","VisMET: a passive, efficient, and sensitive assessment of visuospatial memory in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770466,"Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)",2019 03 10,"The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is one of the earliest sites of cortical pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visuospatial memory paradigms that are mediated by the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit may offer a means to detect memory impairment during the early stages of AD. In this study, we developed a 4-min visuospatial memory paradigm called VisMET (Visuospatial Memory Eye-Tracking Task) that passively assesses memory using eye movements rather than explicit memory judgements. We had 296 control or memory-impaired participants view a set of images followed by a modified version of the images with either an object removed, or a new object added. Healthy controls spent significantly more time viewing these manipulations compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment and AD. Using a logistic regression model, the amount of time that individuals viewed these manipulations could predict cognitive impairment and disease status with an out of sample area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.85. Based on these results, VisMET offers a passive, sensitive, and efficient memory paradigm capable of detecting objective memory impairment and predicting cognitive and disease status.",Spatial memory formation requires netrin-1 expression by neurons in the adult mammalian brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770464,"Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)",2019 03 10,"Netrin-1 was initially characterized as an axon guidance molecule that is essential for normal embryonic neural development; however, many types of neurons continue to express netrin-1 in the postnatal and adult mammalian brain. Netrin-1 and the netrin receptor DCC are both enriched at synapses. In the adult hippocampus, activity-dependent secretion of netrin-1 by neurons potentiates glutamatergic synapse function, and is critical for long-term potentiation, an experimental cellular model of learning and memory. Here, we assessed the impact of neuronal expression of netrin-1 in the adult brain on behavior using tests of learning and memory. We show that adult mice exhibit impaired spatial memory following conditional deletion of netrin-1 from glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex. Further, we provide evidence that mice with conditional deletion of netrin-1 do not display aberrant anxiety-like phenotypes and show a reduction in self-grooming behavior. These findings reveal a critical role for netrin-1 expressed by neurons in the regulation of spatial memory formation.",Knowledge about the predictive value of reward conditioned stimuli modulates their interference with cognitive processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770463,"Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)",2019 03 10,"Stimuli conditioned with a substance can generate drug-approach behaviors due to their acquired motivational properties. According to implicit theories of addiction, these stimuli can decrease cognitive control automatically. The present study (n = 49) examined whether reward-associated stimuli can interfere with cognitive processes in the absence of knowledge about stimulus-outcome contingencies. Conditioned stimuli (CS) were paired with high-reward (HR) or low-reward (LR) probabilities of monetary reward using a Pavlovian learning task. Participants were categorized as Aware or Unaware of contingencies using a Bayesian analysis. CS were then used as task-irrelevant distractors in modified flanker and N-back tasks. Results show HR CS can generate increased interference in the flanker task for participants Unaware of contingencies, contributing further evidence for the existence of implicit Pavlovian conditioning. For the N-back task, working memory performance was affected by HR CS, albeit only for Aware participants. These results suggest that CS can interfere implicitly with cognitive processes in a similar way to drug-related stimuli. Such an effect could occur in a stimulus-driven fashion, devoid of top-down goal-directedness. These findings have implications for the conceptualization and study of implicit processes in addiction and highlights the necessity to reconsider the measurement of such phenomena.",FT Modulates Genome-Wide DNA-Binding of the bZIP Transcription Factor FD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770462,Plant physiology,2019 05 10,"The transition to flowering is a crucial step in the plant life cycle that is controlled by multiple endogenous and environmental cues, including hormones, sugars, temperature, and photoperiod. Permissive photoperiod induces the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the phloem companion cells of leaves. The FT protein then acts as a florigen that is transported to the shoot apical meristem, where it physically interacts with the Basic Leucine Zipper Domain transcription factor FD and 14-3-3 proteins. However, despite the importance of FD in promoting flowering, its direct transcriptional targets are largely unknown. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify targets of FD at the genome scale and assessed the contribution of FT to DNA binding. We further investigated the ability of FD to form protein complexes with FT and TERMINAL FLOWER1 through interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Importantly, we observed direct binding of FD to targets involved in several aspects of plant development. These target genes were previously unknown to be directly related to the regulation of flowering time. Our results confirm FD as a central regulator of floral transition at the shoot meristem and provide evidence for crosstalk between the regulation of flowering and other signaling pathways, such as pathways involved in hormone signaling."

One function of this metric may be to help localize the firing fields of hippocampal place cells during formation and use of the hippocampal spatial representation (""cognitive map""). Of theoretical importance is the question of how this metric, and the resulting map, is configured in 3D space. We find here that when the body plane is vertical as rats climb a wall, grid cells produce stable, almost-circular grid-cell firing fields. This contrasts with previous findings when the body was aligned horizontally during vertical exploration, suggesting a role for the body plane in orienting the plane of the grid cell map. However, in the present experiment, the fields on the wall were fewer and larger, suggesting an altered or absent odometric (distance-measuring) process. Several physiological indices of running speed in the entorhinal cortex showed reduced gain, which may explain the enlarged grid pattern. Hippocampal place fields were found to be sparser but unchanged in size/shape. Together, these observations suggest that the orientation and scale of the grid cell map, at least on a surface, are determined by an interaction between egocentric information (the body plane) and allocentric information (the gravity axis). This may be mediated by the different sensory or locomotor information available on a vertical surface and means that the resulting map has different properties on a vertical plane than a horizontal plane (i.e., is anisotropic).",Probing the link between residual entropy and viscosity of molecular fluids and model potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770449,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"This work investigates the link between residual entropy and viscosity based on wide-ranging, highly accurate experimental and simulation data. This link was originally postulated by Rosenfeld in 1977 [Rosenfeld Y (1977) Phys Rev A 15:2545-2549], and it is shown that this scaling results in an approximately monovariate relationship between residual entropy and reduced viscosity for a wide range of molecular fluids [argon, methane, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], refrigerant R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), refrigerant R-125 (pentafluoroethane), methanol, and water] and a range of model potentials (hard sphere, inverse power, Lennard-Jones, and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen). While the proposed ""universal"" correlation of Rosenfeld is shown to be far from universal, when used with the appropriate density scaling for molecular fluids, the viscosity of nonassociating molecular fluids can be mapped onto the model potentials. This mapping results in a length scale that is proportional to the cube root of experimentally measurable liquid volume values.",TRPM7 is the central gatekeeper of intestinal mineral absorption essential for postnatal survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770447,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"Zn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are essential minerals required for a plethora of metabolic processes and signaling pathways. Different categories of cation-selective channels and transporters are therefore required to tightly control the cellular levels of individual metals in a cell-specific manner. However, the mechanisms responsible for the organismal balance of these essential minerals are poorly understood. Herein, we identify a central and indispensable role of the channel-kinase TRPM7 for organismal mineral homeostasis. The function of TRPM7 was assessed by single-channel analysis of TRPM7, phenotyping of TRPM7-deficient cells in conjunction with metabolic profiling of mice carrying kidney- and intestine-restricted null mutations in Trpm7 and animals with a global ""kinase-dead"" point mutation in the gene. The TRPM7 channel reconstituted in lipid bilayers displayed a similar permeability to Zn2+ and Mg2+ Consistently, we found that endogenous TRPM7 regulates the total content of Zn2+ and Mg2+ in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, genetic inactivation of intestinal rather than kidney TRPM7 caused profound deficiencies specifically of Zn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ at the organismal level, a scenario incompatible with early postnatal growth and survival. In contrast, global ablation of TRPM7 kinase activity did not affect mineral homeostasis, reinforcing the importance of the channel activity of TRPM7. Finally, dietary Zn2+ and Mg2+ fortifications significantly extended the survival of offspring lacking intestinal TRPM7. Hence, the organismal balance of divalent cations critically relies on one common gatekeeper, the intestinal TRPM7 channel.",Single-molecule excitation-emission spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770446,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"Single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) provides a detailed view of individual emitter properties and local environments without having to resort to ensemble averaging. While the last several decades have seen substantial refinement of SMS techniques, recording excitation spectra of single emitters still poses a significant challenge. Here we address this problem by demonstrating simultaneous collection of fluorescence emission and excitation spectra using a compact common-path interferometer and broadband excitation, which is implemented as an extension of a standard SMS microscope. We demonstrate the technique by simultaneously collecting room-temperature excitation and emission spectra of individual terrylene diimide molecules and donor-acceptor dyads embedded in polystyrene. We analyze the resulting spectral parameters in terms of optical lineshape theory to obtain detailed information on the interactions of the emitters with their nanoscopic environment. This analysis finally reveals that environmental fluctuations between the donor and acceptor in the dyads are not correlated.",Motor neuron disease-associated loss of nuclear TDP-43 is linked to DNA double-strand break repair defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770445,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 24,"Genome damage and their defective repair have been etiologically linked to degenerating neurons in many subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients; however, the specific mechanisms remain enigmatic. The majority of sporadic ALS patients feature abnormalities in the transactivation response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), whose nucleo-cytoplasmic mislocalization is characteristically observed in spinal motor neurons. While emerging evidence suggests involvement of other RNA/DNA binding proteins, like FUS in DNA damage response (DDR), the role of TDP-43 in DDR has not been investigated. Here, we report that TDP-43 is a critical component of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. TDP-43 is rapidly recruited at DSB sites to stably interact with DDR and NHEJ factors, specifically acting as a scaffold for the recruitment of break-sealing XRCC4-DNA ligase 4 complex at DSB sites in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons. shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated conditional depletion of TDP-43 markedly increases accumulation of genomic DSBs by impairing NHEJ repair, and thereby, sensitizing neurons to DSB stress. Finally, TDP-43 pathology strongly correlates with DSB repair defects, and damage accumulation in the neuronal genomes of sporadic ALS patients and in Caenorhabditis elegans mutant with TDP-1 loss-of-function. Our findings thus link TDP-43 pathology to impaired DSB repair and persistent DDR signaling in motor neuron disease, and suggest that DSB repair-targeted therapies may ameliorate TDP-43 toxicity-induced genome instability in motor neuron disease.",Deep elastic strain engineering of bandgap through machine learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770444,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"Nanoscale specimens of semiconductor materials as diverse as silicon and diamond are now known to be deformable to large elastic strains without inelastic relaxation. These discoveries harbinger a new age of deep elastic strain engineering of the band structure and device performance of electronic materials. Many possibilities remain to be investigated as to what pure silicon can do as the most versatile electronic material and what an ultrawide bandgap material such as diamond, with many appealing functional figures of merit, can offer after overcoming its present commercial immaturity. Deep elastic strain engineering explores full six-dimensional space of admissible nonlinear elastic strain and its effects on physical properties. Here we present a general method that combines machine learning and ab initio calculations to guide strain engineering whereby material properties and performance could be designed. This method invokes recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence by utilizing a limited amount of ab initio data for the training of a surrogate model, predicting electronic bandgap within an accuracy of 8 meV. Our model is capable of discovering the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and semiconductor-to-metal transition in silicon by scanning the entire strain space. It is also able to identify the most energy-efficient strain pathways that would transform diamond from an ultrawide-bandgap material to a smaller-bandgap semiconductor. A broad framework is presented to tailor any target figure of merit by recourse to deep elastic strain engineering and machine learning for a variety of applications in microelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, and energy technologies.",Emergence of analogy from relation learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770443,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"By middle childhood, humans are able to learn abstract semantic relations (e.g., antonym, synonym, category membership) and use them to reason by analogy. A deep theoretical challenge is to show how such abstract relations can arise from nonrelational inputs, thereby providing key elements of a protosymbolic representation system. We have developed a computational model that exploits the potential synergy between deep learning from ""big data"" (to create semantic features for individual words) and supervised learning from ""small data"" (to create representations of semantic relations between words). Given as inputs labeled pairs of lexical representations extracted by deep learning, the model creates augmented representations by remapping features according to the rank of differences between values for the two words in each pair. These augmented representations aid in coping with the feature alignment problem (e.g., matching those features that make ""love-hate"" an antonym with the different features that make ""rich-poor"" an antonym). The model extracts weight distributions that are used to estimate the probabilities that new word pairs instantiate each relation, capturing the pattern of human typicality judgments for a broad range of abstract semantic relations. A measure of relational similarity can be derived and used to solve simple verbal analogies with human-level accuracy. Because each acquired relation has a modular representation, basic symbolic operations are enabled (notably, the converse of any learned relation can be formed without additional training). Abstract semantic relations can be induced by bootstrapping from nonrelational inputs, thereby enabling relational generalization and analogical reasoning.",Reactive oxygen species modulate macrophage immunosuppressive phenotype through the up-regulation of PD-L1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770442,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"The combination of immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy is currently under investigation as a promising strategy for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most prominent component of the breast cancer microenvironment because they influence tumor progression and the response to therapies. Here we show that macrophages acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype and increase the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) when treated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducers such as the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), and paclitaxel. Mechanistically, these agents cause accumulation of ROS that in turn activate NF-κB signaling to promote PD-L1 transcription and the release of immunosuppressive chemokines. Systemic in vivo administration of paclitaxel promotes PD-L1 accumulation on the surface of TAMS in a mouse model of TNBC, consistent with in vitro results. Combinatorial treatment with paclitaxel and an anti-mouse PD-L1 blocking antibody significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel by reducing tumor burden and increasing the number of tumor-associated cytotoxic T cells. Our results provide a strong rationale for the use of anti-PD-L1 blockade in the treatment of TNBC patients. Furthermore, interrogation of chemotherapy-induced PD-L1 expression in TAMs is warranted to define appropriate patient selection in the use of PD-L1 blockade.",Structural basis for activity of TRIC counter-ion channels in calcium release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770441,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"Trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels are thought to provide counter-ion currents that facilitate the active release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. TRIC activity is controlled by voltage and Ca2+ modulation, but underlying mechanisms have remained unknown. Here we describe high-resolution crystal structures of vertebrate TRIC-A and TRIC-B channels, both in Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free states, and we analyze conductance properties in structure-inspired mutagenesis experiments. The TRIC channels are symmetric trimers, wherein we find a pore in each protomer that is gated by a highly conserved lysine residue. In the resting state, Ca2+ binding at the luminal surface of TRIC-A, on its threefold axis, stabilizes lysine blockage of the pores. During active Ca2+ release, luminal Ca2+ depletion removes inhibition to permit the lysine-bearing and voltage-sensing helix to move in response to consequent membrane hyperpolarization. Diacylglycerol is found at interprotomer interfaces, suggesting a role in metabolic control.",PGC1A regulates the IRS1:IRS2 ratio during fasting to influence hepatic metabolism downstream of insulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770439,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 29,"Precise modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is crucial during the fasting and feeding cycle and is controlled by the actions of circulating insulin and glucagon. The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, which are found to be dysregulated in diabetes and obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a fasting-induced transcriptional coactivator. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes, low hepatic PGC1A levels are associated with insulin resistance. However, how PGC1A activity impacts the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway is still unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function models in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured hepatocyte insulin response by gene and protein expression and ex vivo glucose production. We found that the PGC1A level determines the relative ratio of IRS1 and IRS2 in hepatocytes, impacting insulin receptor signaling via protein kinase B/AKT (AKT). PGC1A drove the expression of IRS2 downstream of glucagon signaling while simultaneously reducing IRS1 expression. We illustrate that glucagon- or PGC1A-induced IRS2 expression was dependent on cAMP Response Element Binding Protein activity and that this was essential for suppression of hepatocyte gluconeogenesis in response to insulin in vitro. We also show that increased hepatic PGC1A improves glucose homeostasis in vivo, revealing a counterregulatory role for PGC1A in repressing uncontrolled glucose production in response to insulin signaling. These data highlight a mechanism by which PGC1A plays dual roles in the control of gluconeogenesis during the fasting-to-fed transition through regulated balance between IRS1 and IRS2 expression."

Whereas IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17C induce overlapping inflammatory cascades to promote neutrophil-mediated immunity, IL-17E/IL-25 drives type 2 immune pathways and eosinophil activity. Genetic and pharmacological studies reveal the significant contribution these cytokines play in antimicrobial and autoimmune mechanisms. However, little is known about the related family member, IL-17B, with contrasting reports of both pro- and anti-inflammatory function in rodents. We demonstrate that in the human immune system, IL-17B is functionally similar to IL-25 and elicits type 2 cytokine secretion from innate type 2 lymphocytes, NKT, and CD4+ CRTH2+ Th2 cells. Like IL-25, this activity is dependent on the IL-17RA and IL-17RB receptor subunits. Furthermore, IL-17B can augment IL-33-driven type 2 responses.

Both genes encode a single V-set Ig domain consisting of a canonical J-like segment and a potential immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory or switch motif in the cytoplasmic region. In vitro experiments showed that both genes were expressed at the cell surface as membrane proteins, and their recombinant products formed a monomer and a disulfide-linked homodimer or a heterodimer. These two genes were mainly expressed in B and T cells and were upregulated in response to stimulation with poly(I:C) in vitro and vaccination in vivo. Orthologs of PRARP have been identified in bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, and other birds, and a V-C1 structure similar to that of Ig or TCR chains was found in all these genes, with the exception of those in avian species, which appear to contain degenerated C1 domains or divergent Ig domains. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the newly discovered genes do not belong to any known immune receptor family and appear to be a novel gene family. Further elucidation of the functions of PRARP and their origin might provide significant insights into the evolution of the immune system of jawed vertebrates.",Soluble Fc-Disabled Herpes Virus Entry Mediator Augments Activation and Cytotoxicity of NK Cells by Promoting Cross-Talk between NK Cells and Monocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770415,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 03 29,"CD160 is highly expressed by NK cells and is associated with cytolytic effector activity. Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) activates NK cells for cytokine production and cytolytic function via CD160. Fc-fusions are a well-established class of therapeutics, where the Fc domain provides additional biological and pharmacological properties to the fusion protein including enhanced serum t1/2 and interaction with Fc receptor-expressing immune cells. We evaluated the specific function of HVEM in regulating CD160-mediated NK cell effector function by generating a fusion of the HVEM extracellular domain with human IgG1 Fc bearing CD16-binding mutations (Fc*) resulting in HVEM-(Fc*). HVEM-(Fc*) displayed reduced binding to the Fc receptor CD16 (i.e., Fc-disabled HVEM), which limited Fc receptor-induced responses. HVEM-(Fc*) functional activity was compared with HVEM-Fc containing the wild type human IgG1 Fc. HVEM-(Fc*) treatment of NK cells and PBMCs caused greater IFN-γ production, enhanced cytotoxicity, reduced NK fratricide, and no change in CD16 expression on human NK cells compared with HVEM-Fc. HVEM-(Fc*) treatment of monocytes or PBMCs enhanced the expression level of CD80, CD83, and CD40 expression on monocytes. HVEM-(Fc*)-enhanced NK cell activation and cytotoxicity were promoted via cross-talk between NK cells and monocytes that was driven by cell-cell contact. In this study, we have shown that soluble Fc-disabled HVEM-(Fc*) augments NK cell activation, IFN-γ production, and cytotoxicity of NK cells without inducing NK cell fratricide by promoting cross-talk between NK cells and monocytes without Fc receptor-induced effects. Soluble Fc-disabled HVEM-(Fc*) may be considered as a research and potentially therapeutic reagent for modulating immune responses via sole activation of HVEM receptors.",Chromosome-Wide Evolution and Sex Determination in the Three-Sexed Nematode Auanema rhodensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770412,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 04 24,"Trioecy, a mating system in which males, females and hermaphrodites co-exist, is a useful system to investigate the origin and maintenance of alternative mating strategies. In the trioecious nematode Auanema rhodensis, males have one X chromosome (XO), whereas females and hermaphrodites have two (XX). The female vs. hermaphrodite sex determination mechanisms have remained elusive. In this study, RNA-seq analyses show a 20% difference between the L2 hermaphrodite and female gene expression profiles. RNAi experiments targeting the DM (doublesex/mab-3) domain transcription factor dmd-10/11 suggest that the hermaphrodite sexual fate requires the upregulation of this gene. The genetic linkage map (GLM) shows that there is chromosome-wide heterozygosity for the X chromosome in F2 hermaphrodite-derived lines originated from crosses between two parental inbred strains. These results confirm the lack of recombination of the X chromosome in hermaphrodites, as previously reported. We also describe conserved chromosome elements (Nigon elements), which have been mostly maintained throughout the evolution of Rhabditina nematodes. The seven-chromosome karyotype of A. rhodensis, instead of the typical six found in other rhabditine species, derives from fusion/rearrangements events involving three Nigon elements. The A. rhodensis X chromosome is the smallest and most polymorphic with the least proportion of conserved genes. This may reflect its atypical mode of father-to-son transmission and its lack of recombination in hermaphrodites and males. In conclusion, this study provides a framework for studying the evolution of chromosomes in rhabditine nematodes, as well as possible mechanisms for the sex determination in a three-sexed species.",rAAV-based brain slice culture models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease inclusion pathologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770411,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 03 09,"It has been challenging to produce ex vivo models of the inclusion pathologies that are hallmark pathologies of many neurodegenerative diseases. Using three-dimensional mouse brain slice cultures (BSCs), we have developed a paradigm that rapidly and robustly recapitulates mature neurofibrillary inclusion and Lewy body formation found in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. This was achieved by transducing the BSCs with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) that express α-synuclein or variants of tau. Notably, the tauopathy BSC model enables screening of small molecule therapeutics and tracking of neurodegeneration.

As one of the four eIF2α kinases that sense diverse stresses and direct the integrated stress response (ISR) crucial for cell survival and proliferation, PKR's versatile roles extend well beyond antiviral defense. Targeted by numerous host and viral regulators made of RNA and proteins, PKR is subject to multiple layers of endogenous control and external manipulation, driving its rapid evolution. These versatile regulators include not only the canonical double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates the kinase activity of PKR, but also highly structured viral, host, and artificial RNAs that exert a full spectrum of effects. In this review, we discuss our deepening understanding of the allosteric mechanism that connects the regulatory and effector domains of PKR, with an emphasis on diverse structured RNA regulators in comparison to their protein counterparts. Through this analysis, we conclude that much of the mechanistic details that underlie this RNA-regulated kinase await structural and functional elucidation, upon which we can then describe a ""PKR code,"" a set of structural and chemical features of RNA that are both descriptive and predictive for their effects on PKR.",Effects of the PIWI/MID domain of Argonaute protein on the association of miRNAi's seed base with the target.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770397,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"The small interfering RNAs (siRNA) or microRNAs (miRNA) incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex with the Argonaute (Ago) protein associates with target mRNAs through base-pairing, which leads to the cleavage or knockdown of the target mRNA. The seed region of the s(m)iRNA is crucial for target recognition. In this work, a molecular dynamic simulation was utilized to study the thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the third seed base binding to the target in the presence of the PIWI/MID domain of Ago. The results showed that in the presence of the PIWI/MID domain, the entropy and enthalpy changes for the association of the seed base with the target were smaller than those in the absence of protein. The binding affinity was increased due to the reduced entropy penalty, which resulted from the preorganization of the seed base into the A-helix form. In the presence of the protein, the association barrier resulting from the unfavorable entropy loss and the dissociation barrier coming from the destruction of hydrogen bonding and base-stacking interactions were lower than those in the absence of the protein. These results indicate that the seed region is crucial for fast recognition and association with the correct target.",Active surveillance for nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770396,Blood,2019 05 17,"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare subtype of lymphoma that, like other Hodgkin lymphomas, has historically been treated aggressively. However, in most cases, NLPHL has an indolent course, which raises the question of to what extent these patients require aggressive upfront treatment. We describe the management and outcomes of consecutive NLPHL patients diagnosed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), with a focus on evaluating active surveillance. All patients aged 16 years or older diagnosed and followed at MSK between 1974 and 2016 were included. Treatment outcomes were compared between management with active surveillance and other strategies. We identified 163 consecutive patients who were treated with radiotherapy alone (46%), active surveillance (23%), chemotherapy (16%), combined modality (12%), or rituximab monotherapy (4%). Median follow-up was 69 months. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS), second PFS (PFS2), and overall survival (OS) estimates were 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-90), 97% (95% CI, 92-99), and 99% (95% CI, 95-100), respectively. Only 1 of 7 deaths was lymphoma related. Patients managed with active surveillance had slightly shorter PFS than those receiving any active treatment, with 5-year PFS of 77% (95% CI, 56-89) vs 87% (95% CI, 79-92; P = .017). This difference did not translate into better PFS2 or OS. Only 10 patients managed with active surveillance (27%) eventually required treatment, after a median of 61 months, and none died. NLPHL has an excellent prognosis. Within the limitations of a retrospective analysis, active surveillance is a viable initial management strategy for selected NLPHL patients.",Characterization and treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770395,Blood,2019 04 12,"Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is an ultra-rare thrombomicroangiopathy caused by an inherited deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). There are limited data on genotype-phenotype correlation; there is no consensus on treatment. We reviewed the largest cohort of cTTP cases, diagnosed in the United Kingdom, over the past 15 years. Seventy-three cases of cTTP were diagnosed, confirmed by genetic analysis. Ninety-three percent were alive at the time of review. Thirty-six percent had homozygous mutations; 64% had compound heterozygous mutations. Two presentation peaks were seen: childhood (median diagnosis age, 3.5 years) and adulthood, typically related to pregnancy (median diagnosis age, 31 years). Genetic mutations differed by age of onset with prespacer mutations more likely to be associated with childhood onset (P = .0011). Sixty-nine percent of adult presentations were associated with pregnancy. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate were used as treatment. Eighty-eight percent of patients with normal blood counts, but with headaches, lethargy, or abdominal pain, reported symptom resolution with prophylactic therapy. The most common currently used regimen of 3-weekly FFP proved insufficient for 70% of patients and weekly or fortnightly infusions were required. Stroke incidence was significantly reduced in patients receiving prophylactic therapy (2% vs 17%; P = .04). Long-term, there is a risk of end-organ damage, seen in 75% of patients with late diagnosis of cTTP. In conclusion, prespacer mutations are associated with earlier development of cTTP symptoms. Prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement decreases the risk of end-organ damage such as ischemic stroke and resolved previously unrecognized symptoms in patients with nonovert disease.",Increased galactose expression and enhanced clearance in patients with low von Willebrand factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770394,Blood,2019 04 05,"Glycan determinants on von Willebrand factor (VWF) play critical roles in regulating its susceptibility to proteolysis and clearance. Abnormal glycosylation has been shown to cause von Willebrand disease (VWD) in a number of different mouse models. However, because of the significant technical challenges associated with accurate assessment of VWF glycan composition, the importance of carbohydrates in human VWD pathogenesis remains largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a novel lectin-binding panel to enable human VWF glycan characterization. This methodology was then used to study glycan expression in a cohort of 110 patients with low VWF compared with O blood group-matched healthy controls. Interestingly, significant interindividual heterogeneity in VWF glycan expression was seen in the healthy control population. This variation included terminal sialylation and ABO(H) blood group expression on VWF. Importantly, we also observed evidence of aberrant glycosylation in a subgroup of patients with low VWF. In particular, terminal α(2-6)-linked sialylation was reduced in patients with low VWF, with a secondary increase in galactose (Gal) exposure. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between Gal exposure and estimated VWF half-life was observed in those patients with enhanced VWF clearance. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that loss of terminal sialylation contributes to the pathophysiology underpinning low VWF in at least a subgroup of patients by promoting enhanced clearance. In addition, alterations in VWF carbohydrate expression are likely to contribute to quantitative and qualitative variations in VWF levels in the normal population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03167320.",Lmx1a drives Cux2 expression in the cortical hem through activation of a conserved intronic enhancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770393,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 08,"During neocortical development, neurons are produced by a diverse pool of neural progenitors. A subset of progenitors express the Cux2 gene and are fate restricted to produce certain neuronal subtypes; however, the upstream pathways that specify these progenitor fates remain unknown. To uncover the transcriptional networks that regulate Cux2 expression in the forebrain, we characterized a conserved Cux2 enhancer that recapitulates Cux2 expression specifically in the cortical hem. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified putative transcription factor (TF)-binding sites for cortical hem-patterning TFs. We found that the homeobox TF Lmx1a can activate the Cux2 enhancer in vitro Furthermore, we showed that Lmx1a-binding sites were required for enhancer activity in the cortical hem in vivo Mis-expression of Lmx1a in hippocampal progenitors caused an increase in Cux2 enhancer activity outside the cortical hem. Finally, we compared several human enhancers with cortical hem-restricted activity and found that recurrent Lmx1a-binding sites are a top shared feature. Uncovering the network of TFs involved in regulating Cux2 expression will increase our understanding of the mechanisms pivotal in establishing Cux2 lineage fates in the developing forebrain.",Trans-splicing of the C. elegans let-7 primary transcript developmentally regulates let-7 microRNA biogenesis and let-7 family microRNA activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770392,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 11,"The sequence and roles in developmental progression of the microRNA let-7 are conserved. In general, transcription of the let-7 primary transcript (pri-let-7) occurs early in development, whereas processing of the mature let-7 microRNA arises during cellular differentiation. In Caenorhabditiselegans and other animals, the RNA-binding protein LIN-28 post-transcriptionally inhibits let-7 biogenesis at early developmental stages, but the mechanisms by which LIN-28 does this are not fully understood. Nor is it understood how the developmental regulation of let-7 might influence the expression or activities of other microRNAs of the same seed family. Here, we show that pri-let-7 is trans-spliced to the SL1 splice leader downstream of the let-7 precursor stem-loop, which produces a short polyadenylated downstream mRNA, and that this trans-splicing event negatively impacts the biogenesis of mature let-7 microRNA in cis Moreover, this trans-spliced mRNA contains sequences that are complementary to multiple members of the let-7 seed family (let-7fam) and negatively regulates let-7fam function in trans Thus, this study provides evidence for a mechanism by which splicing of a microRNA primary transcript can negatively regulate said microRNA in cis as well as other microRNAs in trans.",Rho-of-plant activated root hair formation requires Arabidopsis YIP4a/b gene function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770391,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 10,"Root hairs are protrusions from root epidermal cells with crucial roles in plant soil interactions.

Although RAS mutations are the most frequent MAPK alterations, less frequent alterations in downstream components of the pathway, including the RAF and MEK genes, offer promising therapeutic opportunities. In addition to BRAFV600 mutations, for which several approved therapeutic regimens exist, other alterations in the RAF and MEK genes may provide more rare, but tractable, targets. However, recent studies have illustrated the complexity of MAPK signaling and highlighted that distinct alterations in these genes may have strikingly different properties. Understanding the unique functional characteristics of specific RAF and MEK alterations, reviewed herein, will be critical for developing effective therapeutic approaches for these targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations in the RAF and MEK genes represent promising therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types. However, given the unique and complex signaling biology of the MAPK pathway, the diverse array of RAF and MEK alterations observed in cancer can possess distinct functional characteristics.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a malignant disorder of skin-homing CD4+ T cells, and it exhibits a highly variable clinical course during which the tumor-specific immune response may be an important determinant. An unusual feature of MF is that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) must attempt to control a malignant cell from within their own lineage. We obtained skin biopsies and blood from 43 patients with CD4+ MF and undertook a detailed phenotypic and functional analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Clonotypic TCRBV staining allowed delineation of malignant and reactive CD4+ subsets. CD4+ and CD8+ TILs displayed a comparable ""exhausted"" phenotype that was characterized by expression of PD-1 and TIGIT but retained cytotoxic activity and production of interferon-γ and interleukin-17 in early-stage disease. In contrast, tumor cells were much more heterogeneous and were divided into 3 discrete subsets based on differential expression of HLA-DR: ""cold"" (DR-), ""exhausted"" (DR+ PD-1+), and ""evasive"" (DR++ PD-L1+) phenotypes. Disease progression was associated with increasing divergence of the tumor phenotype away from that of TILs and reduced functional activity within TILs. These observations reveal that the phenotype and function of TIL populations are constrained at all stages of disease, whereas the tumor evolves discrete phenotypic profiles of escape during clinical progression. The findings should help to direct appropriate immunotherapeutic interventions for individual patients.",Prevalence and risk factors of myopic maculopathy in rural southern China: the Yangxi Eye Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770357,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 02 16,To evaluate the prevalence of myopic maculopathy among participants aged 50 years and older in rural southern China.,Treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy with minimally invasive corneal neurotisation: long-term clinical outcomes and evidence of corneal reinnervation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770356,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 02 16,To report clinical outcomes and evidence of corneal innervation in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (NK) treated with minimally invasive corneal neurotisation (MICN) using a sural nerve graft and donor sensory nerves from the face.,Outcomes of small-gauge vitreoretinal surgery without scleral-depressed shaving of the vitreous base in the era of wide-angle viewing systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770355,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 02 16,To evaluate outcomes of small-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) without scleral-depressed shaving of the vitreous base.,Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study: confirmation between eye screening and comprehensive eye examination diagnoses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770354,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 02 16,To evaluate agreement between ocular findings of a telemedicine eye screening (visit 1) with diagnoses of a comprehensive eye examination (visit 2).,"Targeted Assessment of G0S2 Methylation Identifies a Rapidly Recurrent, Routinely Fatal Molecular Subtype of Adrenocortical Carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770352,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 06 04,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with few therapies; however, patients with locoregional disease have variable outcomes.

Indicative of a link between the two, hypothermia induces tau hyperphosphorylation. The 3xTg-AD mouse model not only develops tau and amyloid pathologies in the brain but also metabolic and thermoregulatory deficits. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the main thermogenic driver in mammals, and its stimulation counteracts metabolic deficits in rodents and humans. We thus investigated whether BAT stimulation impedes AD neuropathology.","Patient-reported outcomes following enzalutamide or placebo in men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (PROSPER): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770294,The Lancet.

Recent work highlights the idea that night-time transpirational water loss is a consequence of allowing respiratory CO2 to escape at sufficiently high rates through stomata. Respiration fuels night-time leaf expansion and requires carbohydrates produced during the day. As carbohydrate availability and growth are under the control of the plants' internal clock, so is night-time transpiration. The cost of night-time transpiration is that water is lost without carbon being gained, the benefit is a higher efficiency of taken up water for use in leaf expansion. This could provide a stress acclimation process.",Hormonal medication in medically assisted reproduction: a systematic review of assessments from patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770286,Reproductive biomedicine online,2019 03 02,"Several hormonal fertility medications have comparable effectiveness. A literature review was conducted into patients' assessments regarding seven medication characteristics including 'side effects' and 'ease of use'. Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for female fertility patients' written assessments of a hormonal medication. The tools used were appraised and common (i.e. ≥10%) unpleasant consequences were distinguished from rare ones. The 35 eligible studies did not rely on valid and reliable tools and did not provide patient assessments regarding all seven medication characteristics for any of the globally used medications. Evidence on medications for oocyte triggering was absent and for induction of pituitary quiescence it was scarce. Regarding medications for ovarian stimulation and luteal support, evidence on general side effects (mostly headache), local side effects (mostly pain), 'interference with home life' and 'impact on psychological wellbeing' was found. Evidence on 'ease of use' and 'required education' was only identified for medication for ovarian stimulation. Evidence on 'interference with work life' and 'compliance worry' was absent. This review calls for randomized controlled trials questioning patients with valid and reliable tools. In the meantime, this review's summary of the best available evidence can be integrated in decision aids facilitating personalized and informed medication choices.",Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy manufacturing: modelling the effect of offshore production on aggregate cost of goods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770285,Cytotherapy,2019 03 26,"Cell and gene therapies have demonstrated excellent clinical results across a range of indications with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies among the first to reach market. Although these therapies are currently manufactured using patient-derived cells, therapies using healthy donor cells are in development, potentially offering avenues toward process improvement and patient access. An allogeneic model could significantly reduce aggregate cost of goods (COGs), potentially improving market penetration of these life-saving treatments. Furthermore, the shift toward offshore production may help reduce manufacturing costs. In this article, we examine production costs of an allogeneic CAR-T cell process and the potential differential manufacturing costs between regions. Two offshore locations are compared with regions within the United States. The critical findings of this article identify the COGs challenges facing manufacturing of allogeneic CAR-T immunotherapies, how these may evolve as production is sent offshore and the wider implication this trend could have.",Management of fetal tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770283,Best practice & research.

Overall, the most important outcome predictors are tumor histology, size, vascularity, and location. Very large lesions, lesions causing cardiac failure, and hydrops and lesions obstructing the fetal airway have the poorest outcome, as they may cause fetal death or complications at the time of delivery. Fetal therapy has been developed to improve outcomes for the most severe cases and can consist of transplacental therapy (sirolimus for rhabdomyomas or steroids for hemangiomas and microcystic lung lesions) or surgical intervention (shunting of cystic masses, tumor ablation, occlusion of blood flow or airway exploration, and protection). Given the rarity of fetal tumors, patients should be referred to expert centers where care can be optimized and individualized to allow the best possible outcomes.",The effect of honokiol on pulmonary artery endothelium cell autophagy mediated by cyclophilin A in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770282,Journal of pharmacological sciences,2019 06 14,"Abnormal autophagy plays critical roles in the structure and function of the pulmonary vasculature. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) can be secreted from cells in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress, which are involved in inducing autophagy and regulating the function of endothelial cells in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Honokiol is a small molecule natural compound; it has many bioactivities, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiangiogenic properties, but how honokiol mediates autophagy in pulmonary arterial hypertension is unclear. Rat' lungs gavaged with honokiol were examined for autophagy via western blot and fluorescence microscopy. In addition, western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were employed to test the expression of CyPA and autophagy markers in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). Small interfering RNA targeting CyPA (si-CyPA) was used to knockdown the expression of CyPA, and then autophagy was tested with mRFP-GFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy and western blot. We found that honokiol could reduce the expression of CyPA and autophagy markers in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, autophagy was also down-regulated by si-CyPA. Taken together, we revealed a novel mechanism by which honokiol regulates autophagy. The results revealed that honokiol can alleviate autophagy and pulmonary arterial hypertension regulated by CyPA in PAECs."

The aim of this study was to examine the effect on soft tissue complications of the pie-crusting technique when applied between 2 incisions in distal tibia and fibula fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation. We reviewed 34 patients with distal tibia and fibula fractures treated between September 2014 and March 2017. The pie-crusting technique was performed during wound closure in 16 (47.06%) fractures (group 1) and classic wound closure was done in 18 (52.94%) fractures (group 2). The primary outcome was evaluated as the presence or absence of soft tissue complications such as superficial skin necrosis, deep skin necrosis, and deep infection. The mean age was 50.44 ± 13.51 (range 23 to 65) years in group 1 and 51.67 ± 14.49 (range 18 to 68) years in group 2. The mean follow-up time was 27.35 ± 9.02 (range 16 to 46) months. The mean surgery time after injury was 5.88 ± 3.5 (range 1 to 14) days in group 1 and 7.32 ± 4.25 (range 1 to 16) days in group 2. No soft tissue complications were seen in any patient in group 1. Five (27.77%) occurrences of superficial skin necrosis were observed in group 2. In 2 (11.11%) patients in group 2, deep necrosis and wound dehiscence occurred, and subsequent deep infection developed in 1 (5.55%) of these patients. The overall complication rate was higher in group 2 (p = .005).

Extralevator APE was introduced to address this problem. The post anal minimally invasive approach had been used by other authors for transperineal mesh rectopexy but not in cancer management. Our aim is to use the post-anal minimally invasive approach for better visualization and division of the levator Ani during the Extralevator abdominoprineal excision in 2 cases of carcinoma of the anal canal. After laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen and performing a laparoscopic nerve sparing TME down to the levator ani from the abdominal side, the perineal phase was started by a purse string suture followed by a postanal incision and division of the Anococcygeal ligament, the gel port was inserted where visualization of the levator ani allows its division under vision posteriorly and laterally in order to achieve a good circumferential resection margin in the studied 2 cases.

Isolated venous malformations (frequently misnamed as cavernous hemangiomas) are the most frequent among these. However, also lymphatic and arteriovenous malformations can affect the orbit. The complex anatomy of the orbit and the fact that its content easily suffers from compartmental syndrome explain why treating orbital vascular malformations can be challenging and technically demanding. In this study, two institutions have retrospectively collected their cases, consisting in a total of 69 vascular malformations of the orbit. Each type of malformation has been evaluated separately in terms of diagnosis, indications for treatment, techniques and outcomes. Moreover, the authors have analyzed in detail venous malformations, identifying three different types, named orbital venous malformation (OVM) 1, 2 and 3. These behave differently from each other, and a prompt differential diagnosis is mandatory to pose correct indications, minimize risks and improve results. Overall, surgery was the technique of choice for OVM1, microcystic lymphatic malformations (LM) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). A pure transnasal approach with mass removal and reconstruction of the medial wall with polyethylene sheets was chosen for OVM1 (intra- or extraconal) located in the medial or superomedial compartment.

PARN deficiency affects the stability of non-coding RNAs such as human telomerase RNA (hTR), but these effects do not explain the severe disease in patients. We demonstrate that PARN deficiency affects the levels of numerous miRNAs in human cells. PARN regulates miRNA levels by stabilizing either mature or precursor miRNAs by removing oligo(A) tails added by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5, which if remaining recruit the exonuclease DIS3L or DIS3L2 to degrade the miRNA. PARN knockdown destabilizes multiple miRNAs that repress p53 translation, which leads to an increase in p53 accumulation in a Dicer-dependent manner, thus explaining why PARN-defective patients show p53 accumulation. This work also reveals that DIS3L and DIS3L2 are critical 3' to 5' exonucleases that regulate miRNA stability, with the addition and removal of 3' end extensions controlling miRNA levels in the cell.",Nucleosomes Stabilize ssRNA-dsDNA Triple Helices in Human Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770238,Molecular cell,2019 06 08,"Chromatin-associated non-coding RNAs modulate the epigenetic landscape and its associated gene expression program.

With this study, we show an important role of the nucleosome and its relative positioning to the triplex targeting site (TTS) in stabilizing RNA-DNA triplexes in vitro and in vivo. Triplex stabilization depends on the histone H3 tail and the location of the TTS close to the nucleosomal DNA entry-exit site. Genome-wide analysis of TTS-nucleosome arrangements revealed a defined chromatin organization with an enrichment of arrangements that allow triplex formation at active regulatory sites and accessible chromatin. We further developed a method to monitor nucleosome-RNA triplexes in vivo (TRIP-seq), revealing RNA binding to TTS sites adjacent to nucleosomes.

We searched six databases from inception to 28-March-2018, using the strategy: long-acting antipsychotics AND (bipolar disorder OR schizoaffective disorder OR mania OR manic OR bipolar depression). We included peer-reviewed double-blind comparisons of LAIs for any clinical outcome occurrence in BD, or open mirror studies with same prospective as retrospective assessment periods. We excluded studies reporting on mixed schizophrenia/SAD populations without reporting results separately. The pooled records amounted to 642. After duplicate removal and inclusion/exclusion criteria application, we included 15 studies, 6 double-blind and 9 open, 13 assessing BD and 2 SAD. Depot neuroleptics prevented manic, but not depressive recurrences and may worsen depressive symptoms. Risperidone long-acting injectable was found to be effective in protecting from any mood/manic symptom compared to placebo, but not from depressive recurrences. Add-on or monotherapy paliperidone palmitate in SAD patients protected from psychotic, depressive, and manic symptoms. In patients with BD-I with a manic episode at study enrolment, aripiprazole monohydrate significantly delayed time to recurrence of manic episodes without inducing depressive episodes. LAIs are effective and well-tolerated maintenance treatments for BD and SAD. They showed better efficacy in preventing mania than depression.

However, it remains unknown whether disrupted functional asymmetry originates from intra-hemispheric and/or inter-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) in the patients, and whether it starts at very early stage of psychosis. Seventy-six patients with first-episode, drug-naive schizophrenia, 74 subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR), and 71 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The 'Parameter of asymmetry' (PAS) metric was calculated and support vector machine (SVM) classification analysis was applied to analyze the data. Compared with healthy controls, patients exhibited decreased PAS in the left thalamus/pallidum, right hippocampus/parahippocampus, right inferior frontal gyrus/insula, right thalamus, and left inferior parietal lobule, and increased PAS in the left calcarine, right superior occipital gyrus/middle occipital gyrus, and right precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. By contrast, UHR subjects showed decreased PAS in the left thalamus relative to healthy controls. A negative correlation was observed between decreased PAS in the right hippocampus/parahippocampus and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) scores in the patients (r = -0.364, p = 0.002). Moreover, the PAS values in the left thalamus could discriminate the patients/UHR subjects from the controls with acceptable sensitivities (68.42%/81.08%). First-episode patients and UHR subjects shared decreased PAS in the left thalamus.

ED visits often mark an inflection point in these patients' illness trajectories, signaling a more rapid rate of decline. Although most patients are there seeking care for acute issues, many of them have priorities other than to simply live as long as possible; yet without discussion of preferences for treatment, they are at risk of receiving care not aligned with their goals. An ED visit may offer a unique ""teachable moment"" to empower patients to consider their ability to influence future medical care decisions. However, the constraints of the ED setting pose specific challenges, and little research exists to guide clinicians treating patients in this setting. We describe the current state of goals-of-care conversations in the ED, outline the challenges to conducting these conversations, and recommend a research agenda to better equip emergency physicians to guide shared decisionmaking for end-of-life care.

Although several metabolites of sesamin have been identified, its metabolism by phase II enzymes remains unclear, because usually its sulfo- and glucurono-conjugates in plasma and urine are analyzed after sulfatase/β-glucuronidase treatment. In this study, the metabolites of sesamin in rats administrated with sesamin (100 mg/kg b.w.) were analyzed without sulfatase/β-glucuronidase treatment. Two sulfate conjugates of sesamin monocatechol (SC-1) were detected in the liver and plasma. Their Cmax values were 5- and 10-times higher than that of sesamin itself. The Vmax/Km values for sulfate conjugation in the cytosol fraction of human liver were 1.7-times larger than that in the cytosol fraction of rat liver, suggesting that sulfate conjugation also occurs in human liver. The recombinant human proteins SULT1A1, 1A3, 1B1, and 1E1 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells produced sulfate conjugates effectively.

Naldemedine has limited ability to affect the central analgesic effect of opioid analgesics. In this study, we investigated the contribution of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the brain distribution of naldemedine. Naldemedine tosylate showed acceptable oral absorption in rats. Following a single oral administration of [14C]-naldemedine tosylate to rats and ferrets, little radioactivity was detected in the region protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the assessment using Caco-2 cells, it was determined that naldemedine is a substrate for P-gp. The contribution of P-gp to the brain distribution of naldemedine was assessed using multidrug resistance 1a/b (mdr1a/b) knockout mice. While the brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (brain Kp) of naldemedine in the mdr1a/b knockout mice was 4-fold of that in the wild-type mice, the brain Kp in the mdr1a/b knockout mice was quite low (brain Kp < 0.1). These results suggest that the low brain distribution of naldemedine was due to the limited ability to cross the BBB rather than efflux by P-gp and therefore brain distribution of naldemedine would not be affected by concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors or functional disorder of P-gp.",Iron oxide nanoparticles based antiviral activity of H1N1 influenza A virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770182,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2019 04 15,"Influenza virus is a common human pathogenic agent that has caused serious respiratory illness and death over the past century and in recent year.

The treatment of bradyarrhythmias presents the most common perioperative emergency indication. Intraoperatively, temporary rapid right ventricular pacing is accepted as a safe, titratable, and highly reliable method to achieve deliberate hypotension, and it has become a routine practice in the anesthetic management of cardiovascular interventions. The navigation of the lead into the right ventricle often requires fluoroscopy to guide placement and to confirm position. Ultrasound guidance has been accepted widely by perioperative physicians as a safe technique for central venous access. Basic ultrasound and transthoracic echocardiographic skills rapidly are becoming integral to anesthesiologists' practice. When used to guide transvenous pacemaker wire insertion, subcostal echocardiographic imaging offers attractive advantages over blind or fluoroscopic placement, including rapid deployment, avoidance of radiation, real-time visualization of the lead in relation to the cardiac structures, and early detection of potential complications, such as tamponade. Although several articles on echocardiographic guidance for transvenous pacing have been published in other acute care specialty fields in the last decade, this is the first description of the technique and of the recommended echocardiographic views in a perioperative context. In addition, a review of the current literature is presented, and the specific advantages and disadvantages of the approach are discussed in this article.",Totally Implantable Active Middle Ear Implants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770176,Otolaryngologic clinics of North America,2019 05 01,"The Envoy Esteem and the Carina system are the 2 totally implantable hearing devices.

A live-attenuated investigational vaccine, TC-83, is available, but it has a high non-response rate and can also cause severe reactogenicity. We generated two novel VEE vaccine candidates using self-amplifying mRNA (SAM). LAV-CNE is a live-attenuated VEE SAM vaccine formulated with synthetic cationic nanoemulsion (CNE) and carrying the RNA genome of TC-83. IAV-CNE is an irreversibly-attenuated VEE SAM vaccine formulated with CNE, delivering a TC-83 genome lacking the capsid gene. LAV-CNE launches a TC-83 infection cycle in vaccinated subjects but eliminates the need for live-attenuated vaccine production and potentially reduces manufacturing time and complexity. IAV-CNE produces a single cycle of RNA amplification and antigen expression without generating infectious viruses in subjects, thereby creating a potentially safer alternative to live-attenuated vaccine. Here, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with LAV-CNE elicited immune responses similar to those of TC-83, providing 100% protection against aerosol VEEV challenge. IAV-CNE was also immunogenic, resulting in significant protection against VEEV challenge. These studies demonstrate the proof of concept for using the SAM platform to streamline the development of effective attenuated vaccines against VEEV and closely related alphavirus pathogens such as western and eastern equine encephalitis and Chikungunya viruses.",Research orientation in Ayurveda educational institutions: Challenges and the way forward.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770172,Journal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine,2019 04 26,"This paper examines the scenario of research orientation in Ayurveda educational institutions of India. We demonstrate through the data obtained by searching the SCOPUS that the actual research output by these institutions is not very significant in terms of number of publications. While a lack of research expertise and infrastructure is one contributing factor to this status, a lack of questioning attitude is more crucial one. Mushrooming of new colleges, laxity in regulations, corruption, lack of atmosphere for ethical and quality research make the problem more complex. We show, with the help of SCOPUS Data, that the recent trend of establishing stand-alone institutions of Ayurveda may not help in invigorating research activities since the research contributions from such institutions have always been very poor. Instead, we suggest that existing stand-alone institutions of Ayurveda be merged with other established Central/State universities or other Medical colleges. The data demonstrates that the research output has been always significant when an institution has many experts working in different streams of science within, than when the institutions have only Ayurveda experts. We also take up the question of designing the clinical trials that are suitable for Ayurveda and propose an algorithm that may be considered for research in educational institutions, at least at doctoral level. We further enlist a set of recommendations that could potentially change the scenario. Evidence-informed policy making, inducting clinicians into the education system, making the curricula more attractive by including recent advances, introducing efficient faculty training programs, and rigorous implementation of the existing regulations - are some of the key recommendations we have made.",Efflux-Pump Upregulation: From Tolerance to High-level Antibiotic Resistance?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770171,Trends in microbiology,2019 03 15,"A recent study shows that high expression of the efflux-pump AcrAB-TolC, which increases antibiotic tolerance, reduces DNA mismatch repair in Escherichia coli to promote spontaneous mutations.

The manual feature extraction and selection of traditional fault diagnosis methods depend on signal processing skills and expert experience, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As a typical intelligent fault diagnosis method, the convolutional neural network automatically learns features from original data, but it is extremely difficult to design and train a deep network architecture. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis scheme combined of hierarchical symbolic analysis (HSA) and convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieves laborsaving and timesaving preliminary feature extraction and accomplishes automatically feature learning with simplified network architecture. Firstly, hierarchical symbolic analysis is employed to extract features from original signals. The extracted features are able to identify different health conditions under various operating conditions. Then, convolutional neural network instead of human labor is used to learn the complex non-linear relationship between features and health conditions automatically. The architecture of CNN diagnosis model is simple and convenient to implement. Finally, a centrifugal pump dataset and a motor bearing dataset are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with shallow methods and deep learning methods.",Backtracking search optimization heuristics for nonlinear Hammerstein controlled auto regressive auto regressive systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770155,ISA transactions,2019 02 16,"In this work, novel application of evolutionary computational heuristics is presented for parameter identification problem of nonlinear Hammerstein controlled auto regressive auto regressive (NHCARAR) systems through global search competency of backtracking search algorithm (BSA), differential evolution (DE) and genetic algorithms (GAs).

Surgical technique for TEA destabilizes the elbow by removing the medial and lateral collateral ligaments and, frequently, the radiocapitellar articulation. Current semiconstrained implants aim to allow for physiological varus and valgus motion by employing a sloppy hinge; however, over time, these designs fail owing to nonanatomic force transmission. Nonanatomic force transmission results from ligament release, force transmission primarily to the humeral and ulnar shafts, and radial head resection.

Sea lamprey populations were subsequently controlled using an aggressive integrated pest-management program which employed barriers and traps to prevent sea lamprey from migrating to their spawning grounds and the use of the piscicides (lampricides) 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) and niclosamide to eliminate larval sea lampreys from their nursery streams. Although sea lampreys have not been eradicated from the Great Lakes, populations have been suppressed to less than 10% of their peak numbers in the mid-1900s. The ongoing use of lampricides provides the foundation for sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes, one of the most successful invasive species control programs in the world. Yet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how lampricides are taken-up and handled by sea lampreys, how lampricides exert their toxic effects, and how they adversely affect non-target invertebrate and vertebrates species. In this review we examine what has been learned about the uptake, handling and elimination, and the mode of TFM and niclosamide toxicity in lampreys and in non-target animals, particularly in the last 10 years. It is now clear that the mode of TFM toxicity is the same in non-target fishes and lampreys, in which TFM interferes with oxidative phosphorylation by the mitochondria leading to decreased ATP production. Vulnerability to TFM is related to abiotic factors such as water pH and alkalinity, which we propose changes the relative amounts of the bioavailable un-ionized form of TFM in the gill microenvironment. Niclosamide, which is also a molluscicide used to control snails in areas prone to schistosomiasis infections of humans, also likely works by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, but less is known about other aspects of its toxicology. The effects of TFM include reductions in energy stores, particularly glycogen and high energy phosphagens. However, non-target fishes readily recover from sub-lethal TFM exposure as demonstrated by the rapid restoration of energy stores and clearance of TFM. Although both TFM and niclosamide are non-persistent in the environment and critical for sea lamprey control, increasing public and institutional concerns about pesticides in the environment makes it imperative to explore other means of sea lamprey control. Accordingly, we also address possible ""next-generation"" strategies of sea lamprey control including genetic tools such as RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 to impair critical physiological processes (e.g. reproduction, digestion, metamorphosis) in lamprey, and the use of green chemistry to develop more environmentally benign chemical methods of sea lamprey control.",Gas chromatography system constant database over an extended temperature range for nine open-tubular columns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770145,Journal of chromatography.

System maps constructed from the system constant database are used to evaluate the influence of temperature on the contribution of intermolecular interactions to differences in selectivity. None of the stationary phases are hydrogen-bond acids. Increasing temperature reduces the contribution from cavity formation/dispersion, dipole-type interactions and hydrogen-bond basicity in a stationary phase specific manner with their preservation to the highest temperature studied for each column. Electron lone pair interactions are generally repulsive at lower temperatures becoming attractive and leading to an increase in retention at higher temperatures."

Bauer and Scheim, in a companion set of articles, extend these proposals by developing new attribution-blind measures of perceived discrimination and using VanderWeele's 3-way decomposition to quantify its contribution to disparities through differential exposure and differential effects (sometimes called differential vulnerability or susceptibility). In this commentary, after providing an overview of causal inference interpretations with social characteristics, we provide a broad overview of old and new decomposition methods in the social sciences literature and contrast their strengths and weaknesses for studying intersectional inequalities. We then examine how different forms of differential effects can be expressed within these decompositions and discuss their utility for the purpose of informing interventions for reducing disparities. Last, we discuss the tension in social sciences research when prominent explanatory variables represent constructs that are only defined or exist for certain marginalized populations and may not neatly fit within the decomposition methods framework.

However, precise grading in bladder cancer is critical for therapeutic decision making and thus requires reliable immunohistochemical biomarkers. Herein, an exemplary potential biomarker in bladder cancer was identified by the novel approach of Fourier transform infrared imaging for label-free tissue annotation of tissue thin sections. Identified regions of interest are collected by laser microdissection to provide homogeneous samples for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. This approach afforded label-free spatial classification with a high accuracy and without interobserver variability, along with the molecular resolution of the proteomic analysis. Cystitis and invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma samples were analyzed. Three candidate biomarkers were identified and verified by immunohistochemistry in a small cohort, including low-grade urothelial carcinoma samples. The best-performing candidate AHNAK2 was further evaluated in a much larger independent verification cohort that also included CIS samples. Reactive urothelial atypia and CIS were distinguishable on the basis of the expression of this newly identified and verified immunohistochemical biomarker, with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 69%.

In consecutive 23,358 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions between 2005 and 2016, total of 2,179 patients that required 2,179 elective NCS after DES placement were retrospectively analyzed. A net adverse clinical event (NACE), composite of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and major bleeding, was assessed at 30 days. Of 2,179 patients, 937 patients (43%) underwent NCS with discontinuation of APT. For overall, NACE occurred in 10 patients who discontinued APT (1.1%) and 22 patients who continued APT (1.8%) without significant differences (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 1.27, p = 0.182). Also, adjusted NACE event rates were not different between groups for overall NCSs (adjusted HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.52, p = 0.440), for NCSs >1, ≤12 months after DES, and for NCSs >12 months after DES. Our findings persisted (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.10, p = 0.618) when those who continued dual-APT were excluded from the continuation of APT group due to a higher tendency of NACE compared with those who continued single-APT (adjusted HR 2.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.21, p = 0.055).

We conducted 36 focus group discussions between July 2014 and December 2015 with Medicaid enrollees participating in the MIPCD programs. We assessed participants' satisfaction by program type (i.e., diabetes prevention, diabetes management, hypertension reduction, smoking cessation, and weight management) related to three components: program enrollment and participation, staff courtesy, and program convenience. Based on Aday and Andersen's framework, we conducted thematic analysis to determine similarities and differences across MIPCD programs by type. Participant feedback confirmed the importance of several features of the Aday and Andersen framework, particularly programs with easy enrollment and participation procedures, courteous and helpful staff, and those that are convenient and flexible for participants. Participants valued programming around the clock via telephone and flexible, in-person hours of operation as well as proximity of the program to reliable transportation. We observed that most participants, despite enrollment and participation barriers, perceived programs as accessible and were willing to engage and continue to participate. This finding may reflect behavior change theory's perspective on personal readiness to change. Individuals in the preparation stage of change can effectively change health habits despite barriers they may encounter. In some cases, personal readiness to change was more impactful than consumer satisfaction at encouraging ongoing participation and perceived access to the programs. Thus, program developers may want to consider individual participant readiness to change and its impact on consumer satisfaction when designing, implementing, and evaluating behavior change initiatives.",Characterization of digestate composting stability using fluorescence EEM spectroscopy combining with PARAFAC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770032,"Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",2019 04 22,"A laboratory scale experiment of digestate composting was carried out using a reactor system. In this study, conventional physicochemical and biological analyses were carried out and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to assess the maturity and stability during digestate composting. A four-component model was obtained and three components, i.e. fulvic-like (C1 and C3), protein-like (C2), and humic-like (C4) components, were identified. Furthermore, the ratios of each two components were calculated and the relationships with other parameters were established using Pearson correlation analysis. The results showed that the main humification process during digestate composting was the accumulation of fulvic-like substances and that secondary formation occurred at the late stage of digestate composting. Moreover, the EEM-PARAFAC technique could be used as a sensitive and efficient tool for assessing the dynamic changes of digestate composting. The ratio C4/(C1 + C3) is the most suitable indicator in evaluating the stability of digestate composting.","Knee Function, Strength, and Resumption of Preinjury Sports Participation in Young Athletes Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770031,The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy,2019 03 01,"Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), young athletes demonstrate deficits in knee function and strength whose association with successful return to preinjury sports participation is not well understood.",Insulin resistance and insulin hypersecretion in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: Time for a conceptual framework shift.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770030,Diabetes & vascular disease research,2019 04 24,"While few dispute the existence of the metabolic syndrome as a clustering of factors indicative of poor metabolic health, its utility above that of its individual components in the clinical care of individual patients is questioned. This is likely a consequence of the failure of clinicians and scientists to agree on a unifying mechanism to explain the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance has most commonly been proposed for this role and is generally considered to be a root causative factor for not only metabolic syndrome but also for its associated conditions of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity-related type 2 diabetes (T2D) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). An alternative view, for which evidence is mounting, is that hyper-responsiveness of islet β-cells to a hostile environment, such as westernised lifestyle, is primary and that the resulting hyperinsulinaemia drives the other components of the metabolic syndrome. Importantly, within this new conceptual framework, insulin resistance, while always a biomarker and state of poor metabolic health, is not considered to be harmful, but a protective adaptive response of critical tissues including the myocardium against insulin-induced metabolic stress. This major shift in how metabolic syndrome can be considered puts insulin hypersecretion into position as the unifying mechanism.

For almost 120 years, it has been a stomping ground for scientific discovery, and ice research has often been a trailblazer for investigations into a wide range of materials-related phenomena. Here, the experimental progress of the last couple of years is reviewed, and open questions as well as future challenges are discussed. The specific topics include (i) the polytypism and stacking disorder of ice I, (ii) the mechanism of the pressure amorphization of ice I, (iii) the emptying of gas-filled clathrate hydrates to give new low-density ice polymorphs, (iv) the effects of acid/base doping on hydrogen-ordering phase transitions as well as (v) the formation of solid solutions between salts and the ice polymorphs, and the effect this has on the appearance of the phase diagram. In addition to continuing efforts to push the boundaries in terms of the extremes of pressure and temperature, the exploration of the ""chemical"" dimensions of ice research appears to now be a newly emerging trend. It is without question that ice research has entered a very exciting era.",Measuring heat flux beyond Fourier's law.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770018,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"We use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics to explore the effect of shear flow on heat flux. By simulating a simple fluid in a channel bounded by tethered atoms, the heat flux is computed for two systems: a temperature driven one with no flow and a wall driven, Couette flow system. The results for the temperature driven system give Fourier's law thermal conductivity, which is shown to agree well with experiments. Through comparison of the two systems, we quantify the additional components of the heat flux parallel and normal to the walls due to shear flow. To compute the heat flux in the flow direction, the Irving-Kirkwood equations are integrated over a volume, giving the so-called volume average form, and they are also manipulated to get expressions for the surface averaged and method of planes forms. The method of planes and volume average forms are shown to give equivalent results for the heat flux when using small volumes. The heat flux in the flow direction is obtained consistently over a range of simulations, and it is shown to vary linearly with strain rate, as predicted by theory. The additional strain rate dependent component of the heat flux normal to the wall is obtained by fitting the strain rate dependence of the heat flux to the expected form. As a result, the additional terms in the thermal conductivity tensor quantified in this work should be experimentally testable.",Oscillator strengths and integral cross sections of the ÃA2″1← X̃1A1 excitation of ammonia studied by fast electron impact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770016,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"The vibrationally resolved generalized oscillator strengths of the first and strongest singlet excitation ÃA2″1← X̃1A1 of ammonia have been determined at an impact electron energy of 1500 eV with an energy resolution of 80 meV. The comprehensive comparison of the present results with the previous experimental and theoretical ones shows that the high-energy limit, where the first Born approximation holds, has been reached at an impact electron energy of 1500 eV in K2 < 1 a.u., while it is still not satisfied in the K2 > 1 a.u. even at 1500 eV. It is also observed that the minimum position of the generalized oscillator strength of the vibronic state shifts toward the larger squared momentum transfer with the increasing vibrational quantum number. By extrapolating the generalized oscillator strength to the zero momentum transfer, the optical oscillator strength of the ÃA2″1 state has been obtained, which gives an independent cross check to the previous results. The integral cross sections of the ÃA2″1 state have been obtained systematically from the threshold to 5000 eV with the aid of the BE-scaling method.",Memory effects in a random walk description of protein structure ensembles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770015,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 03 01,"In this paper, we show that ensembles of well-structured and unstructured proteins can be distinguished by borrowing concepts from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. For this purpose, we represent proteins by two different polymer models and interpret the resulting polymer configurations as random walks of a diffusing particle in space. The first model is the trace of the Cα-atoms along the protein main chain, and the second is their projections onto the protein axis. The resulting trajectories are subsequently analyzed using the theory of the generalized Langevin equation. Velocities are replaced by displacements relating consecutive points on the discrete protein axes and equilibrium ensemble averages by averages over appropriate protein structure ensembles. The resulting displacement autocorrelation functions resemble those of the velocity autocorrelation functions of simple liquids and display a minimum, which can be related to the lengths of secondary structure elements. This minimum is clearly more pronounced for well-structured proteins than for unstructured ones, and the corresponding memory function displays a slower decay, indicating a stronger ""folding memory.""",Photophysical features and semiconducting properties of propeller-shaped oligo(styryl)benzenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770014,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Electronic, optical, and semiconducting properties of a series of propeller-shaped oligo(styryl)benzenes have been systematically investigated to monitor the effect of the number of styryl branches (three, four, and six) around a central benzene core. In order to clarify the relationships between their structures and properties, Density Functional Theory calculations were carried out at several levels of theory considering solvents with different polarity. Absorption and vibrational Raman spectroscopies showed that cruciform, four-branched derivatives present the most effective π-conjugation in agreement with the lowest calculated bond length alternation and bandgap. Deviations from the mirror image symmetry between absorption and fluorescence spectra were related to changes in the molecular conformation upon electronic excitation. Furthermore, in order to investigate the semiconducting behavior of oligo(styryl)benzenes, molecular structure changes and different electronic properties related to ionization processes were calculated and analyzed. Hole and electron reorganization energies were also computed to provide a first approximation on the n- or p-type character of these compounds. In some cases, electron reorganization energies comparable to common n-type semiconductors were found.",Inelastic excitation and charge transfer processes for oxygen in collision with H atoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770013,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Potential energy functions of the OH molecule are investigated from small to large inter-atomic distances R. The electronic problem is treated using an efficient Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI) approach that avoids orbital jumps found usually in multi-configuration self-consistent-field followed by multi-reference configuration interaction calculations of excited states. The calculations are performed for all the doublet, quartet, and sextet OH molecular states, up to the O(2p34s 3S) + H(1s 2S) asymptote, and for the lowest O- + H+ and O+ + H- ionic states. Inter-atomic distances, ranging from 0.5 Å to 20 Å, are spanned with a very small step in order to describe accurately the avoided crossings between the adiabatic potential energy functions. The accuracy of the potentials at small and large R values is analyzed. These Full CI calculations provide for the first time a global description of the 40 lowest molecular states of OH, well suited for dynamical calculations. The resulting potentials are used to obtain first estimates of cross sections and rate coefficients for different inelastic processes through the multichannel approach. This method, based on a Landau-Zener formalism taking into account the ionic-covalent avoided crossings at large distances, gives reliable results for the most intense transitions. It is shown that the largest rate coefficients correspond to mutual neutralization and ion-pair production processes.",Complexity surrounding an apparently simple Fermi resonance in p-fluorotoluene revealed using two-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (2D-LIF) spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770012,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Two-dimensional laser-induced fluorescence (2D-LIF) spectroscopy is a powerful tool allowing overlapped features in an electronic spectrum to be separated, and interactions between vibrations and torsions to be identified. Here the technique is employed to assign the 790-825 cm-1 region above the origin of the S1 ← S0 transition in para-fluorotoluene, which provides insight into the unusual time-resolved results of Davies and Reid [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 193004 (2012)]. The region is dominated by a pair of bands that arise from a Fermi resonance; however, the assignment is complicated by contributions from a number of overtones and combinations, including vibration-torsion (""vibtor"") levels. The activity in the 2D-LIF spectra is compared to the recently reported zero-electron-kinetic-energy spectra [Tuttle et al., J. Chem.

The accuracy of the Gaussian wave packet approximation is validated against numerically exact MCTDH simulations for a fully anharmonic seven-dimensional model of the I2Kr18 cluster in a crystal Kr cage. The linear absorption spectrum, time-evolving vibrational probability densities, and I2 energy expectation value are accurately reproduced by the numerically efficient G-MCTDH approach. The reduced density matrix of the chromophore is analyzed in the coordinate, Wigner and energy representations, so as to obtain a multifaceted dynamical view of the guest-host interactions. Vibrational coherences extending over the bond distance range 2.7 Å < RI-I < 4.0 Å are found to survive for several vibrational periods, despite extensive dissipation. The present results prepare the ground for the simulation of time-resolved coherent Raman spectroscopy of the I2-krypton system addressed in Paper II.",Bidirectional spin filter in a triple orbital molecule junction by tuning the magnetic field along a single direction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770009,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Metal-molecule-metal junction is considered the basing block and key element of molecular spintronic devices, within which to generate spin polarized currents is one of the most fundamental issues for quantum computation and quantum information. In this paper, by employing a parallel triple orbital molecule junction with large inter-orbital tunneling couplings, we propose theoretically a bidirectional spin filter where both spin-up and spin-down currents could be obtained by simply adjusting the external magnetic field to different regimes along a single direction, and the filtered efficiencies could reach almost 100%. The Zeeman effect and the occupancy switching for the bonding and anti-bonding states are found to be responsible for the spin selective transport. We demonstrate that our scheme is robust for large parameter spaces of the orbital energy level, except the particle-hole symmetric point, and is widely suitable for the strong-, weak-, and non-interacting cases. To implement these problems, we use the Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique to treat such systems.",Structural changes in nanoparticle-hydrogel composites at very low filler concentrations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770008,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"We study the enhancement of the stiffness of two families of hydrogels (polyacrylamide, PAAm, and polydimethylacrylamide, PDMA) due to the additions of very small amounts of silica nanofillers. It is well established that high concentrations of silica nanoparticles enhance the toughness of both hydrogel types, but significantly more for the PDMA based gels that adsorb readily to silica surfaces. In order to decouple the structural changes in the gels that stem either from polymerization kinetics or from the interactions between nanofillers and polymers, we use a photoinitiator for the polymerization of the composite gels that promotes the structural homogeneity of the hydrogels. We characterize both the mechanical and structural properties of the composite hydrogels as a function of nanofiller concentration, by calculating the single particle diffusion of inert polystyrene tracer particles of three different sizes. In agreement with previous experiments, we find that silica nanoparticles increase the stiffness of PAAm gels more than expected for passive fillers. Surprisingly, we find that a small addition of silica nanoparticles during gel polymerization to PDMA based hydrogels softens them. We attribute this effect to an increase of the average mesh size of the gel, allowing particles of 0.49 μm in diameter to diffuse normally through the gel, but restricting the motion of larger particles. A further increase in silica nanoparticle concentration results in the expected stiffening of the gel. PDMA based composites with a large mean pore size, as reported here, may find applications in particle separation and gentle fixation of microorganisms and cells."

Ionic aggregates form in these systems with a variety of shapes ranging from isolated aggregates to percolated aggregates. At the lower temperature of 423 K, the ionic aggregate morphologies do not reach a steady-state distribution over the course of the simulations. At the higher temperature of 600 K, the aggregates are sufficiently mobile that they rearrange and reach steady state after hundreds of nanoseconds. For systems that are 100% neutralized with lithium, the ions form percolated aggregates that span the simulation box in three directions, for all three spacer lengths (9, 15, and 21). In the partially neutralized systems, the morphology includes lithium ion aggregates that may also include some unneutralized acid groups, along with a coexisting population of acid group aggregates that form through hydrogen bonding. In the lithium ion aggregates, unneutralized acid groups tend to be found on the ends or sides of the aggregates.",The modulating action of electric field on magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769996,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"We investigate the modulating action of an external electric field on the magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance in ultracold heteronuclear atomic collision by using the multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT).

By taking the truncated -C6/R6 - C8/R8 - C10/R10 potential as the reference potential, the threshold behaviors of four quantum-defect parameters for the lowest three partial waves are described. The results calculated by using the MQDT agree with those calculated using the coupled channel method.

This takes inspiration from a recently developed algorithm by Liu et al., in 2017, where the rate-determining step is the accurate evaluation of electrostatic potential. This introduces the Fourier convolution theorem in conjunction with a range-separated Coulomb interaction kernel. The latter is efficiently mapped into a real grid through a simple optimization procedure, giving rise to a constraint in the range-separated parameter. The overall process offers logarithmic scaling with respect to the molecular size. It is then extended toward global hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, PBE0, and BHLYP within pseudopotential Kohn-Sham theory, through an LCAO-MO ansatz in a Cartesian grid, developed earlier in our laboratory. For the sake of comparison, a parallel semi-numerical approach has also been worked out that exploits the familiar Obara-Saika recursion algorithm without any additional techniques. An excellent agreement between these two routes is demonstrated through total energy and orbital energy in a series of atoms and molecules (including 10 π-electron molecules), employing an LANL2DZ-type basis function. A critical analysis of these two algorithms reveals that the proposed numerical scheme could lead to very attractive and competitive scaling. The success of our approach also enables us for further development of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid and hyper functionals.",Quantum dynamics and spectroscopy of dihalogens in solid matrices.

Picconi et al., J. Chem. Phys. 150, 064111 (2019)]. These experiments monitor the time-evolving vibrational coherence between two wave packets created in a quantum superposition (i.e., a ""Schrödinger cat state"") by a pair of pump pulses which induce electronic B Πu30+⟵XΣg+1 transitions. A theoretical description of the spectroscopic measurement is developed, which elucidates the connection between the nonlinear signals and the wave packet coherence. The analysis provides an effective means to simulate the spectra for several different optical conditions with a minimum number of quantum dynamical propagations. The G-MCTDH method is used to calculate and interpret the time-resolved coherent Raman spectra of two selected initial superpositions for a I2Kr18 cluster embedded in a frozen Kr cage. The time- and frequency-dependent signals carry information about the molecular mechanisms of dissipation and decoherence, which involve vibrational energy transfer to the stretching mode of the four ""belt"" Kr atoms.

The Qion calculated with the (BEB/ωB97X) combination is found to give good agreement with the experimental results, the CSP-ic method, and the Qion calculated from Irikura orbital energies. The Qion for most of the targets are calculated for the first time over such a wide energy range. Hence, to check the consistency and reliability of the present data, we have also computed the static polarizability for all the targets and the variation of maximum ionization cross section (Qion,max) with polarizability is studied. A linear relationship is observed between these quantities indicating the consistency and reliability of the present Qion data.

The ordered bilayer forms flat and rigid domains, which is connected or rimmed with flexible domains in the disordered phase. The asymmetric emergence of the phase separation region close to the ordered phase side is interpreted based on the almost equal distribution of the n-alkane to the ordered and disordered phase domains.","Reversibility, pattern formation, and edge transport in active chiral and passive disk mixtures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769991,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"We numerically examine mixtures of circularly moving and passive disks as a function of density and active orbit radius. For low or intermediate densities and/or small orbit radii, the system can organize into a reversible partially phase separated labyrinth state in which there are no collisions between disks, with the degree of phase separation increasing as the orbit radius increases. As a function of orbit radius, we find a divergence in the number of cycles required to reach a collision-free steady state at a critical radius, while above this radius, the system remains in a fluctuating liquid state. For high densities, the system can organize into a fully phase separated state that is mostly reversible, but collisions at the boundaries between the phases lead to a net transport of disks along the boundary edges in a direction determined by the chirality of the active disk orbits. We map the dynamic phases as a function of density and orbit radii and discuss the results in terms of the reversible-irreversible transition found in other periodically driven non-thermal systems. We also consider mixtures of circularly driven disks and ac driven disks where the ac drive is either in or out of phase with the circular motion and find a rich variety of pattern forming and reentrant disordered phases.",Effect of additives on liquid droplet of protein-polyelectrolyte complex for high-concentration formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769990,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Liquid droplets of protein-polyelectrolyte complexes (PPCs) have been developed as a new candidate for stabilization and concentration of protein drugs. However, it remains unclear whether additives affect the precipitation and redissolution yields of PPCs. In the present study, we investigated the PPC formation of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) and poly-L-glutamic acid (polyE) in the presence of various additives that have diverse effects, such as protein stabilization. Alcohols, including ethanol, successfully increased the PPC precipitation yield to over 90%, and the PPCs formed were completely redissolved at physiological ionic strength. However, poly(ethylene glycol), sugars, and amino acids did not improve the precipitation and redissolution yields of PPCs over those observed when no additives were included. Circular dichroism spectrometry showed that the secondary structure of polyE as well as electrostatic interactions play important roles in increasing the PPC precipitation yield when ethanol is used as an additive. The maximum concentration of IgG reached 100 mg/ml with the use of ethanol, which was 15% higher efficiency of the protein yield after precipitation and redissolution than that in the absence of additives. Thus, the addition of a small amount of ethanol is effective for the concentration and stabilization of precipitated PPCs containing IgG formulations.",Mid-infrared quantum cascade laser spectroscopy of the Ar-NO complex: Fine and hyperfine structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769989,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"The rovibrational spectrum of the Ar-NO open-shell complex has been measured in the 5.3 µm region using distributed feed-back quantum lasers to probe the direct absorption in a slit-jet supersonic expansion.

Here we derive a simple model, which reduces phoretic far-field interactions to a pair-interaction whose strength is mainly controlled by one genuine parameter (swimming speed). The model suggests that phoretic interactions are generically important for autophoretic colloids (unless effective screening of the phoretic fields is strong) and should dominate over hydrodynamic interactions for the typical case of half-coating and moderately nonuniform surface mobilities. Unlike standard minimal models, but in accordance with canonical experiments, our model generically predicts dynamic clustering in active colloids at a low density. This suggests that dynamic clustering can emerge from the interplay of screened phoretic attractions and active diffusion."

Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra are obtained for all three clusters, and the measured vibrational and electronic information is used to compare with theoretical calculations to understand their structures and bonding. Bi2B2- is found to be linear (D∞h, 2Πg) with a B2 unit and two terminal Bi atoms, while Bi2B3- is found to be planar (C2v, 1A1), consisting of a B3 triangle with two bridging Bi atoms.

These outcomes are complemented by the consideration of an average number of hydrogen bonds per melamine and preferential interaction parameter calculations. The impact of temperature is negligible on the orientational probability between the two triazine cores. The π-π stacking interaction between the two triazine rings plays a less significant role on melamine aggregation. Dynamical calculations, by considering cluster structure analyses and dimer existence autocorrelation function, strengthen the fact of destabilization of aggregated melamine in water with the rise in temperature. With free energy of solvation, association constant along with the binding free energy between a melamine pair gives the thermodynamic point of view of the impact of elevated temperature on melamine aggregation. Interestingly, the potential of mean force calculation using an umbrella sampling technique explains the reasons, in depth, of how do sp3 N-sp2 N interactions confirm the decrease in the initial probability of growth of higher order clusters with the increase in temperature.",Trapping of diffusing particles by small absorbers localized in a spherical region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769973,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 27,"We study trapping of particles diffusing in a spherical cavity with an absorbing wall containing small static spherical absorbers localized in a spherical region in the center of the cavity. The focus is on the competition between the absorbers and the cavity wall for diffusing particles. Assuming that the absorbers and, initially, the particles are uniformly distributed in the central region, we derive an expression for the particle trapping probability by the cavity wall. The expression gives this probability as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the transparency parameter, characterizing the efficiency of the particle trapping by the absorbers, and the ratio of the absorber-containing region radius to that of the cavity. This work is a generalization of a recent study by Krapivsky and Redner [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 214903 (2017)] who considered the case where the absorber-containing region occupies the entire cavity. The expression for the particle trapping probability is derived in the framework of a steady-state approach which, in our opinion, is much simpler than the time-dependent approach used in the above-mentioned study.",Pattern of property extrema in supercooled and stretched water models and a new correlation for predicting the stability limit of the liquid state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769971,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Water exhibits anomalous behavior in its supercooled region. A widely invoked hypothesis to explain supercooled water's thermodynamic anomalies is the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid transition terminating at a critical point. In this work, we analyze previously published and new simulation results for three commonly used molecular water models (ST2, TIP4P/2005, and TIP5P) that support the existence of the metastable liquid-liquid transition. We demonstrate that a corresponding-states-like rescaling of pressure and temperature results in a significant degree of universality in the pattern of extrema loci of the density, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. We also report, for the first time, an intriguing correlation between the location of the liquid-liquid critical point, the rescaled locus of density extrema, and the stability limit of the liquid state with respect to the vapor. A similar correlation is observed for two theoretical models that also exhibit a second (liquid-liquid) critical point, namely, the van der Waals and lattice-gas ""two-structure"" models. This new correlation is used to explore the stability limit of the liquid state in simultaneously supercooled and stretched water.",Nuclear singlet relaxation by scalar relaxation of the second kind in the slow-fluctuation regime.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769970,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"The singlet state of nuclear spin-1/2 pairs is protected against many common relaxation mechanisms. Singlet order, which is defined as the population difference between the nuclear singlet and triplet states, usually decays more slowly than the nuclear magnetization. Nevertheless, some decay mechanisms for nuclear singlet order persist. One such mechanism is called scalar relaxation of the second kind (SR2K) and involves the relaxation of additional nuclei (""third spins"") which have scalar couplings to the spin-1/2 pair. This mechanism requires a difference between the couplings of at least one third spin with the two members of the spin-1/2 pair, and depends on the longitudinal relaxation time of the third spin. The SR2K mechanism of nuclear singlet relaxation has previously been examined in the case where the relaxation rate of the additional spins is on the time scale of the nuclear Larmor frequency. In this paper, we consider a different regime, in which the longitudinal relaxation of the third spins is on a similar time scale to the J-coupling between the members of the spin pair. This regime is often encountered when the spin-1/2 pair has scalar couplings to nearby deuterium nuclei. We show that the SR2K mechanism may be suppressed in this regime by applying a radiofrequency field which is resonant either with the members of the spin pair, or with the third spins. These phenomena are analyzed theoretically and by numerical simulations, and demonstrated experimentally on a diester of [13C2, 2H2]-labeled fumarate in solution.",Analysis of electrical double layer structure in molten salts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769969,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"This paper reports the results of analysis of the electrical double layer (EDL) phenomenon in molten salts to provide information on the influence of short range interaction type on the shape of charge distribution and the effect of the charge distribution shape on capacitance values. A new method of analysis is proposed, which allows a quantitative discussion. It is assumed that EDL can be modelled as a number of capacitor plates connected in series. This paper reports the application of the proposed method in quantitative analysis of the molten salt capacitance data obtained for different short range potentials. The data to be analysed were obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations of the symmetrical molten salt electrolyte for the following short range interaction potentials: hard spheres, Lennard-Jones repulsions, and full Lennard-Jones. The new analysis method gives a more detailed understanding of EDL in molten salts and can become an inspiration for new researches in this field.","Kinetics of the γ-δ phase transition in energetic nitramine-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769966,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"The solid, secondary explosive nitramine-octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7 or HMX has four different stable polymorphs which have different molecular conformations, crystalline structures, and densities, making structural phase transitions between these nontrivial. Previous studies of the kinetics of the β-δ HMX structural transition found this to happen by a nucleation and growth mechanism, where growth was governed by the heat of fusion, or melting, even though the phase transition temperature is more than 100 K below the melting point. A theory known as virtual melting could easily justify this since the large volume difference in the two phases creates a strain at their interface that can lower the melting point to the phase transition temperature through a relaxation of the elastic energy. To learn more about structural phase transitions in organic crystalline solids and virtual melting, here we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to study another structural phase transition in HMX, γ-δ. Again, second order kinetics are observed which fit to the same nucleation and growth model associated with growth by melting even though the volume change in this transition is too small to lower the melting point by interfacial strain. To account for this, we present a more general model illustrating that melting over a very thin layer at the interface between the two phases reduces the total interfacial energy and is therefore thermodynamically favorable and can drive the structural phase transition in the absence of large volume changes. Our work supports the idea that virtual melting may be a more generally applicable mechanism for structural phase transitions in organic crystalline solids.",Ab initio studies of the ground and first excited states of the Sr-H2 and Yb-H2 complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769965,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Accurate intermolecular potential-energy surfaces (IPESs) for the ground and first excited states of the Sr-H2 and Yb-H2 complexes were calculated. After an extensive methodological study, the coupled cluster with single, double, and non-iterative triple excitation method with the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian and correlation-consistent basis sets of triple-ζ quality extended with 2 sets of diffuse functions and a set of midbond functions were chosen. The obtained ground-state IPESs are similar in both complexes, being relatively isotropic with two minima and two transition states (equivalent by symmetry). The global minima correspond to the collinear geometries with R = 5.45 and 5.10 Å and energies of -27.7 and -31.7 cm-1 for the Sr-H2 and Yb-H2 systems, respectively. The calculated surfaces for the Sr(3P)-H2 and Yb(3P)-H2 states are deeper and more anisotropic, and they exhibit similar patterns within both complexes. The deepest surfaces, where the singly occupied p-orbital of the metal atom is perpendicular to the intermolecular axis, are characterised by the global minima of ca. -2053 and -2260 cm-1 in the T-shape geometries at R = 2.41 and 2.29 Å for Sr-H2 and Yb-H2, respectively. Additional calculations for the complexes of Sr and Yb with the He atom revealed a similar, strong dependence of the interaction energy on the orientation of the p-orbital in the Sr(3P)-He and Yb(3P)-He states.","A simple, parameter-free method for computing solvation free energies of ions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769964,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 26,"Solvation free energies of ions are difficult to determine from molecular dynamics simulations due to the long-range Coulomb interactions. Various approximations and corrections are introduced to enable their calculation in small systems, which, however, raises issues of robustness. We show that solvation free energies of ions can be calculated using the spherical boundary conditions without introducing any corrections at the boundary via a buffer zone. The results are shown to converge for a droplet size of 21 Å and are independent of the parameters used for confining water or restraining the ion. The proposed method thus resolves the robustness issues in solvation free energy calculations of ions and can be used with confidence to determine force field parameters from such calculations. We apply the method to calculate the solvation free energies of the side chain analogs of charged amino acids. Tests using periodic boundary conditions show that similar results are also obtained in that case."

Although chordoma is slow growing tumors, while are extremely recurrent, and aggressive, as well as the rate of prognosis remains poorly. Radical surgery and high-dose radiation are the most used treatments. Currently, there is no effective chemotherapeutic standard for chordomas. The Hedgehog (HH) pathway adjusts various processes included in expansion and differentiation of tissues and organs throughout the fetus's life, furthermore cell growth and differentiation in the adult organism, of the cell in an adult organism, in which acute anesthesia is involved in multiple cancers. To study the role of signaling the hedgehog in the base of the skull and sacrum chordomas, the expression of SHH and GLI-1 levels were detected immuno histochemically, Additionally, PTCH-1 and GLI-1 expressions were distinguished by in- Situ- hybridization. Based on the findings presented herein, it is likely that the HH signal cascade was revealed even in cranial, where consecoently spinal chordoma and their recurrences play an important role. Our staining exhibited a canonical, ligand- dependent and autocrine Hedgehog signaling in skull base and sacrum chordomas including relapse. Due to the high levels of SHH and GLI-1 expression in all investigated chordoma samples, the study suggests a possible autocrine ligand-dependent activation of the canonical HH signaling cascade. A paracrine or non-canonical pathway cannot be excluded. Our results suggest that Hedgehog-inhibitors, like SHH-, GLI- and SMO- inhibitors, might serve as a potential and effective target for the treatment of chordomas.",The Prognostic Significance of Puncture Timing to Survival of Arteriovenous Fistulas in Hemodialysis Patients: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769951,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"(1) Background: A functional shunt is critical to hemodialysis, but the ideal timing of shunt cannulation is still not established.

Fistulas were categorized by functional maturation time, defined as the time from the date of shunt construction to the first successful cannulation. Functional cumulative survival, measured as the duration from the first puncture to shunt abandonment, was mainly regarded. (3) Results: The fistulas created between 91 and 180 days prior to the first cannulation had significantly greater cumulative functional survival (HR 0.883; 95% CI 0.792⁻0.984), and there was no more benefit on their survival from waiting more than 180 days (HR 0.957; 95% CI 0.853⁻1.073) for shunt maturity. (4) Conclusions: Our results showed that to achieve better long-term shunt survivals, fistulas should be constructed at least 90 days before starting hemodialysis.

In addition to consumption of hydrogen, microbial processes such as fermentation and nitrogen fixation produce hydrogen. Hydrogen is also produced by a number of abiotic processes including radiolysis, serpentinization, graphitization, and cataclasis of silicate minerals. Both biotic and abiotically generated hydrogen may become available for consumption by microorganisms, but biotic production and consumption are usually tightly coupled. Understanding the microbiology of hydrogen cycling is relevant to subsurface engineered environments where hydrogen-cycling microorganisms are implicated in gas consumption and production and corrosion in a number of industries including carbon capture and storage, energy gas storage, and radioactive waste disposal. The same hydrogen-cycling microorganisms and processes are important in natural sites with elevated hydrogen and can provide insights into early life on Earth and life on other planets. This review draws together what is known about microbiology in natural environments with elevated hydrogen, and highlights where similar microbial populations could be of relevance to subsurface industry.","A ""Green"" Homogenate Extraction Coupled with UHPLC-MS for the Rapid Determination of Diterpenoids in Croton Crassifolius.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769949,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 06,"Clerodane diterpenoids are the main bioactive constituents of Croton crassifolius and are proved to have multiple biological activities. However, quality control (QC) research on the constituents are rare. Thus, the major research purpose of the current study was to establish an efficient homogenate extraction (HGE) process combined with a sensitive and specific ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC⁻MS) technique together for the rapid extraction and determination of clerodane diterpenoids in C. crassifolius. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r > 0.9943) within the test ranges and the intra- and inter-day precisions and repeatability were all within required limits. This modified HGE⁻UHPLC⁻MS method only took 5 min to extract nine clerodane diterpenoids in C. crassifolius and another 12 min to quantify these components. The results indicated that the quantitative analysis based on UHPLC⁻MS was a feasible method for QC of clerodane diterpenoids in C. crassifolius, and the findings outlined in the current study also inferred the potential of the method in the QC of clerodane diterpenoids in other complex species of plants.",Immunomodulatory Effects of (24R)-Pseudo-Ginsenoside HQ and (24S)-Pseudo-Ginsenoside HQ on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Immunosuppression and Their Anti-Tumor Effects Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769948,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"(24R)-pseudo-ginsenoside HQ (R-PHQ) and (24S)-pseudo-ginsenoside HQ (S-PHQ) are the main metabolites of (20S)-ginsenoside Rh₂ (Rh₂) in vivo.

Spleen T-lymphocyte subpopulations and the serum cytokines level were also balanced in these immunosuppressed mice. Furthermore, co-administration with R-PHQ or S-PHQ did not compromise the antitumor activity of CTX in the hepatoma H22-bearing mice. Treatment with R-PHQ and S-PHQ clearly induced the apoptosis of tumor cells, significantly increased the expression of Bax, and remarkably inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in H22 tumor tissues. The anti-tumor activity of R-PHQ and S-PHQ could be related to the promotion of tumor apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis and may involve the caspase and VEGF signaling pathways.

Here, we evaluated the potential of VSV-GP as an HIV vaccine vector. We introduced genes for different variants of the HIV-1 envelope protein Env, i.e., secreted or membrane-anchored, intact or mutated furin cleavage site or different C-termini, into the genome of VSV-GP. We found that the addition of the Env antigen did not attenuate VSV-GP replication. All HIV-1 Env variants were expressed in VSV-GP infected cells and some were incorporated very efficiently into VSV-GP particles. Crucial epitopes for binding of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 such as MPER (membrane-proximal external region), CD4 binding site, V1V2 and V3 loop were present on the surface of VSV-GP-Env particles. Binding of quaternary antibodies indicated a trimeric structure of VSV-GP incorporated Env. We detected high HIV-1 antibody titers in mice and showed that vectors expressing membrane-anchored Env elicited higher antibody titers than vectors that secreted Envs. In rabbits, Tier 1A HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies were detectable after prime immunization and titers further increased after boosting with a second immunization. Taken together, VSV-GP-Env is a promising vector vaccine against HIV-1 infection since this vector permits incorporation of native monomeric and/or trimeric HIV-1 Env into a viral membrane.",Next-Generation Sequencing Identifies Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Responsive Genes in the Juvenile Rat Cerebellum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769946,Nutrients,2019 05 28,"Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influence postnatal brain growth and development. However, little data exist regarding the impacts of dietary n-3 PUFA in juvenile animals post weaning, which is a time of rapid growth. We tested the hypothesis that depleting dietary n-3 PUFA would result in modifications to the cerebellar transcriptome of juvenile rats. To test this hypothesis, three week old male rats (an age that roughly corresponds to an 11 month old child in brain development) were fed diets containing either soybean oil (SO) providing 1.1% energy from α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3; ALA-sufficient) or corn oil (CO) providing 0.13% energy from ALA (ALA-deficient) for four weeks. Fatty acids (FAs) in the cerebellum were analyzed and revealed a 4-fold increase in n-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n-6), increases in arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) and docosatetraenoic acid (DTA; 22:4n-6), but no decrease in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), in animals fed CO versus SO. Transcript abundance was then characterized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two diets. Upper quartile (UQ) scaling and transcripts per million (TPM) data normalization identified 100 and 107 DEGs, respectively. Comparison of DEGs from the two normalization methods identified 70 genes that overlapped, with 90% having abundance differences less than 2-fold. Nr4a3, a transcriptional activator that plays roles in neuroprotection and learning, was elevated over 2-fold from the CO diet. These data indicate that expression of Nr4a3 in the juvenile rat cerebellum is responsive to dietary n-3 PUFA, but additional studies are needed clarify the neurodevelopmental relationships between n-3 PUFA and Nr4a3 and the resulting impacts.",Heat Stress in Indoor Environments of Scandinavian Urban Areas: A Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769945,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Climate change increases the risks of heat stress, especially in urban areas where urban heat islands can develop. This literature review aims to describe how severe heat can occur and be identified in urban indoor environments, and what actions can be taken on the local scale. There is a connection between the outdoor and the indoor climate in buildings without air conditioning, but the pathways leading to the development of severe heat levels indoors are complex. These depend, for example, on the type of building, window placement, the residential area's thermal outdoor conditions, and the residents' influence and behavior. This review shows that only few studies have focused on the thermal environment indoors during heat waves, despite the fact that people commonly spend most of their time indoors and are likely to experience increased heat stress indoors in the future. Among reviewed studies, it was found that the indoor temperature can reach levels 50% higher in °C than the outdoor temperature, which highlights the importance of assessment and remediation of heat indoors. Further, most Heat-Health Warning Systems (HHWS) are based on the outdoor climate only, which can lead to a misleading interpretation of the health effects and associated solutions. In order to identify severe heat, six factors need to be taken into account, including air temperature, heat radiation, humidity, and air movement as well as the physical activity and the clothes worn by the individual. Heat stress can be identified using a heat index that includes these six factors. This paper presents some examples of practical and easy to use heat indices that are relevant for indoor environments as well as models that can be applied in indoor environments at the city level. However, existing indexes are developed for healthy workers and do not account for vulnerable groups, different uses, and daily variations. As a result, this paper highlights the need for the development of a heat index or the adjustment of current thresholds to apply specifically to indoor environments, its different uses, and vulnerable groups. There are several actions that can be taken to reduce heat indoors and thus improve the health and well-being of the population in urban areas. Examples of effective measures to reduce heat stress indoors include the use of shading devices such as blinds and vegetation as well as personal cooling techniques such as the use of fans and cooling vests. Additionally, the integration of innovative Phase Change Materials (PCM) into facades, roofs, floors, and windows can be a promising alternative once no negative health and environmental effects of PCM can be ensured.",Higher-Order Mode Suppression in Antiresonant Nodeless Hollow-Core Fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769944,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Negative curvature hollow-core fibers (NC-HCFs) are useful as gas sensors. We numerically analyze the single-mode performance of NC-HCFs. Both single-ring NC-HCFs and nested antiresonant fibers (NANFs) are investigated. When the size of the cladding tubes is properly designed, higher-order modes (HOMs) in the fiber core can be coupled with the cladding modes effectively and form high-loss supermodes. For the single-ring structure, we propose a novel NC-HCF with hybrid cladding tubes to enable suppression of the first two HOMs in the core simultaneously. For the nested structure, we find that cascaded coupling is necessary to maximize the loss of the HOMs in NANFs, and, as a result, NANFs with five nested tubes have an advantage in single-mode guidance performance. Moreover, a novel NANF with hybrid extended cladding tubes is proposed. In this kind of NANF, higher-order mode extinction ratios (HOMERs) of 10⁵ and even 10⁶ are obtained for the LP11 and LP21 modes, respectively, and a similar level of 10⁵ for the LP02 modes. Good single-mode performance is maintained within a broad wavelength range.

These tumors exhibit malignant potential but seldom display evidence of metastatic spread, the latter being the only widely accepted evidence of malignancy. To counter this, pre-defined histological algorithms have been suggested to stratify the risk of malignancy: Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Scaled Score (PASS) and the Grading system for Adrenal Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (GAPP). The PASS algorithm was originally intended for PCCs whereas the GAPP model is proposed for stratification of both PCCs and PGLs. In parallel, advances in terms of coupling overtly malignant PPGLs to the underlying molecular genetics have been made, but there is yet no combined risk stratification model based on histology and the overall mutational profile of the tumor. In this review, we systematically meta-analyzed previously reported cohorts using the PASS and GAPP algorithms and acknowledge a ""rule-out"" way of approaching these stratification models rather than a classical ""rule-in"" strategy. Moreover, the current genetic panorama regarding possible molecular adjunct markers for PPGL malignancy is reviewed.

This was verified through the transcriptional up-regulation of citrinin synthesis genes (pksCT and ctnA) and the down-regulation of the Monascus pigments (MPs) synthesis genes (pksPT and pigR). Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were promoted by NaCl at the 2nd day of cultivation, and then inhibited remarkably with the extension of fermentation time. Meanwhile, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the contents of total glutathione (T-GSH) were significantly enhanced in the middle and late stages of cultivation. The inhibition effect on colony size and the growth of aerial mycelia was more obvious with an increased NaCl concentration. Acid and alkaline phosphatase (ACP and AKP) activities dramatically increased in NaCl treatments. NaCl could participate in secondary metabolites synthesis and cell growth in M. purpureus.",Haplotype and Haplotype-Environment Interaction Analysis Revealed Roles of SPRY2 for NSCL/P among Chinese Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769929,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of common birth defects in China, with genetic and environmental components contributing to the etiology. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified SPRY1 and SPRY2 to be associated with NSCL/P among Chinese populations. This study aimed to further explore potential genetic effect and gene-environment interaction among SPRY genes based on haplotype analysis, using 806 Chinese case-parent NSCL/P trios drawn from an international consortium which conducted a genome-wide association study. After the process of quality control, 190 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SPRY genes were included for analyses. Haplotype and haplotype-environment interaction analyses were conducted in Population-Based Association Test (PBAT) software. A 2-SNP haplotype and three 3-SNP haplotypes showed a significant association with the risk of NSCL/P after Bonferroni correction (corrected significance level = 2.6 × 10-4). Moreover, haplotype-environment interaction analysis identified these haplotypes respectively showing statistically significant interactions with maternal multivitamin supplementation or maternal environmental tobacco smoke. This study showed SPRY2 to be associated with NSCL/P among the Chinese population through not only gene effects, but also a gene-environment interaction, highlighting the importance of considering environmental exposures in the genetic etiological study of NSCL/P.",Incorporation of Phosphorus Impurities in a Silicon Nanowire Transistor with a Diameter of 5 nm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769928,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Silicon nanowire (SiNW) is always accompanied by severe impurity segregation and inhomogeneous distribution, which deteriorates the SiNWs electrical characteristics. In this paper, a method for phosphorus doping incorporation in SiNW was proposed using plasma. It showed that this method had a positive effect on the doping concentration of the wires with a diameter ranging from 5 nm to 20 nm. Moreover, an SiNW transistor was assembled based on the nanowire with a 5 nm diameter. The device's ION/IOFF ratio reached 10⁴. The proposed incorporation method could be helpful to improve the effect of the dopants in the silicon nanowire at a nanometer scale.",Dietary Patterns during Pregnancy Are Associated with the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Evidence from a Chinese Prospective Birth Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769927,Nutrients,2019 05 28,"Dietary patterns during pregnancy have been shown to influence the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, evidence from Asian populations is limited and inconsistent. We conducted a prospective cohort study in China to assess the relationship between dietary patterns and GDM. We administered three-day food diaries (TFD) and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) at the second trimester. GDM was diagnosed with a 75 g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24⁻28 weeks of gestation. We identified dietary patterns using principal components analysis and used multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations of dietary patterns with GDM. Of the 1014 participants, 23.5% were diagnosed with GDM. Both the TFD and FFQ identified a ""traditional pattern"", consisting of high vegetable, fruit, and rice intake, which was associated with a lower GDM risk (odds ratio (OR) for quartile 4 versus quartile 1: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23⁻0.71 for traditional pattern (TFD); OR: 0.44, CI: 0.27⁻0.70 for traditional pattern (FFQ)). The protective associations were more pronounced among women ≥35 years old. A whole grain⁻seafood TFD pattern was associated with higher risk of GDM (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.10⁻2.74). These findings may provide evidence for making dietary guidelines among pregnant women in Chinese populations to prevent GDM.",Innate Immune Modulation by GM-CSF and IL-3 in Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769926,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and inteleukin-3 (IL-3) have long been known as mediators of emergency myelopoiesis, but recent evidence has highlighted their critical role in modulating innate immune effector functions in mice and humans. This new wealth of knowledge has uncovered novel aspects of the pathogenesis of a range of disorders, including infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, allergic and cardiovascular diseases. Consequently, GM-CSF and IL-3 are now being investigated as therapeutic targets for some of these disorders, and some phase I/II clinical trials are already showing promising results. There is also pre-clinical and clinical evidence that GM-CSF can be an effective immunostimulatory agent when being combined with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) in patients with metastatic melanoma as well as in novel cancer immunotherapy approaches. Finally, GM-CSF and to a lesser extent IL-3 play a critical role in experimental models of trained immunity by acting not only on bone marrow precursors but also directly on mature myeloid cells. Altogether, characterizing GM-CSF and IL-3 as central mediators of innate immune activation is poised to open new therapeutic avenues for several immune-mediated disorders and define their potential in the context of immunotherapies.",Post-Impact Behaviour of Pseudo-Ductile Thin-Ply Angle-Ply Hybrid Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769925,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,This work experimentally explores the post-impact behaviour of thin-ply angle-ply pseudo-ductile carbon fibre laminates subjected to tensile load. Indentation and low-speed impact tests were performed on standard tensile test specimens. Non-destructive tests were used to investigate the damage propagation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was adopted to detect the strain distribution during tensile tests. Post-damage pseudo-ductile behaviour was retained in angle-ply hybrid composites subjected to tensile loading conditions.,Systematic Degradation Rate Analysis of Surface-Functionalized Porous Silicon Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769924,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) have been utilized within a wide spectrum of biological studies, as well as in chemistry, chemical biology, and biomedical fields. Recently, pSiNPs have been constantly coming under the spotlight, mostly in biomedical applications, due to their advantages, such as controlled-release drug delivery in vivo by hydrolysis-induced degradation, self-reporting property through long life-time photoluminescence, high loading efficiency of substrate into pore, and the homing to specific cells/organ/bacteria by surface functionalization. However, the systematic degradation rate analysis of surface-functionalized pSiNPs in different biological media has not been conducted yet. In this paper, we prepared four different surface-functionalized pSiNPs samples and analyzed the degradation rate in six different media (DI H₂O (deionized water), PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), HS (human serum), DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), LB (lysogeny broth), and BHI (brain heart infusion)). The obtained results will now contribute to understanding the correlation between surface functionalization in the pSiNPs and the degradation rate in different biological media. The characterized data with the author's suggestions will provide useful insights in designing the new pSiNPs formulation for biomedical applications.",Comparison of Immune Responses to Different Versions of VLP Associated Stabilized RSV Pre-Fusion F Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769923,Vaccines,2019 04 19,"Efforts to develop a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have primarily focused on the RSV fusion protein. The pre-fusion conformation of this protein induces the most potent neutralizing antibodies and is the focus of recent efforts in vaccine development. Following the first identification of mutations in the RSV F protein (DS-Cav1 mutant protein) that stabilized the pre-fusion conformation, other mutant stabilized pre-fusion F proteins have been described. To determine if there are differences in alternate versions of stabilized pre-fusion F proteins, we explored the use, as vaccine candidates, of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing five different pre-fusion F proteins, including the DS-Cav1 protein. The expression of these five pre-F proteins, their assembly into VLPs, their pre-fusion conformation stability in VLPs, their reactivity with anti-F monoclonal antibodies, and their induction of immune responses after the immunization of mice, were characterized, comparing VLPs containing the DS-Cav1 pre-F protein with VLPs containing four alternative pre-fusion F proteins. The concentrations of anti-F IgG induced by each VLP that blocked the binding of prototype monoclonal antibodies using two different soluble pre-fusion F proteins as targets were measured. Our results indicate that both the conformation and immunogenicity of alternative VLP associated stabilized pre-fusion RSV F proteins are different from those of DS-Cav1 VLPs.","Antrodia cinnamomea, a Treasured Medicinal Mushroom, Induces Growth Arrest in Breast Cancer Cells, T47D Cells: New Mechanisms Emerge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769922,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 29,"Reported cases of breast cancer have skyrocketed in the last decades with recent advances in examination techniques. Brest cancer has become the second leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, urging the scientific community to develop or find new drugs from natural sources with potent activity and a reasonable safety profile to tackle this ailment. Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) is a treasured medicinal fungus which has attracted attention due to its potent hepatoprotective and cytotoxic activities. We evaluated the antiproliferative activity of the ethanol extract of artificially cultured AC (EEAC) on breast cancer cells (T47D cells) in vivo and in vitro. Ethanol extract of artificially cultured AC inhibited T47D cells' proliferation mediated by cell cycle arrest at G1 phase as well induced autophagy. Immunoblotting assay confirmed that EEAC not only decreased the expression of the cell-cycle-related proteins but also increased the expression of transcription factor FOXO1, autophagic marker LC3 II, and p62. Ethanol extract of artificially cultured AC mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting the expression of IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1α), GRP78/Bip (glucose regulating protein 78), and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein). Apart from previous studies, HDACs (histone deacetylases) activity was inhibited as demonstrated by a cell-free system, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays following EEAC treatment. The in vivo studies demonstrated that EEAC decreased tumor volume and inhibited tumor growth without any significant side effects. High performance liquid chromatography profile demonstrated similar triterpenoids compared to the profile of wild AC ethanol extract. The multiple targets of EEAC on breast cancer cells suggested that this extract may be developed as a potential dietary supplement targeting this debilitating disease."

Treatment with high glucose (30 mM) induced apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β cells; however, the level of cell viability was significantly increased by treatment with (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone. Treatment with 10⁻20 µM of (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone dose-dependently increased cell viability and significantly decreased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and nitric oxide levels in INS-1 pancreatic β cells pretreated with high glucose. These effects were associated with increased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression, while reducing pro-apoptotic Bax, cytochrome C, and caspase 9 protein expression. Treatment with (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone reduced the apoptosis previously induced by high-level glucose-treatment, according to annexin V/propidium iodide staining.

In this study, 15 SBP-box genes were identified and isolated from Citrus clementina (CclSBPs), where 10 of these genes were predicted to be putative targets of Citrus clementina microRNA156 (CclmiR156). The 15 CclSBP genes could be classified into six groups based on phylogenetic analysis, diverse intron⁻exon structure, and motif prediction, similar to the SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL) gene family of Populus trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, CclSBPs classified into a group/subgroup have similar gene structures and conserved motifs, implying their functional redundancy. Tissue-specific expression analysis of CclSBPs demonstrated their diversified expression patterns. To further explore the potential role of CclSBPs during floral inductive water deficits, the dynamic changes of the 15 CclSBPs were investigated during floral inductive water deficits, and the results showed that some CclSBPs were associated with floral induction. Among these genes, CclSBP6 was not homologous to the Arabidopsis SBP-box gene family, and CclSBP7 was regulated by being alternatively spliced. Therefore, CclSBP6 and CclSBP7 were genetically transformed in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of the two genes changed the flowering time of Arabidopsis.",Dynamic Expression of Interferon Lambda Regulated Genes in Primary Fibroblasts and Immune Organs of the Chicken.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769908,Genes,2019 03 29,"Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that establish a first line of defense against viral infections in vertebrates. Several types of IFN have been identified; however, limited information is available in poultry, especially using live animal experimental models. IFN-lambda (IFN-λ) has recently been shown to exert a significant antiviral impact against viral pathogens in mammals. In order to investigate the in vivo potential of chicken IFN-λ (chIFN-λ) as a regulator of innate immunity, and potential antiviral therapeutics, we profiled the transcriptome of chIFN-λ-stimulated chicken immune organs (in vivo) and compared it with primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (in vitro). Employing the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), recombinant chIFN-λ3 (rchIFN-λ3) was produced and its biological activities were demonstrated. The rchIFNλ3 induced a great array of IFN-regulated genes in primary chicken fibroblast cells. The transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatics analysis (gene ontology, differential expressed genes, and KEGGs analysis) of the bursa of Fabricious and the thymus demonstrated an upregulation of crucial immune genes (viperin, IKKB, CCL5, IL1β, and AP1) as well as the antiviral signaling pathways. Interestingly, this experimental approach revealed contrasting evidence of the antiviral potential of chIFN-λ in both in vivo and in vitro models. Taken together, our data signifies the potential of chIFN-λ as a potent antiviral cytokine and highlights its future possible use as an antiviral therapeutic in poultry.",N-Lipidated Amino Acids and Peptides Immobilizedon Cellulose Able to Split Amide Bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769907,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"N-lipidated short peptides and amino acids immobilized on the cellulose were used ascatalysts cleaved amide bonds under biomimetic conditions. In order to select catalytically mostactive derivatives a library of 156 N-lipidated amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides immobilizedon cellulose was obtained. The library was synthesized from serine, histidine and glutamic acidpeptides N-acylated with heptanoic, octanoic, hexadecanoic and (E)-octadec-9-enoic acids.Catalytic efficiency was monitored by spectrophotometric determination of p-nitroaniline formedby the hydrolysis of a 0.1 M solution of Z-Leu-NP. The most active 8 structures contained tripeptidefragment with 1-3 serine residues. It has been found that incorporation of metal ions into catalyticpockets increase the activity of the synzymes. The structures of the 17 most active catalysts selectedfrom the library of complexes obtained with Cu2+ ion varied from 16 derivatives complexed withZn2+ ion. For all of them, a very high reaction rate during the preliminary phase of measurementswas followed by a substantial slowdown after 1 h. The catalytic activity gradually diminished aftersubsequent re-use. HPLC analysis of amide bond splitting confirmed that substrate consumptionproceeded in two stages. In the preliminary stage 24⁻40% of the substrate was rapidly hydrolysedfollowed by the substantially lower reaction rate. Nevertheless, using the most competentsynzymes product of hydrolysis was formed with a yield of 60⁻83% after 48h under mild andstrictly biomimetic conditions.",A Chemiluminescent Method for the Detection of H₂O₂ and Glucose Based on Intrinsic Peroxidase-Like Activity of WS₂ Quantum Dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769906,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"Currently, researchers are looking for nanomaterials with peroxidase-like activity to replace natural peroxidase enzymes. For this purpose, WS₂ quantum dots (WS₂ QDs) were synthesized via a solvothermal method, which improved the mimetic behavior. The resulting WS₂ QDs with a size of 1⁻1.5 nm had a high fluorescence emission, dependent on the excitation wavelength. WS₂ QDs with uniform morphology showed a high catalytic effect in destroying H₂O₂. The peroxidase-like activity of synthesized nanostructures was studied in H₂O₂ chemical and electrochemical reduction systems. The mimetic effect of WS₂ QDs was also shown in an H₂O₂⁻rhodamine B (RB) chemiluminescence system. For this aim, a stopped-flow chemiluminescence (CL) detection system was applied. Also, in order to confirm the peroxidase-like effect of quantum dots, colorimetry and electrochemical techniques were used. In the enzymatic reaction of glucose, H₂O₂ is one of the products which can be determined. Under optimum conditions, H₂O₂ can be detected in the concentration range of 0⁻1000 nmol·L-1, with a detection limit of 2.4 nmol·L-1. Using this CL assay, a linear relationship was obtained between the intensity of the CL emission and glucose concentration in the range of 0.01⁻30 nmol·L-1, with a limit of detection (3S) of 4.2 nmol·L-1.","Clinical Features, Survival and Prognostic Factors of Glycogen-Rich Clear Cell Carcinoma (GRCC) of the Breast in the U.S. Population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769905,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines glycogen-rich clear cell carcinoma (GRCC) of the breast as a carcinoma with glycogen accumulation in more than 90% of its tumor cells. Due to the rarity of this disease, its reported survival and clinical associations have been inconsistent due to reliance on case reports and limited case series. As a result, the prognostic implication of this cancer subtype remains unclear. Using the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database, we compared the incidence, demographics and prognostic factors of 155 cases of GRCC of the breast to 1,251,584 cases of other (non-GRCC) breast carcinomas. We demonstrate that GRCC is more likely to be identified as high grade, advanced stage, and more likely to have triple negative receptor status. GRCC cases display a poorer prognosis than non-GRCC carcinomas of the breast irrespective of age, AJCC staging, tumor grade, joint hormone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and treatment. Similar to non-GRCC carcinomas, older age and higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/TNM staging were associated with poorer prognosis for GRCC, while treatment with surgery and radiation were associated with improved survival. Radiation, specifically in the setting of breast-conserving surgery, further improved survival compared to surgery alone. Our study highlights the poorer prognosis associated with glycogen accumulation in breast cancers and hence stresses the importance of identifying this more aggressive tumor type.","Platinum(II) O,S Complexes Inhibit the Aggregation of Amyloid Model Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769904,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Platinum(II) complexes with different cinnamic acid derivatives as ligands were investigated for their ability to inhibit the aggregation process of amyloid systems derived from Aβ, Yeast Prion Protein Sup35p and the C-terminal domain of nucleophosmin 1. Thioflavin T binding assays and circular dichroism data indicate that these compounds strongly inhibit the aggregation of investigated peptides exhibiting IC50 values in the micromolar range. MS analysis confirms the formation of adducts between peptides and Pt(II) complexes that are also able to reduce amyloid cytotoxicity in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

However, the evolution of this gene family in plants is unknown. In this study, I first identified 114 VIT genes in 14 plant species and classified these genes into seven groups by phylogenetic analysis. Conserved gene organization and motif distribution implied conserved function in each group. I also found that tandem duplication, segmental duplication and transposition contributed to the expansion of this gene family. Additionally, several positive selection sites were identified. Divergent expression patterns of soybean VIT genes were further investigated in different development stages and under iron stress. Functional network analysis exhibited 211 physical or functional interactions.

The disease genes and their products perform their dysfunctions via physical and biochemical interactions in the form of a molecular network. The topological parameters of these disease genes in the interactome are of prominent interest to the understanding of their functionality from a systematic perspective. In this work, we provide a systems biology analysis of the topological features of complex disease genes in an integrated biomolecular network. Firstly, we identify the characteristics of four network parameters in the ten most frequently studied disease genes and identify several specific patterns of their topologies. Then, we confirm our findings in the other disease genes of three complex disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The results reveal that the disease genes tend to have a higher betweenness centrality, a smaller average shortest path length, and a smaller clustering coefficient when compared to normal genes, whereas they have no significant degree prominence. The features highlight the importance of gene location in the integrated functional linkages.",Optimal Energy-Delay in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks with Interference Channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769900,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"In this work, we investigate the capacity allocation problem in the energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with interference channels. For the fixed topologies of data and energy, we formulate the optimization problem when the data flow remains constant on all data links and each sensor node harvests energy only once in a time slot. We focus on the optimal data rates, power allocations and energy transfers between sensor nodes in a time slot. Our goal is to minimize the total delay in the network under two scenarios, i.e., no energy transfer and energy transfer. Furthermore, since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, by considering the network with the relatively high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the non-convex optimization problem can be transformed into a convex optimization problem by convex approximation. We attain the properties of the optimal solution by Lagrange duality and solve the convex optimization problem by the CVX solver. The experimental results demonstrate that the total delay of the energy harvesting WSNs with interference channels is more than that in the orthogonal channel; the total network delay increases with the increasing data flow for the fixed energy arrival rate; and the energy transfer can help to decrease the total delay."

A total of sixteen JF + GBFS mix designs, i.e., JF (% by total mass) = {0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5} and GBFS (% by total mass) = {0, 3, 6, 9}, were tested for unconfined compression (UC) strength; for those mix designs containing GBFS, curing was allowed for 7 and 28 days prior to testing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were also carried out to observe the evolution of fabric in response to JF, GBFS and JF + GBFS amendments. The greater the JF content the higher the developed strength and stiffness up to 1% JF, beyond of which the effect of JF-reinforcement led to some adverse results. The JF inclusions, however, consistently improved the ductility and toughness of the composite. The addition of GBFS to the JF-reinforced samples improved the soil⁻fiber connection interface, and thus led to further improvements in the composite's strength, stiffness and toughness. The mix design ""1% JF + 9% GBFS"" managed to satisfy ASTM's strength criterion and hence was deemed as the optimum choice in this investigation. Finally, a non-linear, multivariable regression model was developed and validated to quantify the peak UC strength as a function of the composite's index properties. The proposed model contained a limited number of fitting parameters, all of which can be calibrated by little experimental effort, and thus implemented for preliminary design assessments.",Influence of Structure-modifying Agents in the Synthesis of Zr-doped SBA-15 Silica and Their Use as Catalysts in the Furfural Hydrogenation to Obtain High Value-added Products through the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769888,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Zr-doped mesoporous silicas with different textural parameters have been synthesized in the presence of structure-modifying agents, and then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N₂ adsorption-desorption at -196 °C, NH₃ thermoprogrammed desorption (NH₃⁻TPD), CO₂ thermoprogrammed desorption (CO₂⁻TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These porous materials were evaluated in the furfural hydrogenation through the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction. The catalytic results indicate that the catalyst synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and adding a pore expander agent is more active and selective to furfuryl alcohol. However, the Zr-doped porous silica catalysts that were synthesized at room temperature, which possess narrow pore sizes, tend to form i-propyl furfuryl and difurfuryl ethers, coming from etherification between furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and isopropanol molecules (used as H-donor) by a SN2 mechanism.",GmZPR3d Interacts with GmHD-ZIP III Proteins and Regulates Soybean Root and Nodule Vascular Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769886,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Fabaceans produce two major classes of symbiotic nodules: the indeterminate type characterized by a persistent meristem, and the determinate type that lacks a persistent meristem. The class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factor family influence development of multiple lateral organs and meristem maintenance, but their role in determinate nodule development is not known. HD-ZIP III protein activity is post-translationally regulated by members of the small leucine zipper protein (ZPR) family in arabidopsis. We characterized the ZPR gene family in soybean and evaluated their ability to interact with two key members of GmHD-ZIP III family through yeast two-hybrid assays. GmZPR3d displayed the strongest interaction with GmHD-ZIP III-2 among the different pairs evaluated. GmHD-ZIP III-1, -2, and GmZPR3d showed overlapping expression patterns in the root stele and in nodule parenchyma tissues. Over-expression of GmZPR3d resulted in ectopic root secondary xylem formation, and enhanced expression of vessel-specific master switch genes in soybean. The nodules in ZPR3d over-expressing roots were larger in size, had a relatively larger central zone and displayed increased nodule vascular branching. The results from this study point to a key role for GmZPR3d in soybean root and nodule development.",Hierarchy of Factors Affecting the Condition and Development of Sports and Recreation Infrastructure-Impact on the Recreational Activity and Health of the Residents of a City (Poznan Case Study).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769884,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"The aim of the article is to identify which groups of factors (economic, social, and spatial) significantly determine the condition and development of the sports and recreation infrastructure of the city of Poznan and shape the needs and expectations of its residents. Standardized interviews among 39 service providers and 1159 service recipients made it possible to collect primary data on the presentation of the pace and directions of changes taking place in the sports and recreational facilities of the city, paying special attention to identifying and prioritizing factors determining this development. In order to establish the hierarchy of factors analyzed in the paper and operating within the same research problem for both groups of respondents (service recipients and service providers), the Anderson-Darling test was used. The test results were referenced to the already existing ""Sportowy Poznan"" (""Sports Poznan"") program. The assessment made by service recipients shows that the factor having the strongest limiting effect on the use of sports and recreation services is the economic factor. In the assessment made by the respondents using their services, the efforts of city authorities to make Poznan sports clubs operate in a professional manner gained the lowest score. The results of the Anderson⁻Darling test show that the social factor of preparing infrastructure for the residents of the city of Poznan was the most important for the respondents, obtaining a test value of 0.886.",Investigation of the Itinerant Electron Ferromagnetism of Ni2+xMnGa1-x and Co₂VGa Heusler Alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769883,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Experimental investigations into the field dependence of magnetization and temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility in Ni2+xMnGa1-x (x = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04) and Co₂VGa Heusler alloy ferromagnets were performed following the spin fluctuation theory of itinerant ferromagnetism, called as ""Takahashi theory"". We investigated the magnetic field dependence of magnetization at the Curie temperature TC, which is the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic⁻paramagnetic transition, and also at T = 5 K, which concerns the ground state of the ferromagnetic state. The field dependence of the magnetization was analyzed by means of the H vs. M⁵ dependence, and the field dependence of the ground state at 5 K was investigated by means of an Arrott plot (H/M vs. M²) according to the Takahashi theory. As for Ni2+xMnGa1-x, the spin fluctuation parameter in k-space (momentum space, TA) and that in energy space (T₀) obtained at TC and 5 K were almost the same. On the contrary, as for Co₂VGa, the H vs. M⁵ dependence was not shown at TC. We obtained TA and T₀ by means of an Arrott plot at 5 K. We created a generalized Rhodes⁻Wohlfarth plot of peff/pS versus TC/T₀ for the other ferromagnets. The plot indicated that the relationship between peff/pS and T₀/TC followed Takahashi's theory. We also discussed the spontaneous magnetic moment at the ground state, pS, which was obtained by an Arrott plot at 5 K and the high temperature magnetic moment, pC, at the paramagnetic phase. As for the localized ferromagnet, the pC/pS was 1. As for weak ferromagnets, the pC/pS was larger than 1. In contrast, the pC/pS was smaller than 1 by many Heusler alloys. This is a unique property of Heusler ferromagnets. Half-metallic ferromagnets of Co₂VGa and Co₂MnGa were in accordance with the generalized Rhodes⁻Wohlfarth plot with a km around 1.4. The magnetic properties of the itinerant electron of these two alloys appeared in the majority bands and was confirmed by Takahashi's theory.",Using Panel Data to Evaluate the Factors Affecting Transport Energy Consumption in China's Three Regions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769882,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"In China, transportation accounts for a large proportion of total energy consumption and that trend is projected to increase in the future. Through the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model, OLS regressions were conducted to investigate the impacts of gross domestic product (GDP), urbanization, energy intensity and transport structure on the transport energy consumption in China's three regions. The analyses of inter-provincial panel data during the period 2006⁻2015 is compared to the analysis of the data from 1996 to 2005 to determine the change. There were two primary findings from this study. First, the changes of the influencing degree in three regions are considered. GDP is still the main driver of transport energy consumption in eastern region, while urbanization becomes the main driver in the other two regions. Second, the relationship between the elasticity and the value of each variable is detected. The elasticity of transport energy consumption with respect to GDP, transport structure, energy intensity and urbanization have separate positive and significant relationships. The primary measure is to optimize transport structure in the central region, while reducing energy intensity in the western region. Finally, we propose relevant policy recommendations for the three regions.",Inhibition of Amyloid Beta Aggregation and Deposition of Cistanche tubulosa Aqueous Extract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769881,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"Cistanche tubulosa aqueous extract (CTE) is already used as a botanical prescription drug for treating dementia in China. Our previous studies reported that phenylethanoid glycosides of CTE have anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity by inhibiting amyloid β peptide (Aβ) aggregation and deposition. However, recent studies considered that the phenylethanoid glycosides may be metabolized by intestinal bacteria, because all analysis results showed that the bioavailability of phenylethanoid glycosides is extremely low. In this study we demonstrate how iron chelation plays a crucial role in the Aβ aggregation and deposition inhibition mechanism of phenylethanoid glycosides of CTE. In addition, we further proved phenylethanoid glycosides (1⁻3) could reach brain. Active CTE component and action mechanism confirmation will be a great help for product quality control and bioavailability studies in the future. At the same time, we provide a new analysis method useful in determining phenylethanoid glycosides (1⁻3) in plants, foods, blood, and tissues for chemical fingerprint and pharmacokinetic research.","Correction: Mauro, A., et al.

In this study, evidence-based policy recommendations and communication guidelines have been derived from the findings of the EU FP7 project CLYMBOL (""Role of health-related CLaims and sYMBOLs in consumer behavior"", Grant Agreement 311963), and have been evaluated and prioritized by European stakeholders using a three-round Delphi method. A moderate level of consensus was achieved and results suggest that policy priority should focus on ways to improve consumer motivation and interest in healthy eating. Consumers' interest in healthy eating could be increased by adopting appropriate communication strategies such as using innovative ways to communicate the importance of healthy eating, which may aim to change the possible negative association between healthiness and tastiness. The highest-rated finding was related to consumers' favorable attitude towards health claims with shorter and less complex messages and health symbols with a visible endorsement. Meanwhile, there was a clear consensus that health claims need to be scientifically substantiated and credible but phrased without using overly complex scientific wordings, in order to be meaningful for consumers. Furthermore, stakeholders from academia and industry believe that consumer awareness about existing health claims should be increased. The identified policy recommendations and communication guidelines stem from recent empirical evidence and provide useful insights that guide future policy development aligning consumer protection issues as well as public health and food marketing communication interests.",The Role of Buffers in Wild-Type HEWL Amyloid Fibril Formation Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769878,Biomolecules,2019 04 10,"Amyloid fibrils, highly ordered protein aggregates, play an important role in the onset of several neurological disorders. Many studies have assessed amyloid fibril formation under specific solution conditions, but they all lack an important phenomena in biological solutions-buffer specific effects. We have focused on the formation of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) fibrils in aqueous solutions of different buffers in both acidic and basic pH range. By means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence measurements and CD spectroscopy, we have managed to show that fibrillization of HEWL is affected by buffer identity (glycine, TRIS, phosphate, KCl-HCl, cacodylate, HEPES, acetate), solution pH, sample incubation (agitated vs. static) and added excipients (NaCl and PEG). HEWL only forms amyloid fibrils at pH = 2.0 under agitated conditions in glycine and KCl-HCl buffers of high enough ionic strength. Phosphate buffer on the other hand stabilizes the HEWL molecules. Similar stabilization effect was achieved by addition of PEG12000 molecules to the solution."

The optimization was performed using the response surface methodology employing a central composite experimental design with five-levels for each of the assessed variables. The independent variables studied were the extraction time (t, 20⁻120 min), temperature (T, 25⁻85 °C), and solvent (S, 0⁻100% of ethanol, v/v). Anthocyanin compounds were analysed by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS and the extraction yields were used as response variables. Theoretical models were developed for the obtained experimental data, then the models were validated by a selected number of statistical tests, and finally, those models were used in the prediction and optimization steps.

Although Adriamycin causes DNA damage, data from Comet assays revealed that CFM-4.16 also induced DNA damage. Phosphorylation of histone 2AX (γH2AX) protein is involved in regulating DNA damage repair and apoptosis signaling. Adriamycin or CFM-4.16 treatments inhibited cell growth and caused elevated CARP-1 and γH2AX in human breast (HBC) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. In fact, a robust nuclear or peri-nuclear co-localization of CARP-1 and γH2AX occurred in cells undergoing apoptosis. Knock-down of CARP-1 diminished γH2AX, their co-localization, and apoptosis in CFM-4.16- or Adriamycin-treated cells. We found that CARP-1 directly binds with H2AX, and H2AX interacted with CARP-1, but not CARP-1 (Δ600⁻652) mutant. Moreover, cells expressing CARP-1 (Δ600⁻652) mutant were resistant to apoptosis, and had diminished levels of γH2AX, when compared with cells expressing wild-type CARP-1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that H2AX residues 1⁻35 harbored a CARP-1-binding epitope, while CARP-1 amino acids 636⁻650 contained an H2AX-interacting epitope. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that CARP-1 (636⁻650) peptide bound with H2AX (1⁻35) peptide with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 127 nM. Cells expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP)-tagged H2AX (1⁻35) peptide or EGFP-tagged CARP-1 (636⁻650) peptide were resistant to inhibition by Adriamycin or CFM-4.16. Treatment of cells with transactivator of transcription (TAT)-tagged CARP-1 (636⁻650) peptide resulted in a moderate, statistically significant abrogation of Adriamycin-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells. Our studies provide evidence for requirement of CARP-1 interaction with H2AX in apoptosis signaling by Adriamycin and CFM compounds.",Anti-Invasion and Antiangiogenic Effects of Stellettin B through Inhibition of the Akt/Girdin Signaling Pathway and VEGF in Glioblastoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769863,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Angiogenesis and invasion are highly related with tumor metastatic potential and recurrence prediction in the most aggressive brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For the first time, this study reveals that marine-sponge-derived stellettin B reduces angiogenesis and invasion. We discovered that stellettin B reduces migration of glioblastoma cells by scratch wound healing assay and invasion via chamber transwell assay. Further, stellettin B downregulates Akt/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathways, which are essential for invasion and angiogenesis in glioblastoma. This study further demonstrates that stellettin B affects filamentous actin (F-actin) rearrangement by decreasing the cross-linkage of phosphor-Girdin (p-Girdin), which attenuates glioblastoma cell invasion. Moreover, stellettin B blocks the expression and secretion of a major proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in glioblastoma cells. Stellettin B also reduces angiogenic tubule formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vivo, we observed that stellettin B decreased blood vesicle formation in developmental zebrafish and suppressed angiogenesis in Matrigel plug transplant assay in mice. Decreased VEGF transcriptional expression was also found in stellettin B⁻treated zebrafish embryos. Overall, we conclude that stellettin B might be a potential antiangiogenic and anti-invasion agent for future development of therapeutic agents for cancer therapy.",Deciphering the Nutraceutical Potential of Raphanus sativus-A Comprehensive Overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769862,Nutrients,2019 05 28,"Raphanus sativus (Radish) belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is a widely consumed root vegetable all around the world.

We conducted a randomized parallel trial in 10 women and 10 men comparing the responses to a consistent savoury lunch-type meal (stewed beans) eaten at the habitual afternoon schedule or at an unconventional time in the morning. Schedule and gender differences were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of covariance. In women, the sensory experience induced by the probe meal, particularly postprandial satisfaction, was weaker when eaten at an unconventional time for breakfast. Men were resilient to the schedule effect and experienced the same sensations regardless of the timing of ingestion; the effect of the eating schedule was significantly more pronounced in women for fullness (F(1,55) = 14.9; p < 0.001), digestive well-being (F(1,36.8) = 22.3; p < 0.001), mood (F(1,12.4) = 13.8; p < 0.001), and anxiety (F(1,11.9) = 10.9; p = 0.001).

In order to do so, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer-containing palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) were electrospun over paper, and the morphology, thermal properties, water vapor barrier, and oxygen absorption properties of nanocomposites and multilayers were investigated. In order to reduce the porosity, and to enhance the barrier properties and interlayer adhesion, the biopapers were annealed after electrospinning. A previous study showed that electrospun PHB-containing PdNP did show significant oxygen scavenging capacity, but this was strongly reduced after annealing, a process that is necessary to form a continuous film with the water barrier. The results in the current work indicate that the PdNP were better dispersed and distributed in the PCL matrix, as suggested by focus ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) experiments, and that the Pd enhanced, to some extent, the onset of PCL degradation. More importantly, the PCL/PdNP nanobiopaper exhibited much higher oxygen scavenging capacity than the homologous PHB/PdNP, due to most likely, the higher oxygen permeability of the PCL polymer and the somewhat higher dispersion of the Pd. The passive and active multilayered biopapers developed here may be of significant relevance to put forward the next generation of fully biodegradable barrier papers of interest in, for instance, food packaging."

The water-based coating was effective in preventing an increase in electrical resistivity for a coated tethtraedrite, preserving its power factor after 48 h at 350 °C.",Overexpression of StDREB2 Transcription Factor Enhances Drought Stress Tolerance in Cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769841,Genes,2019 03 29,"Drought stress significantly restricts plant growth and crop productivity. Cotton is the most important textile fiber and oilseed crop worldwide, and its cultivation is affected by drought stress, particularly in dry regions. Improving cotton tolerance to drought stress using the advanced genetic engineering technologies is a promising strategy to maintain crop production and fiber quality and meet the increasing worldwide fiber and oil demand. Dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) transcription factors play a main role in regulating stresses-tolerance pathways in plant. This study investigated whether potato DREB2 (StDREB2) overexpression can improve drought tolerance in cotton. StDREB2 transcription factor was isolated and overexpressed in cotton. Plant biomass, boll number, relative water content, soluble sugars content, soluble protein content, chlorophyll content, proline content, gas-exchange parameters, and antioxidants enzymes (POD, CAT, SOD, GST) activity of the StDREB2-overexpressing cotton plants were higher than those of wild type plants. By contrast, the contents of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion of StDREB2-overexpressing transgenic plants were significantly lower than that of the wild type plants. Moreover, the transgenic cotton lines revealed higher expression levels of antioxidant genes (SOD, CAT, POD, GST) and stress-tolerant genes (GhERF2, GhNAC3, GhRD22, GhDREB1A, GhDREB1B, GhDREB1C) compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, these findings showed that StDREB2 overexpression augments drought stress tolerance in cotton by inducing plant biomass, gas-exchange characteristics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, antioxidant enzymes activities, osmolytes accumulation, and expression of stress-related genes. As a result, StDREB2 could be an important candidate gene for drought-tolerant cotton breeding.","Behavior of Metalloproteinases in Adipose Tissue, Liver and Arterial Wall: An Update of Extracellular Matrix Remodeling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769840,Cells,2019 03 29,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is required for many physiological and pathological processes. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases which are able to degrade different components of the ECM and nucleus matrix and to cleave numerous non-ECM proteins. Among pathological processes, MMPs are involved in adipose tissue expansion, liver fibrosis, and atherosclerotic plaque development and vulnerability. The expression and the activity of these enzymes are regulated by different hormones and growth factors, such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin. The controversial results reported up to this moment regarding MMPs behavior in ECM biology could be consequence of the different expression patterns among species and the stage of the studied pathology. The aim of the present review was to update the knowledge of the role of MMPs and its inhibitors in ECM remodeling in high incidence pathologies such as obesity, liver fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease.",Fluid Pressure Monitoring-Based Strategy for Delicate Grasping of Fragile Objects by A Robotic Hand with Fluid Fingertips.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769839,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"In this study, we propose a strategy for delicately grasping fragile objects using a robotic gripper with highly deformable fluid fingertips. In an earlier study, we developed a soft fingertip, referred to as a fluid fingertip, which was fabricated from a deformable rubber bag filled with incompressible fluid. The proposed strategy detects the preferable grasping point where fracturing of the target object is avoided while the applied force or pressure from the fluid fingertip is substantially transmitted to the target. In this grasping point, the behavior of the fluid pressure changes with respect to the pushing distance when pushing at a constant speed. The other features of the strategy determining the grasping point are as follows: (1) the threshold for the detection of the grasping point is fixed or constant with respect to the type of target object; (2) information regarding the deformation and stiffness of the fingertips and target object is not required. The detection of the grasping point through behavioral changes in the pressure is performed by comparing the fitting accuracies of fitting models utilizing information of the fluid pressure and pushing distance. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through several experiments.",Strategies to Treat Chronic Pain and Strengthen Impaired Descending Noradrenergic Inhibitory System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769838,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) and antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) are often used to treat chronic pain. The descending noradrenergic inhibitory system from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays an important role in the analgesic mechanisms of these drugs. Gabapentinoids activate the LC by inhibiting the release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and inducing the release of glutamate, thereby increasing noradrenaline levels in the spinal cord. Antidepressants increase noradrenaline levels in the spinal cord by inhibiting reuptake, and accumulating noradrenaline inhibits chronic pain through α₂-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord. Recent animal studies, however, revealed that the function of the descending noradrenergic inhibitory system is impaired in chronic pain states. Other recent studies found that histone deacetylase inhibitors and antidepressants restore the impaired noradrenergic descending inhibitory system acting on noradrenergic neurons in the LC.",In-DRAM Cache Management for Low Latency and Low Power 3D-Stacked DRAMs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769837,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Recently, 3D-stacked dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has become a promising solution for ultra-high capacity and high-bandwidth memory implementations. However, it also suffers from memory wall problems due to long latency, such as with typical 2D-DRAMs. Although there are various cache management techniques and latency hiding schemes to reduce DRAM access time, in a high-performance system using high-capacity 3D-stacked DRAM, it is ultimately essential to reduce the latency of the DRAM itself. To solve this problem, various asymmetric in-DRAM cache structures have recently been proposed, which are more attractive for high-capacity DRAMs because they can be implemented at a lower cost in 3D-stacked DRAMs. However, most research mainly focuses on the architecture of the in-DRAM cache itself and does not pay much attention to proper management methods. In this paper, we propose two new management algorithms for the in-DRAM caches to achieve a low-latency and low-power 3D-stacked DRAM device. Through the computing system simulation, we demonstrate the improvement of energy delay product up to 67%.",Persistent Economic Burden of the Gluten Free Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769836,Nutrients,2019 05 28,"Gluten free (GF) products have been reported to be more expensive and less available than their gluten containing counterparts. We examined the current U.S. cost and availability of GF products and made comparisons to the marketplace over a decade ago. Cost, determined by price per ounce and availability of a ""market basket"" of regular and GF products across four venues and five geographic regions was compared using a student's t test. GF products were more expensive (overall 183%), and in all regions and venues (p < 0.001). GF products from mass-market producers were 139% more expensive than the wheat-based version of the same product. Availability of GF products was greatest (66%) in the health food and upscale venues. In contrast to the results of the 2006 study, the cost of GF products has declined from 240% to 183% (adjusted for inflation). The introduction of mass-market production of GF products may have influenced the increase in availability and overall reduction of cost since 2006. The extent to which the cost of GF products impacts dietary adherence and quality of life for those on a GFD warrants exploration.",The Phylogeographic Diversity of EBV and Admixed Ancestry in the Americas⁻Another Model of Disrupted Human-Pathogen Co-Evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769835,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an etiological agent for gastric cancer with significant worldwide variations. Molecular characterizations of EBV have shown phylogeographical variations among healthy populations and in EBV-associated diseases, particularly the cosegregated BamHI-I fragment and XhoI restriction site of exon 1 of the LMP-1 gene. In the Americas, both cosegregated variants are present in EBV carriers, which aligns with the history of Asian and European human migration to this continent. Furthermore, novel recombinant variants have been found, reflecting the genetic makeup of this continent. However, in the case of EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBV-associated GC), the cosegregated European BamHI-""i"" fragment and XhoI restriction site strain prevails. Thus, we propose that a disrupted coevolution between viral phylogeographical strains and mixed human ancestry in the Americas might explain the high prevalence of this particular gastric cancer subtype. This cosegregated region contains two relevant transcripts for EBV-associated GC, the BARF-1 and miR-BARTs. Thus, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or targeted sequencing of both transcripts may be required to clarify their role as a potential source of this disrupted coevolution.",Music Therapy and Other Music-Based Interventions in Pediatric Health Care: An Overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769834,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Background: In pediatric health care, non-pharmacological interventions such as music therapy have promising potential to complement traditional medical treatment options in order to facilitate recovery and well-being. Music therapy and other music-based interventions are increasingly applied in the clinical treatment of children and adolescents in many countries world-wide. The purpose of this overview is to examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness of music therapy and other music-based interventions as applied in pediatric health care. Methods: Surveying recent literature and summarizing findings from systematic reviews, this overview covers selected fields of application in pediatric health care (autism spectrum disorder; disability; epilepsy; mental health; neonatal care; neurorehabilitation; pain, anxiety and stress in medical procedures; pediatric oncology and palliative care) and discusses the effectiveness of music interventions in these areas. Results: Findings show that there is a growing body of evidence regarding the beneficial effects of music therapy, music medicine, and other music-based interventions for children and adolescents, although more rigorous research is still needed. The highest quality of evidence for the positive effects of music therapy is available in the fields of autism spectrum disorder and neonatal care. Conclusions: Music therapy can be considered a safe and generally well-accepted intervention in pediatric health care to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. As an individualized intervention that is typically provided in a person-centered way, music therapy is usually easy to implement into clinical practices. However, it is important to note that to exploit the potential of music therapy in an optimal way, specialized academic and clinical training and careful selection of intervention techniques to fit the needs of the client are essential."

In agreement with recent experimental data, our results suggest that IMeAuCl easily interacts with all considered biological targets before being hydrated-unless sterically prevented-and allows the establishment of an order of thermodynamic stability and of kinetic reactivity for its binding to protein residues.","High-Throughput Virtual Screening, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, and Enzyme Kinetics Identified ZINC84525623 as a Potential Inhibitor of NDM-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769822,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"The bacteria expressing New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) can hydrolyze all β-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems, causing multi-drug resistance. The worldwide emergence and dissemination of gene blaNDM-1 (produces NDM-1) in hospital and community settings, rising problems for public health. Indeed, there is an urgent need for NDM-1 inhibitors to manage antibiotic resistance. Here, we have identified novel non-β-lactam ring-containing inhibitors of NDM-1 by applying a high-throughput virtual screening of lead-like subset of ZINC database. The screened compounds were followed for the molecular docking, the molecular dynamics simulation, and then enzyme kinetics assessment. The adopted screening procedure funnels out five novel inhibitors of NDM-1 including ZINC10936382, ZINC30479078, ZINC41493045, ZINC7424911, and ZINC84525623. The molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that ZINC84525623 formed the most stable complex with NDM-1. Furthermore, analyses of the binding pose after MD simulation revealed that ZINC84525623 formed two hydrogen bonds (electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction) with key amino acid residues of the NDM-1 active site. The docking binding free energy and docking binding constant for the ZINC84525623 and NDM-1 interaction were estimated to be -11.234 kcal/mol, and 1.74 × 10⁸ M-1 respectively. Steady-state enzyme kinetics in the presence of ZINC84525623 show the decreased catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) of NDM-1 on various antibiotics. The findings of this study would be helpful in identifying novel inhibitors against other β-lactamases from a pool of large databases.

Electrospun poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) MTAM was sterilized and loaded with cell lines/patient derived tumor cells (PDTC) and subcutaneously implanted into the backs of BALB/C mice. Anticancer drugs were administered at the respective time points and the respective MTAMs were retrieved and the viability tumor cells within were quantified with the MTT assay. Results revealed that the MTAMs were excellent culture substrate for various cancer cell lines and PDTCs (patient derived tumor cells).

It has been used in oriental remedies for blood circulation and the common cold. Recently, biological effects of C. junos peel have been reported. However, optimization of the biological properties of C. junos peel preparations has yet to be reported on. We developed a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for quantification of the active constituents in C. junos peel. Hot water and ethanolic extracts of C. junos peel were prepared and their chemical profiles and biological activities were evaluated. The 80% ethanolic extract demonstrated the greatest antioxidant activity and phenolic content, while the 100% ethanolic extract had the greatest xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. Elastase inhibition activity was superior in aqueous and 20% ethanolic extracts. The contents of two flavonoids were highest in the 100% ethanolic extract. We postulated that the antioxidant and anti-aging effects of C. junos peel extract could be attributed to phenolics such as flavonoids. Our results suggest that the flavonoid-rich extract of C. junos may be utilized for the treatment and prevention of metabolic disease and hyperuricemia while the water-soluble extract of C. junos could be used as a source for its anti-aging properties.",Novel O-alkyl Derivatives of Naringenin and Their Oximes with Antimicrobial and Anticancer Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769816,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"In our investigation, we concentrated on naringenin (NG)-a widely studied flavanone that occurs in citrus fruits.

Another chemical modification led to 9 oximes of O-alkyl naringenin derivatives (7b⁻13b, 16b⁻17b) that were never described before. The obtained compounds were evaluated for their potential antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis. The results were reported as the standard minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and compared with naringenin and its known O-alkyl derivatives.

The strongest bacteriostatic activity was observed for 7-O-butylnaringenin (12a) against S. aureus (MIC = 6.25 µg/mL). Moreover, the antitumor effect of flavonoids was examined on human colon cancer cell line HT-29. Twenty-six compounds were characterized as possessing an antiproliferative activity stronger than that of naringenin. The replacement of the carbonyl group with an oxime moiety significantly increased the anticancer properties.

However, less attention has been paid to determining the aroma characteristics of Chinese steamed breads (CSBs) by using this approach. The aim of this work was to evaluate the key aroma compounds and their potential generation pathway in Chinese steamed bread produced with type I sourdough by a metabolomics approach. Based on the aroma characteristics analysis, CSBs produced with type I sourdough and baker's yeast were clearly distinguishable by principal component analysis (PCA) scores plot. A total of 13 compounds in sourdough-based steamed breads were given the status of discriminant markers through the untargeted metabolomics analysis.

Nevertheless, a major bottleneck of existing state-of-the-art approaches lies in a great drop in performance with reducing resolutions of the detected targets. For the boosting-based detectors which are popular in pedestrian detection literature, a possible cause for this drop is that in their boosting training process, low-resolution samples, which are usually more difficult to be detected due to the missing details, are still treated equally importantly as high-resolution samples, resulting in the false negatives since they are more easily rejected in the early stages and can hardly be recovered in the late stages. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a robust multi-resolution detection approach with a novel group cost-sensitive boosting algorithm, which is derived from the standard AdaBoost algorithm to further explore different costs for different resolution groups of the samples in the boosting process, and to place greater emphasis on low-resolution groups in order to better handle the detection of multi-resolution targets. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on the Caltech pedestrian benchmark and KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) multispectral pedestrian benchmark, and validated by its promising performance on different resolution-specific test sets of both benchmarks."

To explore the mechanism of the PeJRL in salinity tolerance, the full length of PeJRL was cloned from P. euphratica and was transformed into Arabidopsis. PeJRL was localized to the cytoplasm in mesophyll cells. Overexpression of PeJRL in Arabidopsis significantly improved the salt tolerance of transgenic plants, in terms of seed germination, root growth, and electrolyte leakage during seedling establishment. Under NaCl stress, transgenic plants retained K⁺ and limited the accumulation of Na⁺. PeJRL-transgenic lines increased Na⁺ extrusion, which was associated with the upward regulation of SOS1, AHA1, and AHA2 genes encoding plasma membrane Na⁺/proton (H⁺) antiporter and H⁺-pumps. The activated H⁺-ATPases in PeJRL-overexpressed plants restricted the channel-mediated loss of K⁺ that was activated by NaCl-induced depolarization. Under salt stress, PeJRL⁻transgenic Arabidopsis maintained reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis by activating the antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of O₂- through downregulation of NADPH oxidases. Of note, the PeJRL-transgenic Arabidopsis repressed abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, thus reducing the ABA-elicited ROS production and the oxidative damage during the period of salt stress. A schematic model was proposed to show the mediation of PeJRL on ABA response, and ionic and ROS homeostasis under NaCl stress.",New Insights on Arabidopsis thaliana Root Adaption to Ammonium Nutrition by the Use of a Quantitative Proteomic Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769801,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Nitrogen is an essential element for plant nutrition. Nitrate and ammonium are the two major inorganic nitrogen forms available for plant growth. Plant preference for one or the other form depends on the interplay between plant genetic background and environmental variables. Ammonium-based fertilization has been shown less environmentally harmful compared to nitrate fertilization, because of reducing, among others, nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions. However, ammonium nutrition may become a stressful situation for a wide range of plant species when the ion is present at high concentrations. Although studied for long time, there is still an important lack of knowledge to explain plant tolerance or sensitivity towards ammonium nutrition. In this context, we performed a comparative proteomic study in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown under exclusive ammonium or nitrate supply. We identified and quantified 68 proteins with differential abundance between both conditions. These proteins revealed new potential important players on root response to ammonium nutrition, such as H⁺-consuming metabolic pathways to regulate pH homeostasis and specific secondary metabolic pathways like brassinosteroid and glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways.",Antibacterial Properties of Polysulfone Membranes Blended with Arabic Gum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769800,Membranes,2019 03 29,"Polysulfone (PS) membranes blended with different loadings of arabic gum (AG) were synthesized using phase inversion method and the antibacterial properties of the synthesized membranes were tested using a number Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcusaureus) bacterial species. It was shown that AG addition to the dope polymer solutions essentially changed porous structure, hydrophilicity and zeta potential of the cast PS/AG membranes. These changes were due to the amphiphilic properties of AG macromolecules that contained negatively charged hydrophilic residues. A pronounced decrease in bacterial attachment was seen in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images for PS/AG membrane samples compared to both commercial (Microdyn-Nadir) and bare PS (without AG) membranes. AG loading dependent trend was observed where the prevention of bacterial colonization on the membrane surface was strongest at the highest (7 wt. %) AG loading in the casting solution. Possible mechanisms for the prevention of bacterial colonization were discussed. Significantly, the inhibition of bacterial attachment and growth on PS/AG membranes was observed for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial models, rendering these novel membranes with strong biofouling resistance attractive for water treatment applications.",Review on Wearables to Monitor Foot Temperature in Diabetic Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769799,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"One of the diseases that could affect diabetic patients is the diabetic foot problem. Unnoticed minor injuries and subsequent infection can lead to ischemic ulceration, and may end in a foot amputation. Preliminary studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between increased skin temperature and the pre⁻ulceration phase. Hence, we have carried out a review on wearables, medical devices, and sensors used specifically for collecting vital data. In particular, we are interested in the measure of the foot⁻temperature. Since there is a large amount of this type of medical wearables, we will focus on those used to measure temperature and developed in Spain.",What Do We Know about Diet and Markers of Cardiovascular Health in Children: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769798,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main health concerns in the 21st century, with CVD as the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Although CVD hard endpoints such as stroke or heart attack do not usually occur in children, evidence shows that the manifestation of CVD risk factors begins in childhood, preceding clinical complications of CVD in adulthood. Dietary intake is a modifiable risk factor that has been shown to make a substantial contribution to the risk of CVD in adulthood. However, less is known about the association between dietary intake and markers of cardiovascular health in children. This review summarises the current evidence on the relationship between dietary intake and markers of cardiovascular health including traditional CVD risk factors, physical fitness, and indices of arterial stiffness and wave reflection in children. Original research published in English, between January 2008 and December 2018 fulfilling the objective of this review were screened and included. Findings show that adaptation of a healthy lifestyle early in life can be beneficial for reducing the risk of CVD later in life. Furthermore, keeping arterial stiffness low from a young age could be a potential CVD prevention strategy. However, limited studies are available on diet-arterial stiffness relationship in children, and future research is required to better understand this association to aid the development and implementation of evidence-based strategies for preventing CVD-related complications later in life.",Rapid Growth of TiO₂ Nanoflowers via Low-Temperature Solution Process: Photovoltaic and Sensing Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769797,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"This paper reports the rapid synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic and sensing applications of TiO₂ nanoflowers prepared by a facile low-temperature solution process. The morphological characterizations clearly reveal the high-density growth of a three-dimensional flower-shaped structure composed of small petal-like rods. The detailed properties confirmed that the synthesized nanoflowers exhibited high crystallinity with anatase phase and possessed an energy bandgap of 3.2 eV. The synthesized TiO₂ nanoflowers were utilized as photo-anode and electron-mediating materials to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and liquid nitroaniline sensor applications. The fabricated DSSC demonstrated a moderate conversion efficiency of ~3.64% with a maximum incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of ~41% at 540 nm. The fabricated liquid nitroaniline sensor demonstrated a good sensitivity of ~268.9 μA mM-1 cm-2 with a low detection limit of 1.05 mM in a short response time of 10 s.",Not Parking Lots but Parks: A Joint Association of Parks and Transit Stations with Travel Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769796,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Urban design literature says that public open space in a station area could promote walking and other types of physical activity, enhance place attractiveness, and increase property values. In the context of station areas, however, there is a lack of empirical studies on the relationship between the presence of parks and sustainable travel behavior, which is one of the primary goals of transit-oriented developments (TODs). This study examined the impact of park provision on transit users' mode choice in three U.S. regions: Atlanta (GA), Boston (MA), and Portland (OR). This study utilized multilevel multinomial logistic regression to account for hierarchical data structures-trips nested within station areas-and multiple travel modes-automobiles, transit, and walking. After controlling for the built environment and trip attributes, this study showed that when there was a park, people were more likely to walk or take transit to access or egress a transit station. A transit station having a park nearby may provide a more pleasant first-mile/last-mile travel experience. This paper demonstrated that station areas need to incorporate more public space, an overlooked element in current TOD plans.",The Circadian tau Mutation in Casein Kinase 1 Is Part of a Larger Domain That Can Be Mutated to Shorten Circadian Period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769795,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Drosophila Double-time (DBT) phosphorylates the circadian protein Period (PER). The period-altering mutation tau, identified in hamster casein kinase I (CKIε) and created in Drosophila DBT, has been shown to shorten the circadian period in flies, as it does in hamsters. Since CKI often phosphorylates downstream of previously phosphorylated residues and the tau amino acid binds a negatively charged ion in X-ray crystal structures, this amino acid has been suggested to contribute to a phosphate recognition site for the substrate. Alternatively, the tau amino acid may affect a nuclear localization signal (NLS) with which it interacts. We mutated the residues that were close to or part of the phosphate recognition site or NLS. Flies expressing DBT with mutations of amino acids close to or part of either of these motifs produced a shortening of period, suggesting that a domain, including the phosphate recognition site or the NLS, can be mutated to produce the short period phenotype. Mutation of residues affecting internally placed residues produced a longer period, suggesting that a specific domain on the surface of the kinase might generate an interaction with a substrate or regulator, with short periods produced when the interaction is disrupted.",Ovariectomy Impairs Socio-Cognitive Functions in Dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769794,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 03 10,"Recent studies have underlined the effect of ovariectomy on the spatial cognition of female dogs, with ovariectomized dogs showing a clear preference for an egocentric rather than an allocentric navigation strategy whereas intact females did not show preferences. Intact females had better performances than gonadectomized females in solving a learning task in a maze. Ovariectomy also affects socio-cognitive abilities, reducing the dog's level of attention on the owner. We tested dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in the object choice task paradigm to assess whether an ovariectomy could impair females' ability to follow human signals. Forty pet dogs (18 intact females (IF) and 22 gonadectomized females (GF)) were tested in the object choice task paradigm using the human proximal pointing gesture. For the analysis, the frequency of correct, wrong and no-choices was collected; moreover, the latency of the correct choices was also considered. The IF group followed the pointing gestures more often than the GF group and with a lower latency, whereas a significantly higher no-choice frequency was recorded for the GF group. These results show a detrimental effect of ovariectomy on dogs' socio-cognitive skills related to the responsiveness to human pointing gestures.",Depletion of Gram-Positive Bacteria Impacts Hepatic Biological Functions During the Light Phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769793,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Living organisms display internal biological rhythms, which are an evolutionarily conserved adaptation to the environment that drives their rhythmic behavioral and physiological activities. The gut microbiota has been proposed, in association with diet, to regulate the intestinal peripheral clock. However, the effect of gut dysbiosis on liver remains elusive, despite that germfree mice show alterations in liver metabolic functions and the hepatic daily rhythm. We analyzed whether the disruption of gut microbial populations with various antibiotics would differentially impact liver functions in mice. Our results support the notion of an impact on the hepatic biological rhythm by gram-positive bacteria. In addition, we provide evidence for differential roles of gut microbiota spectra in xenobiotic metabolism that could protect against the harmful pharmacological effects of drugs. Our results underscore a possible link between liver cell proliferation and gram-positive bacteria."

Considering these trends, we proposed a simple and low computing cost algorithm to process and analyze an ECG signal. Our approach is based on the use of linear regression to segment the signal, with the goal of detecting the R point of the ECG wave and later, to separate the signal in periods for detecting P, Q, S, and T peaks. After pre-processing of ECG signal to reduce the noise, the algorithm was able to efficiently detect fiducial points, information that is transcendental for diagnosis of heart conditions using machine learning classifiers. When tested on 260 ECG records, the detection approach performed with a Sensitivity of 97.5% for Q-point and 100% for the rest of ECG peaks. Finally, we validated the robustness of our algorithm by developing an ECG sensor to register and transmit the acquired signals to a mobile device in real time.","Distinctive Distribution of Secretory Phospholipases A₂ in the Venoms of Afro-Asian Cobras (Subgenus: Naja, Afronaja, Boulengerina and Uraeus).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769779,Toxins,2019 04 02,"The protein abundances of phospholipases A₂ in cobra venom proteomes appear to vary among cobra species. To determine the unique distribution of snake venom phospholipases A₂ (svPLA₂) in the cobras, the svPLA₂ activities for 15 cobra species were examined with an acidimetric and a colorimetric assay, using egg yolk suspension and 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxy benzoic acid (NOBA) as the substrate. The colorimetric assay showed significant correlation between svPLA₂ enzymatic activities with the svPLA₂ protein abundances in venoms. High svPLA₂ activities were observed in the venoms of Asiatic spitting cobras (Naja sputatrix, Naja sumatrana) and moderate activities in Asiatic non-spitters (Naja naja, Naja atra, Naja kaouthia), African spitters (subgenus Afronaja), and forest cobra (subgenus Boulengerina). African non-spitting cobras of subgenus Uraeus (Naja haje, Naja annulifera, Naja nivea, Naja senegalensis) showed exceptionally low svPLA₂ enzymatic activities. The negligible PLA₂ activity in Uraeus cobra venoms implies that PLA₂ may not be ubiquitous in all snake venoms. The svPLA₂ in cobra envenoming varies depending on the cobra species. This may potentially influence the efficacy of cobra antivenom in specific use for venom neutralization.","Theaflavin-3,3'-Digallate Suppresses Human Ovarian Carcinoma OVCAR-3 Cells by Regulating the Checkpoint Kinase 2 and p27 kip1 Pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769778,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"Theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF3) is a unique polyphenol in black tea. Epidemiological studies have proved that black tea consumption decreases the incidence rate of ovarian cancer. Our former research demonstrated that TF3 inhibited human ovarian cancer cells. Nevertheless, the roles of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and p27 kip1 (p27) in TF3-mediated inhibition of human ovarian cancer cells have not yet been investigated. In the current study, TF3 enhanced the phosphorylation of Chk2 to modulate the ratio of pro/anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to initiate intrinsic apoptosis in a p53-independent manner and increased the expression of death receptors to activate extrinsic apoptosis in OVCAR-3 human ovarian carcinoma cells. In addition, TF3 up-regulated the expression of p27 to induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in OVCAR-3 cells. Our study indicated that Chk2 and p27 were vital anticancer targets of TF3 and provided more evidence that TF3 might be a potent agent to be applied as adjuvant treatment for ovarian cancer.",Further Probing of Cu2+-Dependent PNAzymes Acting as Artificial RNA Restriction Enzymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769777,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"Peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-neocuproine conjugates have been shown to efficiently catalyse the cleavage of RNA target sequences in the presence of Cu2+ ions in a site-specific manner. These artificial enzymes are designed to force the formation of a bulge in the RNA target, the sequence of which has been shown to be key to the catalytic activity. Here, we present a further investigation into the action of Cu2+-dependent PNAzymes with respect to the dependence on bulge composition in 3- and 4-nucleotide bulge systems. Cu2+-dependent PNAzymes were shown to have a clear preference for 4-nucleotide bulges, as the cleavage of 3-nucleotide bulge-forming RNA sequences was significantly slower, which is illustrated by a shift in the half-lives from approximately 30 min to 24 h. Nonetheless, the nucleotide preferences at different positions in the bulge displayed similar trends in both systems. Moreover, the cleavage site was probed by introducing critical chemical modifications to one of the cleavage site nucleotides of the fastest cleaved 4-nucleotide RNA bulge. Namely, the exclusion of the exocyclic amine of the central adenine and the replacement of the 2'-hydroxyl nucleophile with 2'-H or 2'-OMe substituents in the RNA severely diminished the rate of RNA cleavage by the Cu2+-dependent PNAzyme, giving insight into the mechanism of cleavage. Moreover, the shorter recognition arm of the RNA/PNAzyme complex was modified by extending the PNAzyme by two additional nucleobases. The new PNAzyme was able to efficiently promote the cleavage of RNA when fully hybridised to a longer RNA target and even outperform the previous fastest PNAzyme. The improvement was demonstrated in cleavage studies with stoichiometric amounts of either PNAzyme present, and the extended PNAzyme was also shown to give turnover with a 10-fold excess of the RNA target.",Increased Phenolic Content and Enhanced Antioxidant Activity in Fermented Glutinous Rice Supplemented with Fu Brick Tea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769776,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 31,"Glutinous rice-based foods have a long history are consumed worldwide. They are also in great demand for the pursuit of novel sensory and natural health benefits. In this study, we developed a novel fermented glutinous rice product with the supplementation of Fu brick tea. Using in vitro antioxidant evaluation and phenolic compounds analysis, fermentation with Fu brick tea increased the total phenolic content and enhanced the antioxidant activity of glutinous rice, including scavenging of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical, and hydroxyl radical, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, and ferric ion reducing power and iron chelating capability. Besides, compared with traditional fermented glutinous rice, this novel functional food exhibited a stronger activity for protecting DNA against hydroxyl radical-induced oxidation damage. Quantitative analysis by HPLC identified 14 compounds covering catechins and phenolic acids, which were considered to be positively related to the enhanced antioxidant capability. Furthermore, we found that 80% ethanol was a suitable extract solvent compared with water, because of its higher extraction efficiency and stronger functional activities. Our results suggested that this novel fermented glutinous rice could serve as a nutraceutical food/ingredient with special sensory and functional activities.","Examining the Walking Accessibility, Willingness, and Travel Conditions of Residents in Saudi Cities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769775,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Rapid urban expansion and population growth in Saudi cities over the past four decades have increased vehicular accidents and traffic congestion and have impacted the daily walking conditions of the residents. Walking has various health and environmental benefits. In North American and European countries, three factors have been found to motivate a resident to walk within their community: their accessibility to community social and business facilities, their perception and willingness, and the safety conditions of the roads and sidewalks within their community for walking. This study examined these factors and their role in the walking habits of the residents in the neighborhoods of Doha and Dana districts in Saudi Arabia's eastern city of Dhahran. Data were collected through field observations and by randomly sampling and interviewing 200 residents. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and SPSS statistical software were used for data analysis. The results show that most of the community facilities are randomly placed in the districts. Mosques are the closest facility to each resident with an average accessibility distance of 242m. Almost 43% of the respondents prefer daily walking while the rest are hesitant due to hot weather during summer and narrow and poorly designed sidewalks. The sidewalks were also found to be blocked by trees, street signals, and illegally parked vehicles. Future studies should explore the accessibility to facilities, willingness, climate, and health conditions of the residents, and the road and sidewalk conditions for walking in other cities of the Kingdom.",Current Progress in Uterus Transplantation Research in Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769774,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Uterus transplantation (UTx) is now a possible approach for women with absolute uterine factor infertility to deliver a child, following the first successful delivery by Brännström et al. in Sweden in September 2014. This remarkable achievement attracted major attention worldwide and caused many countries to prepare for UTx, including countries in Asia. To date, three groups have performed UTx in humans in Asia, and many others are aiming for the clinical application of UTx with accumulation of basic experimental data. Therefore, it is likely that UTx will expand rapidly in Asia in the near future, although this will depend on ethical, social and religious views in each country. With this background, herein we summarize the current progress of UTx in East, Southeast and South Asia, with the purpose of increasing understanding of the current status of basic and clinical UTx research in each country and sharing progress and knowledge to ensure future development of UTx research in Asia.","CdSe/ZnS Quantum Dots Impaired the First Two Generations of Placenta Growth in an Animal Model, Based on the Shh Signaling Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769773,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"The toxicity, especially the transgenerational toxicity of quantum dots (QDs) in vivo, is still scarcely understood in spite of great promising applications of QDs in biomedicine. In this study, the maternal status, pregnancy outcome, and fetus development of parental generation (P0) to offspring in three generations (F3) were investigated after Kunming mice perinatal (GD 13-PND 5) exposure to Cd containing QDs (CdSe/ZnS QDs) and CdCl₂. The results show CdSe/ZnS QDs induced placenta injuries in P0 and diminished placenta diameters in F1 and F2. Bodyweight growth decreased in the CdSe/ZnS QDs treatment group in the F1 and F2 generation. Additionally, CdSe/ZnS QDs significantly altered the expression of key genes in the Shh signal pathway. Overall, this study exhibited that the CdSe/ZnS QDs exposure during perinatal period impaired placenta growth in the first two generations, but not on the third generation. The toxicological actions of the CdSe/ZnS QDs might be through the effects on the Shh signal pathway.",MicroRNA-766-3p Contributes to Anti-Inflammatory Responses through the Indirect Inhibition of NF-κB Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769772,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is small RNA of 20 to 22 nucleotides in length and is stably present in plasma. Regulating the expression of miRNA taken into cells has been suggested as a general therapeutic approach. We identified the novel anti-inflammatory miRNA hsa-miR-766-3p and investigated its biological function in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocyte MH7A cells. To verify the function of the miRNA present in the plasma of RA patients, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the miRNA expression during abatacept treatment and identified eight miRNAs with significantly altered expression levels. Among these eight miRNAs, miR-766-3p was found to have a clear function. The expression of inflammatory genes in response to inflammatory stimuli was suppressed in MH7A transduced with miR-766-3p. We showed that miR-766-3p indirectly reduced the activation of NF-κB and clarified that this mechanism was partially involved in the reduction of the mineralocorticoid receptor expression. In addition, the inflammatory responses were suppressed in other types of cells. These results indicate the novel function of miR-766-3p, findings that may aid in the development of therapies to suppress inflammation, not only in RA but also in other diseases.",Improvement of Transparencies and Mechanical Properties of Poly(cyclohexylene dimethylene cyclohexanedicarboxylate) Parts Using a Compounding Nucleating Agent to Control Crystallization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769771,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Poly(cyclohexylene dimethylene cyclohexanedicarboxylate) (PCCE) is a kind of copolyester polymer with excellent toughness and outstanding flexibility. However, the opacity caused by crystallization limits the widespread application of PCCE in products that have transparency requirements. The effects of 1,3:2,4-Di-p-methylbenzylidene sorbitol (MDBS) on the crystallization behavior, transparency, and mechanical properties of a PCCE melt were investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), spectrophotometry, and tensile testing. The results suggest that the transparency and mechanical properties of PCCE drastically improve and that its crystallization behaviors are obviously influenced by the addition of MDBS. PCCE with 0.6 wt% MDBS was then selected as a representative sample, and its thermal behavior and crystal morphology were further investigated by DSC, hot-staged polarizing microscopy (HSPLM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quantitative results suggest that, compared to neat PCCE resin, PCCE/MDBS has a lower isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization activation energy, which indicates a rapid crystallization process. The results also show that, compared to the pure PCCE melt, the PCCE/MDBS melt experiences a greater increase in the number of crystals and a greater decrease in the crystal size during cooling. The acceleration of the crystallization process and reduction in crystal size can be both attributed to the nucleation effect of the MDBS. In conclusion, because the addition of the nucleating agent improves the transparency and tensile properties of PCCE by adjusting and controlling its thermal and crystallization behaviors, the proposed technique of using a compounding nucleating agent to control crystallization is therefore suitable for PCCE."

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs.

The National Inpatient Sample Database (NIS) was used to identify all patients who underwent a TKA between 2009 and the third quarter of 2015. Regression analysis was utilized to assess trends. Chi-square analysis was used to explore categorical variables whereas Kruskal-Wallis test was used to explore nonparametric continuous variables. TKA utilization increased between 2009 and 2015 with the highest volume occurring during the fall. Primary osteoarthritis was the primary indication in 98% of cases. There was an increase in minority representation among recipients. Black TKA recipients were younger and had lower median age-adjusted Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI). Black recipients were most likely to be of the lowest 25% of median income than any other races. The Midwest demonstrated the greatest increase in TKAs performed per 100,000 between 2009 and 2014. Case volumes shifted to urban teaching hospitals between 2009 and 2014. There were differences in age of presentation, preoperative morbidity, and income status among races. Furthermore, our findings revealed a more rapid growth in TKA procedures per 100,000 in the Midwest, in addition to volume shifts toward urban teaching hospitals. Future studies are needed to update our findings as well as explore trends in racial disparities for primary TKA recipients.",The impact of interventions by pharmacists collected in a computerised physician order entry context: a prospective observational study with a 10-year reassessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769345,Swiss medical weekly,2019 06 13,"This study assesses clinical interventions by pharmacists prospectively collected from medical and surgical wards, notably the acceptance of interventions, computerised physician order entry (CPOE)related problems, the potential impact of interventions on patient safety evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee, and their evolution over the 10 years since a first assessment.",Assessment of voluntary HIV screening for asylum seekers in two Swiss cantons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769343,Swiss medical weekly,2019 06 13,"To evaluate the feasibility of HIV screening, offered to newly arrived asylum seekers in the Swiss cantons of Valais (VS) and Vaud (VD) in order to meet the national and international standards for early detection and effective treatment of HIV infections.",Association between different types of plant-based diets and leptin levels in healthy volunteers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769342,Acta biochimica Polonica,2019 06 13,"Leptin is an important factor regulating appetite and energety metabolism; disturbances in its signaling are related to adiposity and contribute to the excessive body fat. About a third of the human population is overweight or suffers from obesity, as well as from associated medical conditions. It is well established that vegetarian, especially vegan, diet is very effective in lowering BMI and body fat, thus, plant-based diets are associated with a lower risk of obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma levels of leptin in lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan volunteers with normal BMI. The intake of energy and selected diet components such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and carbohydrates was also investigated. The study involved healthy women - 14 omnivores, 17 lacto-ovo-vegetarians, and 11 vegans. All women had a normal BMI (18.5-24.99). The plasma leptin levels were examined with immunoenzymatic test (ELISA). All participants were interviewed to estimate their nutrient intake by performing a 24-hour dietary recall. Both lacto-ovo-vegetarians and vegans had lower plasma leptin concentrations than their meat-consuming counterparts. Every analyzed diet group had a different body fat content, with the highest level in omnivores and the lowest in vegans. All participants had similar calorie, total fat, and total carbohydrates intake. Total PUFA and specifically omega-3 fatty acids consumption was lower in omnivores when compared to both types of plant diet; the same was found for fiber intake. Our results suggest that adopting a plant-based diet may be beneficial for energetic metabolism, as it significantly lowers the body fat storage and circulating leptin levels.",Facile single-molecule pull-down assay for analysis of endogenous proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769341,Physical biology,2019 04 18,"The single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay analyzes molecular complexes in physiological conditions from cell or tissue lysates. Currently the approach requires a lengthy sample preparation process, which has largely prevented the widespread adoption of this technique in bioanalysis. Here, we present a simplified SiMPull assay based upon dichlorodimethylsilane-Tween-20 passivation and F(ab) fragment labeling. Our passivation is a much shorter process than the standard polyethylene glycol passivation used in most single-molecule studies. The use of F(ab) fragments for indirect fluorescent labeling rather than divalent F(ab')2 or whole IgG antibodies allows for the pre-incubation of the detection antibodies, reducing the sample preparation time for single-molecule immunoprecipitation samples. We examine the applicability of our approach to recombinant proteins and endogenous proteins from mammalian cell lysates.","Selective photochromism in a self-coated WO3/WO3-x homojunction: enhanced solar modulation efficiency, high luminous transmittance and fast self-bleaching rate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769340,Nanotechnology,2019 04 09,"Pursuing excellent photochromic (PC) properties is still a longstanding challenge for energy-efficient smart coatings. Herein, we have prepared a novel series of self-coated crystalline WO3-amorphous WO3-x homojunctions by a one-step hydrothermal process, in which oxalic acid was used as a capping agent to prevent polycondensation and the crystallization of [WO6]. The as-prepared nanopowders with tight interfaces have a large specific surface area and rich surface electrons, which leads to a dramatic PC property reaching up to ΔT sol = 64.74% at the near-infrared (NIR) range of 1000-2600 nm with high luminous transmittance (T lum = 94.6% in the virgin state and T lum = 32.47% in the colored state). Meanwhile, the as-prepared crystalline WO3-amorphous WO3-x homojunction reveals fast reversible PC circulation; most particularly, the self-bleaching rate increases at least three times-the self-bleaching time is less than 8 h. Moreover, as the microstructure of the homojunction is tuned, the solar modulation range can be selective and tuned, so that the solar modulation efficiency is up to the best energy-saving state by controlling the main absorption according to the solar energy distribution.",Large area patterning of residue-free metal oxide nanostructures by liquid transfer imprint lithography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769339,Nanotechnology,2019 03 25,"One-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) residue-free metal oxide patterns are directly fabricated over large areas using liquid transfer imprint lithography (LTIL) with an ultraviolet-curable metal oxide precursor resist. A 1D line or pillar array of metal oxides nano-patterns without a residual layer is formed by LTIL and annealing processes. A 3D layer-by-layer nanomesh structure is successfully constructed by repeating the LTIL method without a complex etching process. In addition, it is possible to form a hierarchical structure in which zinc oxide nanowires are selectively grown on a desired zinc oxide (ZnO) seed pattern formed by LTIL via a hydrothermal method. Unlike the pattern fabricated by the conventional nanoimprint lithography method, in the case of the pattern formed by LTIL the residues accumulated between the patterns during the patterning procedure can be removed, and thus it is possible to easily form various types of nanostructures.",Design of a multi-analyte resonant photonic platform for label-free biosensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769338,Nanotechnology,2019 04 23,"We have designed a multi-analyte biosensing platform based on a hybrid whispering gallery mode resonator to detect protein biomarkers, e.g. those allowing the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our proposed biosensor dependent on the hybrid mode naturally extends the capabilities of both plasmonic sensor and photonic sensor and thus performs better interrogation sensitivity. A multi-resonance of the hybrid mode could occur and the field intensity achieved its maximum value, thereby enabling a very strong light-matter interaction. The detection limit for bulk sensing reached a value of 2 × 10-5 RIU and that for surface sensing was at 0.6 pg mm-2. Our novel configuration has an advantage over the conventional plasmonic-waveguide resonator with a similar cavity size (Q-factor < 500) because a wide range of spectral measurements (56 nm) and a high Q-factor (1300) could be achieved simultaneously. Thus, large refractive index shifts in the medium could be detected with high sensitivity. This biosensor, with a footprint of 625 μm2 for each resonator, is a good candidate for integration into lab-on-chip microsystems for large-scale screening of a wide range of protein biomarkers in high risk of developing disease.",Bioprinted osteon-like scaffolds enhance in vivo neovascularization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769337,Biofabrication,2019 04 10,"Bone tissue engineers are facing a daunting challenge when attempting to fabricate bigger constructs intended for use in the treatment of large bone defects, which is the vascularization of the graft. Cell-based approaches and, in particular, the use of in vitro coculture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has been one of the most explored options. We present in this paper an alternative method to mimic the spatial pattern of HUVECs and hMSCs found in native osteons based on the use of extrusion-based 3D bioprinting (3DP). We developed a 3DP biphasic osteon-like scaffold, containing two separate osteogenic and vasculogenic cell populations encapsulated in a fibrin bioink in order to improve neovascularization. To this end, we optimized the fibrin bioink to improve the resolution of printed strands and ensure a reproducible printing process; the influence of printing parameters on extruded strand diameter and cell survival was also investigated. The mechanical strength of the construct was improved by co-printing the fibrin bioink along a supporting PCL carrier scaffold. Compressive mechanical testing showed improved mechanical properties with an average compressive modulus of 131 ± 23 MPa, which falls in the range of cortical bone. HUVEC and hMSC laden fibrin hydrogels were printed in osteon-like patterns and cultured in vitro. A significant increase in gene expression of angiogenic markers was observed for the biomimetic scaffolds. Finally, biphasic scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in rats. Histological analysis of explanted scaffolds showed a significant increase in the number of blood vessels per area in the 3D printed osteon-like scaffolds. The utilization of these scaffolds in constructing biomimetic osteons for bone regeneration demonstrated a promising capacity to improve neovascularization of the construct. These results indicates that proper cell orientation and scaffold design could play a critical role in neovascularization.",Thermal transport in C3N nanotube: a comparative study with carbon nanotube.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769336,Nanotechnology,2019 04 09,"One-dimensional nanotubes, such as carbon nanotube (CNT) and C3N nanotube (C3NNT), are attracting growing research interest due to their excellent electrical and thermal properties. In this work, the thermal transport of a single-walled C3NNT is investigated in comparison with a single-walled CNT using classical molecular dynamic simulations. We firstly observe that the thermal conductivity (k) of C3NNT is lower than that of CNT. Due to the phonon scattering in the N atoms of C3NNT, the energy is localized around the N atoms. Monotonic decreasing trends of k with increasing temperature are shown in CNT and C3NNT, indicating strong Umklapp phonon scattering. Afterwards, uniaxial strains from -10% to 14% are applied to the nanotubes, and the thermal conductivity initially increases and then decreases. Phonon density of states, phonon dispersions, participation ratios, and spatial distribution of energy are used to analyze the phonon behaviors in nanotubes. This work provides fundamental thermo-physical knowledge to the thermal management of CNT and C3NNT based nanoelectronics."

To overcome this problem, herein, a novel approach of using zeolite to mitigate ammonium toxicity in wastewater for value-added Spirulina production was proposed. Synthetic zeolite was used as medium for ammonium adsorption in wastewater and subsequently as slow-releaser providing nitrogen to Spirulina growth. The optimal conditions for ammonium adsorption include pH value of 8.0, zeolite dose of 300 g/L, and adsorption time of 9 h. The results showed that in terms of biomass production and ammonium recovery, zeolite-based pretreatment has great advantages over some conventional pretreatment technologies. After algae-assisted desorption treatment, ammonium adsorption capacity of zeolite increased back to 1.21 mg/g. In a real-world application, this work will provide a feasible and sustainable approach to remediate ammonium-rich wastewater, produce value-added Spirulina biomass, and recycle used zeolite, further promoting the industrialization of algae-based wastewater remediation.",Land-use changes and check dams reducing runoff and sediment yield on the Loess Plateau of China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769322,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 13,"Revegetation and check dam construction are two widely applied soil erosion control measures on the Loess Plateau of China. They play important roles in sediment yield reduction. However, it remains unclear how these large-scale land-use changes and in-channel structures affect water yield and sediment load on the watershed scale. A combination of field work and modeling exercises were used to quantitatively assess the effects of land-use changes and check dam construction on hydrological processes in the Wuding River watershed. The study area suffered important land-use changes with increases in forestland and grassland, coupled with decreases in cropland, from 1980 to 2010. A large number of check dams were constructed from 1970 to 1980. Runoff and sediment yield in the watershed showed significant decreasing trends (P < 0.01), with change points occurring in the early 1970s. Human activity contributed to 75% and 89% of runoff and sediment changes, respectively. The simulations showed that in a scenario without check dams, runoff and sediment increased by 12% and 11.7%, respectively. Vegetation recovery reduced runoff and sediment yield. 'Grain for Green' resulted in decreasing runoff and sediment levels, and reforestation had more hydrological regulatory effects compared with scenarios involving the conversion of cropland to grassland. Moreover, the combination of revegetation and check dam construction had a greater impact on water yield and sediment transportation. Check dams provide short-term flood control and sediment reductions, whereas land-use changes are long-term sustained soil erosion control measures. It may be more efficient to combine check dam construction with revegetation strategies.",Effect of ageing and chemical form on the bioavailability and toxicity of Pb to the survival and reproduction of the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769321,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"This study investigated the effect of ageing on the bioavailability and toxicity of lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2) and lead oxide (PbO) to Enchytraeus crypticus in LUFA 2.2 natural soil. The potworms were exposed after 2 weeks pre-incubation and after ageing the spiked soils for 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Survival and reproduction after 21 d exposure were related to total, 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable and porewater Pb concentrations in the soil and internal Pb concentrations in the surviving animals. Pb concentration in pore water showed little change during ageing for Pb(NO3)2 but increased strongly for PbO-spiked soils. During ageing, toxicity of Pb(NO3)2 did not change with LC50s and EC50s for the effect on enchytraeid survival and reproduction based on total soil Pb concentrations being constant at 523-619 and 89.8-99.4 mg Pb/kg dry soil, respectively. Toxicity of PbO, however, increased with LC50s and EC50s decreasing from 4830 to 1889 mg Pb/kg dry soil and from 151 to 97.5 mg Pb/kg dry soil, respectively. When related to internal Pb concentrations LC50s did not differ for both Pb forms at different ageing periods and were 73.4-78.7 mg Pb/kg dry body wt. Survival was better explained from internal Pb concentrations in the worms than from total or available Pb concentrations in the soil. Reproduction toxicity (EC50s) and Pb uptake in the worms however, were better explained from 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable Pb concentrations in the soil. The latter finding could provide a scientific basis for the ecological risk assessment of contaminated soils and the derivation of soil quality standards based on extractable concentrations.",Cytotoxicity of organic and inorganic compounds to primary cell cultures established from internal tissues of Chelonia mydas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769319,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"Chemical contaminants have been found in the tissues of sea turtles from all over the world; however, very little is known about the effects. Recently, in vitro alternatives to live animal testing have been applied to sea turtles due to their ethical and practical benefits. While primary skin fibroblasts have been established for several species of sea turtle, cells from internal organs are lacking, though they may be more relevant due to the well documented accumulation of contaminants within internal tissues. This study established primary cell cultures from the small intestine, heart, liver, ovary and skin of green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Cells were exposed to ten contaminants typically found in sea turtles to examine potential variations in sensitivity among cells established from different organs. Differences between cells established from different animals were also examined, including a comparison of cells established from a turtle with fibropapillomatosis (FP) and healthy turtles. Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) primary skin cells were also included for species comparisons. Significant differences were found between the organ types, with liver and heart being the least sensitive, and skin being the most sensitive. Overall, variation between the organ types was low. Primary skin fibroblasts may be a suitable and representative cell type for in vitro turtle toxicology research, as it is relatively easy to obtain from healthy live animals. Skin cultures provide a more sensitive indication of effect, and could be used as an early warning of the potential effects of chemical contamination. Some species differences were found but no differences were found between cell cultures from an FP turtle and healthy turtles. When EC50 values were compared to accumulation values from the literature, inorganic contaminants, such as Zn, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Cu were identified as posing a potential risk to sea turtle populations around the world.",The toxic potentials and focus of disinfection byproducts based on the human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769318,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are inevitably generated during drinking water disinfection processes, and their hazards have not been well characterized. Because they plausibly cause toxicological and pathological damage to human kidney, we selected the human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell, instead of the commonly used CHO cell, as a model to investigate the toxic potential and target of 10 DBPs, including 3 haloacetamides, 2 trihaloacetaldehydes and 5 iodomethanes. Based on the chronic toxicity parameter EC10 of the cell viability test, we obtained a toxic rank of the tested DBPs different from previous studies and calculated their risk quotients by combining their actual concentrations in drinking water systems. Then, dichloroacetamide (DCAM), trichloroacetaldehyde (TCAL), and bromochloroiodomethane (BCIM) were selected to conduct multiple mechanistic bioassays, including cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, ATP metabolism, ROS production, mitochondria-derived apoptosis and qRT-PCR assay. All bioassays revealed the effects of interrupting the molecular, physiological and biochemical processes relevant to mitochondrial functions, such as oxidative respiration, apoptosis, and energy metabolism. Our study improved the human risk assessment of DBPs with the help of a convenient model and parameter and revealed that mitochondrion is a potential toxic focus of DBPs exposure at the cellular level.","Identification, origin and characteristics of bio-bead microplastics from beaches in western Europe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769317,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"Primary microplastics have been collected from 17 beaches along the Atlantic, English Channel and southern North Sea coasts of western Europe. Based on visual characteristics, these plastics were differentiated as either relatively smooth, lentil- or disc-shaped pre-production pellets (or nurdles), which were usually a few mm in diameter and were mainly white to off-white, or rougher and more irregular pellets that were slightly larger and usually black. The latter appeared to be bio-beads, or plastics that are specifically manufactured for use as biomedia in certain sewage water treatment (SWT) plants and, possibly, in other industrial wastewater treatment applications. Identification of bio-beads was confirmed following the acquisition of identical samples from a SWT plant in southwest England and a French supplier of bio-beads. Infrared and x-ray fluorescence analysis revealed that bio-beads have, at least historically, been constructed of plasticised polyethylene and, unlike pre-production pellets, contained variable quantities of potentially toxic elements: Br, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb and Sb; with a distinctive Br to Sb ratio indicative of brominated flame retardants and antimony-based retardant synergists. It is asserted that bio-beads have been manufactured from a heterogeneous mix of recycled polyethylene and end-of-life electrical and electronic plastic, with concentrations of Br, Cd, Cr or Pb in about 50 bio-beads (out of 497 analysed) non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with respect to current regulations on hazardous plastic waste. Concentrations of Br, Cd, Cr, Pb and Sb extracted from individual bio-beads by a simulated avian digestive fluid were variable, with maximum values of about 14, 0.8, 1.3, 20 and 1.4 μg g-1, respectively. The presence and, in many cases, dominance of bio-beads among beached primary microplastics is discussed with regard to the classification of microplastics and potential impacts on wildlife.","One Health - Cycling of diverse microbial communities as a connecting force for soil, plant, animal, human and ecosystem health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769316,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"The One Health concept proposes that there is a connection between human, animal and environmental health. Plants and their health are not explicitly included. In this review, we broaden the One Health concept to include soil, plant, animal and ecosystem health. We argue that the health conditions of all organisms in an ecosystem are interconnected through the cycling of subsets of microbial communities from the environment (in particular the soil) to plants, animals and humans, and back into the environment. After an introduction on health concepts, we present examples of community stability and resilience, diversity and interconnectedness as affected by pollutants, and integrity of nutrient cycles and energy flows. Next, we explain our concept of microbial cycling in relation to ecosystem health, and end with examples of plant and animal disease outbreaks in relation to microbial community composition and diversity. We conclude that we need a better understanding of the role of interconnected microbiomes in promoting plant and animal health and possible ways to stimulate a healthy, diverse microbiome throughout human-dominated ecosystems. We suggest that it is essential to maintain ecosystem and soil health through diversification of plant communities and oligotrophication of managed ecosystems.",Protecting the environment from psychoactive drugs: Problems for regulators illustrated by the possible effects of tramadol on fish behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769315,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"There is concern that psychoactive drugs present in the aquatic environment could affect the behaviour of fish, and other organisms, adversely. There is considerable experimental support for this concern, although the literature is not consistent. To investigate why, fish were exposed to three concentrations of the synthetic opiate tramadol for 23-24 days, and their anxiolytic behaviour in a novel tank diving test was assessed both before and after exposure. The results were difficult to interpret. The positive control drug, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, produced the expected results: exposed fish explored the novel tank more, and swam more slowly while doing so. An initial statistical analysis of the results provided relatively weak support for the conclusion that both the low and high concentrations of tramadol affected fish behaviour, but no evidence that the intermediate concentration did. To gain further insight, UK and Japanese experts in ecotoxicology were asked for their independent opinions on the data for tramadol. These were highly valuable. For example, about half the experts replied that a low concentration of a chemical can cause effects that higher concentrations do not, although a similar number did not believe this was possible. Based both on the inconclusive effects of tramadol on the behaviour of the fish and the very varied opinions of experts on the correct interpretation of those inconclusive data, it is obvious that more research on the behavioural effects of tramadol, and probably all other psychoactive drugs, on aquatic organisms is required before any meaningful risk assessments can be conducted. The relevance of these findings may apply much more widely than just the environmental risk assessment of psychoactive drugs. They suggest that much more rigorous training of research scientists and regulators is probably required if consensus decisions are to be reached that adequately protect the environment from chemicals.","Ozone impact on wheat in Europe, Asia and North America - A comparison.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769314,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"Data from experiments where field-grown wheat was exposed to ozone were collated in order to compare the effects in Europe, Asia and North America using dose-response regression. In addition to grain yield, average grain mass and harvest index were included to reflect the influence of ozone on the crop growth pattern. In order to include as many experiments as possible, daytime average ozone concentration was used as the ozone exposure index, but AOT40, estimated from average ozone concentrations, was also used to compare the performance of the two exposure metrics. The response to ozone differed significantly between the continents only for grain yield when using AOT40 as the exposure index. North American wheat was less sensitive than European and Asian that responded similarly. The variation in responses across all three continents was smallest for harvest index, followed by grain mass and grain yield. The highly consistent effect on harvest index shows that not only effects on biomass accumulation, but also on the partitioning of biomass, are important for the ozone-induced grain yield loss in wheat. The average duration of daily ozone exposure was longer in European experiments compared to North American and Asian. It cannot be excluded that this contributed to the indicated higher ozone sensitivity in European wheat in relation to North American. The main conclusions from this study are that on the average the response of wheat to ozone was lower for the older North American experiments and that the ozone response of the growth pattern reflected by grain mass and harvest index did not differ between continents.",Mercury levels and genotoxic effect in caimans from tropical ecosystems impacted by gold mining.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769313,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 29,"One of the most representative predator species in tropical ecosystems is caiman that can provide relevant information about the impact of mercury (Hg) associated with artisanal and small-scale gold mining. To evaluate the degree to which adverse effects are likely to occur in Caiman crocodilus, total Hg (THg) concentrations in different tissues and DNA damage in erythrocytes were determined. Samples of claws, scutes, and blood were taken from 65 specimens in sites impacted by upstream gold mining, and in a crocodile breeding center as control site, located in a floodplain in northern Colombia. In all the sites, the highest THg among tissues was in the following order: claws > scutes > blood. High concentrations of THg were found in the different tissues of the specimens captured in areas impacted by mining activities, with mean values in claws (1100 ng/g ww), caudal scutes (490 ng/g ww), and blood (65 ng/g ww), and statistically significant differences compared to those of the control site (p < 0.05). THg in scutes from impacted sites are 15-fold higher than in control, whereas for claws and blood are 8 times higher, and a high significant correlation with THg was found in all the tissues. The comet assay reveals significant differences in the DNA damage in the exposed reptiles compared to the controls (p < 0.01). In sum, C. crocodilus from La Mojana floodplain presents a high ecological risk given its genotypic susceptibility to Hg levels present in its habitat, which could possibly influence vital functions such as reproduction of the species and the ecological niche that it represents within the ecosystem."

We conducted a systematic review of the literature on cognitive biases in forensic science disciplines. The initial literature search including electronic searching of three databases (two social science, one science) and manual review of reference lists in identified articles. An initial screening of title and abstract by two independent reviewers followed by full text review resulted in the identification of 29 primary source (research) studies. A critical methodological deficiency, serious enough to make the study too problematic to provide useful evidence, was identified in two of the studies. Most (n = 22) conducted analyses limited to practitioners (n = 17), forensic science trainees (n = 2), or both forensic science practitioners and students (n = 3); other analyses were based on university student or general population participants. Latent fingerprint analysis was examined in 11 studies, with 1-3 other studies found in 13 other disciplines or domains. This set of studies provides a robust database, with evidence of the influence of confirmation bias on analysts conclusions, specifically among the studies with practitioners or trainees presented with case-specific information about the ""suspect"" or crime scenario (in 9 of 11 studies examining this question), procedures regarding use of exemplar(s) (in 4 of 4 studies), or knowledge of a previous decision (in 4 of 4 studies). The available research supports the idea of susceptibility of forensic science practitioners to various types of confirmation bias and of the potential value of procedures designed to reduce access to unnecessary information and control the order of providing relevant information, use of multiple comparison samples rather than a single suspect exemplar, and replication of results by analysts blinded to previous results.",Using histology to evaluate micro-CT findings of trauma in three post-mortem samples - First steps towards method validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769301,Forensic science international,2019 04 25,"Forensic imaging technology has rapidly advanced over the past several decades and is gaining increasing significance in medico-legal death investigations. Medical-grade computed tomography (CT) is now routinely used in post-mortem examinations at numerous institutions across the globe. However, the resolution of medical-grade CT is limited and unsuitable when used to depict some smaller anatomical structures or micro-trauma. High-resolution micro-CT offers up to 100× the resolution to overcome this problem but is a very recent addition to the field of forensic radiology. Few studies so far have attempted to validate the results which is an essential prerequisite for it to be used in the criminal justice process as demanded by regulatory bodies. This study directly compares micro-CT images with histology, the current gold standard. Three cases were examined: two larynges from suspected strangulations and one ribcage of a case of fatal child abuse. A strong correlation was observed between histology and micro-CT as the majority of skeletal injuries were identified correctly. This paper discusses the forensic implications of the results and how micro-CT is complementary to histology.",Are sensorimotor experiences the key for successful early intervention in infants with congenital brain lesion?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769300,Infant behavior & development,2019 05 29,"Living with a congenital brain lesion may have detrimental effects on the ability to do everyday activities, but contrary to acquired brain lesions, people and in particular children, with congenital brain lesions may have limited or no experience of how their bodies work. This absence of experience gives rise to challenges for habilitation of sensorimotor abilities and derived cognitive abilities. How can motor and cognitive abilities be achieved and trained in an individual with no experience of potential abilities? In this article, we aim to review the existing knowledge about the development of sensorimotor integration. Further, we will discuss this knowledge in the light of two neurocognitive theories: embodied cognition and predictive coding. Moreover, using developmental knowledge and theory in combination, we will argue that early sensorimotor development serves as a foundation for later cognitive development. Finally, we try to use these elements in a strategy to make interventions as early as possible, with the purpose of improving sensorimotor and cognitive abilities in children with congenital brain lesions.",Ectopic intranasal canine tooth in a child: A rare case report and literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769299,International journal of surgery case reports,2019 03 12,"Intranasal teeth are a rare form of ectopic teeth.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) juveniles were treated with enrofloxacin at concentrations of 5, 10 and 500 μg/L for 14 days. A three-day-long test caused changes of catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. Moreover, lipid peroxidation was observed at the highest concentration. No significant changes either in catalytic activity of antioxidant enzymes or elevated lipid peroxidation were observed from sampling day 7 on. mRNA expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes was also not affected by enrofloxacin after a 14-day exposure. This suggests the ability of D. rerio juveniles to adapt to enrofloxacin in a short time period. Moreover, enrofloxacin was not shown to affect collagen, cathepsin K, optic atrophy 1 and pyruvate kinase L/R mRNA expression in this study.","Circulating miRNA-126, -145 and -155 levels in Mexican women exposed to inorganic arsenic via drinking water.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769280,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 03 28,"The aim of this research was to investigate circulating expression levels of three miRNAs (miR-126, miR-155, and miR-145) proposed as predictive CVD biomarkers in Mexican women exposed to inorganic arsenic via drinking water.

We have previously shown that CEP-701 (lestaurtinib), a drug with an established safety profile in children, attenuates short-term hyperexcitability and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor activation in a well-established rat model of early life hypoxic seizures (HS). Here, we investigated the potential long-term neuroprotective effects of a post-HS transient CEP-701 treatment. Following exposure to global hypoxia, 10 day old male Sprague-Dawley pups received CEP-701 or its vehicle and were sequentially subjected to the light-dark box test (LDT), forced swim test (FST), open field test (OFT), Morris water maze (MWM), and the modified active avoidance (MAAV) test between postnatal days 24 and 44 (P24-44). Spontaneous seizure activity was assessed by epidural cortical electroencephalography (EEG) between P50 and 100. Neuronal density and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels were evaluated on histological sections in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex at P100. Vehicle-treated hypoxic rats exhibited significantly increased immobility in the FST compared with controls, and post-HS CEP-701 administration reversed this HS-induced depressive-like behavior (p < 0.05). In the MAAV test, CEP-701-treated hypoxic rats were slower at learning both context-cued and tone-signaled shock-avoidance behaviors (p < 0.05). All other behavioral outcomes were comparable, and no recurrent seizures, neuronal loss, or increase in GFAP levels were detected in any of the groups. We showed that early life HS predispose to long-lasting depressive-like behaviors, and that these are prevented by CEP-701, likely via TrkB modulation. Future mechanistically more specific studies will further investigate the potential role of TrkB signaling pathway modulation in achieving neuroprotection against neonatal HS, without causing neurodevelopmental adverse effects.",Pharmacological advances in pemphigoid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769277,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 05 15,"Pemphigoid is the most common autoimmune blistering disease. IgG and IgE autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal antigens Bullous Pemphigoid (BP) 180 and BP230 are of pathogenic relevance, since autoantibody-antigen binding results in complement activation, immune cells infiltration, impaired hemidesmosomal function, and loss of dermal-epidermal adhesion. Systemic steroids and immunosuppressants are frontline therapies in pemphigoid, but result in substantial morbidity and increased mortality. A large randomized multicenter study highlighted doxycycline as a feasible alternative to systemic corticosteroids in patients not suitable for long-term steroid use. In recent years, new targeted therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg), rituximab, omalizumab, and immunoadsorption, have proven efficacy in the refractory setting, but, with the exception of IVIG, large randomized trial has not been performed yet. Basic research studies have now shed light on the pathogenic role of eosinophils and autoreactive T-helper 2 cells in pemphigoid, inducing tissue damage and sustaining autoantibody production by autoreactive B-cells, respectively. Indeed, eosinophils and Th2-related cytokines have become attractive therapeutic options. Moreover, Interleukin-17 related inflammatory pathways have been also shown to participate in the blistering process. This review discusses current evidence for the use of targeted therapies in pemphigoid as well as most relevant pharmacologic advances and new drugs currently under clinical investigation.",Mechanisms and regulation of dopamine release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769276,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 07,"Dopamine controls motor functions, motivation, and reward-related learning through G-protein coupled receptor signaling. The current working model is that upon release, dopamine diffuses to influence many target cells via wide-spread receptors. Recent studies, however, suggest that dopamine release is fast and generates small signaling hotspots. In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.",Pre-enrichment of radioactive cesium in muddy water separated into suspended and dissolved substances for trace analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769275,Water research,2019 05 12,"A new in-situ pre-enrichment system was developed for trace analysis of radioactive Cs in environmental water such as rivers, ponds, and seas, where the radioactive Cs is separated into suspended substances (SS) and dissolved substances (DS). The SS component was collected as the enrichment slurry by cross-flow filtration, thereby compact systems were realized. The DS component was collected in a small cartridge filled with a non-woven fiber with immobilized adsorbent nanoparticles. The recovery rate was estimated at around 95%. The size distribution of the SS and the concentration of radioactive Cs after enrichment were the same as that of the raw water before enrichment. The condensed SS can be used for other evaluations such as ignition loss. From the field test at a pond in the Fukushima-area, the Cs concentration of the SS was found to be 4-5 times higher than that of the sediment in the same pond. The organic content estimated by ignition loss was also three times higher.",Effect of dissolved oxygen on efficiency of TOC reduction by UV at 185 nm in an ultrapure water production system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769274,Water research,2019 05 12,"The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the degradation of methanol by ultraviolet (UV) light at 185 nm (UV-185) was examined in this study. The experiments were conducted using a bench-scale experimental apparatus that was operated under continuous conditions. In the control tests with various DO conditions, it was confirmed that UV irradiation of water without methanol produced approximately 54 μg/L of H2O2 and removed 15%-90% of the DO. The production of H2O2 was affected by the mixing conditions within the UV reactor and the dose of UV. The degradation efficiency of methanol by UV-185 irradiation improved linearly with increasing DO concentration, with more than 90% DO consumption. The maximum total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate was observed at 100 μg/L DO and 433 mW·sec/cm2, the highest DO and dosage conditions in this study. The production of H2O2 was also affected by DO concentration in the feed water, especially at the high UV dosage, in which lower H2O2 production was observed at higher DO.",Social contents in dreams: An empirical test of the Social Simulation Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769273,Consciousness and cognition,2019 02 19,"Social Simulation Theory (SST) considers the function of dreaming to be the simulation of social events.

Further, we investigated the frequency and quality of interactions in late vs early REM and NREM dreams. Data consisted of wake, REM and NREM home dream reports (N = 232, 116, 116, respectively) from 15 students. Dreams overrepresented social events compared to wake reports, supporting the Sociality Bias hypothesis. However, the Strengthening Hypothesis was not supported.

Yet, little developmental research has examined the interface of attention and visual working memory (VWM), where what is seen is maintained for use in ongoing visual tasks. Using the task-evoked pupil response - a sensitive, real-time, involuntary measure of focused attention that has been shown to correlate with VWM performance in adults and older children - we examined the relationship between focused attention and VWM in 13-month-olds. We used a Delayed Match Retrieval paradigm, to test infants' VWM for object-location bindings - what went where - while recording anticipatory gaze responses and pupil dilation. We found that infants with greater focused attention during memory encoding showed significantly better memory performance. As well, trials that ended in a correct response had significantly greater pupil response during memory encoding than incorrect trials. Taken together, this shows that pupillometry can be used as a measure of focused attention in infants, and a means to identify those individuals, or moments, where cognitive effort is maximized.",Characterization of normative angular joint kinematics during two functional upper limb tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769260,Gait & posture,2019 06 16,"Optical motion capture is a powerful tool for assessing upper body kinematics, including compensatory movements, in different populations.

In order to verify applicability of this approach well-defined referential system of sphingomyelin (SM), cholesterol (Chol) and cyclosporin A (CsA) is applied. AFM-IR method allows to directly and chemoselectively map the distribution of components in model lipid membranes. Additionally the orientation of Chol and SM molecules in the monolayer is determined by application of two perpendicular infrared laser polarizations.

However, due to the long timescale of creep (up to several years), its modeling and, thereby, prediction has remained challenging. Here, based on mesoscale simulations of calcium-silicate-hydrate gels (CSH, the binding phase of concrete), we present an accelerated simulation method-based on stress perturbations and overaging-to model creep deformations in CSH. Our simulations yield a very good agreement with nanoindentation creep tests, which suggests that concrete creep occurs through the reorganization of CSH grains at the mesoscale. We show that the creep of CSH exhibits a logarithmic dependence on time-in agreement with the free-volume theory of granular physics. Further, we demonstrate the existence of a linear regime, i.e., wherein creep linearly depends on the applied load-which establishes the creep modulus as a material constant. These results could offer a new physics-based basis for nanoengineering colloidal gels featuring minimal creep.",A case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder following seasonal influenza vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769255,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2019 04 16,"There have been reports of central nervous systemic inflammatory disease associated with vaccination.

The MPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, magnetometry and Gran titration and the results showed that magnetic jacobsite was obtained as an intermediate product in transformation of Fe/Mn oxides to siderite and rhodochrosite. When the molar ratio of SA to Mn in the sludge was two, the produced MPs-2 contained a mixture of ferrihdyrite, hematite, jacobsite and Si/Al oxides, and could magnetize at 2.4 emu/g. Ferrihydrite content in MPs decreased with increase of the SA/Mn molar ratio, leading to decrease of the surface sites concentration (Hs). Thus, MPs-2 contained optimized Hs of 6.7 mmoL/g and a desirable adsorption capacity of Cu(II) (73.1 mg/g). The adsorption isotherms of MPs-2 on Cu(II) complied with the Langmuir model and the adsorption kinetics fitted well with the pseudo-second-order model. The major mechanism of adsorption was cationic exchange of the coordinated H and Na ions on MPs-2 surface sites with the Cu(II) ions.

Copper orebodies in Poland contain substantial amounts of metals deemed critical (e.g. Co, Mo, rare earth elements (REE) or V), which are not recovered during processing. The metals of interest are concentrated in metallurgical waste residues that should be classified as a secondary resource rather than as a waste. Bioleaching is a frontier technology promising for environment-friendly treatment of slags. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the feasibility of metal (Co, Mo, REE, V) bioleaching from copper metallurgical wastes employing Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans bacterial strain as the leaching agent. The effect of particle size (fractions <0.25 mm and 0.25-0.5 mm) and pulp density (1%, 2%) was studied using three different slag samples (lead slag - LS, shaft furnace slag - SFS and granulated slag - GS). The bioleaching experiment was set up for 28 days under acidic conditions (pH t0 = 2.5). The results revealed that the microorganisms can catalyze metal extraction from slags as compared to leaching achieved under abiotic conditions. The optimal bioleaching yield was achieved under conditions at 0.25-0.5 mm particle size and 1% pulp density, regardless of used type of slag. After 28 days, the extracted amounts of metals were: 88% Co, 40% Mo, 83% REE and 55% V from LS, 100% Co, 44% Mo, 70% REE and 70% V from SFS and 95% Co, 70% Mo, 99% REE and 93% V from GS. All examined slags showed good potential for bioleaching of valuable elements. However, optimization of initial parameters is still needed for further efficiency improvement, especially in terms of the process duration.",Municipal solid waste biochar-bentonite composite for the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin from aqueous media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769252,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 26,"This study investigates the adsorption of ciprofloxacin (CPX) onto a municipal solid waste derived biochar (MSW-BC) and a composite material developed by combining the biochar with bentonite clay. A bentonite-MSW slurry was first prepared at 1:5 ratio (w/w), and then pyrolyzed at 450 °C for 30 min. The composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy before and after CPX adsorption. Batch experiments were conducted to assess the effect of pH, reaction time and adsorbate dosage. The SEM images confirmed successful modification of the biochar with bentonite showing plate like structures. The PXRD patterns showed changes in the crystalline lattice of both MSW-BC and the composite before and after CPX adsorption whereas the FTIR spectra indicated merging and widening of specific bands after CPX adsorption. The optimum CPX adsorption was achieved at pH 6, and the maximum adsorption capacity of the composite calculated via isotherm modeling was 190 mg/g, which was about 40% higher than the pristine MSW-BC. The Hill isotherm model along with pseudo-second order and Elovich kinetic models showed the best fit to the adsorption data. The most plausible mechanism for increased adsorption capacity is the increased active sites of the composites for CPX adsorption through induced electrostatic interactions between the functional groups of the composite and CPX molecules. The added reactive surfaces in the composite because of bentonite incorporation, and the intercalation of CPX in the clay interlayers improved the adsorption of CPX by the biochar-bentonite composite compared to the pristine biochar. Thus, MSW-BC-bentonite composites could be considered as a potential material for remediating pharmaceuticals in aqueous media."

Our recent work has revealed the crucial role of one of the two structural domains (i.e. Bateman domain) in the regulation of the quaternary structure and enzymatic activity of bacterial IMPDHs. Thus, we have screened chemical libraries to search for compounds targeting the Bateman domain and identified first in-class allosteric inhibitors of a bacterial IMPDH. These inhibitors were shown to counteract the activation by the natural positive effector, MgATP, and to block the enzyme in its apo conformation (low affinity for IMP).

Especially, norfloxacin analogue II-c displayed superior antimicrobial activities against K. pneumoniae and C. albicans with MIC values of 0.005 and 0.010 mM to reference drugs, respectively. This compound not only showed broad antimicrobial spectrum, rapid bactericidal efficacy and strong enzymes inhibitory potency including DNA gyrase and chitin synthase (CHS), low toxicity against mammalian cells and no obvious propensity to trigger the development of bacterial resistance, but also exerted efficient membrane permeability, and could effectively intercalate into K. pneumoniae DNA to form a steady supramolecular complex, which might block DNA replication to exhibit their powerful antimicrobial activity.

These organelles were isolated from the leaves of oxidative stress-sensitive and stress-tolerant wheat cultivars that had been grown from grains that had been incubated in a solution of ZEA (30 μM), Na2SeO4 (Se, 10 μM), EBR (0.1 μM) or in a mixture of ZEA with Se or EBR. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography techniques indicated that ZEA was adsorbed in higher amounts in the chloroplasts in the sensitive rather than tolerant cultivar. Although the brassinosteroids and Se were also accumulated in the chloroplasts, higher levels were only found in the tolerant cultivar. The application of EBR increased the homocastasterone content, especially in the chloroplasts of the tolerant plant and after the addition of ZEA. The presence of both protectants caused a decrease in the ZEA content in studied organelles and resulted in diminishing of the oxidative stress (i.e. changes in the activity of the antioxidative enzymes). Moreover, a recovery of photosystem II and decrease in the negative impact of ZEN on Hsp90 transcript accumulation was observed in plants.",Iatrogenic embolization following cardiac intervention: postmortem analysis of 110 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769235,Cardiovascular pathology : the official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Pathology,2019 05 06,"Iatrogenic embolization following cardiac investigative procedures may result from hydrophilic polymer emboli (HPE) from catheter valve and vessel wall calcifications, and air embolism from open heart surgery.

Tensile tests are commonly performed in-vitro to characterize the mechanical stiffness and rupture force of the knee ligaments which makes the technique unsuitable for in-vivo application. The time required for the limited noninvasive approaches for properties estimation based on knee laxity remained the main obstacle in clinical implementation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique can be a platform to noninvasively assess the knee ligaments. In this study the aim was to explore the potential role of quantitative MRI and dimensional properties, in characterizing the mechanical properties of the main tibiofemoral ligaments. After MR scanning of six cadaveric legs, all 24 main tibiofemoral bone-ligaments-bone specimens were tested in vitro. During the tensile test cross sectional area of the specimens was captured using ultrasound and force-displacement curve was extracted. Digital image correlation technique was implemented to check the strain behavior of the specimen and rupture region and to assure the fixation of ligament bony block during the test. The volume of the specimen was measured using manual segmentation data, and quantitative MR parameters as T2*, T1ρ, and T2 were calculated. Linear mixed statistical models for repeated measures were used to examine the association of MRI parameters and dimensional measurements with the mechanical properties (stiffness and rupture force). The results shows that while the mechanical properties were mostly correlated to the volume, inclusion of the MR parameters increased the correlation strength for stiffness (R2 ≈ 0.48) and partial rupture force (R2 = 0.53). Inclusion of ligament type in the statistical analysis enhanced the correlation of mechanical properties with MR parameters and volume as for stiffness (R2 = 0.60) and partial rupture (R2 = 0.57). In conclusion, this study revealed the potentials in using quantitative MR parameters, T1ρ, T2 and T2*, combined with specimen volume to estimate the essential mechanical properties of all main tibiofemoral ligaments required for subject-specific computational modeling of human knee joint.",Hydro air abrasion on dental glass-ceramics: A direct 3D analysis by stylus profilometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769232,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 03 27,"Air abrasion is used in dentistry for cavity opening, post-endodontic cavity cleaning, and removal of hard deposits or stains. Different applications may require different settings. We aimed to gain better understanding of the effect of some operating parameters on the efficiency of air abrasion on a model dental material. We abraded lithium disilicate glass-ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) with Prepstart H2O device (Danville) and 27-µm-size aluminium oxide abrasive (Danville). At 5 bar constant pressure, we varied incidence direction, treatment time, distance, powder consumption, and supporting medium, in separate experiments addressing individual aspects. The abraded surfaces were characterized by stylus profilometer XP-2 (Ambios). Laboratory condition of normal incidence at fixed direction showed threefold increased volume abrasion vs 45° incidence and oscillating direction. Working in air, 2 mm distance was more efficient than 1 and 5 mm, likely due to its influence on the abrading particles speed. Maximum vs medium powder consumption decreased the abraded volume, while increasing the treated area. Using water restricted the treated surface. To minimize the risk of dental material damage, the best conditions should be 45° direction and 5 mm distance, which both increase the treated area. To counteract this, water may be used. The most abrasive condition is instead 90°, at intermediate 2 mm distance. In most cases, abraded volume scales linearly with time. The present combination of device and abrasive can be effective even on enamel-like ceramic material. Tuning air abrasion settings to the specific dental application appears to be necessary.",Corrosion and metal release from overlapping arterial stents under mechanical and electrochemical stress - An experimental study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769231,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 03 27,"Intra-arterial stenosis due to atherosclerosis is often treated with endovascular balloon dilatation with a metal stent. Restenosis is common and is frequently treated with a new stent placed inside the existing one or the stents are placed with overlap to cover a larger area of the vessels. Observations of stent fractures, stent compression, accumulation of immunocompetent cells around stents have suggested the possibility of immunologic reactions to substances released from stents. An accelerated corrosion model was developed to study corrosion behaviour of commonly used surgical peripheral stents. Single nitinol stents (n = 6), connected stents of the same material (stent-in-stent, both nitinol, n = 7) and connected stents of dissimilar alloys (Nitinol with stainless steel stent inside, n = 7) were investigated. The stents were subjected to mechanical pulsatile radial strain (up to 8% strain at 1 Hz) and electrochemical stress (+112 mV vs. SCE). The release of nickel and titanium ions was compared. Scanning electron images were obtained. There was a higher release of nickel when combining two similar (range: 1382-8018 μg/L, p = 0.0012) and dissimilar (range: 170-2497 μg/L, p = 0.0023) stents compared to single stents (range: 0.4-216 μg/L). The concentration of titanium was low (range: 1.6-98.4 μg/L) with only a difference between the single and two similar stents (p = 0.0047). Deposits of corrosion products were clearly visible after fretting and pitting corrosion mainly on the Nitinol stents. Several mesh wires were fractured. The study demonstrated that mechanical strain combined with weak electric potential resulted in pronounced corrosion and fracture of stents, especially with overlapping stents. Single stents after pulsatile load released the lowest amount of ions. The combination of stents of the same material (Nitinol) had the highest release of metal ions."

NMOSD can infrequently present as a complication of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Moreover, few cases of NMOSD patients with brain hemorrhage have been reported. We report a rare case of PRES together with NMOSD recurrence, subsequent to pontine hemorrhage after intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) therapy. A 51-year-old Japanese woman, with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and recurrent episodes of left visual acuity disorder related to AQP4-positive NMOSD, developed blindness in the left eye. Brain MRI showed a hyperintense lesion in pons. She was initially diagnosed with recurrence of NMOSD and 1000 mg of IVMP was administered for 3 days. After the 3rd course of IVMP, she developed left-sided sensory disturbance, and blood pressure was increased to 202/127 mmHg. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed pontine hemorrhage, and she was referred to our hospital again. We diagnosed PRES associated with NMOSD recurrence, along with development of pontine hemorrhage induced by the increase in blood pressure resulting from IVMP. The patient was treated with nicardipine to strictly control blood pressure, and tranexamic acid and glycerol for pontine hemorrhage and PRES. We also extended IVMP for 5 consecutive days in total, followed by plasmapheresis. After therapy, blindness in the left eye improved to light perception. Collectively, anti-AQP4 antibody could induce PRES together with recurrent NMOSD, and pontine hemorrhage could thus be induced by blood pressure increases resulting from IVMP.",The expansion of circulating IL-6 and IL-17-secreting follicular helper T cells is associated with neurological disabilities in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769212,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 04 01,"Due to their function in assisting B cells, TFH cells may be involved in the production of pathogenic IgG in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).

Moore. It was reported recently that the differentiation of Th17 cells was inhibited, while the generation of induced Treg cells (iTregs) was promoted, by TET treatment. We therefore carefully examined the effect of TET on the differentiation of four major subsets of T helper cells. The results showed that in vitro treatment with TET potently inhibited the differentiation of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Administration of LPS resulted in a mixed Th1, Th2 and Th17 responses in normal mice, and such effect of LPS was inhibited by in vivo TET treatment as well. In contrast, TET did not promote or inhibit the in vitro generation of iTregs from naïve CD4+CD25-Foxp3/gfp- T cells. Furthermore, spontaneous and rapamycin-induced conversion of naïve CD4+CD25-Foxp3/gfp- T cells into Foxp3-expressing iTregs in congenic mice was not affected by TET treatment. Thus, TET had the capacity to inhibit the differentiation of proinflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells, while sparing the generation of Tregs. As a Treg-friendly and broad spectrum anti-inflammatory agent, the molecular mechanism and the therapeutic potential of TET in various human inflammatory diseases should be further studied.",Foot and shoe responsible for majority of soft tissue work in early stance of walking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769210,Human movement science,2019 05 13,"Soft tissues located throughout the human body are known to perform substantial mechanical work through wobbling and deforming, particularly following foot impacts with the ground. Yet, it is not known which specific tissues in the body are responsible for the majority of the soft tissue work. The purpose of this study was to quantify how much of the soft tissue work after foot contact was due to the foot and shoe, vs. from tissues elsewhere in the body, and how this distribution of work changed with walking speed and slope. We collected ground reaction forces and whole-body kinematics while ten subjects walked at five speeds (0.8-1.6 m/s) and on seven different slopes (9 degrees downhill to 9 degrees uphill). Using a previously-published Energy-Accounting analysis, we found that the majority of the soft tissue work during early stance was due to deformation of the foot and shoe. The percentage of work did not vary significantly with speed but did vary significantly with slope.

This study investigated the occurrence and contamination profiles of nine ARGs of three types from swine manure to receiving environments (soil and water) in Guangdong Province, southern China. All ARGs occurred in 100% of swine manure samples. Moreover, the absolute concentration of total ARGs varied from 3.01 × 108 to 7.18 × 1014 copies/g, which was significantly higher than that in wastewater and manured soil (p < 0.05). Regarding the distribution characteristics of ARGs in swine manure, wastewater and manured soil, the tetracycline resistance gene tetO was predominant. ARGs in swine manure were relatively stable among swine growth periods after the nursery period. The ARG concentration did not differ significantly between manured and unmanured soil (p > 0.05). However, the number of ARGs (ermB, qnrS, acc(6')-Ib, tetM, tetO and tetQ) decreased but were not eliminated by wastewater treatment components (p < 0.05). Based on correlation analysis, the tetracycline resistance genes tetQ and tetW in swine manure and the macrolide resistance genes ermB and ermF in wastewater were more easily spread than were other ARGs onto soil when the substances were applied as fertilizers. Therefore, effective removal and a standard permissible environmental level of ARGs should be established to control the risk of spreading ARGs in the environment.",Natural ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Plants, due to their sessile nature, should adapt to these challenging genotoxic environmental conditions and develop resistance. Herein, we evaluated the response of three natural ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh (Oasis, Columbia-0, and Chernobyl-07) to cadmium, using discovery gel-based proteomics. These accessions are differing by level of tolerance to heavy metal probably achieved by various exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. Based on the pairwise comparison (control versus cadmium-treated) we recognized 5.8-13.4% of identified proteins as significantly altered at the presence of cadmium. Although the majority of photosynthesis-related proteins were found to be less abundant in all ecotypes it was noted that in contrast to the sensitive variants (Col and Oas), the tolerant Che accession may activate the mechanism preserving photosynthesis and energy production. Also, proteins modulating energy budget through alternative route and mediating higher resistance to heavy metals were upregulated in this ecotype. Although we suggest that regulation of enzymes acting in peptide and protein synthesis, protection of the plants against various abiotic stresses, or those neutralizing the effects of reactive oxygen species are rather associated with general response to cadmium, they were found to be altered more intensively in the Che accession. Thus, the identified affected proteins may represent good candidate molecules for molecular breeding to improve tolerance of crops to heavy metal stress.","Multi-generational exposure to Pb in two monophyletic Daphnia species: Individual, functional and population related endpoints.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769206,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"To better evaluate chemical damage in chronically contaminated habitats, a nine-generational exposure to Lead (Pb) was done with two monophyletic Daphnia species, from temperate (Daphnia magna) and tropical (Daphnia similis) environments. The multi-generational test consisted generally of a continuous Pb exposed set of organisms, plus an extra control set running simultaneously. To assess daphnids recovery after Pb exposure, some organisms from the sixth generation were transferred to clean media for three extra generations (recovery period; F6 to F9), while others were keep Pb exposed. All setups (control, Pb exposure and recovery period) were submitted to two different dietary regimes, the standard (3 × 105 cells/mL) and restricted food (1.5 × 105 cells/mL) regimes. To evaluate the effects of generational Pb exposure and food regimes, individual, functional and population related endpoints were assessed (number of offspring, body length and rate of population increase (r) and feeding rate (FR)). The tests were conducted on the first (F0) and last generations (F9). No differences were shown on number of offspring and feeding among F9 control and continuous Pb exposed D. magna, although a higher r was shown for F9 Pb exposed organisms. F9 Pb exposed D. similis also presented a higher r than F9 control, however, lethality was induced at high Pb exposure levels. At food restriction the patterns were opposite and D. magna died at high Pb exposure while Pb exposed D. similis was the only setup (compared to control and recovery period) to survive at high Pb exposure levels. Regarding the recovery period, D. magna (standard food) did not cope well with the Pb re-exposure and lethality was induced, while D. similis indicate a decreased Pb sensitivity (only setup that survived high Pb exposure levels). Under food restriction, both species presented a decreased Pb sensitivity and consequent failed recovery (possibly due to epigenetic changes). Both species presented similar patterns regarding generations. Organisms from F0 presented enhanced reproductive outputs in comparison to F9 and the contrary occurred to the FR (even in control organisms). Data show an acclimation under a generational Pb exposure, which could increase the population of adapted organisms in natural habitats. And, since there was not a full recovery after three generations in clean media, an indication of epigenetic changes for both species may also be considered.","Cytotoxic evaluation of sodium hypochlorite, using Pisum sativum L as effective bioindicator.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769205,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of different sodium hypochlorite concentrations, using apical root cells of P. sativum as a bioindicator.

Next, root growth was measured during 24, 48 and 72 h. Subsequently, the mitotic index (MI) and cellular anomalies (5000 cells per treatment) were determined at 72 h. According to the results obtained, a decrease in root growth was observed at concentrations of 0.4, 1.6 and 2 mg L-1. Likewise, it was evident that, among all the evaluated concentrations, an inhibition of mitosis higher than 50% was presented. Additionally, chromosomal anomalies were also generated, such as Nuclear notch, lagging chromosomes and Chromosomal break, which were present in all the concentrations evaluated. In addition, the presence of micronuclei at concentrations of 2.0 and 1.6 mg L-1 indicate that sodium hypochlorite is a highly cytotoxic substance. Therefore, P. sativum is a specie that offers a feasible experimental model to be implemented in the laboratory with the aim to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of any cytotoxic substance.",Towards the development of standardised sea turtle primary cell cultures for toxicity testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769204,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"Chemical contaminants are known to accumulate in marine megafauna globally, but little is known about how this impacts animal health. In vitro assays offer an ethical, reproducible and cost-effective alternative to live animal toxicity testing on large, long-lived or threatened species, such as sea turtles. However, using a cell culture from a single animal raise the question of whether the toxicity observed adequately represents the toxicity in that species. This study examined variation in the cytotoxic response of primary skin fibroblasts established from seven green (Chelonia mydas) and five loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles. Cell viability using resazurin dye was examined in response to exposure to five contaminants. The variation in cytotoxicity was generally low (within a factor of five) for both independent analyses of the same cell culture, and cell cultures from different individuals. This low within and between cell culture variation indicates that primary sea turtle cell cultures can provide a suitable approach to understanding toxicity in sea turtles. In addition, green and loggerhead turtle cells showed similar toxicity to the compounds tested, indicating that only subtle differences in chemical sensitivity may exist between sea turtle species. This study provides a framework for using species-specific cell cultures in future toxicological studies on sea turtles. Although in vivo studies are the gold standard for toxicological studies and species-specific risk assessments, the development of in vitro tools can provide important information when in vivo studies are not possible or practical. For large, endangered species such as sea turtles that are exposed to, and accumulate, a large number of contaminants, using validated cell cultures may facilitate the rapid assessment of chemical risk to these animals."
