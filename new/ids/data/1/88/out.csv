Using existing research and innovative tools, two workshops were developed, representing the first formalised approach to health advocacy for medical trainees in Oman. The development and application of the workshops highlighted many unique challenges and opportunities in advocacy training. This article summarises the process of developing and implementing the workshops as well as feedback from the participants and short-term consequences. Furthermore, this article seeks to explore the complexities of designing a cross-cultural curriculum. In particular, it reflects on how the role of health advocate may be perceived differently in various cultural and societal settings.

Variation in statistical characteristics of univariate time series can have a profound effect on characteristics of missing observations and, therefore, the accuracy of different imputation methods. The imputeTestbench package can be used to compare the prediction accuracy of different methods as related to the amount and type of missing data for a user-supplied dataset. Missing data are simulated by removing observations completely at random or in blocks of different sizes depending on characteristics of the data. Several imputation algorithms are included with the package that vary from simple replacement with means to more complex interpolation methods. The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or remove methods as needed. Plotting functions also allow comparative visualization of the behavior and effectiveness of different algorithms. We present example applications that demonstrate how the package can be used to understand differences in prediction accuracy between methods as affected by characteristics of a dataset and the nature of missing data.",Effect of Nutrient Removal and Resource Recovery on Life Cycle Cost and Environmental Impacts of a Small Scale Water Resource Recovery Facility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607262,Sustainability,2019 01 08,"To limit effluent impacts on eutrophication in receiving waterbodies, a small community water resource recovery facility (WRRF) upgraded their conventional activated sludge treatment process for biological nutrient removal, and considered enhanced primary settling and anaerobic digestion (AD) with co-digestion of high strength organic waste (HSOW). The community initiated the resource recovery hub concept with the intention of converting an energy-consuming wastewater treatment plant into a facility that generates energy and nutrients and reuses water. We applied life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment to evaluate the net impact of the potential conversion. The upgraded WRRF reduced eutrophication impacts by 40 percent compared to the legacy system. Other environmental impacts such as global climate change potential (GCCP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) were strongly affected by AD and composting assumptions. The scenario analysis showed that HSOW co-digestion with energy recovery can lead to reductions in GCCP and CED of 7 and 108 percent, respectively, for the upgraded WRRF (high feedstock-base AD performance scenarios) relative to the legacy system. The cost analysis showed that using the full digester capacity and achieving high digester performance can reduce the life cycle cost of WRRF upgrades by 15 percent over a 30-year period."

In the present paper, we focus on pairwise joint-movement behaviour, where individuals move together during at least a segment of their path. We investigate the adequacy of twelve metrics introduced in previous works for assessing joint movement by analysing their theoretical properties and confronting them with contrasting case scenarios. Two criteria are taken into account for review of those metrics: 1) practical use, and 2) dependence on parameters and underlying assumptions. When analysing the similarities between the metrics as defined, we show how some of them can be expressed using general mathematical forms. In addition, we evaluate the ability of each metric to assess specific aspects of joint-movement behaviour: proximity (closeness in space-time) and coordination (synchrony) in direction and speed. We found that some metrics are better suited to assess proximity and others are more sensitive to coordination. To help readers choose metrics, we elaborate a graphical representation of the metrics in the coordination and proximity space based on our results, and give a few examples of proximity and coordination focus in different movement studies.","Heterogeneous global health stock and growth: quantitative evidence from 140 countries, 1990-2100.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607246,Archives of public health = Archives belges de sante publique,2019 01 08,"In the prevailing economic perspective, health is viewed as a type of capital stock that yields 'healthy days' in human society.

Acculturation is speculated to be one of the sociocultural factors contributing to pain sensitivity since cultural beliefs and practices can influence the way patients perceive and respond to pain. However, the relationship of acculturation to pain sensitivity in minority populations remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between acculturation and experimental pain sensitivity in 50 Asian Americans residing in North Central Florida with knee osteoarthritis pain. The Suinn-Lew Asian Self Identity Acculturation Scale was used to assess acculturation, and multimodal quantitative sensory testing was performed to measure experimental sensitivity, including heat pain tolerance, pressure pain threshold, and punctate mechanical pain. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. Participants' mean age was 55.7 years, and about half of this sample were Korean American (56%). The participants had lived in the United States for 21 years on average. Regression analyses indicated that lower acculturation to American culture may contribute to greater experimental pain sensitivity. Asian Americans who were more acculturated to the American culture had higher heat pain tolerance (beta = 0.61, P=0.01), higher pressure pain threshold (beta = 0.59, P=0.02), and lower ratings of punctate mechanical pain (beta = -0.70, P < 0.01). These findings add to the literature regarding sociocultural factors associated with pain in Asian Americans; additional research with a larger and more diverse sample of Asian Americans is warranted for cross-validation.",Biomarkers of food intake for Allium vegetables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607216,Genes & nutrition,2019 01 08,"Allium vegetables are widely consumed around the world and are known for their potential bioactive components improving human health. These effects have been extensively investigated; however, the results were inconsistent in human studies. Biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) could provide objective measurements of food intake in observational studies and assess compliance in intervention studies. Therefore, the discovery and application of BFIs for Allium vegetables would facilitate the exploring and understanding of the health benefit of Allium vegetables. In this manuscript, we reviewed the currently used and potential candidate BFIs for Allium vegetables and evaluated their levels of validation. S-Allylmercapturic acid (ALMA), allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl methyl sulfoxide (AMSO), allyl methyl sulfone (AMSO2), and S-allylcysteine (SAC), which are derived from organosulfur compounds, were shown to be promising candidate BFIs for garlic consumption. Further validation is needed to assess their robustness and concordance with other measures. Their applicability for the whole food group should be evaluated as well. N-Acetyl-S-(2-carboxypropyl)cysteine (CPMA) was detected in high levels in urine after both garlic and onion intake, suggesting that it may be used for the assessment of intake of Allium food group. The available information regarding its kinetics, robustness, and analytical performance is limited and needs to be assessed in further studies. No candidate BFIs specific to intake of onion, leek, chives, shallots, or ramsons were found. Untargeted metabolomics studies and further validation studies should be performed to discover more reliable BFIs for individual Allium vegetables and the whole food group. This paper serves as an example of Biomarker of Food Intake Reviews (BFIRev) and biomarker of food intake validation procedures.",Paediatric orthopaedics through paintings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607214,Journal of children's orthopaedics,2019 01 08,"Some famous artistic representations created throughout the centuries can reveal a hidden or mysterious diagnosis of some diseases and these paintings have always drawn the attention of physicians interested in art.

Here, we devise a methodology based on Markov chain models that allows us to obtain analytic results for the expected rate. First, we analyze the property of the secretory complex obtained by coupling a single granule with one CaV. Then, we extend our results to a more general case where the granule is coupled with n CaVs. We investigate how the exocytosis rate is affected by varying the location of granules and CaVs. Moreover, we assume that the single granule can form complexes with inactivating or non-inactivating CaVs. We find that increasing the number of CaVs coupled with the granule determines a much higher rise of the exocytosis rate that, in case of inactivating CaVs, is more pronounced when the granule is close to CaVs, while, surprisingly, in case of non-inactivating CaVs, the highest relative increase in rate is obtained when the granule is far from the CaVs. Finally, we exploit the devised model to investigate the relation between exocytosis and calcium influx. We find that the quantities are typically linearly related, as observed experimentally. For the case of inactivating CaVs, our simulations show a change of the linear relation due to near-complete inactivation of CaVs.",Diagnostic Value of Contrast-Enhanced Digital Mammography versus Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Preoperative Evaluation of Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607168,Journal of breast cancer,2019 01 08,"This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) in preoperative evaluations, and to evaluate the effect of each modality on the surgical management of women with breast cancer.",Patterns of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Prospective Single-Center Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607167,Journal of breast cancer,2019 01 08,"The recent trend in breast cancer treatment is to minimize axillary dissection.

The freeze-dried EPO-loaded hydrogel were characterized using various methods. Gelation property by rheological analysis, EPO aggregation in formulations by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), protein secondary structure by far ultraviolet-circular dichroism (CD), and the antigenic activity of EPO with ELISA techniques. The healing effects of the freeze-dried formulation was also investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats with chemotherapy-induced mucositis and compared with freshly prepared mixture. Finally, the retention time of the gel in the oral cavity was assessed in healthy volunteers. SDS-PAGE, CD, and ELISA confirmed the stability of conformational structure of loaded and released EPO. Severity of mucositis was markedly reduced in animals treated with freeze-dried EPO hydrogel; whereas the group received normal saline did not show any significant healing. EPO salvia level was decreased rapidly following EPO solution compared to the gel application. Approximately, 40% of EPO was maintained on the buccal areas in patients receiving the hydrogel system after 30 min. Therefore, the TMC/GP could preserve EPO stability after freeze drying and has the potential in the treatment of oral mucositis and other oral or subcutaneous wounds.",Clinical and laboratory features distinguishing between Deinagkistrodon acutus and Daboia siamensis envenomation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607144,The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,2019 04 09,"There are 6 species of venomous snakes in Taiwan.

Natural plant resistance to thrips has become a prominent breeding target in commercial crops. The main reason for this is the shift toward banning key pesticides used for controlling thrips infestations and the lack of effective alternatives. Despite this urgent need for crop plants that are resistant, or tolerant, to thrips infestation, the toolbox for studying genetic resistance to this insect is still underdeveloped. Essentially, there is a lack of robust protocols for the screening and identification of thrips genes relevant to its performance on crop plants. To bridge this gap, we have developed a functional analysis screening method. Our approach relies on the, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated, homogeneous, and transient ectopic expression of thrips genes in large tomato leaf discs followed by the assessment of thrips reproductive performance. The setup is designed to maintain gene expression during the course of the assay, where GFP signal in the control treatment is used as a reporter of expression. The screen is conducted in a climate box under controlled settings. As a result, multiple genes can be screened for their effect on thrips reproductive performance in a single experiment and in a relatively small space, without the need for generating stable transgenic plants. The method also eliminates the need for a greenhouse equipped to accommodate the combination of A. tumefaciens-infiltrations and thrips infestations. It is not only flexible and convenient for screening genes encoding putative thrips effectors but also for plant resistance genes or effector-targets of host plants and can be adapted for other crop plants, or other herbivorous arthropods.",Fast quantitative urinary proteomic profiling workflow for biomarker discovery in kidney cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607141,Clinical proteomics,2019 01 08,"Urine has evolved as a promising body fluids in clinical proteomics because it can be easily and noninvasively obtained and can reflect physiological and pathological status of the human body.

Chemotherapeutic treatment options are limited and require concurrent antiretroviral therapy (art). Here, we report the case of an adult patient with hiv infection and chronic hepatitis E virus (hev) co-infection who had low CD4 T cell recovery after years of art. The patient then developed a cutaneous ec-pel which rapidly regressed after 1 cycle of liposomal doxorubicin (ld) for his Kaposi sarcoma (ks) before treatment with chop chemotherapy. He had previously received numerous cycles of ld for cutaneous ks over 2 years. Because of the patient's low CD4 T cell count, hev co-infection, and earlier unexpected remission of ec-pel before chop, the patient opted for a single trial of ld before other options. Surprisingly, he experienced a complete remission lasting 18 months. Subsequently, his ec-pel relapsed twice at 31 and at 41 months after the initial diagnosis. Upon recurrence, a similar single cycle of ld was given, which again induced remission. The patient today is in complete remission after a total of 4 ld infusions over 54 months.

Therefore, understanding metabolic interdependencies between microbes is critical to deciphering ecosystem function. In this study, we sought to deconstruct metabolic interdependencies in organohalide-respiring consortium ACT-3 containing Dehalobacter restrictus using a combination of metabolic modeling and experimental validation. D. restrictus possesses a complete set of genes for amino acid biosynthesis yet when grown in isolation requires amino acid supplementation. We reconciled this discrepancy using flux balance analysis considering cofactor availability, enzyme promiscuity, and shared protein expression patterns for several D. restrictus strains. Experimentally, 13C incorporation assays, growth assays, and metabolite analysis of D. restrictus strain PER-K23 cultures were performed to validate the model predictions. The model resolved that the amino acid dependency of D. restrictus resulted from restricted NADPH regeneration and predicted that malate supplementation would replenish intracellular NADPH. Interestingly, we observed unexpected export of pyruvate and glutamate in parallel to malate consumption in strain PER-K23 cultures. Further experimental analysis using the ACT-3 transfer cultures suggested the occurrence of an interspecies malate-pyruvate shuttle reconciling a redox imbalance, reminiscent of the mitochondrial malate shunt pathway in eukaryotic cells. Altogether, this study suggests that redox imbalance and metabolic complementarity are important driving forces for metabolite exchange in anaerobic microbial communities.",Evolutionary constraints on species diversity in marine bacterioplankton communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607025,The ISME journal,2019 03 29,"Variation in microbial species diversity has typically been explained as the outcome of local ecological factors driving species coexistence, overlooking the roles of evolutionary constraints. Here, we argue that macro-evolutionary niche conservatism and unequal diversification rates among phylum-level lineages are strong determinants of diversity-environment relationships in bacterial systems. That is, apart from stochasticity, environmental effects operate most strongly on phylum composition, which in turn dictates the species diversity of bacterial communities. This concept is demonstrated using bacterioplankton in the surface seawaters of the East China Sea. Furthermore, we show that the species richness of a local bacterioplankton community can generally be estimated based on the relative abundances of phyla and their contributions of species numbers in the global seawater pool-highlighting the important influence of evolutionary constraints on local community diversity.",Correction: Biallelic sequence and structural variants in RAX2 are a novel cause for autosomal recessive inherited retinal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607024,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2019 04 05,"The original version of this Article contained an incorrect version of Fig. 3, which included two variants initially shown in black text in Fig. 3a that the authors removed from the final manuscript.

During CMA, the HSC70 chaperone carries target proteins endowed with a KFERQ-like motif to the lysosomal receptor LAMP2A, which then translocate them into lysosomes for degradation. In the present study, we scrutinized the mechanisms underlying the response and resistance to Azacytidine (Aza) in MDS/AML cell lines and bone marrow CD34+ blasts from MDS/AML patients. In engineered Aza-resistant MDS cell lines and some AML cell lines, we identified a profound defect in CMA linked to the absence of LAMP2A. LAMP2 deficiency was responsible for Aza resistance and hypersensitivity to lysosome and autophagy inhibitors. Accordingly, gain of function of LAMP2 in deficient cells or loss of function in LAMP2-expressing cells rendered them sensitive or resistant to Aza, respectively. A strict correlation was observed between the absence of LAMP2, resistance to Aza and sensitivity to lysosome inhibitors. Low levels of LAMP2 expression in CD34+ blasts from MDS/AML patients correlated with lack of sensitivity to Aza and were predictive of poor overall survival. We propose that CD34+/LAMP2Low patients at diagnosis or who become CD34+/LAMP2Low during the course of treatment with Aza might benefit from a lysosome inhibitor already used in the clinic.",STIM1 thermosensitivity defines the optimal preference temperature for warm sensation in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607017,Cell research,2019 02 03,"Mammals possess a remarkable ability to sense subtle temperature deviations from the thermoneutral skin temperature of ~33 °C, which ensures precise warm sensation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident transmembrane protein that responds to both ER Ca2+ depletion and heat, mediates temperature-induced Ca2+ influx in skin keratinocytes via coupling to Orai Ca2+ channels in plasma membrane. Behaviorally, the keratinocyte-specific knockout of STIM1 shifts the optimal preference temperature (OPT) of mice from ~32 °C to ~34 °C, resulting in a strikingly reversed preference between 32 °C and 34 °C. Importantly, the thermally inactive STIM1-ΔK knock-in mice show altered OPT and warm preference behaviors as well, demonstrating the requirement of STIM1 thermosensitivity for warm sensation. Furthermore, the wild-type and mutant mice prefer temperatures closer to their respective OPTs, but poorly distinguish temperatures that are equally but oppositely deviated from their OPTs. Mechanistically, keratinocyte STIM1 affects the in vivo warm responses of sensory neurons by likely involving TRPA1 as a downstream transduction channel. Collectively, our data suggest that STIM1 serves as a novel in vivo thermosensor in keratinocytes to define the OPT, which might be utilized as a peripheral reference temperature for precise warm sensation.",Social anhedonia in major depressive disorder: a symptom-specific neuroimaging approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607014,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 05 22,"While research concerning brain structural biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD) is continuously progressing, our state of knowledge regarding biomarkers of specific clinical profiles of MDD is still limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate brain structural correlates of social anhedonia as a cardinal symptom of MDD. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated n = 166 patients with MDD and n = 166 matched healthy controls (HC) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Social anhedonia was assessed using the Chapman Scales for Social Anhedonia (SAS). An anhedonia x group ANCOVA was performed in a region of interest approach of the dorsal and ventral striatum (bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens respectively) as well as on whole-brain level. The analyses revealed a significant main effect for social anhedonia: higher SAS-scores were associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral caudate nucleus in both the MDD-group (pFWE = 0.002) and the HC-group (pFWE = 0.032). The whole-brain analysis confirmed this association (left: pFWE = 0.036, right: pFWE = 0.047). There was no significant main effect of group and no significant anhedonia x group interaction effect. This is the first study providing evidence for volumetric aberrations in the reward system related to social anhedonia independently of diagnosis, depression severity, medication status, and former course of disease. These results support the hypothesis that social anhedonia has a brain biomarker serving as a possible endophenotype of depression and possibly providing an alternative approach for a more precise and effective treatment.",Sequential exo-mode oxacyclizations for the synthesis of the CD substructure of brevenal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607013,The Journal of antibiotics,2019 04 26,"We describe a novel strategy for synthesizing the CD bicyclic ether substructure of the fused polycyclic ether natural product brevenal.

Both the bithermal caloric test and the video head impulse testing showed sever hypofunction of the bilateral semicircular canal. In sum, somatosensory deficit and otoneurologic examinations indicated bilateral vestibulopathy which, together with the patient's and cerebellar impairment, confirmed the diagnosis of CANVAS.",[A case of antisynthetase syndrome with anti-EJ antibody complicated by pericarditis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606993,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,2019 02 15,"A 69-year-old man was admitted with neck muscle weakness, symmetric proximal muscle weakness, skin rash and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Muscle biopsy showed perifascicular necrosis and perimysial alkaline phosphatase activity. Chest CT revealed interstitial lung disease and colorectal cancer was diagnosed on colonoscopy. He was serologically positive for anti-EJ antibody, leading to the diagnosis of antisynthetase syndrome (ASS). After laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum, he received intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (50 mg/d). Although his muscle weakness improved after corticosteroid therapy, he developed pericardial effusion with resultant asymptomatic hypotension and arrhythmia possibly due to pericarditis. Corticosteroid monotherapy was insufficient to control the disease, and, we decided to use oral cyclosporin concurrently. After this combined therapy started, pericardial effusion and arrhythmia were improved. We should keep in mind that pericarditis can occur in patients with anti-EJ antibody-positive ASS, and early combined therapy with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs for ASS may improve the patient's prognosis.",Protective Effects of Alpha-Lipoic Acid on Glutamate-Induced Cytotoxicity in C6 Glioma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606992,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring thiol antioxidant, on glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in cultured C6 astroglial cells. Exposure to high-dose glutamate (10 mM) caused oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction through the elevation of reactive oxygen species, depletion of glutathione, and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Pretreatment with ALA (200 µM), however, significantly inhibited the glutamate-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. ALA pretreatment dose-dependently suppressed glutamate-induced apoptotic events including altered nuclear morphology and activation of caspase-3. In addition, ALA significantly attenuated glutamate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers; namely, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR)-like ER-associated kinase (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and caspase-12. We confirmed that CHOP and caspase-12 are key mediators of glutamate-induced ER stress. Furthermore, exposure of the cells to a caspase-12-specific inhibitor and CHOP small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) led to restoration of the ΔΨm that was damaged by glutamate treatment. These results suggest that ALA can effectively suppress oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER stress in astroglial cells.",Disruption of Gap Junction-Mediated Intercellular Communication in the Spiral Ligament Causes Hearing and Outer Hair Cell Loss in the Cochlea of Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606991,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"It is well-known that outer hair cell (OHC) loss occurs in the cochlea of animal models of permanent hearing loss induced by intense noise exposure. Our earlier studies demonstrated the production of hydroxynonenal and peroxynitrite, as well as the disruption of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication (GJIC), in the cochlear spiral ligament prior to noise-induced sudden hearing loss. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the mechanism underlying cochlear OHC loss after sudden hearing loss induced by intense noise exposure. In organ of Corti explant cultures from mice, no significant OHC loss was observed after in vitro exposure to 4-hydroxynonenal (a product of lipid peroxidation), H2O2, SIN-1 (peroxynitrite generator), and carbenoxolone (a gap junction inhibitor). Interestingly, in vivo intracochlear carbenoxolone injection through the posterior semicircular canal caused marked OHC and hearing loss, as well as the disruption of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication in the cochlear spiral ligament. However, no significant OHC loss was observed in vivo in animals treated with 4-hydroxynonenal and SIN-1. Taken together, our data suggest that disruption of GJIC in the cochlear lateral wall structures is an important cause of cochlear OHC loss in models of hearing loss, including those induced by noise.",Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Can Re-sensitize a Cisplatin-Resistant Human Bladder Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606990,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Cisplatin chemotherapy is the standard treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Although there are second-line chemotherapeutic agents approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as those targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), more effective pharmacotherapy is required for cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer due to its limited overall survival and progression-free survival. The synergistic anti-cancer effect of cisplatin and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (T24R2) was examined. Tumor cell proliferation and cell cycle was examined using the cell counting kit (CCK)-8 assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Synergism was examined using the combination index (CI). CCK-8 assay and CI test were used to observe the strong synergistic anti-cancer effect between SAHA and cisplatin. Activation of caspase mediated apoptosis, down-regulated expression of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and up-regulated expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) were observed in Western blot. SAHA synergistically could partially re-sensitize cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (T24R2) through the cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis pathway. SAHA-based treatment could be a potential treatment regimen in patients with cisplatin resistant bladder cancer.",Urate Transport via Paracellular Route across Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606989,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Urate is the final oxidation product of purine metabolism in humans. We have recently reported that the paracellular route is the major urate transport pathway across the blood-placental barrier. In this study, the mechanism of urate paracellular transport was investigated in several epithelial cell lines including Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) type I, Lilly Laboratories cell-porcine kidney 1 (LLC-PK1) and Caco-2 cells. Very little urate passed through MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell layers. In contrast, one of the Caco-2 cell lines was found to be urate-permeable. This urate paracellular movement across Caco-2 cell layer was not inhibited by the urate transporter inhibitor benzbromarone but was partially inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS), which inhibits chloride transport. Detection and quantification of claudin proteins that are important for paracellular transport of ions were performed by LC/MS. Claudins 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12 were detected in urate-permeable cell lines, BeWo cells and Caco-2 cells. We compared claudin expression patterns in urate-permeable and urate-non-permeable Caco-2 cells by LC/MS and found that claudin 12 had a higher expression level in urate-permeable Caco-2 cells. Overexpression of these claudins in MDCK cells did not increase urate paracellular transport. Although there were differences in claudin expression pattern between urate-permeable and non-permeable cells, increased expression of single claudin alone did not explain paracellular permeability of urate.",4-Hydroxypanduratin A and Isopanduratin A Inhibit Tumor Necrosis Factor α-Stimulated Gene Expression and the Nuclear Factor κB-Dependent Signaling Pathway in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606988,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, regulates inflammatory and immune responses by up-regulating gene expression in a manner that is dependent on the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). In the present study, we found that 4-hydroxypanduratin A and isopanduratin A, constituents of the rhizomes of Boesenbergia pandurata, inhibited the TNF-α-stimulated up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. 4-Hydroxypanduratin A and isopanduratin A also reduced ICAM-1 mRNA expression and NF-κB-responsive luciferase activity in TNF-α-stimulated A549 cells. Moreover, 4-hydroxypanduratin A and isopanduratin A prevented the TNF-α-stimulated translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 to the nucleus and the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of the inhibitor of the NF-κB α protein. The present results revealed that 4-hydroxypanduratin A and isopanduratin A inhibit TNF-α-stimulated gene expression and the NF-κB-dependent signaling pathway in A549 cells.","Acute and Chronic Antihypertensive Effect of Fractions, Tiliroside and Scopoletin from Malva parviflora.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606987,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Hypertension is a disease of high prevalence and morbidity where vascular inflammation and associated oxidative stress (endothelial dysfunction) is the underlying cause of this pathology. We are reporting the antihypertensive activity of extracts and fractions of Malva parviflora in mice with chronic and acute hypertension. Also, the treatments of this plant were able to counteract the kidney inflammation and associated oxidative stress. The chronic hypertension model consisted of administration of angiotensin II (AGII) during 12 weeks, causing a sustained increase in systolic (SBP) or diastolic (DBP) pressure, with values of pharmacological constants of: ED50 = 0.038 mg/kg y Emax = 135 mmHg for SBP and ED50 = 0.046 mg/kg y Emax = 98 mmHg for DBP. The chronic hypertension caused the inflammation and lipid peroxidation in kidneys, measured by of tissue level of cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), IL-10 and malondialdehyde, and treatments for M. parviflora were able to modulate these parameters. The chemical fractionation allowed to identify three compounds: oleanolic acid, tiliroside and scopoletin, which were tested in a model of acute hypertension. The pharmacodynamic parameters for SBP were ED50 = 0.01 and 0.12 mg/kg while Emax = 33.22 and 37.74 mmHg for scopoletin and tiliroside, respectively; whereas that for DBP data were ED50 = 0.01 and 0.02 mg/kg; with an Emax = 7.00 and 6.24 mmHg, in the same order. M. parviflora, is able to counteract the effect of chronic and acute administration of AGII, on hypertension, but also the inflammatory and oxidative damage in the kidney. The oleanolic acid, scopoletin and tiliroside are the compounds responsible for such activities.",Enhancement Effect of Poly-L-ornithine on the Nasal Absorption of Water-Soluble Macromolecules in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606986,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"The transnasal route for the delivery of water-soluble macromolecules, such as bioactive peptides and proteins, has attracted interest, although the use of permeation enhancers is required due to the poor permeabilities of these macromolecules across the nasal mucosa. With polycationic compounds, such as poly-L-arginine and chitosan, the nasal absorption of hydrophilic macromolecules is molecular weight- and concentration-dependently enhanced without causing cytotoxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of various molecular weights and concentrations of poly-L-ornithine (PLO), a polycationic compound, on the nasal absorption and the damage to the nasal mucosa in vivo. PLO enhanced the nasal absorption of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4), used as a model drug, and the bioavailability of FD-4 increased with the concentration of PLO. The enhancement effect was also dependent on the molecular weight. The administration of PLO at a concentration that sufficed for enhancing the nasal absorption had no effect on the activity of lactic dehydrogenase and the protein leakage in the nasal fluid, as indices of nasal mucosa damage. These findings suggest that a transnasal delivery system using PLO is a useful strategy for improving the nasal absorption of water-soluble macromolecules without toxicity to the nasal mucosa.",Norgalanthamine Stimulates Proliferation of Dermal Papilla Cells via Anagen-Activating Signaling Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606985,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 04 15,"Norgalanthamine has been shown to possess hair-growth promoting effects, including increase in hair-fiber length in cultured rat vibrissa follicles and increase in dermal papilla cell (DPC) proliferation. However, the intracellular mechanisms that underlie the action of norgalanthamine in DPCs have not been investigated. In this study, we addressed the ability of norgalanthamine to trigger anagen-activating signaling pathways in DPCs. Norgalanthamine significantly increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation at 0.1 µM, a concentration at which DPC proliferation was also induced. Furthermore, the increases in norgalanthamine-induced ERK 1/2 activation and subsequent DPC proliferation were suppressed by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor, U0126. A 0.1 µM dose of norgalanthamine also increased phosphorylation of AKT, which was followed by an increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In addition, LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, blocked the effect of norgalanthamine on DPC proliferation. These results suggest that norgalanthamine can stimulate the anagen phase of the hair cycle in DPCs via activation of the ERK 1/2, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways."

The antiradical activity of roasted oils was higher than that of unroasted oils, and the activity of methanol-water extracts from the roasted egoma oils was significantly higher than that of unroasted oils. The antiradical activity of the methanol-water fractions was strongly correlated to that of whole oils (r=0.72) and the color depth of oils (r=0.93), which was an index of roasting. Fractionation of the methanol-water extract of a roasted egoma oil according to molecular size using ultra membrane filters revealed that the fraction under 3 kDa had the strongest radical scavenging activity. Subsequent preparative HPLC separation using an ODS column also revealed that the second fraction was the most active. Our HPLC analytical method for DPPH radical scavengers in complex mixtures detected four strong radical scavenger peaks in the fraction. Among the detected peaks, two peaks were determined to be derived from rosmarinic acid and luteolin by comparison with the retention times and UV spectra of the authentic samples, and the other two compounds could not be identified because no characteristic UV spectra were observed. These identified polyphenols (rosmarinic acid and luteolin) have been reported to be present in the non-oily part of egoma seeds. They probably migrated to the oily part during the egoma oil roasting process.",The Association between Dietary Vitamin C/E and Gestational Hypertensive Disorder: A Case-Control Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606968,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"A case-control study of 10,228 gestational women was conducted in Lanzhou, China, between 2010 and 2012. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the risk of gestational hypertensive disorders and dietary intake of vitamin C/E. Among this study's participants, 5.41% (n=553) were diagnosed with gestational hypertensive disorders. Of these disorders, 69.44% (n=384) were preeclampsia and 30.56% (n=169) were considered to be gestational hypertension. After adjustment for confounding variables and other relevant dietary nutrients, no association was found between the risk of gestational hypertensive disorders and dietary intake of vitamin C, vitamin E, copper or manganese before or during pregnancy. However, zinc and selenium intake was associated with the decrease risk of gestational hypertensive disease during different stages of pregnancy (p<0.05). Gestational dietary intake of zinc and selenium can significantly decrease the risk of gestational hypertensive disorders. No association was found between gestational hypertensive disorders and vitamin C, vitamin E, copper or manganese intake.",Prevalence of Sarcopenia and Its Relationship with Nutritional State and Quality of Life in Patients with Digestive Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606967,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of sarcopenia, which is characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, and its relationship with nutritional state and quality of life (QOL) in patients with digestive diseases. This study enrolled 303 patients (187 men and 116 women with a median age of 70 y) having digestive diseases. Diseases were gastrointestinal in 99 patients, biliary/pancreatic in 93, and hepatic in 111. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by abdominal computed tomography at the 3rd vertebra (L3) level. Sarcopenia was defined using the L3 skeletal muscle index and hand grip strength. Nutritional state was assessed by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini nutritional Assessment®-Short Form (MNA®-SF), anthropometry, and blood biochemistry. QOL was evaluated by Short Form-8TM. Prevalence of sarcopenia was 32.0% in overall cases. The value was 22.2% in gastrointestinal disease, 36.6% in biliary/pancreatic disease, and 36.9% in hepatic disease. Advanced age, male sex, and advanced cancer state were associated with development of sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse nutritional state according to SGA and MNA®-SF than those without sarcopenia. In anthropometry, % arm muscle area, % calf circumference, and body mass index were significantly lower in the sarcopenic group. Serum albumin and hemoglobin were also significantly lower in the sarcopenia patients. QOL was more impaired in physical component subscales in sarcopenia patients than non-sarcopenia ones. Patients with digestive diseases frequently suffer from sarcopenia and this is associated with worsening of nutritional state and QOL in these patients.",Association of Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels with Colorectal Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606966,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"A higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration benefits colorectal cancer prevention. However, whether it can improve the prognosis among patients is still under discussion. This study aims to explore the impacts of high level 25(OH)D on the survival of colorectal cancer patients. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched from January 2000 to August 2017 for relevant articles. Only published studies focusing on the relationship between 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis and survival were considered. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor. Eleven studies comprising 7,367 patients were included. In these studies, there were considerable differences between the higher 25(OH)D level group and the lower group in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and colorectal cancer-specific survival (CSS) in a random effect model (OS: HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.80, p<0.00001; CSS: HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97, p=0.03; PFS: HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.90, p=0.003). Moreover, the combined hazard ratios of OS and CSS had considerably significant heterogeneity which may be explained by subgroup analysis. The relationship between 25(OH)D and tumor characteristics/lifestyle factors was also included in the meta-analysis. BMI (p=0.03), smoking (p=0.03) and physical activity (p=0.002) seemed to be associated with circulating 25(OH)D level. Publication bias was undetected. Colorectal cancer patients with higher circulating 25(OH)D level may have a better prognosis.",Relationship between Food-Intake Trends and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate in Elderly Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606965,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"The aim of this study is to investigate how vegetable and fruit intake trends affect the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by analyzing therapeutic diet status in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The study included 59 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age: 70.1±7.8 y) who had previously received therapeutic education for type 2 diabetes mellitus from a clinical team and were subsequently receiving outpatient treatment. Blood examination data were retrospectively collected from medical records and diet status was investigated using a simplified self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns were extracted using principal component analysis, and the relationships with each blood examination data were investigated. Linear regression analysis was then used to examine the intake food groups related to eGFR. Energy intake was 27±9 kcal/kg. Overall, these results were in line with the Guidelines for the Treatment of Diabetes in Japan 2016. As a result of principal component analysis, seven dietary patterns were extracted, and the cumulative contribution ratio of the seven components was 74.0%. Among the dietary patterns, the 6th factor (positive weighting with fruit) for eGFR was a negative prognostic factor (p=0.010). Analysis of food group intake and eGFR indicated that green and yellow vegetables were positive prognostic factors, whereas fruits were negative prognostic factors (both p<0.05). The dietary patterns dependent on green and yellow vegetables and fruit intake appeared to influence eGFR positively and negatively, respectively.","A Suitable Diet for Recovery from Starvation Is a High-Fat Diet, but Not a High-Protein Diet, in Rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606964,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"The present study aims to determine the most suitable dietary balance of energy-producing nutrients for recovery from starvation. Rats were fed their standard high- carbohydrate diet (HCD, carbohydrate energy : protein energy : fat energy=71 : 18 : 11) for 7 d and then deprived of food for 3 d (short-term starvation) or 8 d (long-term starvation). The starved rats were then fed the HCD, a high-protein diet (HPD, 31 : 57 : 12), or a high-fat diet (HFD, 34 : 14 : 52) for 8 d. Rats had ad libitum access to drinking water throughout the experimental period, including the starvation period. The reference group was allowed free access to the HCD throughout the experimental period. Characteristically, increased drinking, increased urea nitrogen in the plasma and urine, and hypertrophy of the kidneys, were observed in the HPD group. Furthermore, the recovery of plasma glucose level was insufficient in this group. Therefore, administration of a HPD was contraindicated in recovery from starvation. The recovery of body weight after starvation was excellent in the HFD group. No effect on the metabolism of B-group vitamins involved in energy metabolism was found with the administration of any diet. The effects of HCD and HFD administration on recovery from starvation were investigated in further detail. No adverse effects were observed on the tissue to body weight mass ratios or biochemical parameters in blood in the HFD group. From the above findings, it is hypothesized that a HFD is most suitable for quickly reversing the influence of starvation.",Dietary Intake of Ascorbic Acid Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sepsis and Septic Inflammation in ODS Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606963,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"The aim of this study was to verify the protective effects of ascorbic acid (AsA) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. The study was conducted using osteogenic disorder Shionogi (ODS) rats, which are unable to synthesize AsA. Male ODS rats (6 wk old) were fed either an AsA-free diet (AsA-deficient group), a diet supplemented with 300 mg/kg AsA (control group), or a diet supplemented with 3,000 mg/kg AsA (high-AsA group) for 8 d. On day 8, all the rats were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (15 mg/kg body weight). Forty-eight hours after the injection, the survival rates of the rats in the control (39%) and the high-AsA (61%) groups were significantly higher than that in the AsA-deficient group (5.5%). Next, we measured several inflammatory parameters during 10 h after administering LPS. At 6 h, elevated serum levels of markers for hepatic and systemic injuries were suppressed in rats fed AsA. Similarly, 10 h after LPS injection, the elevation in the serum levels of markers for renal injury were also suppressed proportionally to the amount of AsA in the diet. The elevated serum concentrations of TNFα and IL-1β by LPS in the AsA-deficient group decreased in groups fed AsA. Hematic TNFα mRNA levels at 6 h after the LPS injection were also lowered by feeding AsA. These results demonstrated that the dietary intake of AsA improved the survival rates and suppressed the inflammatory damage, in a dose-dependent manner, caused during sepsis induced by LPS in ODS rats.",γ-Tocopherol Is Metabolized Faster than α-Tocopherol in Young Japanese Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606962,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"To elucidate the characteristics of γ-tocopherol metabolism, serum concentrations of α- and γ-tocopherol, and urinary excretion of their metabolites after ingestion of α- or γ-tocopherol, major isoforms in our diet, were compared. Six healthy Japanese women (age 22.7±1.7 y old, BMI 21.4±0.9) ingested 134 mg of α- or γ-tocopherol, and blood and urine were collected until 72 h later. After α-tocopherol intake, the serum concentration of α-tocopherol increased at 12-24 h, and urinary excretion of 2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2(2'-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (α-CEHC), an α-tocopherol metabolite, increased at 12-36 h. However, after γ-tocopherol intake, the serum concentration of γ-tocopherol increased at 6-12 h, and excretion of 2,7,8-trimethyl-2(2'-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (γ-CEHC), a γ-tocopherol metabolite, increased at 3-12 h. The area under the curve from 0 to 72 h and serum maximal concentration of γ-tocopherol were lower than those of α-tocopherol. The time to maximal concentration of γ-tocopherol was faster than that of α-tocopherol. The ratio of urinary excretion of carboxyethyl-hydroxychroman to tocopherol intake was 2.9% for α-CEHC and 7.7% for γ-CEHC. These results revealed that γ-tocopherol is metabolized faster than α-tocopherol in healthy young women.",Tissue Distribution of Menaquinone-7 and the Effect of α-Tocopherol Intake on Menaquinone-7 Concentration in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606961,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"We have reported that vitamin E intake lowers phylloquinone (PK) concentration in extrahepatic tissues of rats. In this study, we aimed to clarify the characteristic of the distribution of menaquinone-7 (MK-7), a vitamin K contained in fermented foods, by comparison with other vitamin K distributions and to clarify the effect of vitamin E intake on MK-7 concentration in rats. Rats were fed a vitamin K-free diet (Free group), a diet containing 0.75 mg PK/kg (PK group), a 0.74 mg menaquinone-4 (MK-4)/kg diet (MK-4 group), a 1.08 mg MK-7/kg diet (MK-7 group), or a 0.29 mg menadione (MD)/kg diet (MD group) for 16 wk. MK-7 mainly accumulated in the liver, spleen, and adrenal gland of the MK-7 group, although PK accumulated in the serum and all tissues of the PK group. Conversely, MK-4 was present in all tissues of the PK, MK-4, MK-7, and MD groups. MK-4 concentration in the serum, liver, adipose tissue, and spleen was higher in the MK-4 group than in the other groups; however, MK-4 concentration in the kidney, testis, tibia, and brain was lower in the MK-4 group than in the PK, MK-7, and MD groups. Next, vitamin E- and K-deficient rats were orally administered MK-7 with or without α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol did not affect MK-7 or MK-4 concentration in the serum and various tissues. These results suggested that MK-7 is particularly liable to accumulate in the liver, and MK-7 concentration is not affected by vitamin E intake.",25-Hydroxyvitamin D Is Associated with Kidney Function: The Dong-gu Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606960,Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2019 04 08,"Although the kidneys play a leading part in the biosynthesis of vitamin D, there is no consensus regarding the relationship of the vitamin D concentration with kidney function.

This study consisted of 9,166 people who participated in a basic survey of the Dong-gu Study. Following an overnight fast, the blood and urine sample were assessed. The serum 25(OH)D, eGFR, ACR of each subject were measured. When adjusting for covariates and log-transformed ACR (Model III), the lower eGFR value was significantly associated with increasing 25(OH)D levels (<10.0: 71.5[70.5-72.4]; 10.0-14.9: 70.0 [69.5-70.4]; 15.0-19.9: 68.7 [68.3-69.2]; ≥20.0: 67.4 [66.8-67.9] mL/min/1.73 m2, p<0.001). When adjusted for the same covariates and log-transformed eGFR (Model III), the lower ACR value was significantly associated with increasing 25(OH)D levels (<10.0: 57.4 [48.0-66.9]; 10.0-14.9: 40.8 [36.5-45.2]; 15.0-19.9: 34.0 [29.5-38.5]; ≥20.0: 34.3 [28.8-39.8] μg/mg creatinine, p<0.001). In conclusion, the mean values of eGFR were significantly decreased with increasing 25(OH)D levels independent of ACR. In additon, the mean values of ACR were significantly decreased with increasing 25(OH)D levels independent of eGFR in participants aged ≥50 y in Korea."

Total syntheses of polycyclic ether marine toxins, viz. hemibrevetoxin B, gambierol, and gymnocin-A, were achieved based on the oxiranyl anion strategy developed.",Preoperative imaging findings as predictors of postoperative inferior alveolar nerve injury following mandibular cyst surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606945,Journal of oral science,2019 04 05,"The purpose of the present study was to predict inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) exposure and associated neurosensory deficits after mandibular cyst surgery based on imaging findings. The study includes 193 sites in 184 consecutive patients who underwent enucleation of cystic lesions around a mandibular third molar (MM3) and extraction of the associated MM3. Absence/presence of white lines on panoramic radiographs (PR) and absence/presence of cortication surrounding the mandibular canal on computed tomography (CT) are evaluated as predictor variables. Outcome variables are operative IAN exposure and postoperative lower lip and/or chin dysesthesia. There is a significant correlation between interruption of white lines and loss of cortication. The predictor variables are statistically associated with IAN exposure and dysesthesia. Positive predictive values of CT findings (loss of cortication) for each outcome variable are slightly higher than those of PR findings (interruption of white lines). When considering the variables, type IV, with interruption of white lines and loss of cortication, shows a statistically significant difference compared to the other groups. White lines on PR images and cortication status of the mandibular canal on CT images predict operative IAN exposure and postoperative dysesthesia in mandibular cyst surgery.",Controversies in the 2017 ACC/AHA Hypertension Guidelines: Who Can Be Eligible for Treatments Under the New Guidelines?　- An Asian Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606943,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2019 02 25,"Until the 2017 ACC/AHA Hypertension Guidelines were released, the target blood pressure (BP) for adults with hypertension (HTN) was 140/90 mmHg in most of the guidelines. The new 2018 ESC/ESH, Canadian, Korean, Japan, and Latin American hypertension guidelines have maintained the <140/90 mmHg for the primary target in the general population and encourage reduction to <130/80 if higher risk. This is more in keeping with the 2018 American Diabetes Association guidelines. However, the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines classify HTN as BP ≥130/80 mmHg and generally recommend target BP levels below 130/80 mmHg for hypertensive patients independently of comorbid disease or age. Although the new guidelines mean that more people (nearly 50% of adults) will be diagnosed with HTN, the cornerstone of therapy is still lifestyle management unless BP cannot be lowered to this level; thus, more people will require BP-lowering medications. To date, there have been many controversies about the definition of HTN and the target BP. Targeting an intensive systolic BP goal can increase the adverse effects of multiple medications and the cardiovascular disease risk by excessively lowering diastolic BP, especially in patients with high risk, including those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and coronary artery disease, and the elderly. In this review, we discuss these issues, particularly regarding the optimal target BP.",Ivabradine for the Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606942,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2019 01 28,"Higher heart rate (HR) is independently related to worse outcomes in various cardiac diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure (HF). HR is determined by the pacemaker activity of cells within the sinoatrial node. The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 4 channel, one of 4 HCN isoforms, generates the If current and plays an important role in the regulation of pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. Ivabradine is a novel and only available HCN inhibitor, which can reduce HR and has been approved for stable angina and chronic HF in many countries other than Japan. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the HCN4 channel and ivabradine, including the function of HCN4 in cardiac pacemaking, the mechanism of action of If inhibition by ivabradine, and the pharmacological and clinical effects of ivabradine in cardiac diseases as HF, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.",Incremental Prognostic Value of Platelet Count in Patients With Acute Heart Failure　- A Retrospective Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606941,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2019 02 25,"Acute heart failure (AHF) triggers platelet aggregation and platelet markers are associated with the severity of AHF. The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of platelet count (PLT) in patients with AHF. Methods and Results: This single-center retrospective observational study analyzed 425 consecutive patients with AHF. The patients were divided into groups based on tertiles of PLT: low (PLT1 <170,000/μL), intermediate (170,000/μL≤PLT<230,000/μL), and high (PLT3 ≥230,000/μL). The endpoint was all-cause death with a composite endpoint of all-cause death and HF rehospitalization. Survival analysis was performed, and Cox proportional hazard models adjusted by an established risk score (Get With The Guidelines score) were generated. The PLT1 group had the worst survival for all-cause death (log-rank, P=0.003) and the composite endpoint (P=0.009). A significant trend of increasing survival was observed for all-cause death (log-rank trend, P<0.001) and the composite endpoint (P=0.002) in the following order: PLT1, PLT2, and PLT3.

Methods and Results: In this prospective, observational study, the quality of chest compressions performed by a simulated actor in a video was visually assessed by certified instructors. The film consisted of 14 case scenarios, each including a combination of depth (2 patterns: adequate, 5-6 cm; and inadequate, <5 cm) and rate (7 categories: compressions 90-150 times/min in increments of 10 times/min). The participants evaluated whether the compression depth was adequate, deep, or inadequate; and whether the compression rate was appropriate, fast, or slow. Of 198 instructors, 56% of participants misidentified adequate depth as deep at a chest compression rate of 120/min (the tendency toward this response increased as chest compression rate increased), and 64.1% of participants incorrectly determined 130/min to be appropriate. On generalized linear mixed-effects model analysis, perceived chest compression depth and rate were significant factors for a correct response (P<0.01, both). A significant interaction between chest compression depth and rate was observed (P<0.01).",Protective effects of sulforaphane on diabetic retinopathy: activation of the Nrf2 pathway and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606939,Experimental animals,2019 05 16,"Sulforaphane (SFN) is abundant in cruciferous plants, providing significant protection against many chronic diseases. With the aim of clarifying the efficacy of sulforaphane in diabetic retinopathy (DR), a series of systematic studies were carried out in the present study. Male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg), and those with confirmed diabetes mellitus were given different doses of SFN (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/d) for 12 weeks. In vitro, Müller cells exposed to 25 mM glucose were treated with 2.5 µM SFN. The results indicated that SFN significantly reduced the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes (GSH, SOD, and CAT) in the retina of STZ rats. Further, SFN enhanced the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and increased the expression of HO-1 and NQO1, two major antioxidants downstream to Nrf2, in the injured retina. In addition, retinal expression levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 p20, IL-1β p17, and ASC were dramatically increased in STZ-induced DR, and this was abolished by SFN intervention. In vitro, high glucose-induced inflammation and oxidative stress damage in Müller cells were attenuated by SFN. SFN also exerted antioxidant effects, activated the Nrf2 pathway, and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in Müller cells. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that SFN attenuates retinal inflammation and oxidative stress induced by high glucose and activates the antioxidative Nrf2 pathway and inhibits the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo and in vitro.",Successful Treatment of Lung Adenocarcinoma with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Compound Mutations Involving Exon 19 Deletion and Exon 20 Insertion by Afatinib.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606938,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 02 15,"A 70-year-old woman was referred to our hospital after a nodular shadow was noted on chest X-ray.

The major focus points of the re-structured training program were ""inclusion of basic communication skills"", ""exemplifying correspondence involving CBT-A using pre-recorded video(VTR)"", and ""approach methods for cases where counter-evidence is unavailable"". The training program lasted for 4 h per day, for a total of 8 h. We also performed role-play scenarios on information gathering and medication guidance for simulated patients before and after training, and evaluated patient satisfaction with counseling, patient counseling alliance scores, and the degrees of the psychological distance between patients and pharmacists. Participants had high satisfaction with the discussion and role-play aspects of the training, as in our previous study. Participants also showed high satisfaction with ""exemplifying correspondence involving CBT-A using VTR"". Counseling time was significantly longer when using CBT-A compared to ordinary information gathering and medication guidance, but patient satisfaction and patient counseling alliance scores were both higher, and the psychological distance between patient and pharmacist was lower. Accordingly, if patients cannot solve their own problems, even when pharmacists provide polite responses and expertise, patients can be guided in their problem solving using CBT-A. It suggested that using CBT-A could solve the problem of patients with anxiety due to problems that cannot be solved only via drug-centered approach."

Currently, by using the BTM, it has become possible to evaluate and select an effective treatment for osteoporosis. The BTM has become widely used as a clinical test item in actual clinical practice. Patients' low adherence to osteoporosis medication regimens increases the risk of vulnerable fractures and affects the cost effectiveness of therapeutics. A joint working group has been established, with International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) and International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) in a central role. The joint policy document of the joint working group is intended to increase the international application of BTM in clinical medicine, and to eliminate blood type I procollagen-N-propeptide (P1NP) and type I collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX) in observational research and intervention studies, in order to eliminate the inherent uncertainty of these measurements in clinical use. Current osteoporotic drug treatment has been proven to prevent bone fractures, but poor adherence to dosage regimens is an ongoing problem in clinical practice; various attempts have been made to improve adherence. Low adherence to an osteoporosis medication regimen increases the risk of fracture, and affects cost effectiveness. The BTM is an effective indicator in monitoring reactivity to osteoporosis drug therapy, and can be used to individually evaluate guidelines for treatment continuity and medication. In addition, providing BTM information to patients has reportedly improved their adherence to therapeutics, thereby potentially improving both the outcome and cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis drug therapy.",[A Novel Oral Anti-osteoporosis Drug with Osteogenesis-promoting Effects via Osteoblast Differentiation].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606923,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 05 28,"Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone fractures (e.g., the femur), reduces a person's activities of daily living (ADL) and increases the likelihood of being bedridden. Therapeutic drugs for osteoporosis include oral bisphosphonates and intravenous receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) antibodies, both of which suppress osteoclast activity, as well as the subcutaneously administered recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH), which activates osteoblasts. However, there is currently no oral osteogenesis-promoting drug. In the present study, we found a low-molecular-weight compound, KY-273, with osteogenesis promoting effects. KY-273 induced osteoblast differentiation in ST2 cells and in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells at a dose of 0.1 μM. On the other hand, KY-273 did not clearly exert differentiation effects in osteoclasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, or myoblasts. In ovariectomized rats, KY-273 clearly increased serum bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) by at a dose of 3 mg/kg for 8 weeks, and increased both the cortical bone volume and medullary volume of the diaphyseal and epiphyseal regions of femoral bone, but did not affect trabecular bone. Although alendronate (used to decrease bone loss) increased trabecular bone, it did not have any significant effects on cortical bone. PTH increased epiphysis cortical and trabecular bone volume, and reduced medullary volume. KY-273 also displayed good oral absorption in rats. In conclusion, KY-273 is a promising candidate for use as an oral anti-osteoporosis drug with osteogenesis promoting effects.",[Transcription Regulators and Bone Metabolism].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606922,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"Although the transcriptional modulator interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (Ifrd1) has been identified as a transcriptional coactivator/repressor in various cells, including bone-resorbing osteoclasts, no attention has been paid to its role in bone-forming osteoblasts. Therefore, in this study we show that Ifrd1 is a critical mediator of both osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis through its expression in osteoblasts. Ifrd1 deficiency enhanced both osteoblast differentiation and maturation, and increased the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 and Osterix. A coculture experiment revealed that Ifrd1 deficient osteoblasts have higher osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression and less ability to support osteoclastogenesis. These findings suggest that Ifrd1 plays a pivotal role in bone homeostasis through its expression in osteoblasts, and represents a therapeutic target for bone disease.",[Evaluation of the Cytotoxicity of Commercially Available Nail Adhesives].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606921,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"Nail tips are nail art materials that can be attached to the nail with adhesives. Recently, nail/finger injuries related to nail tips have been reported and one of the causes is considered to be the adhesives used for attaching nail tips. The components of nail adhesives are mostly cyanoacrylate, which is also used as an industrial instant adhesive. During curing, cyanoacrylate adhesives release formaldehyde through hydrolysis. When it is marketed as a nail adhesive, there is no regulation regarding its formaldehyde amount nor obligation to indicate its ingredients in Japan. Additionally, a biological safety test is not required for nail adhesives. Thus, because the safety of nail adhesives is inadequately confirmed, it is necessary to investigate their biological safety. Therefore, we purchased 5 commercially available nail adhesives and 1 medical adhesive and examined their formaldehyde content and cytotoxicity. We examined the cytotoxicity of the adhesives in V79 cells by a colony forming assay. In this test, 5 nail adhesives showed higher toxicity than 1 medical adhesive. Formaldehyde concentrations in the extract of adhesives were as follows: 17.5 to 24.2 μg/mL for nail adhesives and 7.4 μg/mL for medical adhesives. Cyanoacetate did not elicit cytotoxicity at the final concentration up to 1000 μM. However, formaldehyde showed cytotoxicity, with an IC50 of 79 μM (2.4 μg/mL). Taken together, the cytotoxicity of nail adhesives could be due to the formaldehyde generated by the hydrolysis of cyanoacrylate. It seems important that nail adhesives will be regulated by obligation and enhanced safety in the future.",Safety of 90Y-ibritumomab Tiuxetan Treatment for Japanese Patients in Real-world Clinical Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606920,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"When undergoing 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (90Y-IT) treatment, patients are discharged from hospital soon after initiation of treatment and followed up as outpatients. Thus it is important to apprise patients of the safety information regarding 90Y-IT treatment. However, studies investigating the safety of 90Y-IT in real-world clinical practice are lacking. We sought to investigate the adverse events arising from 90Y-IT administration to patients in our hospital. Patients who received 90Y-IT treatment at Hiroshima University Hospital from April 2010 to December 2014 were eligible for this study. The medical records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. Eleven patients (median age, 65 years) were enrolled. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the number of prior regimens: 1, 2-3, or >3, consisting of 5, 4, and 2 patients, respectively. The number of patients with induced grade 3 and 4 hematotoxicity, respectively, was 5 and 0 for leukocytopenia, 3 and 2 for neutropenia, and 3 and 2 for thrombocytopenia. The median nadir time was 37 d for leukocytopenia, 37 d for neutropenia, 36 d for thrombocytopenia, and 43 d for anemia. Patients with 2 or more prior regimens tended to experience grade 3 or 4 hematotoxicity more frequently than those with 1 prior regimen. In conclusion, we showed that hematotoxicity is a major adverse event of 90Y-IT treatment and that the nadir time is later than that with conventional anticancer agents. Medical staff, including pharmacists, should direct attention to the initial symptoms of hematotoxicity, especially in those patients who have received several prior regimens.",[Effect of Methylcellulose (Cellulose Derivatives) on Ibuprofen-crushing Efficiency in Nano Pulverizer NP-100].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606918,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"It is expected that drug systems using nanoparticles will improve the problem of poor water solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic drugs. However, it is difficult to prepare the formulations containing nanoparticles, and it is important to determine the concentration and kind of additives to prepare the formulations. We previously reported that a nano pulverizer NP-100 is possible to prepare drug nanoparticles for the 2-3 min, and the cellulose derivatives (metolose®, methylcellulose) is usefulness to prepare the nanoparticles by the mill method. In this study, we investigated the relationships of methylcellulose type and crushing efficiency in NP-100. First, we demonstrated the effect of viscosity in the various methylcellulose on the ibuprofen (IBU, lipophilic drug) particle size, and showed that the viscosity did not relate the crushing efficiency by the NP-100. Next, we measured the changes of cumulative size frequency curve in IBU particles by the combination of the NP-100 and 0.1-2.0% methylcellulose (SM-4, 400 and 4000). The appropriate addition reached IBU nanoparticles, although, the appropriate addition amount of methylcellulose was different in the SM-4 (0.5%), 400 (1.0%) and 4000 (1.2%). In addition, the IBU became meringue-like when subjected to the bead mill method in the less of methylcellulose, and excessive addition of methylcellulose increased the ratio of coarse particle. In conclusion, this results show that the appropriate addition amount of methylcellulose is different in the type of methylcellulose, and these changes of cumulative size frequency curve is useful as index to determine the concentration and type of additives in the nanoparticle production.",[Association between Elimination Half-life of Benzodiazepines and Falls in the Elderly: A Meta-analysis of Observational Studies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606917,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDRAs) have been associated with an increased risk of falls in the elderly. However, the association between the elimination half-life (t1/2) of BZDRAs and the difference between benzodiazepines (BZDs) and non-benzodiazepines (Z-drugs) has not been clarified. By conducting a meta-analysis of observational studies, we compared the risk of falls with respect to 1) short-acting BZDRAs (t1/2<12 h) vs. long-acting BZDRAs (t1/2≥12 h) and 2) BZDs vs. Z-drugs in elderly patients. Data were retrieved from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi. In total, 13 observational studies from 12 articles were included in our study (short-acting BZDRAs, n=12; long-acting BZDRAs, n=9; BZDs, n=13; Z-drugs, n=7). The risk of falls was significantly increased by the use of short-acting BZDRAs [Odds ratio (OR) (95% Confidence interval (CI)): 2.00 (1.46-2.73)], long-acting BZDRAs [OR (95%CI): 2.16 (1.61-2.89)], BZDs [OR (95%CI): 1.67 (1.31-2.13)], and Z-drugs [OR (95%CI): 2.42 (1.35-4.34)] compared to the risk in BZDRAs non-users. The increased risk of falls in elderly patients was similar in each group and unrelated to t1/2.

The oxidation peak at around +0.35 V for EGCG is assigned to a pyrogallol group in the gallate ring. Current changes of those individual polyphenols at the peak potential are proportional to their concentrations (linear range 0.28 - 94 μM; detection limit 0.11 μM). The CV curve for real black tea, which is mainly composed of a mixture of the mentioned five compounds, is produced by the sum of those. The current change of the mixture solution of polyphenols is also proportional to the mass concentration of the total polyphenols and the sensitivity defined as the slope of current vs. concentration plot is independent of the ratio of the individual polyphenols. This indicates that the peak current at around +0.35 V can quantify the total amount of polyphenols in a black tea. Additionally, the shape of the CV curve can roughly estimate the ratio of [catechins]/[theaflavins]. The values for real samples determined from CVs show good agreement with that obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography.",Rapid Detection of the Bursaphelenchus Xylophilus by Denaturation Bubble-mediated Strand Exchange Amplification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606901,Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,2019 04 11,"Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (B. xylophilus) is one of the most important causal agents of infectious diseases in forest pathology. Obviously, the rapid detection of B. xylophilus is an urgent need for its prevention and cure. We have developed a detection method of B. xylophilus by strand exchange amplification (SEA). This method could detect 105 copies of genomic DNA of B. xylophilus, and it was sufficiently sensitive to detect a single nematode as short as 40 min. Moreover, because the amplification result could be visualized by the naked eyes, the only equipment required throughout the process was a simple isothermal block. Therefore, our method would be a potential for developing on-site detection of B. xylophilus to prevent and control its spread.",Determination of Barium Isotopic Ratios in River Water on the Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606900,Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,2019 05 13,"Barium (Ba) isotopes have been booming while providing ubiquitous traceability to various geochemical/oceanographical processes in recent years. Accurate and precise determinations of Ba isotopes is the main precondition to apply them to tracing various processes. However, a particular determination method is lacking for Ba isotopic ratios in river water. Compared to the double-spike method which needs expensive spikes, intensive laboratory operation, and complex calibration, sample-standard bracketing (SSB) is an easier and more convenient method to obtain isotopic data on the multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. In this study, to obtain the Ba isotopic ratio of river-water samples with a rather lower Ba concentration than igneous rock, we experimented with K, Ca, Na, Mg, and Ce doping tests. The acidity and concentration matches to explore suitable SSB method conditions for river water Ba isotopic determinations on an MC-ICP-MS. The results showed no obvious matrix effects to Ba isotopes when K/Ba, Ca/Ba, Na/Ba, and Mg/Ba <5, and Ce/Ba <0.2, indicating that the matrix effects are negligible after column purification of Ba. HNO3 concentration match tests showed that within a 25% acidity difference, there would be also no systematic effects to a Ba isotopic determination. However, Ba isotopic determinations are highly sensitive to the Ba concentration difference between the standard and the sample. We observed a mismatch between the Ba concentration and its isotopic ratios, even when the concentration was strictly within a 5% difference. Nevertheless, the on-peak zero strategy (i.e. subtraction of HNO3, gas, and instrumental blanks) worked well to solve the mismatch situation. With this easy strategy, the Ba isotopic ratios of batch natural rive-water samples with various Ba concentrations will become easily accessible.",Accuracy of metabolic rate estimates from heart rate under heat stress-an empirical validation study concerning ISO 8996.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606899,Industrial health,2019 01 04,"The standard ISO 8996 provides methods for the determination of metabolic rate from measured oxygen consumption (MVO2), as well as simplified estimation algorithms based on heart rate (MHR). We quantified the accuracy of these methods by comparing MHR with MVO2 measured in 373 climatic chamber experiments under different workloads and widely varying heat stress conditions. While our results confirmed the 5% accuracy level for MVO2, MHR considerably overestimated MVO2 due to the rise in core temperature concomitantly increasing heart rate by approximately 30 bpm/°C resulting in an overall error of 43%. After individually correcting for this bias the accuracy was 10-15% as stipulated by the standard. Thus, methods correcting for the thermal component of heart rate, e.g. by introducing intermittent resting periods of sufficient length of at least five minutes when investigating heat stress at workplaces, should become a mandatory element in the ongoing revision of the relevant standards.",Role of metallothionein-like cadmium-binding protein (MTLCdBP) in the protective mechanism against cadmium toxicity in the testis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606898,Industrial health,2019 01 04,"The role of metallothionein (MT)-like cadmium (Cd) binding protein (MTLCdBP) in protecting the testes against Cd toxicity was examined. In the acute Cd exposure treatment, cadmium chloride was intraperitoneally injected at 2 mg Cd/kg to Wistar male rats. In the chronic Cd toxicity treatments, 20 mg Cd/kg/day was orally administered for 5 days a week for 5, 10, and 15 weeks. MT (-I,-II) and MTLCdBP were measured using ELISA and Cd-Hem methods, respectively. Testicular tissues were immunostained with antibodies of MT-I,-II, MT-III, and MTLCdBP. Expression of HO1, OGG, iNOS, COX2, and p53 was measured by RT-PCR. Cd concentration in the testis increased dose-dependently in response to Cd exposure. MTLCdBP concentration increased markedly with increasing Cd accumulation. Significant increases in expression of iNOS, HO1, COX2, and OGG1 were observed in the acute exposure treatment. In the chronic oral administration group, expression of MT-I, MT-II, MT-III, iNOS, HO1, and COX2 did not change. Positive immunostaining of MTLCdBP was observed in testicular interstitial tissue. In the testis protected from Cd toxicity, MTLCdBP induction increased significantly with increasing Cd accumulation. Our results suggest that MTLCdBP plays an important role in protecting the testis against Cd toxicity.","Incidence, Clinical Characteristics, and Long-term Outcome of the Dilated Phase of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606897,The Keio journal of medicine,2019 01 04,"Some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) develop systolic dysfunction, called the dilated phase of HCM (d-HCM), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective study using an HCM database to clarify the incidence, clinical characteristics, and long-term outcomes of d-HCM. We analyzed an HCM cohort consisting of 434 patients (273 with apical HCM and 161 with non-apical HCM; 18 had obstructive HCM, 16 had dilated HCM, and 127 had other HCM) diagnosed by echocardiography in our hospital between 1991 and 2010. The follow-up period was 8.4 ± 6.7 years. The mean age at final follow-up was 67 ± 14 years, and 304 patients (70%) were men. The mean age of the 16 d-HCM patients at the initial visit was 45 ± 17 years, the age at final follow-up was 59 ± 18 years, and 13 were men. Thirteen d-HCM patients developed atrial fibrillation and six patients developed ischemic stroke. Twelve d-HCM patients were implanted with cardiac devices: one pacemaker, nine implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and two cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator. Five patients died of progressive heart failure at the age of 61 ± 23 years. The age at the initial visit and final follow-up were lower and the NYHA class, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and left ventricular function at initial evaluation were worse in the d-HCM group. Univariate analysis demonstrated that a lower age at the initial visit was associated with d-HCM (hazard ratio 0.955/1 year increase; 95% CI 0.920-0.991, P = 0.015). In our HCM cohort, the incidence of d-HCM was 4%. A high prevalence of atrial fibrillation and cerebral infarction and poor prognosis were noted in this group, despite patients undergoing medication and device implantation.",Juglone Inhibits Proliferation of HPV-Positive Cervical Cancer Cells Specifically.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606896,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 04,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as HPV 16 and HPV 18 are related to cervical cancer. Therefore, it is important to inhibit HPV-positive cervical cancer for treating cervical cancer. This study is aiming at investigating the proposed molecular mechanism, which underlies the antineoplastic potential of the aqueous extract of juglone of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. According to the results, it is showed that, juglone prohibited HPV positive cervical cancer cells' growth through dose-dependent way. Nevertheless, when pin 1 was knocked down, the proliferation inhibition reduced. The detection of apoptosis and cell cycle also illustrated that juglone influenced HPV positive cells. Western blot expressed the influence mechanism that it affected the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family and later activated the Caspase-depended apoptosis way. It is contributable for this study to understand the mechanism of inhibiting HPV positive cells by juglone and it also provides an effective strategy for the application of it in the future.","Circulating Concentrations of Insulin Resistance-Associated Hepatokines, Selenoprotein P and Leukocyte Cell-Derived Chemotaxin 2, during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test in Humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606895,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 04,"A hepatokine is a collective term for liver-derived secretory factors whose previously-unrecognized functions have been recently elucidated. We have rediscovered selenoprotein P (SeP) and leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) as hepatokines that are involved in the development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. The aim of this study was to determine whether and, if so, how oral glucose loading alters the two hepatokines in humans. We measured concentrations of serum SeP and plasma LECT2 during 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (n = 20) in people with various degrees of glucose tolerance. In OGTT, concentrations of both serum SeP and plasma LECT2 decreased at 120 min compared with the baseline values, irrespective of the severity of glucose intolerance. Decrement of serum SeP during OGTT showed no correlations to the clinical parameters associated with insulin resistance or insulin secretion. In multiple stepwise regression analyses, plasma cortisol was selected as the variable to explain the changes in plasma concentrations of LECT2. The current data reveal the acute inhibitory actions of oral intake of glucose on circulating SeP and LECT2 in humans, irrespective of the severity of glucose intolerance. This study suggests that circulating SeP is regulated by the unknown clinical factors other than insulin and glucose during OGTT.",YiQi Tongluo Granule against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rats by Freezing GluN2B and CaMK II through NMDAR/ERK1/2 Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606894,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 26,"Yiqi Tongluo Granule (YQTL) is a kind of proprietary Chinese medicine, manufactured by China Shineway Pharmaceutical Group Ltd., under the authority of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke in China, however the underlying mechanism of YQTL on treating ischemic stroke has not been revealed. This study is aimed to evaluate the protective effect of YQTL on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and inquire into its underlying mechanisms. Cerebral I/R injury was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. And regional cerebral flow was monitored by Laser Doppler flow during ischemia phase. The infarct volume was evaluated by Triphenyte-trazolium chloride staining. The protective effects of YQTL were assessed by a number of parameters, including neurological scores, regional cerebral blood flow, pathological changes of neuron in hippocampuses and hippocampus calcium level. The proteins of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (GluN2B) and p-calcium-dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKII) response were assayed by Western blotting. I/R caused significant change in neurological deficit scores, regional cerebral flow and infarct volume. However results in YQTL groups and Nimodipine Tablets (NMDP) group were reversed. Subsequently YQTL reduced I/R-induced calcium influx. Results of hematoxylin-eosin staining manifested that YQTL significantly improved neuronal injury after I/R in rats. Meanwhile, microdialysis data demonstrated that extracellular glutamate was increased in the striatum during ischemia reperfusion, which was reduced by YQTL. YQTL and mitogen-activated protein extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor suppressed the I/R-mediated over-expression of GluN2B, p-ERK, ERK and p-CaMKII proteins expression. Putting these together, our results suggest that YQTL played a neuroprotective role in cerebral I/R injury, which might be exerted by inhibiting the excitotoxicity and expression of GluN2B, p-CaMKII and MEK/ERK signal pathway.",Temporal changes of abomasal contents and volumes in calves fed milk diluted with oral rehydration salt solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606893,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2019 03 18,"Several manufacturers recommend to feed mixture comprising equal amounts of oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution and milk for diarrheic calves after milk withdrawal. Such a feeding method is expected to supply more nutrients and energy compared to feeding only the ORS solution. However, little is known about the effects of feeding milk diluted with ORS solution on calves' digestive process. This study examined the abomasal contents, volumes, and emptying rates in calves fed whole milk, milk diluted by 50% with ORS solution (50% ORS-milk), and ORS solution. Ultrasonography identified curds in the milk-fed calves, but not in the 50% ORS-milk-fed or the ORS-fed calves. The abomasal fluid of the 50% ORS-milk-fed calves contained not only β-lactoglobulin but also α-casein (CN), β-CN, and κ-CN, which were used for curd formation and undetectable in the milk-fed calves. Abomasal pH was relatively higher in the 50% ORS-milk-fed than that in the milk-fed calves. Abomasal emptying rates were significantly faster in the ORS-fed than in the 50% ORS-milk-fed and the milk-fed calves. These data indicate that the formation of abomasal curd is inhibited in the 50% ORS-milk-fed calves due to the resultant high abomasal pH and low κ-CN concentration. The 50% ORS-milk may not provide rehydration as quickly as the ORS solution. In conclusion, we do not recommend feeding 50% ORS-milk to calves."

Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin's fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized v = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the spin unpolarized state.",Rovibrational quantum state resolution of the C60 fullerene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606838,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 08,"The unique physical properties of buckminsterfullerene, C60, have attracted intense research activity since its original discovery. Total quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of isolated C60 molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C60 in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C60 in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state-resolved rovibrational transitions.

We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through polarized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed. Building on these observations, we lay out a hydrodynamic theory of polarized crowds and demonstrate its predictive power.

Inspired by earlier work, we installed into tobacco chloroplasts synthetic glycolate metabolic pathways that are thought to be more efficient than the native pathway. Flux through the synthetic pathways was maximized by inhibiting glycolate export from the chloroplast. The synthetic pathways tested improved photosynthetic quantum yield by 20%. Numerous homozygous transgenic lines increased biomass productivity by >40% in replicated field trials. These results show that engineering alternative glycolate metabolic pathways into crop chloroplasts while inhibiting glycolate export into the native pathway can drive increases in C3 crop yield under agricultural field conditions.",Exceptional points in optics and photonics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606818,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 08,"Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.","Relation between Chlamydia trachomatis infection and pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility in a Dutch cohort of women previously tested for chlamydia in a chlamydia screening trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606817,Sexually transmitted infections,2019 05 17,"A better understanding of Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia)-related sequelae can provide a framework for effective chlamydia control strategies.

We carefully investigated how common genetic variations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) influence cellular metabolic kinetics in response to methotrexate (MTX). Designs: Two distinct cell models: HepG2 with stabilized MTHFR inhibition using shRNA delivered by a Lentiviral vector; and Epstein-Barr virus transformed human lymphoblasts expressing MTHFR polymorphic allele 677C and 677T were used. Disease activity and DMARD use were compared between MTHFR-677CC, CT and TT rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in a cross-sectional study (n=120). Results: Compared with MTHFR-CC, MTHFR-TT carriers had lower mean weakly MTX dose (9.8 ± 3.3 compared with 12.1 ± 3.5, P<0.05). More MTHFR-TT carriers (8/11, 73%) reported MTX-related side effects compared with MTHFR-677CC (32/57, 56%) and MTHFR-677CT (30/51, 59%). No genotypic difference was found in other DMARDs. At the same dose of MTX, lymphoblasts were more sensitive in cell survival, protein and thymidine syntheses whereas HepG2 models were more susceptible to the inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine (adoMet) synthesis. MTHFR-C677T altered protein turnover and folate mediated 1-carbon metabolic fluxes in lymphoblasts with and without MTX. MTHFR function significantly affected transmethylation fluxes and adoMet homeostasis but not nucleotide biosyntheses in MTX-treated HepG2 cell-lines. Conclusion: Combining cell models, kinetic studies, and genetic tests in humans, the present study gives insight on how MTHFR effects hepatic transmethylation homeostasis during MTX therapy. We provide platforms that help predict the genetic impact on antifolate drugs, and further delineate tissue-specific target pathway in DMARD therapies.

Post-resection portal venous pressure (PVP) predicts liver failure, is implicated in its pathogenesis, and when PVP is reduced, rates of liver dysfunction decrease. The aim of the present study was to characterize the hemodynamic, biochemical, and histological changes induced by 80% hepatectomy in non-cirrhotic pigs and determine if terlipressin or direct portacaval shunting can modulate these effects. Pigs were randomized (n=8/group) to undergo 80% hepatectomy alone (control); terlipressin (2 mg bolus + 0.5-1 mg/h) + 80% hepatectomy; or portacaval shunt (PCS) + 80% hepatectomy, and were maintained under terminal anesthesia for 8 h. The primary outcome was changed in PVP. Secondary outcomes included portal venous flow (PVF), hepatic arterial flow (HAF), and biochemical and histological markers of liver injury.

However, our understanding of animal colour perception is largely derived from human psychophysics, and behavioural tests of non-human animals are required to understand how colour signals are perceived. Here, we introduce a novel test of colour vision in animals inspired by the Ishihara colour charts, which are widely used to identify human colour deficiencies. In our method, distractor dots have a fixed chromaticity (hue and saturation) but vary in luminance. Animals can be trained to find single target dots that differ from distractor dots in chromaticity. We provide MATLAB code for creating these stimuli, which can be modified for use with different animals. We demonstrate the success of this method with triggerfish, Rhinecanthus aculeatus, which quickly learnt to select target dots that differed from distractor dots, and highlight behavioural parameters that can be measured, including success of finding the target dot, time to detection and error rate. We calculated discrimination thresholds by testing whether target colours that were of increasing colour distances (ΔS) from distractor dots could be detected, and calculated discrimination thresholds in different directions of colour space. At least for some colours, thresholds indicated better discrimination than expected from the receptor noise limited (RNL) model assuming 5% Weber fraction for the long-wavelength cone. This methodology could be used with other animals to address questions such as luminance thresholds, sensory bias, effects of sensory noise, colour categorization and saliency.",Efficacy of first-line treatments for multiple myeloma patients not eligible for stem cell transplantation: a network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606791,Haematologica,2019 06 10,"Decision making for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) not transplant eligible (NTE) is complicated by a lack of head-to-head comparisons of standards of care, the increase in the choice of treatment modalities, and the promising results that are rapidly evolving from studies with novel regimens. To support evidence-based decision making, we performed a network meta-analysis for NTE MM patients that synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and enables a comparison of all treatments. Relevant randomized clinical trials were identified by a systematic literature review in EMBASE®, MEDLINE®, MEDLINE®-in-Process and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for January 1999 to March 2016. Efficacy outcomes [i.e. the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for progression-free survival] were extracted and synthesized in a random effects network-meta analysis. In total, 24 studies were identified including 21 treatments. According to the network-meta analysis, the HR for progression-free survival was favorable for all NTE MM treatments compared to dexamethasone (HR: 0.19-0.90). Daratumumab-bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone and bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide with bortezomib-thalidomide maintenance were identified as the most effective treatments (HR: 0.19, 95%CI: 0.08-0.45 and HR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.10-0.51, respectively). HR and 95%CI for currently recommended treatments, bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone, bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone, and lenalidomide-dexamethasone compared to dexamethasone, were 0.31 (0.16-0.59), 0.39 (0.20-0.75), and 0.44 (0.29-0.65), respectively. In addition to identifying the most effective treatment options, we illustrate the additional value and evidence of network meta-analysis in clinical practice. In the current treatment landscape, the results of network meta-analysis may support evidence-based decisions and ultimately help to optimize treatment and outcomes of NTE MM patients.","Proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules as therapy for multiple myeloma: efficacy, biomarker and drug combinations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606790,Haematologica,2019 06 01,"Proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule ARV 825 causes ubiquitination of bromodomains resulting in their efficient degradation by proteasome activity. Bromodomain degradation down-regulates MYC transcription contributing to growth inhibition of various human cancers. We examined the therapeutic potential of ARV 825 against multiple myeloma (MM) cells both in vitro and in vivo In a dose-dependent manner, ARV 825 inhibited proliferation of 13 human MM cell lines and three fresh patient samples, and was associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. ARV 825 rapidly and efficiently degraded BRD 2 and BRD 4. Sensitivity of MM cells to ARV 825 was positively correlated with cereblon levels. RNA sequencing analysis showed important genes such as CCR1, RGS, MYB and MYC were down-regulated by ARV 825. A total of 170 small molecule inhibitors were screened for synergy with ARV 825. Combination of ARV 825 with inhibitor of either dual PI3K/mTOR, CRM1, VEGFR, PDGFRα/b, FLT3, IGF-1R, protein kinase C, CBP-EP300 or JAK1/2 showed synergistic activity. Importantly, ARV 825 significantly inhibited the growth of MM xenografts and improved mice survival.

The PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606789,Haematologica,2019 01 04,"(273 words) The optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis is uncertain. We aimed to assess the benefits and risks of an additional 18-month treatment with warfarin versus placebo, after initial 6-month anticoagulation for a first unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing an additional 18 months of warfarin with placebo in patients with a unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis initially treated for six months (treatment period: 18 months; follow-up after treatment period: 24 months). The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding at 18 months. Secondary outcomes were the composite at 42 months, as well as each component of the composite, and death unrelated to pulmonary embolism or major bleeding, at 18 and 42 months. All outcomes were centrally adjudicated. A total of 104 patients (July 2007 and October 2013) were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis; no patient was lost to follow-up. During the 18-month treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in none of the 50 patients in the warfarin-group and in 16 out of 54 patients (cumulative risk, 29.6%) in the placebo-group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.09; p<0.001). During the entire 42-month study period, the composite outcome occurred in 14 patients (cumulative risk, 36.8%) in the warfarin-group and 17 patients (cumulative risk, 31.5%) in the placebo-group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.35-1.46). In conclusion, after a first unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis initially treated during 6 months, an additional 18 months of warfarin therapy reduced the composite of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared to placebo. However, this benefit was not maintained after stopping anticoagulation.

Embase and MEDLINE were searched from January 2008 to June 2018 for studies which evaluated the Khorana score. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Additional data on the 6-month incidence of venous thromboembolism were sought by contacting corresponding authors. The incidence in each Khorana score risk group was estimated with random effects meta-analysis. A total of 45 articles and eight abstracts were included, comprising 55 cohorts enrolling 34,555 ambulatory cancer patients. For 27,849 patients (81%), 6-month follow-up data were obtained. Overall, 19% of patients had a Khorana score of 0 points, 64% a score of 1 or 2 points, and 17% a score of 3 or more points. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in the first six months was 5.0% (95%CI: 3.9-6.5) in patients with a low-risk Khorana score (0 points), 6.6% (95%CI: 5.6-7.7) in those with an intermediate-risk Khorana score (1 or 2 points), and 11.0% (95%CI: 8.8-13.8) in those with a high-risk Khorana score (3 points or higher). Of the patients with venous thromboembolism in the first six months, 23.4% (95%CI: 18.4-29.4) had been classified as high risk according to the Khorana score.

PTI signals are transmitted through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inducing signaling and defense processes such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and callose deposition. Here, we examine mutants for two Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding homologs of UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2 (UBAC2), a conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein implicated in ER protein quality control. The ubac2 mutants were hypersusceptible to a type III secretion-deficient strain of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, indicating a PTI defect. The ubac2 mutants showed normal PRR biogenesis, MAPK activation, ROS burst, and PTI-associated gene expression. Pathogen- and PAMP-induced callose deposition, however, was compromised in ubac2 mutants. UBAC2 proteins interact with the plant-specific long coiled-coil protein PAMP-INDUCED COILED COIL (PICC), and picc mutants were compromised in callose deposition and PTI. Compromised callose deposition in the ubac2 and picc mutants was associated with reduced accumulation of the POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANT 4 (PMR4) callose synthase, which is responsible for pathogen-induced callose synthesis. Constitutive overexpression of PMR4 restored pathogen-induced callose synthesis and PTI in the ubac2 and picc mutants. These results uncover an ER pathway involving the conserved UBAC2 and plant-specific PICC proteins that specifically regulate pathogen-induced callose deposition in plant innate immunity.",The Role of Abscisic Acid Signaling in Maintaining the Metabolic Balance Required for Arabidopsis Growth under Nonstress Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606780,The Plant cell,2019 03 05,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that regulates a diverse range of cellular and molecular processes during development and in response to osmotic stress. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), three Suc nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase2s (SnRK2s), SRK2D, SRK2E, and SRK2I, are key positive regulators involved in ABA signaling whose substrates have been well studied. Besides reduced drought-stress tolerance, the srk2d srk2e srk2i mutant shows abnormal growth phenotypes, such as an increased number of leaves, under nonstress conditions. However, it remains unclear whether, and if so how, SnRK2-mediated ABA signaling regulates growth and development. Here, we show that the primary metabolite profile of srk2d srk2e srk2i grown under nonstress conditions was considerably different from that of wild-type plants. The metabolic changes observed in the srk2d srk2e srk2i were similar to those in an ABA-biosynthesis mutant, aba2-1, and both mutants showed a higher leaf emergence rate than wild type. Consistent with the increased amounts of citrate, isotope-labeling experiments revealed that respiration through the tricarboxylic acid cycle was enhanced in srk2d srk2e srk2i These results, together with transcriptome data, indicate that the SnRK2s involved in ABA signaling modulate metabolism and leaf growth under nonstress conditions by fine-tuning flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle."

It improves colitis outcomes in the clinical setting, but the mechanism underlying its function yet to be uncovered. We investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of cinobufacini on colitis using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, mainly focusing on the impact of macrophage polarization. Our results showed that cinobufacini dramatically ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice. Cinobufacini treatment reduced the infiltration of activated F4/80+ and/or CD68+ macrophages into the colon in DSS-induced colitis mice. More importantly, cinobufacini significantly decreased the quantity of M1 macrophages and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Cinobufacini also increased the population of M2 macrophages and the expression of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-10 and arginase-1 in DSS-induced colitis mice. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that cinobufacini inhibited M1 macrophage polarization in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Mechanistically, our in vivo and in vitro results showed that cinobufacini inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization may be associated with the suppression of nuclear factor κB activation. Our study suggests that cinobufacini could ameliorate DSS-induced colitis in mice by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization.",Acquired Expression of Mutant Mitofusin 2 Causes Progressive Neurodegeneration and Abnormal Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606759,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 02 28,"Neurons have high plasticity in developmental and juvenile stages that decreases in adulthood. Mitochondrial dynamics are highly important in neurons to maintain normal function. To compare dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model capable of selective timing of the expression of a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor Mitofusin 2 (MFN2). Mutant expression in the juvenile stage had lethal effects. Contrastingly, abnormalities did not manifest until 150 d after mutant expression during adulthood. After this silent 150 d period, progressive neurodegeneration, abnormal behaviors, and learning and memory deficits similar to those seen in human neurodegenerative diseases were observed. This indicates that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. Our findings highlight the need to consider the timing of disease onset in mimicking human neurodegenerative diseases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To compare the dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in neurons in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor MFN2 in an arbitrary timing. Juvenile expression of the mutant showed acute and severe phenotypes and had lethal effects; however, post-adult expression induced delayed but progressive phenotypes resembling those found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Our results indicate that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. This strongly suggests that the timing of expression should be considered when establishing an animal model that closely resembles human neurodegenerative diseases.",Mouse Parabrachial Neurons Signal a Relationship between Bitter Taste and Nociceptive Stimuli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606758,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 03 01,"Taste and somatosensation both mediate protective behaviors. Bitter taste guides avoidance of ingestion of toxins while pain sensations, such as noxious heat, signal adverse conditions to ward off harm. Although brain pathways for taste and somatosensation are typically studied independently, prior data suggest that they intersect, potentially reflecting their common protective role. To investigate this, we applied electrophysiologic and optogenetic techniques in anesthetized mice of both sexes to evaluate relationships between oral somatosensory and taste activity in the parabrachial nucleus (PbN), implicated for roles in gustation and pain. Spikes were recorded from taste-active PbN neurons tested with oral delivery of thermal and chemesthetic stimuli, including agonists of nocisensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels on somatosensory fibers. Gustatory neurons were also tested to follow electrical pulse stimulation of an oral somatosensory region of the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), which projects to the PbN. Neurons composed classic taste groups, including sodium, electrolyte, appetitive, or bitter cells. Across groups, most neurons spiked to Vc pulse stimulation, implying that trigeminal projections reach PbN gustatory neurons. Among such cells, a subpopulation responsive to the bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, and aversive concentrations of sodium, cofired to agonists of nocisensitive TRP channels, including capsaicin, mustard oil, and noxious heat. Such neurons populated the lateral PbN. Further, nociceptive activity in PbN bitter taste neurons was suppressed during optogenetic-assisted inhibition of the Vc, implying convergent trigeminal input contributed to such activity. Our results reveal a novel role for PbN gustatory cells in cross-system signaling related to protection.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Prior data suggest that gustatory and trigeminal neural pathways intersect and overlap in the parabrachial area. However, no study has directly examined such overlap and why it may exist. Here we found that parabrachial gustatory neurons can receive afferent projections from trigeminal nuclei and fire to oral nociceptive stimuli that excite somatosensory receptors and fibers. Activation to aversive nociceptive stimuli in gustatory cells was associated with responding to behaviorally avoided bitter tastants. We were further able to show that silencing trigeminal projections inhibited nociceptive activity in parabrachial bitter taste neurons. Our results imply that in the parabrachial area, there is predictable overlap between taste and somatosensory processing related to protective coding and that classically defined taste neurons contribute to this process.",A Distinct Visual Pathway Mediates High-Intensity Light Adaptation of the Circadian Clock in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606757,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 03 01,"To provide organisms with a fitness advantage, circadian clocks have to react appropriately to changes in their environment. High-intensity (HI) light plays an essential role in the adaptation to hot summer days, which especially endanger insects of desiccation or prey visibility. Here, we show that solely increasing light intensity leads to an increased midday siesta in Drosophila behavior. Interestingly, this change is independent of the fly's circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome and is solely caused by a small visual organ, the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelets. Using receptor knock-downs, immunostaining, and recently developed calcium tools, we show that the eyelets activate key core clock neurons, namely the s-LNvs, at HI. This activation delays the decrease of PERIOD (PER) in the middle of the day and propagates to downstream target clock neurons that prolong the siesta. We show a new pathway for integrating light-intensity information into the clock network, suggesting new network properties and surprising parallels between Drosophila and the mammalian system.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environment plays an important role in their fitness. A key player in this adaptation is the circadian clock. For animals to predict the changes of day and night, they must constantly monitor, detect and incorporate changes in the environment. The appropriate incorporation and reaction to high-intensity (HI) light is of special importance for insects because they might suffer from desiccation during hot summer days. We show here that different photoreceptors have specialized functions to integrate low-intensity, medium-intensity, or HI light into the circadian system in Drosophila These results show surprising parallels to mammalian mechanisms, which also use different photoreceptor subtypes to respond to different light intensities.",Frequency Shifts and Depth Dependence of Premotor Beta Band Activity during Perceptual Decision-Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606756,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 02 23,"Neural activity in the premotor and motor cortices shows prominent structure in the beta frequency range (13-30 Hz). Currently, the behavioral relevance of this beta band activity (BBA) is debated. The underlying source of motor BBA and how it changes as a function of cortical depth are also not completely understood. Here, we addressed these unresolved questions by investigating BBA recorded using laminar electrodes in the dorsal premotor cortex of 2 male rhesus macaques performing a visual reaction time (RT) reach discrimination task. We observed robust BBA before and after the onset of the visual stimulus but not during the arm movement. While poststimulus BBA was positively correlated with RT throughout the beta frequency range, prestimulus correlation varied by frequency. Low beta frequencies (∼12-20 Hz) were positively correlated with RT, and high beta frequencies (∼22-30 Hz) were negatively correlated with RT. Analysis and simulations suggested that these frequency-dependent correlations could emerge due to a shift in the component frequencies of the prestimulus BBA as a function of RT, such that faster RTs are accompanied by greater power in high beta frequencies. We also observed a laminar dependence of BBA, with deeper electrodes demonstrating stronger power in low beta frequencies both prestimulus and poststimulus. The heterogeneous nature of BBA and the changing relationship between BBA and RT in different task epochs may be a sign of the differential network dynamics involved in cue expectation, decision-making, motor preparation, and movement execution.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Beta band activity (BBA) has been implicated in motor tasks, in disease states, and as a potential signal for brain-machine interfaces. However, the behavioral relevance of BBA and its laminar organization in premotor cortex have not been completely elucidated. Here we addressed these unresolved issues using simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical layers of the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a decision-making task. Our key finding is that BBA is not a monolithic signal. Instead, BBA consists of at least two frequency bands. The relationship between BBA and eventual behavior, such as reaction time, also dynamically changes depending on task epoch. We also provide further evidence that BBA is laminarly organized, with greater power in deeper electrodes for low beta frequencies.",Genetic Effects on Dispersion in Urinary Albumin and Creatinine in Three House Mouse (Mus musculus) Cohorts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606755,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 03 29,"Conventionally, quantitative genetics concerns the heredity of trait means, but there is growing evidence for the existence of architectures in which certain alleles cause random variance in phenotype, termed 'phenotypic dispersion' (PD) or 'variance QTL' (vQTL), including in physiological traits like disease signs. However, the structure of this phenomenon is still poorly known. PD for urinary albumin (PDUAlb ) and creatinine (PDUCrea ) was mapped using curated data from two nearly genetically identical F2 mouse (Mus musculus) cohorts (383 male F2 C57BL/6J×A/J (97 SNP) and 207 male F2 C57BL/6J×A/J ApoE knockout mice (144 SNP)) and a related mapping cohort (340 male F2 DBA/2J×C57BL/6J (83 SNP, 8 microsatellites)). PDUAlb was associated with markers in regions of Chr 1 (5-64 megabases (MB); 141-158 MB), 3 (∼113 MB), 8 (37-68 MB), 14 (92-117 MB) and 17 (14-24 MB) with several positions and quantitative architectures in common between the two C57BL/6J×A/J cohorts, most of which had a negative dominant construction. One locus for PDUCrea was detected on Chr 19 (57 MB) in the C57BL/6J×A/J ApoE-/- cohort. The large number of negative dominant loci for albuminuria dispersion relative to conventional quantitative trait loci suggests that the development of albuminuria may be largely genetically dynamic and that randomization in this development is detrimental.",Activation of the Bile Acid Pathway and No Observed Antimicrobial Peptide Sequences in the Skin of a Poison Frog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606754,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 04,"The skin secretions of many frogs have genetically-encoded, endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

The origins of these defense systems are not clear, but a novel bile-acid derived metabolite, tauromantellic acid, was recently discovered and shown to be endogenous in poison frogs (Mantella, Dendrobates, and Epipedobates). These observations raise questions about the evolutionary history of AMP genetic elements, the mechanism and function of tauromatellic acid production, and links between these systems. To understand the diversity and expression of AMPs among frogs, we assembled skin transcriptomes of 13 species across the anuran phylogeny. Our analyses revealed a diversity of AMPs and AMP expression levels across the phylogenetic history of frogs, but no observations of AMPs in Mantella We examined genes expressed in the bile-acid metabolic pathway and found that CYP7A1 (Cytochrome P450), BAAT (bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase), and AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) were highly expressed in the skin of M. betsileo and either lowly expressed or absent in other frog species. In particular, CYP7A1 catalyzes the first reaction in the cholesterol catabolic pathway and is the rate-limiting step in regulation of bile acid synthesis, suggesting unique activation of the bile acid pathway in Mantella skin. The activation of the bile acid pathway in the skin of Mantella and the lack of observed AMPs fuel new questions about the evolution of defense compounds and the ectopic expression of the bile-acid pathway.",Skin Grafting in Xenopus laevis: A Technique for Assessing Development and Immunological Disparity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606753,Cold Spring Harbor protocols,2019 05 02,"Skin grafting in the amphibian Xenopus laevis has been used to detect not only allogeneic antigens that differ by minor H antigens or by one MHC haplotype, but also to detect ontogeny-specific antigens (including both emerging adult- and disappearing larval-specific) during metamorphosis. To understand the mechanisms underlying allogeneic tolerance or immune responses against larval- and/or adult-specific antigens, a complete MHC homozygous, inbred strain is the most appropriate experimental model. The inbred J strain established in Japan is used here. Owing to complete histocompatibility, the inbred J strain shows no grafted skin rejection among the same strain of adult frogs, and its genuine homozygosity was reconfirmed by genomic sequence analysis in 2016. Therefore, the J strain enables immunologists and embryologists to understand evolutionary processes as well as immunological events and tissue remodeling mechanisms present during development. Furthermore, an F1 hybrid between the J strain and a GFP-labeled transgenic line is available from our laboratory and can be used as a model for long-term cell tracking. This protocol explains the methodology for skin grafting in X. laevis to determine immunological discrepancies between the host and donor. It is also possible to trace cell and tissue fates in the hosts during early embryogenesis and during complete development from larvae to adults, which is extremely difficult to perform using other species.",Mapping Chromatin Features of Xenopus Embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606752,Cold Spring Harbor protocols,2019 04 02,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with genomic analysis provides a global snapshot of protein-DNA interactions in the context of chromatin, yielding insights into which genome loci might be regulated by the DNA-associated protein under investigation.

Fetal and neonatal edition,2019 01 04,"Neonatal intubation is an essential but difficult skill to learn. Videolaryngoscopy allows the airway view to be shared by the intubator and supervisor and improves intubation success. Ideally, a videolaryngoscope (VL) should be usable as a conventional laryngoscope (CL). The aims of this report were to describe differences in the shape of currently available CL and VL blades and to compare the direct airway view obtainable on a neonatal manikin with different laryngoscope blades.Three main differences were observed; compared with CL, the VL blades have a reduced vertical height, a curved tip and curved body. The direct airway view obtained by the VL is narrower than that obtained with the CL, although the corresponding view on the VL screen is maintained.Minor adaptation of intubation technique may be required when using a VL. Modifying VL blades to reduce these differences may improve their usefulness as an intubation training tool."

When inflammatory cells are activated, 5-LO translocates to the nuclear membrane to initiate oxygenation of AA released by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) into leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 can also be exported from an activated donor cell into an acceptor cell by the process of transcellular biosynthesis. When thimerosal is added to cells, the level of free AA increases by inhibition of lysophospholipid acyltransferases of the Lands pathway of phospholipid remodeling. Another arachidonate phospholipid cycle involves phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the plasma membrane that undoubtedly intersects with the Lands pathway of phospholipid remodeling. The highest abundance of PI occurs between the ER and the plasma membrane and is probably a result of the importance of the PI signaling cascade in cellular biochemistry. Because transport proteins mediate the rapid intracellular movement of phospholipids, largely as result of physical membrane contact, 5-LO-dependent production of LTA4 could be mediated by the disappearance of free AA from the nuclear membrane, transfer to the ER for Lands cycle reesterification into PI, and population of PI(18:0/20:4) for cell membrane signaling.",Putting VE-cadherin into JAIL for junction remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606730,Journal of cell science,2019 01 04,"Junction dynamics of endothelial cells are based on the integration of signal transduction, cytoskeletal remodeling and contraction, which are necessary for the formation and maintenance of monolayer integrity, but also enable repair and regeneration. The VE-cadherin-catenin complex forms the molecular basis of the adherence junctions and cooperates closely with actin filaments. Several groups have recently described small actin-driven protrusions at the cell junctions that are controlled by the Arp2/3 complex, contributing to cell junction regulation. We identified these protrusions as the driving force for VE-cadherin dynamics, as they directly induce new VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion sites, and have accordingly referred to these structures as junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAIL). JAIL extend over only a few microns and thus provide the basis for a subcellular regulation of adhesion. The local (subcellular) VE-cadherin concentration and JAIL formation are directly interdependent, which enables autoregulation. Therefore, this mechanism can contribute a subcellularly regulated adaptation of cell contact dynamics, and is therefore of great importance for monolayer integrity and relative cell migration during wound healing and angiogenesis, as well as for inflammatory responses. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and functions underlying these actin-driven protrusions and consider their contribution to the dynamic regulation of endothelial cell junctions.",Continuum of Host-Gut Microbial Co-metabolism: Host CYP3A4/3A7 are Responsible for Tertiary Oxidations of Deoxycholate Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606729,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 04 19,"The gut microbiota modifies endogenous primary bile acids (BAs) to produce exogenous secondary BAs, which may be further metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s). Our primary aim was to examine how the host adapts to the stress of microbe-derived secondary BAs by P450-mediated oxidative modifications on the steroid nucleus. Five unconjugated tri-hydroxyl BAs that were structurally and/or biologically associated with deoxycholate (DCA) were determined in human biologic samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with enzyme-digestion techniques. They were identified as DCA-19-ol, DCA-6β-ol, DCA-5β-ol, DCA-6α-ol, DCA-1β-ol, and DCA-4β-ol based on matching in-laboratory synthesized standards. Metabolic inhibition assays in human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 assays revealed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 were responsible for the regioselective oxidations of both DCA and its conjugated forms, glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA). The modification of secondary BAs to tertiary BAs defines a host liver (primary BAs)-gut microbiota (secondary BAs)-host liver (tertiary BAs) axis. The regioselective oxidations of DCA, GDCA, and TDCA by CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 may help eliminate host-toxic DCA species. The 19- and 4β-hydroxylation of DCA species demonstrated outstanding CYP3A7 selectivity and may be useful as indicators of CYP3A7 activity.",The MBNL/CELF Splicing Factors Regulate Cytosolic Sulfotransferase 4A1 Protein Expression during Cell Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606728,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 28,"Sulfotransferase 4A1 (SULT4A1) is a sulfotransferase-like protein that is highly conserved between species. In human tissues, there are two transcripts, one that produces a full-length protein and one that produces an unstable truncated protein. The second transcript, which includes a pseudo-exon between exons 6 and 7 (6p), is widely expressed, whereas the first is more restricted. Differentiation of neuronal cells results in the removal of the pseudo-exon and subsequent SULT4A1 protein expression. Recent studies with SULT4A1 knockout mice showed that the protein is essential for normal development and that its absence leads to a severe neurologic phenotype. Here, the regulation of SULT4A1 6p splicing was investigated during neuronal differentiation using SH-SY5Y cells, human induced pluripotent stem cells, and mouse embryonic tissue. In all three models, pseudo-exon 6p was removed during differentiation, resulting in stable SULT4A1 protein expression. Using a minigene splicing assay, a region upstream of pseudo-exon 6p was identified that is essential for correct splicing of SULT4A1 mRNA. Within this region, there were binding motifs for four RNA processing factors (MBNL-1, MBNL-2, CELF-1, and CELF-2). Time-dependent changes in SULT4A1 protein and MBNL/CELF protein during differentiation supported their role in correctly splicing the SULT4A1 mRNA. Furthermore, ectopic expression of each factor produced efficient splicing in the minigene assay as well as correct splicing of the endogenous SULT4A1 mRNA. These results show that SULT4A1 mRNA is a target for MBNL/CELF-dependent splicing, which may be essential in producing stable, functional SULT4A1.","""Ears of the Lynx"" MRI Sign Is Associated with SPG11 and SPG15 Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606727,AJNR.

Although genes frequently mutated in B-cell lymphoma have been identified, the search for driver mutations has largely focused on the coding genome. Here we report an analysis of the noncoding genome using whole-genome sequencing data from 117 patients with B-cell lymphoma. Using promoter capture Hi-C data in naive B cells, we define cis-regulatory elements, which represent an enriched subset of the noncoding genome in which to search for driver mutations. Regulatory regions were identified whose mutation significantly alters gene expression, including copy number variation at cis-regulatory elements targeting CD69, IGLL5, and MMP14, and single nucleotide variants in a cis-regulatory element for TPRG1 We also show the commonality of pathways targeted by coding and noncoding mutations, exemplified by MMP14, which regulates Notch signaling, a pathway important in lymphomagenesis and whose expression is associated with patient survival.

Because an increasing number of older patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), we examined the incidence and impact of transplant-related geriatric syndromes using our institutional database and electronic medical records. We identified 527 patients age 60 years or older who had undergone first allo-HCT from 2001 to 2016 for hematologic malignancies. From the initiation of conditioning to 100 days posttransplant, new geriatric syndromes were predominantly delirium with a cumulative incidence of 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-25%) at day 100 followed by fall at 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%). In multivariable analyses of available pretransplant variables, fall within the last year, potentially inappropriate use of medication, thrombocytopenia, and reduced creatinine clearance were significantly associated with delirium; age older than 70 years and impaired activities of daily living were significantly associated with fall. In the 100-day landmark analysis, both delirium (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P = .023) and fall (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .026) were significantly associated with increased nonrelapse mortality; moreover, fall (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.18-3.14; P = .016), but not delirium, was significantly associated with reduced overall survival. Here, we establish baseline incidences and risk factors of common transplant-related geriatric syndromes. Importantly, we demonstrate significant associations of delirium and fall with inferior transplant outcomes. The burden and impact of transplant-related geriatric syndromes warrant the institution of patient-centered, preemptive, longitudinal, and multidisciplinary interventions to improve outcomes for older allo-HCT patients.",Bicyclic Peptides as a New Modality for Imaging and Targeting of Proteins Overexpressed by Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606721,Cancer research,2019 03 27,"Molecular imaging of cancers using probes specific for tumor-associated target proteins offers a powerful solution for providing information regarding selection of targeted therapy, patient stratification, and response to therapy. Here we demonstrate the power of bicyclic peptides as targeting probes, exemplified with the tumor-overexpressed matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP as a target. A bicyclic peptide with subnanomolar affinity towards MT1-MMP was identified, and its radioconjugate showed selective tumor uptake in an HT1080 xenograft mouse model. Proteolytic stabilization of the peptide by chemical modification significantly enhanced the in vivo tumor signal [from 2.5%ID/g to 12%ID/g at 1 hour post injection (p.i.)]. Studies using mouse xenograft models with different cell lines show a robust correlation between tumor signals and in vivo MT1-MMP expression levels. Fatty acid modification of the bicyclic peptide extended its circulating half-life, resulting in increased tumor signals (36%ID/g at 6 hours p.i.). Comparative work with an equipotent radiolabeled MT1-MMP targeting antibody demonstrated starkly differential biodistribution and tumor accumulation properties, with the tumor signal slowly increasing to 6.2%ID/g within 48 hours. The rapid tumor penetration characteristics of bicyclic peptides, coupled with high potency and chemical versatility, thus offer high-contrast imaging probes for clinical diagnostics with compelling additional potential in targeted therapy.Significance: This work demonstrates the potential of bicyclic peptides as a platform for the development of high-contrast imaging probes for potential use in clinical cancer diagnostics and molecularly targeted therapeutics.",SIX2 Mediates Late-Stage Metastasis via Direct Regulation of SOX2 and Induction of a Cancer Stem Cell Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606720,Cancer research,2019 06 10,"The capacity for tumor cells to metastasize efficiently is directly linked to their ability to colonize secondary sites. Here we identify Six2, a developmental transcription factor, as a critical regulator of a breast cancer stem cell program that enables metastatic colonization. In several triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models, Six2 enhanced the expression of genes associated with embryonic stem cell programs. Six2 directly bound the Sox2 Srr2 enhancer, promoting Sox2 expression and downstream expression of Nanog, which are both key pluripotency factors. Regulation of Sox2 by Six2 enhanced cancer stem cell properties and increased metastatic colonization. Six2 and Sox2 expression correlated highly in breast cancers including TNBC, where a Six2 expression signature was predictive of metastatic burden and poor clinical outcome. Our findings demonstrate that a SIX2/SOX2 axis is required for efficient metastatic colonization, underscoring a key role for stemness factors in outgrowth at secondary sites. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into stemness and the metastatic outgrowth of triple-negative breast cancer cells.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/4/720/F1.large.jpg."

There are some online and offline computational tools for toxicogenomic data analysis to identify the biomarker genes and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. However, none of the researchers has considered yet the identification of significant interactions between genes and compounds. Therefore, in this paper, we have discussed two approaches namely moving range chart (MRC) and logistic moving range chart (LMRC) for the identification of significant up-regulatory (UpR) and down-regulatory (DnR) gene-compound interactions as well as toxicogenomic biomarkers and their regulatory chemical compounds/drugs. We have investigated the performance of both MRC and LMRC approaches using simulated datasets. Simulation results show that both approaches perform almost equally in absence of outliers. However, in presence of outliers, the LMRC shows much better performance than the MRC. In case of real life toxicogenomic data analysis, the proposed LMRC approach detected some important down-regulated biomarker genes those were not detected by other approaches. Therefore, in this paper, our proposal is to use LMRC for robust identification of significant interactions between genes and chemical compounds/drugs.",Network-based approach to identify molecular signatures and therapeutic agents in Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606694,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 04 03,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a dynamic degeneration of the brain with progressive dementia. Considering the uncertainties in its molecular mechanism, in the present study, we employed network-based integrative analyses, and aimed to explore the key molecules and their associations with small drugs to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic agents for the AD. First of all, we studied a transcriptome dataset and identified 1521 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Integration of transcriptome data with protein-protein and transcriptional regulatory interactions resulted with central (hub) proteins (UBA52, RAC1, CREBBP, AR, RPS11, SMAD3, RPS6, RPL12, RPL15, and UBC), regulatory transcription factors (FOXC1, GATA2, YY1, FOXL1, NFIC, E2F1, USF2, SRF, PPARG, and JUN) and microRNAs (mir-335-5p, mir-26b-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-124-3p, mir-17-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-20a-5p, mir-92a-3p, mir-106b-5p, and mir-192-5p) as key signaling and regulatory molecules associated with transcriptional changes for the AD. Considering these key molecules as potential therapeutic targets and Connectivity Map (CMap) architecture, candidate small molecular agents (such as STOCK1N-35696) were identified as novel potential therapeutics for the AD. This study presents molecular signatures at RNA and protein levels which might be useful in increasing discernment of the molecular mechanisms, and potential drug targets and therapeutics to design effective treatment strategies for the AD.",Phylogenetic implications and secondary structure analyses of Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper genotypes based on nrDNA ITS2 sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606693,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 04 03,"The internal transcribed spacers are highly preferred nuclear markers for the phylogenetic assessment of most eukaryotes, including plants. More recently, ITS2 has shown to possess equivalent phylogenetic significance as the entire ITS region. Vigna mungo L. Hepper is comparatively less explored from the molecular aspects as compared to the other species of the Vigna genus. The study presents the intra-individual characterization of 24 distinct genotypes Vigna mungo L. Hepper, using morphological as well as nrDNA ITS2 sequences and secondary structural data. The morphological characterization has been carried out using nine important agro-morphological traits. The molecular phylogeny of the sequence data, using the maximum parsimony and neighbor joining methods, shows the significant distinction based on the haplotypic variations amongst blackgram genotypes. The ITS2 secondary structures predicted using the homology modeling approach were compatible with the eukaryote-universal ITS2 secondary structure. The sequence-structure phylogeny reconstructed using the profile neighbour joining approach, also showed the presence of haplotypic variations in form of clusters on the phylogenetic tree. Further, the high GC content in the sequence data and highly negative ΔG values of the folded secondary structures ruled out the possibilities of the presence of any pseudogenes in the data set. Our analysis recommends the use of ITS2 sequence and secondary structure data at the intraspecific levels of plant taxonomical classification. Moreover, this study for the very first time reports the combined use morphological, and molecular data (using ITS2 sequence and secondary structural information) for the characterization of plants at the varietal level of taxonomical classification.",Acinetobacter baumannii outer membrane protein A induces HeLa cell autophagy via MAPK/JNK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606692,International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,2019 06 13,"Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved self-balancing process that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis via the clearance of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. Infection-triggered autophagy specifically inhibits the invasion of intracellular bacterial replication and hence protects the cells from microbial infections. It has been reported that Acinetobacter baumannii trigger cell autophagy. However, the role of its virulence protein OmpA remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of Acinetobacter baumannii OmpA on cell autophagy and its underlying molecular mechanisms. The results showed that OmpA induced autophagy in HeLa and RAW264.7 cells, increased LC3BII expression, and hindered p62 degradation. Moreover, OmpA triggered incomplete autophagy by interfering the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Besides, OmpA activated MAPK/JNK signaling pathway and enhanced the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38, and ERK, c-Jun. Inhibition of JNK signaling pathway suppressed OmpA-induced autophagy in HeLa cells. Ab wild-type strains carrying OmpA triggered incomplete autophagy and resulted in a large number of IL-1β production. Ab-△OmpA strain (OmpA gene mutation) restored autophagic flux and reduced the accumulation of p62 and the release of IL-1β in HeLa cells. Rapamycin activated autophagy to inhibit OmpA-induced IL-1β secretion and protect HeLa cells from inflammatory damage. Collectively, these results suggest that OmpA can induce autophagy in HeLa cells through MAPK/JNK signaling pathway. Pre-treatment with Rapamycin activates autophagy and protects against cell death.",The ArlR-MgrA regulatory cascade regulates PIA-dependent and protein-mediated biofilm formation in Rbf-dependent and Rbf-independent pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606691,International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,2019 06 13,"The two-component system response regulator ArlR and the global regulator MgrA in Staphylococcus aureus participated in numerous biological processes including biofilm formation inhibition. Previous studies have shown that these two regulators could function as a regulatory cascade. Rbf is a positive regulator of biofilm formation enhancing the production of PIA (polysaccharide intercellular adhesin). Here we have demonstrated that both ArlR and MgrA can directly bind to the promoter of rbf and repress its expression. ArlR and MgrA can also directly bind to the promoter of ica operon and enhance the expression of icaA and PIA production, revealing that the ArlR-MgrA regulatory cascade controls PIA-dependent biofilm formation. In addition, we have found that Rbf can directly bind to the aur promoter and repress the expression of aur, which encodes a protease initiating a protease cascade to inhibit protein-mediated biofilm formation. Moreover, our data indicate that the ArlR-MgrA regulatory cascade can promote the expression of aur by directly binding to its promoter and inhibit protein-mediated biofilm formation. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of both PIA-dependent and protein-mediated biofilm formation modulated by the ArlR-MgrA regulatory cascade and the new role of Rbf in protein-mediated biofilm formation, and broaden our understanding of the biofilm formation regulation in S. aureus.",Phenotypic and molecular characterization of Escherichia albertii: Further surrogates to avoid potential laboratory misidentification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606690,International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,2019 06 13,"Escherichia albertii is an emerging gastrointestinal pathogen, related to Escherichia coli, which can be misidentified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), due to the presence of the eae gene in E. albertii. The aim of this study was to verify our hypothesis that E. coli cytolethal distending toxin-II (Eccdt-II) gene-positive E. coli is E. albertii and to accumulate the data regarding the bacteriological characteristics of E. albertii. For these purposes, we attempted to detect E. albertii in eae gene-positive bacteria previously identified as E. coli and to examine if re-identified E. albertii contained Eccdt-II-homologous gene and remaining eae gene-positive E. coli did not. A total of 373 eae gene-positive E. coli strains were analyzed by biochemical tests, multilocus sequence analysis and an E. albertii-specific PCR. The strains re-identified as E. albertii were also examined for the presence of cdt genes by using 32P-labled DNA probes, followed by their toxin-typing. Of the 373 strains, 17 were re-identified as E. albertii by three above-mentioned methods. Furthermore, all the 17 re-identified E. albertii possessed cdt genes highly homologous to Eccdt-II and Eacdt genes. Moreover, Eccdt-I or both Eccdt-I and stx2f genes were detected in two re-identified E. albertii strains. However, the remaining 356 strains did not carry such cdt genes. These data indicate that all re-identified E. albertii isolates specifically carried cdt genes homologous to Eccdt-II and Eacdt genes. We suggest that Eccdt-II gene-positive E. coli may be identical to E. albertii.",Vacuum extraction for non-rotational and rotational assisted vaginal birth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606689,Best practice & research.

Vacuum extraction can avoid prolonged second stage of labour, birth asphyxia in the presence of foetal distress or maternal pushing where contraindicated. Vacuum-assisted births - particularly those in midpelvic rotational births - have been increasingly traded for caesarean births, although the latter are generally associated with potentially a greater risk to women and (future) children. In this article, (contra)indications and the basics of vacuum technique are elaborated. A specific section is dedicated to vacuum extraction for rotational birth. If these techniques are known, trained and practiced by obstetric care givers, then vacuum extraction has tremendous potential to make childbirth safer."

However, fundamental studies on the effect of ultrasound on electrode kinetics i.e. on the electron-transfer are scarce. The main question still remains to be answered: Does power ultrasound affect heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics? This opinion paper discusses the effect of ultrasonic frequency and intensity upon the electrode kinetic parameters such as the half-wave potential (E1/2) and the apparent heterogeneous rate constant (ko). A few sonoelectrochemical studies have highlighted changes in half-wave potential and in apparent heterogeneous rate constant for both quasi-reversible and irreversible systems when the data were compared to silent conditions. These observations are thought to be due to the contribution of mass-transport and macroscopic temperature effects, as well as the continuous cleaning of the electrode surface caused by the collapse of high-energy cavitation bubbles and the production of high velocity jets of liquid. However, there still remains mechanistic controversy in assigning whether these findings could also be due to localised temperature increases, the contribution of sonolysis products or solely due to enhanced mass-transport at the electrode surface. Thus, the effect of stirring, macroscopic temperature and sonication time upon these electrode kinetic parameters is also shown to be important factors in comparing the validity of any sonoelectrochemical effects.","Structure-guided discovery of a novel, potent, and orally bioavailable 3,5-dimethylisoxazole aryl-benzimidazole BET bromodomain inhibitor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606676,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 03 29,"The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins, consisting of the bromodomains containing protein 2 (BRD2), BRD3, BRD4, and the testis-specific BRDT, are key epigenetic regulators of gene transcription and has emerged as an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Herein, we describe the discovery of a novel potent BET bromodomain inhibitor, using a systematic structure-based approach focused on improving potency, metabolic stability, and permeability. The optimized dimethylisoxazole aryl-benzimidazole inhibitor exhibited high potency towards BRD4 and related BET proteins in biochemical and cell-based assays and inhibited tumor growth in two proof-of-concept preclinical animal models.",Acid-controlled release complexes of podophyllotoxin and etoposide with acyclic cucurbit[n]urils for low cytotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606675,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 01 20,"The targeted or responsive systems are appealing therapeutic platforms for the development of next-generation precision medications. So, we design and prepare acid-controlled release complexes of podophyllotoxin (POD) and etoposide (VP-16) with pH-labile acyclic cucurbit[n]urils, and their characteristics and inclusion complexation behaviors were investigated via fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray power diffraction. Cells incubated with complexes have been analyzed by high-content analysis (HCA), and cytotoxicity tests have been completed by MTT assay. The results showed that complexes with different binding constants can release the drug substance in the physiological pH environment of cancer cells, maintain good anticancer activity, and have low cytotoxicity. This provides a strategy about targeted and responsive systems of POD and VP-16 for clinical application.","Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking of benzimidazole grafted benzsulfamide-containing pyrazole ring derivatives as novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606674,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 01 20,"Tubulin-targeting drugs have increasingly become the focus of anticancer drugs research. Twenty-five novel benzimidazole grafted benzsulfamide-containing pyrazole ring derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for bioactivity as potential tubulin polymerization inhibitors.

P97 has a significant role in maintaining the cellular protein homeostasis for tumor cell growth and survival and has been found overexpressed in many tumor types. No new molecule entities based on p97 target were approved in clinic. Herein, a series of novel pyrimidine structures as p97 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. After enzymatic evaluations, structure-activity relationships (SAR) were discussed in detailed. Among the screened compounds, derivative 35 showed excellent enzymatic inhibitory activity (IC50, 36 nM). The cellular inhibition results showed that compound 35 had good antiproliferative activity against the non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells (IC50, 1.61 μM). Liver microsome stability showed that the half-life of compound 35 in human liver microsome was 42.3 min, which was more stable than the control CB-5083 (25.8 min). The in vivo pharmacokinetic results showed that the elimination phase half-lives of compound 35 were 4.57 h for ig and 3.64 h for iv, respectively and the oral bioavailability was only 4.5%. These results indicated that compound 35 could be effective for intravenous treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","Synthesis of 5a,5a'-dicarba-d-glucobioses from conformationally restricted carbaglucosyl triflates using SN2-type inversion with carbaglucosyl nucleophiles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606671,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 05 27,"Novel carbohydrate mimics were designed which contain two 5a-carba-d-glucose residues, one each at reducing and nonreducing end, and thus these mimics are 5a,5a'-dicarba-d-glucobioses.

Therefore, when new therapeutic agents targeting these malignant cancer cells were explored, we found that caged-xanthone (CX) isolated from the roots of Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniflorum diminished the expression of NF-κB, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein levels, cell migration and invasion, and sphere-forming ability of A549RT-eto cells. To address the role of NF-κB in these malignant cancer features, we treated A549RT-eto cells with NF-κB siRNAs in the present work. We found that the knockdown of NF-κB inhibited EMT and sphere formation. Furthermore, co-treatment with CX and NF-κB siRNA accelerated the death of apoptotic cells through the decrease of P-gp protein levels. These results suggest that NF-κB was involved in malignant cancer phenotypes and MDR in A549RT-eto cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that CX can be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of malignant tumor cells.",African Americans are less likely to have elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606666,Journal of vascular surgery,2019 01 04,"Recently published Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for both elective and emergent treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in patients with suitable anatomy.

The purpose is motivated by the fact that sodium monitoring is challenging and still in the area of exploratory analysis despite its biological importance. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which sodium diffusion has been investigated by time-dependent acoustic impedance measurements provided by SAM. We first tested the idea in an agarose phantom as a proof-of-concept. Accordingly, we designed the agarose phantom which initially contains a well of sodium chloride (NaCl) solution moving radially into the phantom. By using NaCl diffusion in the phantom, we obtained two-dimensional (2D) acoustic impedance (Z) maps over time through SAM operating with 80 MHz ultrasonic transducer having a lateral resolution of 20 μm. A linear correlation between the changes in the concentration profile of the phantom and its acoustic impedance was introduced. Analysis of experimental data proved that spatially changing acoustic impedance could be ascribed to the diffusion process and produced a diffusion coefficient in the order of 10-5 cm2/s which matches well with the literature. Our results showed that SAM could monitor the time-dependent alterations in acoustic impedance resulting from the diffusion of sodium inside the agarose phantom. With this study, SAM shows a promise as a monitoring tool not only to obtain static images but also to perform dynamic investigations of sodium ions with the advantages of providing images in micrometer resolution with a scanning time no longer than 2 min for an image area of 4.8 mm × 4.8 mm.",Real-time H-scan ultrasound imaging using a Verasonics research scanner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606648,Ultrasonics,2019 05 09,"H-scan ultrasound (US) is a new imaging technique that relies on matching a model that describes US image formation to the mathematics of a class of Gaussian-weighted Hermite polynomials (GH).

Herein, we detail development of a real-time H-scan US imaging technology that was implemented on a programmable US research scanner (Vantage 256, Verasonics Inc, Kirkland, WA). This custom US imaging system has a dual display for real-time visualization of both the H-scan and B-scan US images. This MATLAB-based (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA) system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling the entire US scan sequence including the raw radio frequency (RF) data acquisition parameters, image processing, variable control of a parallel set of convolution filters used to derive the H-scan US signal, and data (cine loop) save. The system-level structure used for software-based image reconstruction and display is detailed. Imaging studies were conducted using a series of homogeneous and heterogeneous tissue-mimicking phantom materials embedded with monodisperse spherical US scatterers of size 15-40 µm in diameter. Relative to H-scan US image measurements from a phantom with 15 µm-sized scatterers, data from phantoms with the 30 and 40 µm-sized scatterers exhibited mean intensity increases of 5.2% and 11.6%, respectively.

The elimination route of mAbs is cellular uptake by nonspecific pinocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by proteolytic degradation which is protected by neonatal Fc-receptor or mediated by antigenic target. There is a wide-interindividual variability in mAbs exposure due to target burden and other factors affecting unique their pharmacokinetics. It has been reported that higher exposures are correlated with better clinical outcomes of various therapeutic mAbs. On the other hand, flat exposure-efficacy relationships of anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolmab and pembrolizumab mean ensuring absolute maximum efficacy in each patient by the approved dose regardless of their large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics. Administration of mAbs can induce production of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which impact on their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of mAbs, when total (free, soluble target bound and ADAs bound) mAbs concentration is measured, ADAs content (concentration/titer) should be also monitored because mAbs exists in inactive complex with ADAs.

The use of the photocatalytic approach in reduction reactions seems very promising and can open new horizons for green chemistry synthesis. For this purpose, titanium dioxide nanotubes (TNTs) were developed in autoclave conditions using TiO2 P25 as a precursor material. Based on these nanotubular substrates, TiO2/CoFe2O4 (TCF) nanocomposites were further obtained by wet impregnation method. The materials were thoroughly characterized and their structural, textural, vibrational, optoelectronic and magnetic properties were determined. The composite materials combine absorbance in the visible optical range and high BET surface area values (˜100 m2/g), showing extremely high yield in the photocatalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), exceeding 94% within short illumination time (only 35 min). The developed nanocomposites were successfully reused in consecutive photocatalytic experiments and were easily removed from the reaction medium using magnets. Both remarkable recycling ability and high-performance stability in the photocatalytic reduction of nitrophenol were observed, thus justifying the significant economic potential and industrial perspectives for this advanced reduction process.",Health differentials between citizens and immigrants in Europe: A heterogeneous convergence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606616,"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 02 11,"The literature on immigration and health has provided mixed evidence on the health differentials between immigrants and citizens, while a growing body of evidence alludes to the unhealthy assimilation of immigrants. Relying on five different health measures, the present paper investigates the heterogeneity in health patterns between immigrants and citizens, and also between immigrants depending on their country of origin. We use panel data on more than 100,000 older adults living in nineteen European countries. Our panel data methodology allows for unobserved heterogeneity. We document the existence of a healthy immigrant effect, of an unhealthy convergence, and of a reversal of the health differentials between citizens and immigrants over time. We are able to estimate the time threshold after which immigrants' health becomes worse than that of citizens. We further document some heterogeneity in the convergence of health differentials between immigrants and citizens in Europe. Namely, the unhealthy convergence is more pronounced in terms of chronic conditions for immigrants from low-HDI countries, and in terms of self-assessed health and body-mass index for immigrants from medium- and high-HDI countries.",Mechanisms of Spatiotemporal Selectivity in Cortical Area MT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606614,Neuron,2019 03 06,"Cortical sensory neurons are characterized by selectivity to stimulation. This selectivity was originally viewed as a part of the fundamental ""receptive field"" characteristic of neurons. This view was later challenged by evidence that receptive fields are modulated by stimuli outside of the classical receptive field. Here, we show that even this modified view of selectivity needs revision. We measured spatial frequency selectivity of neurons in cortical area MT of alert monkeys and found that their selectivity strongly depends on luminance contrast, shifting to higher spatial frequencies as contrast increases. The changes of preferred spatial frequency are large at low temporal frequency, and they decrease monotonically as temporal frequency increases. That is, even interactions among basic stimulus dimensions of luminance contrast, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency strongly influence neuronal selectivity. This dynamic nature of neuronal selectivity is inconsistent with the notion of stimulus preference as a stable characteristic of cortical neurons.",Developmental Heterogeneity of Microglia and Brain Myeloid Cells Revealed by Deep Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606613,Neuron,2019 05 08,"Microglia are increasingly recognized for their major contributions during brain development and neurodegenerative disease. It is currently unknown whether these functions are carried out by subsets of microglia during different stages of development and adulthood or within specific brain regions. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of microglia and related myeloid cells sorted from various regions of embryonic, early postnatal, and adult mouse brains. We found that the majority of adult microglia expressing homeostatic genes are remarkably similar in transcriptomes, regardless of brain region. By contrast, early postnatal microglia are more heterogeneous. We discovered a proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAM) subset, mainly found in developing white matter, that shares a characteristic gene signature with degenerative disease-associated microglia (DAM). Such PAM have amoeboid morphology, are metabolically active, and phagocytose newly formed oligodendrocytes. This scRNA-seq atlas will be a valuable resource for dissecting innate immune functions in health and disease.",Calreticulin mutation specific CAL2 immunohistochemistry accurately identifies rare calreticulin mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606612,Pathology,2019 05 29,"Mutations of the multifunctional protein calreticulin (CALR) are recognised as one of the main driver alterations involved in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph- MPN) and also represent a major diagnostic criterion in the most recent World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms. Nowadays, quantitative assessment of the driver mutations is gaining importance, as recent studies demonstrated the clinical relevance of the mutation load reflecting the size of the mutant clone. Here, we performed for the first time a manual and automated quantitative assessment of the CALR mutation load at protein level using CAL2, a recently developed CALR mutation specific monoclonal antibody, on a cohort of 117 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and compared the CALR protein mutation loads with the CALR mutation load values established by a molecular assay. Eighteen different CALR mutations were detected in the cohort of the 91 CALR mutant cases. Mutation loads of the CALR mutations were between 13% and 94% with mean value in PMF cases significantly higher than ET cases (49.94 vs 41.09; t-test, p=0.004). Cases without CALR mutation (n=26) showed no or only minimal labelling with the CAL2 antibody, while all 18 different types of CALR mutations were associated with CAL2 labelling. The CALR mutation load showed a significant correlation (p=0.03) with the occurrence of major thrombotic events, with higher mutation load in patients presenting with these complications. We report a 100% concordance between the mutation status determined by immunohistochemistry and the CALR molecular assay, and we extend the applicability of this approach to 16 rare CALR mutations previously not analysed at protein level.",Mammalian INO80 chromatin remodeler cooperates with FANCM to mediate DNA interstrand crosslink-induced checkpoint activation and repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606611,DNA repair,2019 04 02,"Chromatin regulators play crucial roles in the DNA damage response. While the chromatin changes needed for double-strand break repair and nucleotide excision repair have been intensely studied, the chromatin requirements of interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair have remained largely unexplored. Here, we studied the effect of silencing the INO80 chromatin remodeler subunits on the cellular response to ICLs. Cells depleted of Ino80 ATPase were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) and defective in FANCD2 chromatin recruitment. Ino80-deficient cells displayed strongly reduced Chk1 phosphorylation after MMC treatment indicating impaired ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling, likely due to the significantly slower RPA foci formation which we observed in these cells. MMC treatment of cells silenced for FANCM - a protein required for ICL-induced checkpoint signaling, Ino80 or both genes simultaneously led to similar decreases in RPA phosphorylation suggesting that the two proteins were involved in the same checkpoint pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data indicated that Ino80 and FANCM interact physically. Taken together our data demonstrate for the first time that the INO80 chromatin remodeler cooperates with FANCM to mediate ICL-induced checkpoint activation by promoting accumulation of RPA at the lesion sites. This constitutes a novel mechanism by which the INO80 chromatin remodeler participates in the repair of ICLs and genome integrity maintenance."

The effects of different types of polymeric-substrate, drying process, and thermal heat-treatment on the crystallization process of calcium phosphate nano-particles were studied. As-synthesized particles were treated with different chemical surface agents to improve their surface charge, cell growth, and cell adhesion properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses were employed to explore the phase composition and specific surface area of synthesized powders, respectively. Results showed that the presence of oil in PVA/oil system results in crystallization of mesoporous HA/βTCP particles with the surface area of 93 cm2/g, while using gelatin/oil mixture leads to crystallization of pure HA nano-particles with the surface area of 115 cm2/g. Using Rietveld method, the amounts of HA/βTCP and amorphous phases in the oven-dried PVA substrated powders after heat-treatment were calculated as about 65, 13, and 22 wt%, respectively. Interfacial tension energy (IFT) results indicated that PVA could reduce interfacial tension energy of oil/water mixture from 21.6 mN/m to 7.0 mN/m. The ZETA potential measurements showed that using 25 wt% of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as surface modifier could increase zeta values from -21 ± 1 to -42 ± 1 mV. According to cell viability results, synthesized powder in the presence of oil/PVA, which was then modified by 25 wt% of TEOS, did not cause toxicity. Using Alizarin Red S staining quantification assay, it was found that after modification by TEOS, bone-nodule formation was enhanced by 25%. Furthermore, cell adhesion of the TEOS-modified surface was found to be significantly higher than that of non-modified one. Altogether, granulation method successfully led to improvement of synthesized porous HA/βTCP nanoparticles' physio-chemical properties.",Lithospermi radix extract-containing bilayer nanofiber scaffold for promoting wound healing in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606599,"Materials science & engineering.

LR extract, which has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for treating skin wounds, was added to a biocompatible gelatin solution. After glutaraldehyde vapor was used to modify the surface of chitosan scaffolds, various ratios of mammalian gelatin and fish collagen (GF100, GF91 and GF82) were electrospun onto the chitosan scaffolds to manufacture bilayer scaffolds. The porous chitosan scaffolds with a high swelling ratio showed efficient exudate absorption ability. GF91 gelatin nanofibers electrospun at a constant flow rate at 0.1 mL/h and a voltage of 20 kV displayed the optimal characteristics required for cell attachment and skin tissue regeneration. Moreover, the LR extract was successfully released slowly from the GF91 nanofibers. The investigation of the wound-healing activity of the chitosan/gelatin (CGF) bilayer scaffolds revealed that CGF91L provided the highest wound recovery rate in vivo in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.

Galvanic corrosion between α-Mg matrix and β-(MgZn)3Gd compounds is the main corrosion mechanism of the two GZKM-1 alloys. Larger α-Mg peeled off from the as-cast samples, then expanded corrosion reaction along discontinuous β-(MgZn)3Gd compounds making a pit corrosion phenomenon in macro view.

The pore sizes ranged from 100 to 500 μm. Manufacturing parameters were tuned from sub-critical to super-critical conditions to optimize porosity, pore size, pore interconnectivity, and mechanical properties. The biological behavior of the constructs was evaluated by in vitro toxicity and proliferation assays and in vivo subcutaneous biocompatibility.

The rate of production of ROS was higher when CuO-Au nanoalloys were present in a solution containing DPBF and H2O2 (0.1092 min-1). The absorption peak of DPBF at 430 nm decreased confirming the generation of ROS. The CuO-Au nanoalloys were evaluated their potential use for colorimetric detection of glucose. The detection limit for glucose was obtained to be 6.75 μM. The detection of glucose took place in two steps and at different pH conditions, first glucose oxidation by glucose oxidase occurred in physiological pH (7.4) at 37 °C.

In this context, the objective of this work is the generation and evaluation in vitro of supports obtained from mixtures of starch with poly (lactic acid) (PLA), treated with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptides (RGD). For this, non-woven fibers of PLA with different starch content (0.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0%wt) were obtained using the electrospinning technique. Then the physical absorption of RGD was carried out, with the aim of increasing the cellular adhesion of the polymeric material.

Regarding biocompatibility results, only viable cells were found for all the compositions, and the biocompatibility of the materials was validated by the morphological analysis of the cultured cells, where extended cells were observed. Proliferation assays show that osteoblasts proliferate better on the surfaces of PLA and PLA with 5.0% starch scaffolds.

The obtained PCL/SeNPs microspheres were in the range 1-4 μm with the encapsulation efficiency of about 90%. The degradation process and release behavior of SeNPs from PCL microspheres were investigated in five different degradation media: phosphate buffer solution (PBS), a solution of lipase isolated from the porcine pancreas in PBS, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cell-free extract in PBS and implant fluid (exudate) from the subcutaneously implanted sterile polyvinyl sponges which induce a foreign-body inflammatory reaction. The samples were thoroughly characterized by SEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, PSA, DSC, confocal microscopy, and ICP-OES techniques. Under physiological conditions at neutral pH, a very slow release of SeNPs occurred (3 and 8% in the case of PBS or PBS + lipase, respectively and after 660 days), while in the acidic environment their presence was not detected. On the other hand, the release in the medium with bacterial extract was much more pronounced, even after 24 h (13%). After 7 days, the concentration of SeNPs reached a maximum of around 30%. Also, 37% of SeNPs have been released after 11 days of incubation of PCL/SeNPs in the implant exudate. These results suggest that the release of SeNPs from PCL was triggered by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 bacterium as well as by foreign body inflammatory reaction to implant. Furthermore, PCL/SeNPs microspheres were investigated in terms of their biocompatibility. For this purpose, cytotoxicity, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genotoxicity were evaluated on HepG2 cell line. The interaction of PCL/SeNPs with phagocytic cell line (Raw 264.7 macrophages) was monitored as well. It was found that the microspheres in investigated concentration range had no acute cytotoxic effects. Finally, SeNPs, as well as PCL/SeNPs, showed a considerable antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 1228). These results suggest that PCL/SeNPs-based system could be an attractive platform for a prolonged prevention of infections accompanying implants."

Bioactive glass nanoparticles (nBG) or mesoporous BG nanospheres (nMBG) were incorporated during the polymerization reaction to produce simultaneous formation and foaming of porous nanocomposite scaffolds. The in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds was assessed in simulated body fluid (SBF), and through cytocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation assays with stem cells. Bone regeneration properties of the scaffold materials were in vivo assessed by using a critical-sized femoral defect model in rat. The scaffold nanocomposites showed excellent cytocompatibility and ability to accelerate the crystallization of bone-like apatite in vitro. nBG/PU bionanocomposite scaffold exhibited the higher capacity to stimulate osteogenic cell differentiation as judged by an increased ALP activity and the presence of mineralized nodules associated with the stem cells. nBG (5%)/PU scaffold significantly also produces in vivo a denser and more significant amount of new bone after 8 weeks of implantation, which is attributed to the more rapid dissolution rate of nBG into osteogenic ionic products compared to nMBG. The results of this work show that the in situ polymerization method combined with the use of nanodimensional BG particles enable the production of PU - based scaffolds with enhanced bioactive properties to stimulate the bone tissue regeneration.",Enhanced treatment effect of nanoparticles containing cisplatin and a GSH-reactive probe compound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606575,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 12,"Cisplatin is a highly effective antitumor drug, which can kill cancer cells by crossing-linking DNA and inhibiting transcription, but this process is limited by the combination of cisplatin and many endogenous nucleophiles, such as glutathione (GSH). Thus, when cisplatin enter cells, it is potentially vulnerable to cytoplasmic inactivation by GSH. To settle this bottleneck, we designed and synthesized a probe compound (Probe 1) and fabricated pH-responsed cisplatin, Probe 1-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid NanoParticles (CPNPs) using a single-step sonication method. Probe 1 can specifically bind to GSH, thus avoiding the combination of GSH and cisplatin, and enhancing the pharmacological activity of cisplatin. In vitro studies have suggested CPNPs, compared with cisplatin, loaded lipid-polymer hybrid NanoParticles CNPs (Not contain Probe 1), could efficiently kill MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and A549 human nonsmall lung cancer cell.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 12,"Hydrogels are an increasingly attractive choice in the fields of regenerative medicine, wound care and tissue engineering as important forms of bio-scaffolds. For many clinical needs, injectable in situ crosslinkable hydrogels are strongly preferred, due to treatment effectiveness and ease of use. In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA), containing side-arms linked to photo-active coumarin moieties, was used for the preparation of wall-to-wall hydrogels. This photocrosslinkable HA, hereafter called HA-TEG-coumarin, produces colourless aqueous solutions that solidify upon near-UV irradiation (at a specific wavelength of 365 nm) via a clean [2 + 2] photocycloaddition reaction, without by-products formation. The crosslinking event, a robust and non-cytotoxic process, does not require catalysts or radical initiators: in the field of hyaluronan photocrosslinking, this innovative feature is significant to ensure the whole biocompatibility and to avoid collateral reactions. Mechanical and rheological tests showed that hyaluronan derivatives became hydrogels after 3-5 min of irradiation, with average values for bulk and surface elastic moduli of about 32 kPa and 193 kPa, respectively. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay showed that the hydrogels are porous and allow a good permeation for nutrients and growth factors. Cell metabolism and proliferation assays revealed that hydrogel-encapsulated fibroblasts maintained their viability and that HA-TEG-coumarin sustained the proliferation of non-adherent myoblasts. For all of these reasons and thanks to a safe free-radical approach, this novel hyaluronan coumarin derivative could be a good candidate for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.",Electrospun nanofiber regulates assembly of keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments of PANC-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606573,"Materials science & engineering.

We found that aligned nanofibers enhanced expression of E-cadherin and promoted assembly of keratin intermediate filaments. Meanwhile, the compositional variation show different preference on up-regulation of the two intermediate filaments. Compared to keratin, the assembly of vimentin intermediate filaments were promoted by incorporating bovine serum albumin (BSA) functionalized graphene oxide (BSA-GO) into polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers. Thus, our findings elucidate how the different physical factors of fibrous extracellular matrix affect the reorganization of cytoskeleton by assembly of keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments.",Chitosan and polyethylene glycol based membranes with antibacterial properties for tissue regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606572,"Materials science & engineering.

The properties that are relevant for intended applications in tissue regeneration and antibacterial coatings of implants were assessed. It was found that the addition of 1% (w/w - relative to the mass of CS) of each metal oxide promoted satisfactory bacteriostatic activity and exhibited no cytotoxic effects towards the Vero cell line. The formation of bonds between the CS/PEG matrix and ionic species from the powders enhanced the cross-linking degree and mechanical properties of composite membranes in comparison to the non-doped membrane with the same polymer matrix (CS/PEG = 70/30%).

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 12,"Superhydrophobic substrates facilitate low adhesion for biological liquid handling but are hampered by wetting state changes due to condensation. Here, meshed near-superhydrophobic substrates, that are easier to produce than two-tiered architecture substrates, are shown to provide good immunity to wetting state changes while imbuing high positional resistance to roll-off by tilting when tested with 5 and 10 μL volume drops (18° and 13° respectively) of human IgG antibodies in aqueous solution at both room temperature and 4 °C. Pneumatic actuation was applied to elicit horizontal drop movement over the near-SH surface without any fragmentation, wherein higher velocities can be achieved when smaller drops and higher air pressures are used (0.385 m/s at 33 mbar with the 5 μL drop). A non-contact mode of translating a protein drop towards a highly viscous oil-based adjuvant dispensed from a steel tip allowed for both drops to be combined and aspirated back up into the tip such that subsequent repeated cycles of pendant drop formation and upward aspiration allows for effective mixing to achieve a stable emulsion. The findings here advance the development of devices that enable improved antigen-adjuvant preparation by reducing the amount of reagents required and product losses from surface adsorption.",Hollow CuS nanocube as nanocarrier for synergetic chemo/photothermal/photodynamic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606570,"Materials science & engineering.

The surface morphologies of the hydrogels showed that the pectin and κ-carrageenan favors the formation of larger and more defined pores. The mechanical properties indicated that the pectin increased slightly the mechanical properties and the κ-carrageenan improves the mechanical properties of the synthetic hydrogel reaching up 400 N of compression load. Therefore, the entrapment of κ-carrageenan within synthetic hydrogels improved both the swelling and the mechanical properties. The biocompatibility of the hydrogels was evaluated with in vitro cytotoxicity assays and the results indicated that they could be considered as candidates for biomedical use.",Novel one step transformation method for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using arginine-glucose functionalized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606568,"Materials science & engineering.

The porosity of the microneedles is a gradient, and the pores are mainly distributed in the tip region. The liquid drug formulation can directly be loaded in the pores of the microneedle tips by dipping. GPMA could penetrate into the rabbit skin without breakage and the penetration force per microneedle is approximately 22 mN. The GPMA can diffuse a dry model drug, namely Rhodamine B, in vitro in the rabbit skin dermis.

At the lower Nb content a dual-phase α/β-alloy was formed consisting of hexagonal close-packed and body-centred cubic Ti-Nb, whereas at the higher Nb contents a single-phase β-alloy was formed of body-centred cubic Ti-Nb. The corrosion behaviour of the alloys prepared was assessed in Hanks' simulated body fluid solution at 310 K over extended periods of time. Potentiodynamic polarisation studies confirmed that the alloys exhibited passivation behaviour, and impedance studies revealed that the passive films formed on the surface of the alloys comprised a bi-layered structure. XPS analysis further proved that this contained hydroxyapatite at the top and native metal oxide underneath. The mechanical properties of the alloys were evaluated, and the elastic moduli and the Vickers hardness were both found to be in the range of that of bone.

This study opened the path towards the development of fully bioresorbable fibers promising for biosensing. In the past, this phosphate glass with CeO2 was found to increase the refractive index and the glass stability. Therefore, a new SrO-containing glass was prepared with 1 mol% of CeO2 and core fibers were drawn from it. A core-clad fiber was also processed, where the core was a Ce-doped glass and the clad undoped, to allow for total internal reflection. The mechanical properties of the core and core-clad fibers are discussed as a function of immersion time in TRIS-buffer solution. Finally, a sensing region was created, in the core-clad fiber, by etching the cladding using phosphoric acid. Then, the change in light transmission, upon immersion in TRIS-buffer solution, was quantified to assess the potential use of the novel core-clad fiber as a biosensor. Upon immersion in TRIS, the core-clad fiber was found to guide light effectively and to maintain a tensile strength of ~150-200 MPa up to 6 weeks in TRIS, clearly showing that this fiber has potential as a biosensing device.",A quantitative comparable study on multi-hierarchy conformation of acid and pepsin-solubilized collagens from the skin of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606554,"Materials science & engineering.

And further to conduct quantitative characterization on structural properties, self-assembly kinetics and gelation properties of these collagens. Herein, a two-step collagen extraction method (pepsin-pepsin) was established with the high yield. Meanwhile, structural measurements of high-yield collagen (pepsin-soluble collagen, PSC) and acid-soluble collagen (ASC) indicated that both collagens maintained the typical triple helical conformation of collagen type I. Moreover, the fibrillogenesis tests of PSC and ASC at the various temperatures confirmed that self-assembly were the entropy-driven process. The gelation time of both ASC and PSC was determined by the dynamic time sweep at the different frequencies combined with Winter's criterion. The self-assembly kinetics results showed that fibrillogenesis rate for ASC solution was faster, and more liable to gelation relative to PSC. Mechanical measurements suggested that ASC showed the more resistance ability to deformation than PSC due to more complicated architecture, confirmed by higher fractal dimension. However, the equivalent typical assemblies of PSC to ASC at the various stages can still be expected via controlling incubation time or temperature under the guidance of Arrhenius equation. This study would provide some strategies for achieving maximum utilization of waste biomass and significant insights into the mechanisms underlying the quantitative differences in multiple hierarchy conformation (molecule, fibrillogenesis and hydrogel) of ASC and PSC, which may benefit for subsequent design, development and optimization of collagen-based hydrogels in biomedical industries.",Development of PSMA-targeted and core-crosslinked glycol chitosan micelles for docetaxel delivery in prostate cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606553,"Materials science & engineering.

The degree of substitution was 5.2 PCP groups and 10.7 lipoic acid groups per 100 sugar residues of glycol chitosan in PGC-LA copolymer. Docetaxel (DTX) was chosen as a model anti-tumor drug. The DTX-loaded micelles were prepared by an o/w method, and core-crosslinked micelles were further constructed by using a catalytic amount of dithiothreitol. The mean diameter of DTX-loaded core-crosslinked PGC-LA (DTX-PGC-LA/cc) micelles was 397 nm determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). In vitro DTX released from core-crosslinked micelles was slower than that from non-crosslinked counterpart. Blank micelles exhibited good biocompatibility. Additionally, cellular uptake and cytotoxcity of PCP-modified micelles were higher than those of micelles without PCP in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. Importantly, DTX-PGC-LA/cc demonstrated the stronger anti-tumor efficacy against LNCaP tumor xenograft models than DTX injection and other DTX-loaded micelles. Taken together, this study provides a potential way in developing actively targeted and core-crosslinked micelles for hydrophobic drug delivery in cancer therapy.","Cellulose/vaterite nanocomposites: Sonochemical synthesis, characterization, and their application in protein adsorption.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606552,"Materials science & engineering.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"The emergence of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes is complicating malaria elimination efforts in Africa and alternative insecticides have to be considered for indoor residual spray. Unfortunately, the high volatility of WHO-approved organophosphate alternatives, e.g. malathion, translates into an early loss of residual efficacy. This laboratory study explored the concept of trilayer films as potential wall or ceiling linings. In the proposed design, the fugitive liquid insecticide is trapped in an inner core layer. The two sheath layers act as low-permeability membranes controlling the release of the insecticide. The concept was explored using poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as core and sheath polymers respectively. The polarity of the EVA polymer matrix allowed incorporation of substantial quantities (up to 30 wt%) of malathion. The low polarity of the LDPE provided the necessary barrier properties and, in addition, allowed film blowing to be conducted at relatively low processing temperatures. Trilayer films containing about 6 wt% malathion were prepared on a film blowing line. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the trilayer film structure. Confocal Raman microscopy studies revealed a malathion concentration gradient across the thickness of the polyethylene layers. Mass loss measurements and FTIR spectroscopy studies showed that the malathion release followed first-order kinetics. Bioassays, on samples aged at 22 °C, indicated that the residual efficacy against mosquitoes can be maintained for up to about six months. This suggests that trilayer films impregnated with organophosphates, may have potential as alternative mosquito control interventions in pyrethroid resistant settings.",Improvement of calcium phosphate scaffold osteogenesis in vitro via combination of glutamate-modified BMP-2 peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606550,"Materials science & engineering.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"Intensive efforts have been employed in modifying biomedical membranes. Among them, blending is recognized as a simple method. However, the conventional blending materials commonly lead to an insufficient modification, which is mainly caused by the poor miscibility between the blending materials and the matrixes, the elution of the hydrophilic materials from the matrixes during the use and storage, and the insufficient surface enrichment of the blending materials. Aiming to solve the abovementioned disadvantages, we developed novel polyethersulfone/poly(acrylic acid-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) networked submicrogels (PES/P(AA-VP) NSs), which were blended with PES to enhance the antifouling properties, antibacterial adhesion and haemocompatible properties of PES membranes. As results, the PES/P(AA-VP) NSs showed good miscibility with the PES matrix, and hydrophilic submicrogels would enrich onto the membrane surface during the phase inversion process due to the surface segregation. The entanglement between the PES matrix and the networked submicrogels would effectively limit the elution of the submicrogels. In conclusion, the modified PES membranes prepared by blending with the PES/P(AA-VP) NSs might draw great attention for the application in haemodialysis fields.","Synthesis, characterization and application of Ag doped ZnO nanoparticles in a composite resin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606547,"Materials science & engineering.

Integration of Eu3+ ions on CeO2 could unlock a new trail to optimize the photoluminescence properties of formed nanocrystals. The generated oxygen vacancies (Vo) have the ability to affect the characteristic features of cerium oxide in solid state. The variations in the nature of surface defect in presence of Eu3+ ions with CeO2 nanoparticles were explained with the results of XPS studies. The obtained results validated that defect-induced band gap modification by Eu3+ ion doping on CeO2 could be employed as effective chemical sensor for harmful metal ions in real water samples.",Responses of human urothelial cells to magnesium-zinc-strontium alloys and associated insoluble degradation products for urological stent applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606530,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"Current urological devices such as ureteral stents and catheters still face serious problems, such as encrustation and biofilm formation. Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys showed great potentials as an alternative material for urological devices, due to their excellent biodegradability and antibacterial property. In this study, a serial of four promising Mg alloys which contain zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr), i.e., Mg-4Zn-xSr (ZSr41) alloys, were investigated in vitro for potential ureteral stent application. Specifically, these four alloys have 4 wt% Zn in all and 0.15 wt% Sr in ZSr41_A, 0.5 wt% Sr in ZSr41_B, 1.0 wt% Sr in ZSr41_C and 1.5 wt% Sr in ZSr41_D. The cytocompatibility and degradation behaviors of Mg-4Zn-xSr alloys were studied by culturing with human urothelial cells (HUCs) for 24 h and 48 h using exposure culture method. ZSr41_B showed a better cytocompatibility with HUCs among all the Mg-4Zn-xSr alloys in both 24-hour and 48-hour cultures. Moreover, the cytocompatibility of insoluble degradation products of Mg, i.e., MgO and Mg(OH)2, was also investigated by culturing different concentrations of MgO and Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles with HUCs for 24 h and 48 h. The concentration of MgO and Mg(OH)2 particles at 0.5 mg/mL and above, showed a significant decrease of cell density and cell size after 24-hour and 48-hour cultures. The concentration of MgO and Mg(OH)2 at 1.0 mg/mL and above, showed no viable cells after 24-hour culture. Collectively, it is recommended to further reduce the degradation rates of Mg alloys in order to control possible side effects of the soluble and insoluble degradation products and to take the benefits of Mg-based biodegradable ureteral stents toward the future clinical translation.",Superparamagnetic hybrid microspheres affecting osteoblasts behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606529,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"The present work describes biomimetic hybrid microspheres made of collagen type I-like peptide matrix (RCP) mineralised with Fe2+/Fe3+ doping hydroxyapatite (RCPFeHA) by a bio-inspired process. Superparamagnetic RCPFeHA microspheres are obtained by emulsification of the hybrid slurries in the presence of citrate ions, to achieve a biomimetic surface functionalisation improving the bioactivity and the dispersion ability in cell culture medium. A biological in vitro study correlates the osteoblast cells behaviour to calcium and iron ions released by the hybrid microspheres in culture media mimicking physiological or inflammatory environment, evidencing a clear triggering of cell activity and bio-resorption ability. In presence of the microspheres, the osteoblast cells maintain their typical morphology and no cell damage were detected, whereas also showing up-regulation of osteogenic markers. The ability of the hybrid microspheres to undergo bio-resorption and release bioactive ions in response to different environmental stimuli without harmful effects opens new perspectives in bone regeneration, as magnetically active bone substitute with potential ability of drug carrier and smart response in the presence of inflammatory states.",Chitosan hydrogels containing nanoencapsulated phenytoin for cutaneous use: Skin permeation/penetration and efficacy in wound healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606527,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"Although phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug used in the oral treatment of epilepsy, its off-label use as a cutaneous healing agent has been studied in recent years due to the frequent reports of gingival hyperplasia after oral administration. However, the cutaneous topical application of phenytoin should prevent percutaneous skin permeation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro skin permeation/retention and in vivo effects of nanocapsules and nanoemulsions loaded with phenytoin and formulated as chitosan hydrogels on the healing process of cutaneous wounds in rats. The hydrogels had adequate pH values (4.9-5.6) for skin application, drug content of 0.025% (w/w), and non-Newtonian pseudoplastic rheological behaviour. Hydrogels containing nanocapsules and nanoemulsions enabled improved controlled release of phenytoin and adhesion to skin, compared with hydrogels containing non-encapsulated phenytoin. In vitro skin permeation studies showed that phenytoin permeation to the receptor compartment, and consequently the risk of systemic absorption, may be reduced by nanoencapsulation without any change in the in vivo performance of phenytoin in the wound healing process in rats.",Effect of surfactant concentration on textural characteristics and biomineralization behavior of mesoporous bioactive glasses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606526,"Materials science & engineering.

The surfactant of non-ionic block co-polymer used in the present work act as structure directing agent (SDA) with varying amount, which brings different textural properties. As prepared glasses possess wormhole-like mesostructure with different textural characteristics and it varies with surfactant concentrations. The pristine MBGs have been characterized by various analytical techniques before and after immersing in simulated body fluid (SBF). The textural properties show non-monotonous variations with varying the surfactant concentrations. We have quantified the various structural species present in the glass sample by using local structural probe such as nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Invitro studies on the MBGs revealed the influence of textural characteristics on the formation of nano-crystalline hydroxycarbonated apatite (HCA) layer. The biodegradability is largely related to the pore architecture and it affects the biocompatibility as well as bone formation. In-vitro studies reveals that there are serious negative effects that have been observed in the case of larger pore sized samples due to rapid degradation. We found that MBG with pore sizes of few nano meters exhibit favorable biocompatibility in vitro behavior and found to be promising candidate in the field of biomaterials including tissue regeneration and drug storage.",Plasmon enhanced photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities of Ag-TiO2 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation prepared by DBD cold plasma treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606525,"Materials science & engineering.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 13,"Mimicking the structural features of natural bone has been demonstrated to bring pronounced advantages for mechanical reinforcement of polymeric orthopedic substitutes that are composed of bioinert polymer matrix and bioactive fillers. However, to trigger effective bone formation and implant integration, the bioactivity of bone substitutes plays a vital role. We hypothesized that the use of hydroxyapatite (HA) and bioactive glass (BG), compared to the use of HA alone, could improve the biological properties of polymer-based bone substitutes. Herein, high-density polyethylene (PE) composites loaded with HA and BG were fabricated using a modified injection molding machine that can provide intense shear flow to regulate the hierarchical structure of the composites. Morphological observation revealed that bone-like structures were formed in both HA/PE and BG/HA/PE composites, showing highly oriented interlocked shish kebabs. In addition, the bioactive fillers were distributed uniformly. Osteoblast proliferation was promoted by the combination of HA and BG. The mechanism was the upregulation of Runx2 expression (1.51 ± 0.17) with BG and the activation of the TAZ/YAP (1.41/0.64) signaling pathway, which accelerated the generation of ossification-related proteins. BG can regulate microRNA to promote the mRNA expression of Runx2. The silencing of Runx2 expression can inhibit BG-induced osteoblast proliferation. These results suggest that the BG/HA/PE composites having a bone-like structure have high potential as bone substitutes to repair large bone defects.",Outcomes of Endoprosthetic Replacement for Salvage of Failed Fixation of Malignant Pathologic Proximal Femur Fractures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606513,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 05 02,"Internal fixation is often used to treat pathologic proximal femur fractures.

Two compounds are currently available for the treatment of ALS but the majority of trials have failed to show a positive effect on prognosis. One of the explanations which could be put forward involves the way efficacy is evaluated: clinicians agree that the ALSFRS-revised scale used in all trials does not fit with highlighting a positive effect. So, the development and validation of new tools allowing a reliable assessment of ALS has become a key issue in clinical research. Over the last three years, two functional scales (the King's College and MiToS staging systems) have been proposed. These scales rely on two different approaches to ALS: an anatomical and prognostic concept, and loss of autonomy. Both scales propose five stages. We will discuss below the contribution of these two scales to clinical evaluation and the questions which remain to be resolved in the future.",Neuroimaging and clinical trials with stem cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: present and future perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606510,Radiologia,2019 05 03,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare neurodegenerative disease with a rapid fatal course. The absence of effective treatments has led to new lines of research, some of which are based on stem cells. Surgical injection into the spinal cord, the most common route of administration of stem cells, has proven safe in trials to test the safety of the procedure. Nevertheless, challenges remain, such as determining the best route of administration or the way of checking the survival of the cells and their interaction with the therapeutic target. To date, the mission of neuroimaging techniques has been to detect lesions and complications in the spine and spinal cord, but neuroimaging also has the potential to supplant histologic study in analyzing the relations between the implanted cells and the therapeutic target, and as biomarkers of the disease, by measuring morphological and functional changes after treatment. These developments would increase the role of radiologists in the clinical management of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",Methylene Blue Monotherapy Compared With Combination Therapy With Hydroxocobalamin for the Treatment of Refractory Vasoplegic Syndrome: ARetrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606508,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019 04 17,To compare the efficacy of methylene blue with combination therapy with hydroxocobalamin in patients experiencing vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery.,"Distribution and chemical forms of cadmium in Coptis chinensis Franch. determined by laser ablation ICP-MS, cell fractionation, and sequential extraction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606507,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 07,"Coptis chinensis Franch., is a widely used medicinal plant in China. This plant is often contaminated by cadmium (Cd) and render health risk to human consumers. Understanding distribution of Cd and its chemical forms is important to evaluate accumulation of the metal and its detoxification mechanisms in this plant. Since few studies have focused on this aspect, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to spatially locate Cd in rhizome cross-sections, and ICP-MS to analyze the Cd subcellular distribution and the chemical forms of Cd in different tissues. Rhizome bioimaging results showed that Cd was distributed predominantly within the periderm, cortex, pith, and root trace vascular bundle. The LA-ICP-MS results suggested that Ca2+ channels might be a pathway for Cd entry into the plant. Subcellular distribution data indicated that most of Cd was associated with the cell wall (41.8-77.1%) and the soluble fraction (14.4-52.7%) in all tissues. Analysis of chemical forms revealed that majority Cd existed in less mobile and less toxic forms in all tissues, and P could convert to insoluble phosphate with Cd to moderate Cd toxicity. The new understanding of Cd accumulation and detoxification might provide novel strategies for reducing the levels of Cd in C. chinensis Franch., thereby mitigating its potential transfer to humans and providing a theoretical basis for evaluating the Cd status in other medicinal plants. Further, our findings might provide a basis for establishing a reasonable Cd limit level of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.",Preoperative C-reactive protein/albumin ratio to predict mortality and recurrence of patients after curative resection with hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606506,Medicina clinica,2019 01 04,Recent studies have shown that the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) can predict the mortality in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

It has become an important area of focus since it remains one of the most common reasons for admission in patients over the age of 65. Importantly, the incidence of HF has not declined within the past 20 years, but the survival after onset has increased in younger patients and men. This has been in part due to the growing interest in therapies that may decrease morbidity, mortality, along with the substantial health care expenditures associated with the disease. It can be said that over the past 50 years, there have been three distinct eras relating to HF management; a) the non-pharmacologic era, focused its treatments on fluid restriction; b) the pharmacologic era, marked by the increased use of inotropes and diuretics and the discovery of vasodilators, and the posterior discovery of medications relating to neurohormonal pathways; c) the device era, with the discovery, acceptance, and increased use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) among others.

Using a human monoclonal antibody phage display library, we screened new therapeutic antibodies for anthrax infection against protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis. Among 5 selected clones of antibodies based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results, 7B1 showed neutralizing activity to anthrax lethal toxin (LT) by inhibiting binding of the domain 4 of PA (PD4) to its cellular receptors. Through light chain shuffling process, we improved the productivity of 7B1 up to 25 folds. The light chain shuffled 7B1 antibody showed protective activity against LT both in vitro and in vivo.

A common feature of ICH is the accumulation of thrombin around the lesion site. Previous studies showed that thrombin promotes VEGF release and angiogenesis at a late stage post ICH [1]. In current study, we explored the source for thrombin-induced VEGF release by adding thrombin or its receptor agonist peptide to the neuronal or astrocytic primarily cultures. We identified that astrocytes specifically respond to thrombin by up-regulating and releasing VEGF. Furthermore, such release is dependent on p44/42 MAPKs and PAR1, a thrombin specific receptor. Our study therefore helps clarifying the underlying mechanisms of thrombin-induced VEGF release in ICH, which will further provide novel insights into the designing principles for treating ICH and traumatic brain injuries.",Upregulated AHIF-mediated radioresistance in glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606477,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 12,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in the pathobiology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Though radiotherapy remains the most effective component of multiple therapies for patients with GBM, lncRNAs conferring GBM radioresistance are less unknown. Here, the present study identified that the antisense transcript of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (AHIF) was upregulated in GBM cells after radiotherapy. The deregulation of AHIF affected GBM cell clonogenic formation, DNA repair and apoptosis. Notably, knockdown of AHIF inhibited tumorigenesis after radiotherapy in vivo. Further biochemical analysis identified that AHIF regulated proteins associated with apoptosis after radiotherapy. Thus, the present data illustrate that suppression of AHIF increases radiosensitivity in GBM cells, which may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for GBM patients.",Interleukin 4 inhibits high mobility group box-1 protein-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome formation by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in astrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606476,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 12,"High mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) is one of the most important DAMPs and has been previously shown to promote the formation of the NOD-like receptor with pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in microglia. Interleukin 4 (IL4) is a Th2-derived cytokine that plays a significant role in the function of various immune cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which IL4 signaling antagonizes NLRP3 inflammasome is poorly characterized. In particular, whether IL4 could modulate NLRP3 inflammasome in astrocytes remains unknown. In the present study, we elucidated this phenomenon and the mechanism by which IL4 inhibits HMGB1-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome formation in astrocytes. For this purpose, we cultured and extracted primary astrocytes, setup different concentrations of HMGB1, and used immunofluorescence and western blotting to detect NLRP3 inflammasome formation, including NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1, and signaling changes in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Meanwhile, BAY 11-7082 and IL4 were added with HMGB1 to observe the NLRP3 inflammasome and changes in NF-κB expression. Our data showed that HMGB1 could effectively promote NLRP3 inflammasome formation by activating NF-κB in astrocytes. This effect can be inhibited by BAY 11-7082, a NF-κB inhibitor. Meanwhile, IL4 could activate PPARγ via the STAT6 singling pathway and inhibit NF-κB activation, significantly decreasing formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Our study demonstrated that the NLRP3 inflammasome complex is also expressed in astrocytes, and IL4 could inhibit HMGB1-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome formation, through negative regulation of NF-κB activity and promotion of PPARγ activation.",Evaluation of natural dyes for human spermatozoa morphology assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606475,Acta histochemica,2019 05 16,"Dye extracts from plants have been valuable not only for the economy but also environmental sustainability. There have been many reports on the utilization of natural dyes extracted from various sources for staining of biological tissues. This study aimed to investigate the extraction of natural dye from black rice (Oryza Sativa), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea), fresh roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), and mulberry (Morus alba) to stain of human spermatozoa for morphology assessment. The results showed that black rice extracted from solvents C containing 5 ml of absolute ethanol, 10 g of potassium alum and 100 ml of distilled water is the best dye for human spermatozoa evaluation comparable to the rapid PAP and Dip quick® stain. Effectiveness of the process was found with black rice extract stain by using 2 steps for 15 min. There were no statistically significant differences in the parameters of head, midpiece, tail and background for human sperm morphology assessment comparable to rapid PAP and Dip quick® stain (p > 0.05) unless the midpiece compartment when compare to rapid PAP. This finding suggests that the black rice extracted has potential for use as an alternative dye for human spermatozoa morphology evaluation.

The Pid4 protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Introduction of Pid4 into susceptible rice cultivars confers race-specific resistance to leaf and neck blast. Amino acid sequence comparison and blast resistance spectrum tests showed that Pid4 is a novel R gene, different from the previously reported R genes located in the same gene cluster.

The field of cardiovascular medicine, rich in knowledge of molecular level disease mechanisms, is particularly well positioned to receive significant benefits from this technology. Specifically, a new generation of genome editing tools capable of introducing targeted sequence modifications at high frequencies initiated by induced DNA double-strand breaks has been developed. Of note is the RNA-guided genome editing system, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9), which has provided researchers and clinicians a malleable gene-targeting platform with high specificity. Recent reports have robustly demonstrated proof-of-concept in using CRISPR-Cas9 based gene therapy for treating common cardiovascular diseases and are testaments that the new genome editing technology holds promise for treating patients with cardiovascular ailments in the clinic in the near future. In light of this trend, a basic understanding of genome editing technology is becoming more relevant to clinical cardiologists. To this end, a concise explanation of terms and the biological basis of genome editing, on-going research, and clinical trials highly relevant to clinical application are presented. In conclusion, the aim of this short review is to introduce clinicians to the core concepts of current genome editing technology.",Study on internal stress damage detection in long-distance oil and gas pipelines via weak magnetic method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606451,ISA transactions,2019 05 29,"Weak magnetic stress detection is an important issue in oil-gas pipeline internal detection area. In order to verify the characteristics of weak magnetic stress internal detection signals, we built herein a magneto-mechanics equivalent model having a balanced magnetic field. First, we calculated the relationship between the stress and the weak magnetic signals; consequently, the analysis propagation laws of the weak magnetic signals with non-magnetic saturation were pointed out. Finally, the theoretical model was validated by a systematic experimental research. The analytical results show that a one-to-one linear link between the weak magnetic signals and the stress concentration is clear. Instead, the change of the weak magnetic signals with the liftoff is nonlinear, therefore we are proposing the Boltzmann liftoff correction factor whose degree of adaptability of the equivalent model can reach the value of 94%. It is possible to note that when the liftoff is in the approximate linear stage, the relevance ratio and the recognition rate of the magneto-mechanics curve show a high-quality. This conclusion is important in the engineering field for the set of the liftoff.",Mechanisms for Benzene Dissociation through the Excited State of T4 Lysozyme L99A Mutant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606449,Biophysical journal,2019 05 08,"The atomic-level mechanisms that coordinate ligand release from protein pockets are only known for a handful of proteins. Here, we report results from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations for benzene dissociation from the buried cavity of the T4 lysozyme Leu99Ala mutant (L99A). In these simulations, benzene is released through a previously characterized, sparsely populated room-temperature excited state of the mutant, explaining the coincidence for experimentally measured benzene off rate and apo protein slow-timescale NMR relaxation rates between ground and excited states. The path observed for benzene egress is a multistep ligand migration from the buried cavity to ultimate release through an opening between the F/G-, H-, and I-helices and requires a number of cooperative multiresidue and secondary-structure rearrangements within the C-terminal domain of L99A. These rearrangements are identical to those observed along the ground state to excited state transitions characterized by molecular dynamic simulations run on the Anton supercomputer. Analyses of the molecular properties of the residues lining the egress path suggest that protein surface electrostatic potential may play a role in the release mechanism. Simulations of wild-type T4 lysozyme also reveal that benzene-egress-associated dynamics in the L99A mutant are potentially exaggerations of the substrate-processivity-related dynamics of the wild type.",Nonlinear Actomyosin Elasticity in Muscle?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606448,Biophysical journal,2019 02 06,"Cyclic interactions between myosin II motor domains and actin filaments that are powered by turnover of ATP underlie muscle contraction and have key roles in motility of nonmuscle cells. The elastic characteristics of actin-myosin cross-bridges are central in the force-generating process, and disturbances in these properties may lead to disease. Although the prevailing paradigm is that the cross-bridge elasticity is linear (Hookean), recent single-molecule studies suggest otherwise. Despite convincing evidence for substantial nonlinearity of the cross-bridge elasticity in the single-molecule work, this finding has had limited influence on muscle physiology and physiology of other ordered cellular actin-myosin ensembles. Here, we use a biophysical modeling approach to close the gap between single molecules and physiology. The model is used for analysis of available experimental results in the light of possible nonlinearity of the cross-bridge elasticity. We consider results obtained both under rigor conditions (in the absence of ATP) and during active muscle contraction. Our results suggest that a wide range of experimental findings from mechanical experiments on muscle cells are consistent with nonlinear actin-myosin elasticity similar to that previously found in single molecules. Indeed, the introduction of nonlinear cross-bridge elasticity into the model improves the reproduction of key experimental results and eliminates the need for force dependence of the ATP-induced detachment rate, consistent with observations in other single-molecule studies. The findings have significant implications for the understanding of key features of actin-myosin-based production of force and motion in living cells, particularly in muscle, and for the interpretation of experimental results that rely on stiffness measurements on cells or myofibrils.",Disseminated canine mold infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606445,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 01 14,"Disseminated canine mold infections are reviewed. Case inclusion criteria were dogs as hosts, two or more non-adjacent organs affected and identification of the etiological agent at least to the genus level. Of the 157 cases identified, 59.3% were caused by Aspergillus spp. of which 36.3% belonged to the section Terrei. German Shepherd breed dogs constituted 67.8% of the cases, 89.7% of which were caused by fungi of the section Terrei. Female dogs constituted 72.7% of the cases. The average age was 4.3years (range 1-13years). Pathogenesis, especially virulence factors facilitating the hematogenous dissemination, are discussed. Clinical signs reported most frequently included weight loss, lethargy, discospondylitis, osteomyelitis, urinary tract infections, ophthalmitis, head tilt and gait difficulties. Of 50 dogs with data on temperature, 25 had a fever of 40°C (104°F) or above. The most common hematologic and biochemical test result aberrations included increased neutrophil counts and serum protein concentration, azotemia and decreased urine specific gravity. The diagnostic value of fungal antigen detection, antibody titers and imaging are discussed. An attempt to treat was made in 59 (37.6%). Failure and relapses (sometimes after years) were common, but there was some success observed in eight cases. Identification of the gene/s predisposing dogs to disseminated mycoses, increased awareness, improved diagnostic methods and less expensive drugs should contribute to the reduction of disseminated mold infections in dogs in the future.",Effects of oral versus parenteral cobalamin supplementation on methylmalonic acid and homocysteine concentrations in dogs with chronic enteropathies and low cobalamin concentrations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606444,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 01 14,"The objective of this study was to compare the effects of parenteral (PE) versus oral (PO) cobalamin supplementation on serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCY) concentrations in dogs with hypocobalaminaemia.

Serum MMA and HCY concentrations were analysed at day 0, 28 and 90 after start of supplementation. There was no significant difference between the PO and PE group regarding serum MMA or HCY concentrations at any time point. Median (range, P comparing baseline and 28 days, P comparing 28days and 90 days) serum MMA concentrations (nmol/L; RI 415-1193) were 932 (566-2468) in the PO and 943 (508-1900) in the PE group at baseline, respectively, 705 (386-1465, P<0.0001) and 696 (377-932, P<0.0001) after 28 days, and 739 (450-1221, P=0.58) and 690 (349-1145, P=0.76) after 90 days.

Feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a variable progression rate. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of urinary heat shock protein-72 to urinary creatinine ratio (uHSP72:uCr) as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in feline AKI, and as a prognostic indicator in feline CKD. The study included 63 cats, divided into five groups: healthy controls (n=10), urethral obstruction (UO; n=7), CKD (n=15), AKI (16 cats) and acute decompensating CKD (ACKD; n=15). Median uHSP72:uCr (ng/mg) of healthy, UO, CKD, AKI and ACKD cats were 0.44 (range, 0.13-1.1), 1.96 (range, 0.64-11.9), 4.2ng/mg (range, 0.57-22.16), 3.2 (range, 0.42-10.91) and 7.0 (range, 1.2-20.96), respectively, and differed (P<0.001) among groups. uHSP72:uCr was significantly lower in the controls vs. the CKD, AKI and ACKD groups. Receiver operator characteristic analysis of uHSP72:uCr, including the AKI and control groups, showed an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.00), indicating an excellent predictive performance for diagnosing AKI. A 0.54ng/mg cutoff point corresponded to 94% sensitivity and 70% specificity for diagnosing AKI. The median survival time of cats with CKD with low uHSP72:uCr was longer (P=0.036) than in those with high uHSP72:uCr (561 vs. 112 days, respectively). uHSP72:uCr is a highly sensitive, moderately specific marker of AKI in cats, and is associated with the survival of cats with CKD.",Initial antimicrobial treatment of foals with sepsis: Do our choices make a difference?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606442,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 01 14,"The study objectives were to provide cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility data at the patient level and to evaluate the effect of initial antimicrobial treatment on survival in foals with sepsis.

Susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution procedure. In total, 213 foals and 306 bacterial isolates were included. The likelihood of survival for foals from which all bacteria were susceptible to the initial antimicrobial treatment was 65.4% (n=106/162; 95% confidence interval (CI) 57.6% to 72.7%) versus 41.7% (n=10/24; 95% CI 22.1% to 63.4%) if one or more isolates were resistant (relative risk 1.57, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.06).

Thirteen overweight dogs (body condition score 6-9/9) were randomised to one of two interventions: dietary caloric restriction or physical activity. The dietary caloric restriction intervention comprised feeding a therapeutic weight loss diet, while the physical activity intervention comprised increasing the dog's current physical activity pattern by at least a third. The primary outcome measure was change in body weight, while secondary outcome measures included change in neck, thorax and abdominal circumference and change in physical activity measured by triaxial accelerometer. Bodyweight decreased significantly with the dietary caloric restriction (median -10% of starting body weight [SBW], 5 to -12%; P=0.028) but not with the physical activity intervention (-2% SBW, +3% to -6%; P=0.107). Abdominal circumference (dietary caloric restriction: median -12.0%; physical activity: median -7.8%, P=0.016) and thoracic circumference (dietary caloric restriction: median -7.5%, P=0.031; physical activity: median -3.6%, P=0.031) changed significantly in both groups. There was no change in activity levels within the dietary caloric restriction group, but vigorous activity increased significantly in the physical activity group (P=0.016). Dietary caloric restriction was more effective than physical activity for controlled weight loss in overweight pet dogs. Although advising owners to increase their dog's activity by a third led to a modest increase in measured vigorous physical activity, this was insufficient to promote weight loss on its own.",Interstitial lung diseases in dogs and cats part II: Known cause and other discrete forms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606440,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 01 14,"In addition to idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) can occur secondary to known causes or be classified as discrete syndromes. Also known as diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, the ILDs represent a heterogenous group of non-infectious, non-neoplastic disorders characterized by varied patterns of inflammation and fibrosis. Characteristically associated with the true interstitium (i.e. the anatomic space lined by alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells and the loose-binding connective tissue), it is important to understand ILDs are associated with pathology of the distal lung parenchyma and thus lesions can be bronchiolocentric or resemble alveolar filling disorders. Injury to the distal lung can occur via inhalation or hematogenous routes. This review will build on a proposed classification scheme adapted from human medicine to describe known cause and discrete forms of ILDs in dogs and cats."

It occurs frequently in critically ill patients and has profound effects on morbidity and mortality. Recent research efforts have shown a bidirectional interplay between AKI and the immune system. Both innate and adaptive immune responses mediate renal injury as well as recovery from AKI. Dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes all play specific roles in the development of AKI. M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells also are pivotal in controlling inflammation, tissue remodeling, and repair after AKI. Conversely, existing evidence also suggests that increased production and decreased clearance of cytokines as well as dysfunction of immune cells, in particular neutrophils, can contribute to immune dysfunction and impaired bacterial clearance during AKI. Clinical data indicate that AKI is a risk factor for infections after various forms of critical illness, including cardiac surgery, malignancies, or severe trauma. Available evidence does not suggest that standard renal replacement therapies improve outcome from AKI beyond control of fluid balance and azotemia. Thus, novel approaches likely will be necessary to prevent or treat AKI-induced dysregulation of the inflammatory response.",AKI and the Neuroimmune Axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606410,Seminars in nephrology,2019 03 13,"Neuroimmune interaction is an emerging concept, wherein the nervous system modulates the immune system and vice versa.

The kidneys are innervated by sympathetic efferent and sensory afferent neurons, and these neurons also may play a role in the modulation of inflammation in AKI.

However, free iron is an aberration because of its ability to donate electrons, reduce oxygen, and generate reactive oxygen species. Iron-mediated cell injury or ferroptosis is a central player in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury. There are several homeostatic proteins and pathways that maintain critical balance in iron homeostasis to allow iron's biologic functions yet avoid ferroptosis. Hepcidin serves as the master regulator of iron homeostasis through its ability to regulate ferroportin-mediated iron export and intracellular H-ferritin levels. Hepcidin is a protective molecule in acute kidney injury. Drugs targeting hepcidin, H-ferritin, and ferroptosis pathways hold great promise to prevent or treat kidney injury.

Recent data have indicated that increased FGF23 and decreased klotho levels in the blood and urine could serve as novel predictive biomarkers of incident AKI, or as novel prognostic biomarkers of adverse outcomes in patients with established AKI. In addition, because FGF23 and klotho exert numerous classic as well as off-target effects on a variety of organ systems, targeting their dysregulation in AKI may represent a unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention.

HRS AKI represents the end-stage complication of decompensated cirrhosis with severe portal hypertension and is characterized by worsening of renal function in the absence of prerenal azotemia, nephrotoxicity, and intrinsic renal disease. Non-HRS AKI may be caused by prerenal hypoperfusion, bile acid nephropathy, nephrotoxicity, or acute parenchymal insult. There have been several mechanisms proposed to explain the pathophysiology of HRS AKI and non-HRS AKI, and a number of biomarkers have been suggested to aid in differentiation between these types of AKI and to act as prognostic indicators. The standard of care clinical management for patients with HRS AKI is to exclude other etiologies of AKI, followed by volume expansion with human albumin solution and then the introduction of vasopressors. However, some 40% of patients treated for HRS AKI fail to respond. In this review, we discuss the current and recent data about classification, pathophysiology, and management of AKI in general, with specific insight about the treatment of HRS AKI."

The anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed and secreted by PBL were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).Results The Treg/total lymphocyte ratio was significantly higher in the healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group[(3.2±0.5)%;P=0.001],but AMSCs in patients had a tendency to promote the proliferation of Treg cells [(1.3±0.2)%],with no significant difference(P=0.485) when compared with the PBL culture alone group[(1.0±0.1)%]. qRT-PCR showed that the ability of PBL in expressing Treg transcription factor forkhead box p3 and transforming growth factor(TGF)-Β mRNA was significantly lower in psoriasis AMSCs+PBL co-culture group than in the healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group(P=0.00,P=0.03),AMSCs had a tendency to promote the expression of interlukin(IL)-10 in peripheral blood lymphocytes,but there was no significant difference(P=0.09).ELISA showed the PBL in healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group secreted the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10[(156.9±41.8) ng/Μl] and TGF-Β[(2774.1 ± 526.4) ng/Μl];in contrast,the abilities of PBL in PV patient AMSCs+PBL co-culture group in secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokines has a downward trend:IL-10[(90.4±28.8) ng/Μl] and TGF-Β[(1597.9±55.7) ng/Μl],although the differences were not statistically significant. After the co-culture,the proportion of Th17 cells in the psoriasis AMSCs+PBL co-culture group[(0.8±0.3)%] showed a decreasing trend when compared with the PBL culture alone group[(1.1±0.1)%],although the results were not statistically significant. Also,the proportion of Th17 cells showed no significant difference between PV patient AMSCs+PBL co-culture group and healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group.

These 37 TIO tumors showed obviously increased activities,with an maximum standardized uptake value of 7.2±4.3 and mean standardized uptake value of 4.3±2.4. The average maximum diameter was (1.9±0.7) cm. The majority of the tumors occurred in the lower extremities (19/37),followed by the trunk (11/37),maxillary/mandibular bone (5/37),and upper extremities (2/37). In addition,24 bone lesions were located in long bones of lower extremities (13/24),most of which demonstrated eccentric growth (8/13). Osteolytic changes (14/24) were observed mainly in the lesions via the corresponding CT imaging;meanwhile,sclerotic changes presented in nine cases. Of the 13 soft-tissue lesions,the majority (10/13) showed well-circumscribed isodense or hypodense nodules on the CT images,with spot calcification in one lesion located in the pleura.Conclusions 68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT scans can detect the TIO culprit tumors miss-diagnosed by 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC SPECT. Somatostatin-receptors highly expressed lesions with focal osteolytic or osteosclerotic change in bone and isodense or hypodense nodules in soft tissue will favor the diagnosis of TIO tumors.","[Awareness of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and Its Influencial Factors among College Students in Universities Implementing ""Red Ribbon in Colleges"" Event across China].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606384,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

A systematic search was performed using both medical subject headings and truncated word searches to identify all comparative studies published on this topic. The primary outcomes were postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95 per cent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. A total of 10 studies which included 3900 patients were finally enrolled in the meta-analysis.

Multidrug-resistant strains of causative VAP pathogens are becoming increasingly common. Aerosolized antibiotics achieve high alveolar concentrations and provide valuable adjuncts in the treatment of VAP. This study examined the impact of aerosolized antibiotics in the treatment of VAP in trauma patients. Patients with either Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP over 10 years treated with aerosolized antibiotics (cases) were stratified by age, severity of shock, and injury severity. A frequency-matched (by causative pathogen) control group treated without aerosolized antibiotics was used for comparison. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors for the use of aerosolized antibiotics. One hundred twenty VAP episodes were identified in 100 patients. Microbiologic resolution was achieved in all patients treated with aerosolized antibiotics. There was no difference in mortality (14.5% vs 15.7%, P = 0.87) and no antibiotic-related complications in either group. Multivariable logistic regression identified VAP persistence and relapse as independent predictors for the use of aerosolized antibiotics. Combined with systemic therapy, aerosolized antibiotics broaden the spectrum of therapy. They are valuable adjuncts with minimal risk of antibiotic resistance and/or systemic complications.",Patient's Privacy Violation on Social Media in the Surgical Area.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606346,The American surgeon,2019 01 17,"In the new era of mobile technologies and social media, patient's privacy is at risk. Surgical patients have high visual appeal and may be vulnerable because a significant proportion of cases consist of emergency and trauma, in which patients are frequently unconscious. This study aims to identify the most vulnerable health providers to share patient's confidential data on social media in the surgical environment and their awareness of the confidentiality rules and laws. We surveyed medical graduates, surgical residents, and attending surgeons from a quaternary university hospital. Demographic data, usage and frequency of mobile apparatus, social media access, patient's data dissemination, and knowledge of laws and rules governing patient's privacy were recorded. One hundred fifty-six individuals (52 graduates, 51 residents, and 53 attending surgeons; mean age 24, 28, and 59 years, respectively) participated in the study. Patient's information was shared on social media by 53 per cent of the graduates, 86 per cent of the residents, and 32 per cent of the attending surgeons (P < 0.05). Confidentiality preservation policies were unknown to 69 per cent of graduates, 80 per cent of residents, and 62 per cent of attending surgeons (P = 0.124). Awareness of protocols to guide health-care professionals about safer use of social media was 0 per cent for graduates, 15 per cent for residents, and 22 per cent for attending surgeons (P = 0.002). Residents were the most vulnerable to share patient's information on social media compared with graduates and attending surgeons.

The trauma registry of a Level 1 trauma center was used to identify all adult trauma patients presenting from 2012 to 2015. Patients with psychiatric needs, identified as having either an ICD-9 code corresponding to a psychiatric disorder or requiring inpatient psychiatric consultation, were compared with controls, using propensity score matching. Patients with psychiatric disorders were more than three times more likely to present with penetrating injuries (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, P < 0.005). They had longer length of hospital stay (median 5 [IQR 2.5-11] vs. three days [IQR 1-7], P < 0.01), were approximately 70 per cent more likely to require ICU-level care (OR 1.68, P = 0.08), and were 80 per cent less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.18, P < 0.005).

Few studies directly compare robotic versus open techniques. This is a retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients undergoing robotic or open rectal cancer resection during a three-year period. The primary endpoint was a composite of complete mesorectal excision, circumferential resection margin <1 mm, and distal resection margin <1 mm. The study cohort included 64 patients undergoing robotic (n = 28) or open (n = 36) resection. Successful surgical resection was similar between the robotic (75%) and open (76%) approaches. Robotic resection was associated with significantly lower blood loss (P = 0.02) and significantly longer operative times (P = 0.009) compared with open resection. Length of hospital stay and complications were similar between groups. Both male gender (P = 0.03) and shorter tumor distance from the anal verge (P = 0.01) were predictors for unsuccessful surgical resection in open, but not robotic, surgery. Pathologic outcomes are similar between robotic and open rectal cancer resection, even early in the learning curve. Tumor distance from the anal verge complicates open total mesorectal excision; however, robotic surgery is less impacted. Robotic resection may be a promising minimally invasive approach for rectal cancer resection.",Acute Surgical Decision-Making in Abdominal Trauma Is Not Altered by Race or Socioeconomic Status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606341,The American surgeon,2019 01 17,"Two main procedures are performed on patients suffering from colonic perforation, diverting colostomy and primary tissue repair. We investigated patient race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) that predicted surgical outcomes after blunt or penetrating trauma. A retrospective analysis was performed using data from the National Trauma Data Bank for three years (2013-2015). We identified patients who presented with primary colonic injury and subsequent colon operation (n = 5431). Operations were grouped into three classes: colostomy, ileostomy, and nonostomy. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess how race and insurance status are associated with the primary outcome of interest (ostomy formation) and secondary outcomes such as length of stay, time spent in ICU, and surgical site infection. Neither race/ethnicity nor insurance status proved to be reliable predictors for the formation of an ostomy. Patients who received either a colostomy or ileostomy were likely to have longer stays (OR [odds ratio]: 5.28; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 3.88-6.69) (OR: 11.24; 95% CI: 8.53-13.95), more time spent in ICU (2.73; 1.70-3.76) (7.98; 6.10-9.87), and increased risk for surgical site infection (1.32; 1.03-1.68) (2.54; 1.71-3.78). Race/ethnicity and SES were not reliable predictors for surgical decision-making on the formation of an ostomy after blunt and penetrating colonic injury. However, the severity of the injury as calculated by Injury Severity Score and the number of abdominal injuries were both associated with higher rates of colostomy and ileostomy. These data suggest that surgical decision-making is dependent on perioperative patient presentation and, not on race, ethnicity, or SES.",Relationship between the Body Mass Index and Tumor Site Postoperative Complications and Prognosis in Gastric Adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606340,The American surgeon,2019 01 17,"The impact of BMI on survival in gastric cancer (GC) is not clear.

The prevalence of gastric-antrum cancer in the high BMI group was significantly lower than that in the low BMI group (P = 0.001) and the normal BMI group (P = 0.004). The BMI of patients with gastric-cardia cancer was significantly higher than that of patients with gastric-body cancer (P = 0.018) and gastric-antrum cancer (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of tumor size, TNM stage, depth of tumor invasion, degree of tumor differentiation, resection margin, lymph node metastasis, or postoperative complications. BMI was not an independent factor that influenced the prognosis. We found a relationship between BMI and GC site. A low BMI may be associated with a poor prognosis and a high BMI may be related to a favorable prognosis.

These patients are at risk of being discharged to rehabilitation or a skilled nursing facility, instead of being returned to their homes, placing a significant burden on both the patient families and society. This study evaluated which patient characteristics increase the likelihood of a previously independent geriatric blunt trauma becoming functionally dependent and being discharged to a location other than home. Data were extracted from the National Trauma Data Bank from 2012 to 2014 for blunt trauma patients ≥65 years old, admitted from home, with one or more rib fractures. Primary outcomes were discharge home versus a facility. Subgroup analysis evaluated disposition to acute short-term rehabilitation or subacute rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility. Multivariable analysis was used to calculate probabilities of disposition based on the above variables, controlling for comorbidities. Sixteen thousand six hundred thirty-two patients were included. Only 58 per cent were discharged home. Increased age, ≥4 rib fractures, white race, and female gender were found to increase the risk of discharge to a facility. In addition, patients with chronic renal failure, history of diabetes, obesity, or heart failure were less likely to be discharged home. This study shows that age, gender, race, and the number of rib fractures are statistically significant in predicting which patients are less likely to be discharged home. This reinforces the need for the development of triage and treatment protocols in this higher risk population, to decrease the social and financial burden of these injuries.",Patient-Surgeon Relationship Influences Outcomes in Bariatric Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606338,The American surgeon,2019 01 17,"Bariatric surgery is an important therapy in weight loss. However, adherence to follow-up is critical and may be influenced by the patient-surgeon relationship. To test this hypothesis, bariatric surgical patients were surveyed from March 2013 to March 2015 via the National Association for Weight Loss Surgery webpage and social media outlets. Surgical outcomes and adherence to follow-up were collected, and aspects of the patient-surgeon relationship were assessed via the Likert scale. Correlations between survey item responses were calculated using Fisher's exact test, Student's t test, and Spearman's rho rank correlation. Three hundred twenty patients responded (n = 287 completed in entirety and n = 33 partially completed); 48 months was the median time to survey from operation (interquartile range, 22-84 months). Eighty-six per cent (n = 276) of patients rated their relationship with their operative surgeon as ""average"" to ""very good."" Thirteen per cent (n = 43) rated their relationship as ""poor"" to ""very poor."" Positive relationship with the operative surgeon and lack of complication were associated with adherence to follow-up (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.002, respectively). The presence of complication did not affect the overall patient-surgeon relationship (P = 0.5), although aspects of the patient-surgeon relationship were correlated to complications. There was no association between weight loss at one year and patient-surgeon relationship (P = 0.6) or presence of complication (P = 0.1). The findings of this study support the role of a positive patient-surgeon relationship in achieving long-term follow-up in post-bariatric surgical patients."

This review describes the impact of migration on TB epidemiology in the United States, and how the TB burden differs between US-born and non-US-born populations. The United States has a long history of receiving migrants from other parts of the world, and TB among non-US-born individuals now represents the majority of new TB cases. Based on an analysis of TB cases among individuals from the top 30 countries of origin in terms of non-US-born TB burden between 2003 and 2015, we describe how TB risks vary within the non-US-born population according to age, years since entry, entry year, and country of origin. Variation along each of these dimensions is associated with more than 10-fold differences in the risk of developing active TB, and this risk is also positively associated with TB incidence estimates for the country of origin and the composition of the migrant pool in the entry year. Approximately 87 000 lifetime TB cases are predicted for the non-US-born population resident in the United States in 2015, and 5800 lifetime cases for the population entering the United States in 2015.","Major depressive disorder in patients with diabetes mellitus in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606306,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,2019 04 19,Diabetes mellitus (DM) and major depressive disorder (MDD) constitute a major burden of disease.

Despite their promise, they pose challenges for introduction into the healthcare sector in South Africa (SA), including: (i) that they are technologically demanding and their manufacture is resource intensive; (ii) that the regulatory system is underdeveloped and likely to be challenged by ethical, legal and social requirements that accompany these new therapies; and (iii) that costs are likely to be prohibitive, at least initially, and before economies of scale take effect.

This results in a regulatory lag. Furthermore, ethical and legal considerations are often debated in real time as issues pertaining to these technologies that were previously not considered begin to come to the fore. Finding the appropriate balance between facilitating potential therapeutic gains and ensuring the safety interests of recipients of the new treatments requires close attention, especially for minors. This vulnerable population frequently has off-label treatment prescribed on the basis of extrapolation of clinical trial data derived from adults, which is ethically and scientifically questionable. In this article we discuss how best to maintain ethical integrity while introducing innovative cell and gene therapies to minors. We advocate that clinical trials of promising innovative therapies should be designed so that testing in adults is followed as soon as possible by testing in minors, given the impressive gains that have recently been reported.","Auditory hallucinations, top-down processing and language perception: a general population study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606279,Psychological medicine,2019 01 04,Studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia suggest that an imbalance in top-down expectations v. bottom-up processing underlies these errors in perception.

Traditionally risk factors have been inferred from observational designs. However, association with psychiatric outcome does not equate to causation. There are a number of threats that clinicians and researchers face in making causal inferences from traditional observational designs because adversities or exposures are not randomly allocated to individuals. Natural experiments provide an alternative strategy to randomized controlled trials as they take advantage of situations whereby links between exposure and other variables are separated by naturally occurring events or situations. In this review, we describe a growing range of different types of natural experiment and highlight that there is a greater confidence about findings where there is a convergence of findings across different designs. For example, exposure to hostile parenting is consistently found to be associated with conduct problems using different natural experiment designs providing support for this being a causal risk factor. Different genetically informative designs have repeatedly found that exposure to negative life events and being bullied are linked to later depression. However, for exposure to prenatal cigarette smoking, while findings from natural experiment designs are consistent with a causal effect on offspring lower birth weight, they do not support the hypothesis that intra-uterine cigarette smoking has a causal effect on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct problems and emerging findings highlight caution about inferring causal effects on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",Cognitive impairment from early to middle adulthood in patients with affective and nonaffective psychotic disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606277,Psychological medicine,2019 04 09,"Cognitive impairment is a core feature of psychotic disorders, but the profile of impairment across adulthood, particularly in African-American populations, remains unclear.",Effects of chronic physical disease and systemic inflammation on suicide risk in patients with depression: a hospital-based case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606276,Psychological medicine,2019 01 04,"Few studies have examined the concurrent effects of physical disease and systemic inflammation on suicide risk in patients with depression.

We have previously identified a pathogenic C-terminal tau fragment (Tau35) that is associated with human tauopathy. However, it is not known how tau fragmentation affects critical molecular processes in cells and contributes to impaired physiological function. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and new CHO cell lines stably expressing Tau35 or full-length human tau were used to compare the effects of disease-associated tau cleavage on tau function and signaling pathways. Western blots, microtubule-binding assays and immunofluorescence labeling were used to examine the effects of Tau35 on tau function and on signaling pathways in CHO cells. We show that Tau35 undergoes aberrant phosphorylation when expressed in cells. Although Tau35 contain the entire microtubule-binding region, the lack of the amino terminal half of tau results in a marked reduction in microtubule binding and defective microtubule organization in cells. Notably, Tau35 attenuates insulin-mediated activation of Akt and a selective inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. Moreover, Tau35 activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 signaling and the unfolded protein response, leading to insulin resistance in cells. Tau35 has deleterious effects on signaling pathways that mediate pathological changes and insulin resistance, suggesting a mechanism through which N-terminal cleavage of tau leads to the development and progression of tau pathology in human tauopathy. Our findings highlight the importance of the N-terminal region of tau for its normal physiological function. Furthermore, we show that pathogenic tau cleavage induces tau phosphorylation, resulting in impaired microtubule binding, disruption of insulin signaling and activation of the unfolded protein response.

Genetic forms show a striking variability in their clinical and neuropathological picture and can sometimes mimic other neurodegenerative diseases.We report a novel PRNP mutation (V189I) in four CJD patients from three unrelated pedigrees. In three patients, the clinical features were typical for CJD and the diagnosis was pathologically confirmed, while the fourth patient presented with a complex phenotype including rapidly progressive dementia, behavioral abnormalities, ataxia and extrapyramidal features, and the diagnosis was probable CJD by current criteria, on the basis of PrPSc detection in CSF by Real Time Quaking-Induced Conversion assay. In all the three patients with autopsy findings, the neuropathological analysis revealed diffuse synaptic type deposition of proteinase K-resistant prion protein (PrPres), and type 1 PrPres was identified in the brain by western blot analysis.

Notably in the post-World War II period, an ever increasing number of countries began negotiating treaties to reduce, first, tariff barriers and, later, non-tariff barriers (government measures of any sort) that could impede the cross-border flow of goods. The rationale, in part, was that countries that became more entwined economically would be less likely to go to war with each other. It wouldn't be in their own economic interests to do so, or at least that of the firms based within their borders but engaged in transnational trade and dependent upon global supply chains. At first primarily an undertaking of developed (high-income) countries, developing (low and middle-income countries) slowly enjoined in what, in 1995, became the World Trade Organization. The WTO locked in scheduled declines in tariffs (border taxes), albeit with lesser obligations on developing country members (a problematic nomenclature given the vast geographic, economic, and development differences between such countries, but which nonetheless persists within the WTO). Importantly, a slew of new agreements that coincided with the establishment of the WTO also sought to liberalize trade in services (not just goods) (The General Agreement on Trade in Services), create new rules for agricultural trade (Agreement on Agriculture), expand intellectual property rights protections (The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), limit trade-distorting government subsidies (Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures), and ensure that government food, health, or environmental regulations would not pose an unnecessary barrier to trade (the Technical Barriers to Trade and the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Agreements). Outside of the WTO system, bilateral or regional investment treaties granting special rights to foreign investors to sue governments for actions perceived to affect the value of their investment (such as direct expropriation or passage of new laws and regulations considered 'tantamount to expropriation') similarly exploded in number, dispute frequency, and the size of monetary claims.

This turns our attention to potentially objective neuroimaging methods. Paradigms based on electroencephalography (EEG) are most suited for bedside applications, but sensitive to artifacts. These problems are especially pronounced in pediatric patients. We present the first study on the assessment of pediatric DOC patients by means of command-following procedures and involving long-latency cognitive event-related potentials. To deal with the above mentioned challenges, we construct a specialized signal processing scheme including artifact correction and rejection, parametrization, classification and final assessment of the statistical significance. To compensate for the possible bias of the tests involved in the final diagnosis, we propose the Monte Carlo evaluation of the processing pipeline. To compensate for possible sensory impairments of DOC patients, for each subject we check command-following responses to the stimuli in the major modalities: visual, tactile, and audio (words and sounds).

Methods and Results We evaluated urinary levels of TMAO and its precursor metabolites (ie, choline, betaine, and carnitine) in relation to risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) among Chinese adults in a nested case-control study, including 275 participants with incident CHD and 275 individually matched controls. We found that urinary TMAO , but not its precursors, was associated with risk of CHD . The odds ratio for the highest versus lowest quartiles of TMAO was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.08-3.35; Ptrend=0.008) after adjusting for CHD risk factors including obesity, diet, lifestyle, and metabolic diseases and 1.75 (95% CI, 0.96-3.18; Ptrend=0.03) after further adjusting for potential confounders or mediators including central obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and intake of seafood and deep-fried meat or fish, which were associated with TMAO level in this study. The odds ratio per standard deviation increase in log- TMAO was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.03-1.63) in the fully adjusted model. A history of diabetes mellitus modified the TMAO - CHD association. A high TMAO level (greater than or equal to versus lower than the median) was associated with odds ratios of 6.21 (95% CI, 1.64-23.6) and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.00-2.43), respectively, among diabetic and nondiabetic participants ( Pinteraction=0.02). Diabetes mellitus status also modified the associations of choline, betaine, and carnitine with risk of CHD ; significant positive associations were found among diabetic participants, but null associations were noted among total and nondiabetic participants. Conclusions Our study suggests that TMAO may accelerate the development of CHD , highlighting the importance of diet-gut microbiota-host interplay in cardiometabolic health.",Cross-linguistic Influences on Sentence Accent Detection in Background Noise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606083,Language and speech,2019 01 04,"This paper investigates whether sentence accent detection in a non-native language is dependent on (relative) similarity between prosodic cues to accent between the non-native and the native language, and whether cross-linguistic differences in the use of local and more widely distributed (i.e., non-local) cues to sentence accent detection lead to differential effects of the presence of background noise on sentence accent detection in a non-native language. We compared Dutch, Finnish, and French non-native listeners of English, whose cueing and use of prosodic prominence is gradually further removed from English, and compared their results on a phoneme monitoring task in different levels of noise and a quiet condition to those of native listeners. Overall phoneme detection performance was high for the native and the non-native listeners, but deteriorated to the same extent in the presence of background noise. Crucially, relative similarity between the prosodic cues to sentence accent of one's native language compared to that of a non-native language does not determine the ability to perceive and use sentence accent for speech perception in that non-native language. Moreover, proficiency in the non-native language is not a straightforward predictor of sentence accent perception performance, although high proficiency in a non-native language can seemingly overcome certain differences at the prosodic level between the native and non-native language. Instead, performance is determined by the extent to which listeners rely on local cues (English and Dutch) versus cues that are more distributed (Finnish and French), as more distributed cues survive the presence of background noise better.",Efficacy of chewing gum for improving bowel function after cesarean sections: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606082,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 01 04,To investigate the effects of chewing xylitol-free gum at different intervals after cesarean sections.,Aortic stiffness in families with inherited non-syndromic thoracic aortic disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606081,Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ,2019 04 09,"In families with an inherited form of non-syndromic thoracic aortic disease (TAAD), aortic diameter alone is not a reliable marker for disease occurrence or progression.

Thus, serum and decidual levels of CX3CL1 from first-trimester pregnancy and preeclampsia-complicated term pregnancy were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The effects of incubating primary human first-trimester decidual cells (FTDCs) with estradiol + medroxyprogesterone acetate + either IL-1β or TNF-α and/or IFN-γ on CX3CL1 expression were also assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. The inhibition of each signaling pathway with each kinase and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) inhibitors was evaluated by ELISA. Chemotaxis of CD56brightCD16- NK cells by various concentrations of CX3CL1 was evaluated. C-X3-C motif ligand 1 is expressed by both cytotrophoblasts and decidual cells in first-trimester decidua. C-X3-C motif ligand 1 expression is increased in term decidua but unchanged in first-trimester and term serum of patients with preeclampsia. Interferon-gamma and either IL-1β or TNF-α synergistically upregulated CX3CL1 expression in FTDCs. Coincubation with IL-1β or TNF-α or IFN-γ, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and NFκB inhibitors suppressed CX3CL1 production. C-X3-C motif ligand 1 elicited concentration-dependent enhancement of CD56brightCD16- NK cell migration. In conclusion, the current study suggests that decidual cell-secreted CX3CL1 is involved in the later development of preeclampsia, whereas circulating CX3CL1 levels do not predict preeclampsia. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2, JNK, and NFκB signaling mediate IL-1β-, TNF-α-, and IFN-γ-induced CX3CL1 production by FTDCs.",Results of a Dutch national and subsequent international expert meeting on interconception care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606078,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 01 04,"The potential value of preconception care and interconception care is increasingly acknowledged, but delivery is generally uncommon.

In vitro experiments performed using the DLBCL cell lines OCI-ly1 (LY1; mutant TP53), OCI-ly10 (LY10; wild-type TP53) and OCI-ly19 (LY19, wild-type TP53) demonstrated that chidamide is more potent against cells with mutant TP53 mutant than those with wild-type TP53. Moreover, chidamide can reduce the mRNA and protein expression levels of mutant TP53 and upregulate the surface expression of the CD20 antigen in lymphoma cells."

We aimed to investigate how changes in cerebral small vessel disease lesions relate to cognitive decline and incident mild cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients. Data were obtained from the ISSYS cohort (Investigating Silent Strokes in Hypertensives: a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study)-a longitudinal population-based study on hypertensive patients aged 50 to 70 years without dementia and stroke at baseline. Patients underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging, a cognitive screening test, and cognitive diagnosis (normal aging or mild cognitive impairment) at baseline and follow-up. We evaluated incident lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds. Changes in the periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were qualitatively defined as none, minor, or marked. We followed up 345 patients (median age, 65 [61-68]; 55.4% men) for 3.95 (3.83-4.34) years. Incident mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 9.1% of the sample. Considering the progression of cerebral small vessel disease, the prevalence of incident infarcts was 6.1% and that of incident cerebral microbleeds was 5.5%; progression of periventricular WMH was 22% and that of deep WMH was 48%.

Empirical research has demonstrated that by improving leadership, safety outcomes are likely to improve as well. Worker perceptions are shaped through leader-employee interactions over time. However, few details are known about social support dimensions (i.e., emotional, informational, and tangible support) offered by supervisors and what kind of impact this communication has on miners' safety culture perceptions and performance. In order to study leadership communication in a high-risk environment, this study utilized pre- and post-interview data collected with 20 managers and 48 workers to identify positive and negative instances of social support and its implications on worker performance. Findings show that emotional support, although helpful in motivating miner compliance and proactivity, was harder to tailor and to be received as intended. Informational support not only had the largest impact on miners' behaviors but was also carried out by miners through support to their coworkers. Finally, tangible support in the form of supervisor assistance had a larger impact on worker behavior than offering incentives or other tangible rewards. By demonstrating the communication offered and desired within these three support dimensions - informational, emotional, and tangible - practitioners can see what is lacking in their organization and whether a shift is needed to balance supportive communication.",Andrographolide is neither a human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) substrate nor inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606060,Journal of Asian natural products research,2019 01 04,"Andrographolide, a major bioactive compound isolated from Andrographis paniculata (Burm.

Substrate determination and inhibition of hOAT1-mediated uptake transport assay was carried out using recombinant CHO-hOAT1 cells. The results showed that the uptake ratio of andrographolide was less than 2.0 at all concentrations tested, indicating that andrographolide is not a hOAT1 substrate. Andrographolide has no significant effects on the p-aminohippuric acid uptake and on the mRNA and protein expression of hOAT1. In conclusion, andrographolide may not pose a drug-herb interaction risk related to hOAT1.

Conflicting results, however, were obtained. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between TNF-α -308 A/G, -850 C/T, -238 A/G, FAS -670 A/G, and FASL -844 C/T and PE risk using a meta-analysis. Pubmed, EBSCO, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched up to April 10th 2018. Summarized odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between the five polymorphisms and PE risk were computed using a fixed or random effects model. The TNF-α -308 GA and GA/AA genotypes were associated with increased risks of PE in Asians (heterozygous comparison: OR = 2.68, 95% CI, 1.07-6.66; dominant model: OR = 2.70, 95% CI, 1.08-6.73) rather than in Caucasians.

No significant association was found between TNF-α -850 C/T, -238 A/G and FASL -844 C/T polymorphisms and PE risk. These findings indicate that FAS -670 A/G polymorphism may be a susceptibility gene for the development of PE.

In addition to hair restoration, PRP's multifactorial capabilities can also be used to treat aging skin, facial scarring, and acne. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the success of PRP in the field of dermatology, with specific attention to the role of PRP in hair restoration. Where possible, meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy of PRP. In androgenetic alopecia (AGA) patients, 3 monthly PRP injections (1 session administered every month for 3 months) exhibited greater efficacy over placebo as measured by change in total hair density (hair/cm2) over the treatment period (mean difference: 25.61, 95% CI: 4.45 to 46.77; P = .02). The studies included in the meta-analysis used a half-head design, which may have influenced the results because of the effects PRP can induce. Controlled studies suggest that 2 to 4 sessions of PRP combined with traditional therapies and procedures can help minimize acne scarring and facial burns, improve aesthetic results, and decrease recovery time. However, data for these indications are lacking and are less robust in design. In conclusion, to achieve an improvement in hair restoration in patients with mild AGA, 3 initial monthly PRP injections should be given. Only upon completion of rigorous, randomized, controlled studies can standardized and effective PRP protocols for treating dermatology conditions such as acne scarring, facial burns, and aging skin be determined.",In-Hospital Management and Outcomes After ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Medicaid Beneficiaries Compared With Privately Insured Individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606054,Circulation.

Due to the paucity of data, it is paramount to evaluate outcomes based on case studies to continue improving medical and surgical management of these patients. We present a case report of craniopagus twins cared for by the senior author (A.K.G.). The patients underwent extensive surgical planning and 2 attempts at cerebroendovascular embolization to reroute shared venous sinus drainage. After the 2 endovascular procedures, attempted separation at age 41 months was aborted due to intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Eleven-year follow-up shows the twins to be developing well in regard to social and cognitive development. Nonetheless, they have had numerous physical challenges including a fall in 2016 resulting in C1-C2 subluxation in twin B leading to partial spinal cord ischemia and left-sided weakness. The separation of craniopagus twins is fraught with technical, medical, and ethical challenges. Surgical separation of the twins is not always possible without significant risk of devastating consequences to one or both twins.

Children's participation in these situations improves their motivation and situated understanding. Likewise, their participation helps professionals to more fully understand the child's perspective. In the project, an interactive communication tool, that is, an application suitable for tablet use, was developed with children, aged three to five, in two clinical settings. When tested, the children's participation cues, identified from video recordings of healthcare situations, were understood as having curious, thoughtful or affirmative meanings. This study aimed to investigate the similarities and differences in the young children's use of participation cues when using an interactive communication tool in healthcare situations. A secondary analysis of the identified cues was performed focusing on age, setting and examination or procedure. In total, 2167 cues were identified representing either curious, thoughtful or affirmative cues. The curious cues were mainly used (66%), followed by thoughtful (28%) and affirmative (6%) cues. Differences in cue usage were seen in relation to the children's age and setting.

Yet little is known about how EAMs and the resulting interaction between researchers and participants affect research participation and the data gathered. We interviewed participants and research assistants (RAs) in an observational cohort study involving EAMs for HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Uganda. We qualitatively explored interviewees' views about ethical issues surrounding EAMs and assessed data with conventional and directed content analysis. Participants valued their relationships with RAs and were preoccupied with RAs' perceptions of them. Participants were pleased when the EAM revealed regular adherence, and annoyed when it revealed non-adherence that contradicted self-reported pill-taking behavior. For many, the desire to maintain a good impression incentivized adherence. But some sought to creatively conceal non-adherence, or refused to use the EAM to avoid revealing non-adherence to RAs. These findings show that participants' perceptions of the study staff's perceptions of them affected the experience of being monitored, study participation, and ultimately the data gathered in the study.

The mean Social Communication Questionnaire total score was significantly higher in autism spectrum disorder children than in typically developing children ( p < 0.0001). Scores on the three Social Communication Questionnaire subscales also differed significantly between the groups ( p < 0.001). Of the 39 items, 37 were endorsed significantly more often in the autism spectrum disorder group. The total Social Communication Questionnaire score did not vary by age or gender. Internal consistency was excellent (alpha = 0.92). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve for the total score showed excellent discrimination between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children (area under the curve = 0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.97).

They are therefore often candidates for long-term anticoagulation medication. At the same time, they have an increased risk of bleeding due to age and co-morbidities, which anticoagulation therapy necessarily potentiates. New Oral Direct Anticoagulants (NOAC) registered in the Czech Republic - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban - are a good alternative to the currently dominant warfarin in many of these indications. Their great advantage is that they do not need to be regularly monitored on a laboratory basis and are considered to be safer, especially to significant reduction of the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Each drug in the group of direct oral anticoagulants has some specificity resulting from pharmacological properties or the results of registration studies, so it is possible to individually determine an optimal anticoagulation strategy. Older, respectively fragile patients are characterized by reduced body weight, limited renal function, and multiple comorbidities (associated with many co-medications).

Unrecognized thyroid dysfunction leads to increased: cardiovascular risk, bone fractures, cognitive impairment, depression, and mortality. The symptoms of thyroid diseases can be nonspecific or common in seniors with ageing complaints. The interpretation of thyroid function tests, the physiological changes in secretion and metabolism of thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormones must be considered, as well as the influence of comorbidities, certain drugs, and individual ""set point"" of pituitary gland. According to many observations the serum TSH, thyroxine (T4), concentrations depend on age, comorbidities, and medical treatment - these together sometimes make the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction complicated in older population. The observational data may suggest a diminished pituitary sensitivity to T4 in the ageing population. According to several studies, serum TSH concentration is probably age-dependant and the upper limit of TSH could be 5.28-5.9 mIU/l in those who are > 70 years old. Therapy of thyroid dysfunction is different in elderly persons than in young people; hypothyroidism should be treated with caution, because high doses of thyroxine can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and increased bone turnover. Hyperthyroidism could be treated either with surgery or preferable with radioiodin. Especially the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be made with caution after concerning different important circumstances. Nevertheless there are certain conditions, when subclinical hypothyroidism must be treated.

Subjects aged 65 years and more have typically isolated systolic hypertension with increased pulse pressure as a consequence of decreased elasticity of central arteries. With increasing age, the prevalence of cardiovascular/ renal diseases and diabetes is higher. Therefore, we use drugs that have cardiprotective effect and do not affect negatively concomitant diseases. Diuretics have the largest data from prospective studies, calcium channels blockers are suitable especially in isolated systolic hypertension, and ACE inhibitors tested in high-risk hypertensive patients, especially after stroke. The HYVET study showed that the risk of cardiovascular events and of heart failure is decreased with antihypertensive troroeatment also in subjects aged 80 years and more.

In the present study, the method of chemical conjugation by affinity peptide (CCAP) for site-specific chemical modification has been developed by using a peptide that bound with high affinity to human IgG-Fc. This method enabled a rapid modification of a specific residue (Lys248 on Fc) in a one-step reaction under mild condition to form a stable amide bond between the peptide and Fc. The monovalent peptide-IgG conjugate not only maintained complete antigen binding but also bound to Fc receptors (FcRn, FcγRI, and FcγRIIIa), indicating that it is a suitable conjugate form that can be further developed into highly functional antibody therapeutics. CCAP was applied for the preparation of an antibody-drug conjugate and a bispecific antibody to demonstrate the usefulness of this method.",Iron-Promoted Three-Component 2-Substituted Benzothiazole Formation via Nitroarene ortho-C-H Sulfuration with Elemental Sulfur.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606012,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 02 01,"A three-component procedure for the preparation of 2-substituted benzothiazoles from nitroarenes, alcohols, and sulfur powder is described.

A,2019 02 15,"Cl atom initiated photo-oxidation of monochlorinated propanes to form the carbonyl compounds was investigated. Propionaldehyde and acetone were identified to be major products in the oxidation of 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane, respectively. The complete product analyses were carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-infrared spectroscopy (GC-IR) as analytical tools, and an appropriate oxidation mechanism was proposed on the basis of the product analyses. The temperature dependent rate coefficients for the reactions of Cl atoms with 1-chloropropane (1-CP) and 2-chloropropane (2-CP) were measured experimentally in the gas phase, using the relative rate method in the temperature range 268-363 K and at 1 atm pressure. Ethane, ethylene, and ethyl acetate were used as reference compounds. The obtained rate coefficients for the reactions of Cl atoms with 1-CP and 2-CP at room temperature (298 K) and at 1 atm pressure were (4.64 ± 0.70) × 10-11 and (2.57 ± 0.44) × 10-11 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. Furthermore, to complement our experimentally obtained results, computational calculations were performed for these reactions using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling (SCT) in combination with the CCSD/cc-pVDZ//MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.

We developed a novel transmission geometry for low-frequency Raman spectroscopy and compared quantitative ability in transmission mode versus backscattering mode using chemometrics. We prepared two series of tablets, (1) containing different weight-based contents of carbamazepine form III and (2) including different ratios of carbamazepine polymorphs (forms I/III). From the relationship between the contents of carbamazepine form III and partial least-squares (PLS) predictions in the tablets, correlation coefficients in transmission mode ( R2 = 0.98) were found to be higher than in backscattering mode ( R2 = 0.97). The root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) of the transmission mode was 3.9 compared to 4.9 for the backscattering mode. The tablets containing a mixture of carbamazepine (I/III) polymorphs were measured by transmission low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, and it was found that the spectral shape changed according to the ratio of polymorphs: the relationship between the actual content and the prediction showed high correlation. These findings indicate that transmission low-frequency Raman spectroscopy possesses the potential to complement existing analytical methods for the quantification of polymorphs.",Effective Extraction of Domoic Acid from Seafood Based on Postsynthetic-Modified Magnetic Zeolite Imidazolate Framework-8 Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606008,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Domoic acid (DA) is a naturally occurring neurotoxin known to bioaccumulate in marine products. Despite its hypertoxicity, the enrichment and analysis of trace DA in complex marine organisms remains a challenge. We describe herein the fabrication of a postsynthetic-modified magnetic zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (Fe3O4 SPs@ZIF-8/Zn2+), based on Fe3O4 superparticles, for the adsorption of DA from complex biological matrices. The adsorption of DA is rapid (∼5 min) and occurs through strong electrostatic interactions and chelation with coordinatively unsaturated zinc sites on the surface of Fe3O4 SPs@ZIF-8/Zn2+. Employing our Fe3O4 SPs@ZIF-8/Zn2+ sorbent in a magnetic solid-phase extraction, followed by liquid chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometric detection, resulted in a facile, rapid, efficient, and sensitive method for the enrichment and detection of trace DA in marine products. After optimization, this method yielded satisfactory precision (relative standard deviation ≤3.4%; n = 5) with a high degree of linearity from 1.0 to 1000.0 pg mL-1 ( r2 = 0.9997) and a detection limit of 0.2 pg mL-1 (S/N = 3). Recoveries of 93.1-102.3% were obtained in spiked aquatic products. In addition, trace levels of DA (49.2 pg mL-1) were found in shellfish samples, confirming the applicability of our Fe3O4 SPs@ZIF-8/Zn2+ adsorbent for the detection of DA in seafood."

Fifty-four subjects completed a self-questionnaire that included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) for ES, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Pathway analysis was performed to analyze the mediating effects of ES, the anxiety subscale scores of the HADS, and the ISI scores. The low-ES group exhibited an insomnia severity that was significantly higher than that of the high-ES group (p=0.048). According to the pathway analysis, the significant indirect effect of ES on the ISI scores was mediated by the scores on the anxiety subscale of the HADS. Cataract patients with low ES waiting to undergo surgery have a high risk of experiencing insomnia due to anxiety.

Methods: A total of 117 patients who were diagnosed with ESCC from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. They recieved standard curative esophagectomy in the Yangzhou University Affiliated Taixing People's Hospital. The nutritional status and risk score for recruited patients were assessed according to the standard of NRS-2002 tool prior to surgery, and these patients were grouped for further analysis according to the median values of NRS-2002 score. Finally, the relationship between NRS-2002 score and prognosis was analyzed. Results: Patients were classified into two groups, with 45 in the NRS-2002<2.0 group, and 72 cases in the NRS-2002≥2.0, respectively. In the NRS-2002<2.0 group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 75.6%, 44.4% and 40.0% separately, while in the NRS-2002≥2.0 group, the PFS rates were 61.1%, 6.9% and 4.2% respectively, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Correspondingly, in the NRS-2002< 2.0 group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 97.8%, 66.7% and 57.8% separately, while in the NRS-2002≥2.0 group, the OS rates were 91.7%, 33.3% and 16.7% respectively, and the differences were also statistically significant (P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed that N stage, TNM stage and NRS-2002 score were closely related to PFS and OS (P<0.05), and T stage was only associated with OS in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that N stage (RR=1.640, 95% CI 1.049-2.565, P=0.030) and NRS-2002 (RR=3.154, 95% CI 1.946-5.113, P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors for PFS in patients with ESCC after surgery. Additionally, pathological differentiation (RR=1.556, 95% CI 1.004-2.440, P=0.041), N stage (RR=1.624, 95% CI 1.017-2.593, P=0.042) and NRS-2002 (RR=3.906, 95% CI2.245-6.795, P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors for OS in ESCC patients following surgery. Conclusion: Preoperative nutritional risk screening NRS-2002 score is an independent prognostic factor in patients with ESCC receiving surgery and could be used as a tool for primary screening for nutritional risk.",[Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in distinguishing the origin of adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605982,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],2019 02 15,"Objective: To evaluate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at 3.0T in differential diagnosis of the origin of adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix. Methods: 71 patients with adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix were retrospectively collected. Pelvic MR examinations, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences, were performed within 2 weeks before surgery. MR images were analyzed and measured by two radiologists, including the location of the tumor center, the enhancement pattern, the anterior and posterior diameters, the left and right diameters, the upper and lower diameters, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the tumor. Immunohistochemical method was used as gold standard in distinguishing cervical adenocarcinoma and uterine adenocarcinoma. Results: The upper and lower diameters of uterine adenocarcinoma were [(5.80±2.31) cm], significantly larger than those of cervical adenocarcinoma [(4.16±2.17) cm, P=0.009]. Using 4.5cm as the best cutoff point value, the sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing uterine adenocarcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma were 68.4% and 65.4%, respectively. According to the location of tumor center, the sensitivity and specificity were 84.2% and 73.1%, respectively. Using tumor enhancement pattern as the criterion, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing uterine adenocarcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma were 68.4% and 80.8% respectively. Conclusions: MRI has certain clinical value in evaluating the origin of adenocarcinoma at the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervix.

Methods: Venous blood samples from 68 patients with esophageal cancer, 36 patients with benign esophageal lesions and 45 healthy subjects were collected. Circulating cfDNA was verified through quantitative real-time PCR (Alu-qPCR) using Alu-115 and Alu-247 primers. DNA integrity index was calculated as the ratio of Alu-qPCR results (Alu247/115). Concentrations of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCC) were detected by chemiluminescence analyzer assay. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test and Spearman correlation test. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of each index to esophageal carcinoma. Results: The median absolute serum Alu115 and the Alu247/115 index (1 162.0 ng/ml, 0.57) in esophageal cancer group were significantly higher than those in benign esophageal disease group (496.7 ng/ml, 0.43) and in healthy control group (432.3 ng/ml, 0.42) (all P<0.01, respectively). The Alu115 and Alu247/115 index of serum DNA in benign esophageal disease group were no statistically different from those in the healthy control group (all P>0.05, respectively). The levels of cfDNA and its integrity were not significantly correlated with age, gender, tumor differentiation, or disease stage according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system in the esophageal cancer group (all P>0.05).

Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V/ Propidium iodide (PI) double staining. The correlation between UCHL5 expression and the expressions of proliferation and apoptosis associated genes was analyzed using TCGA breast invasive carcinoma data set. The relationship between UCHL5 expression and breast cancer patients'survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool. Results: After knockdown of UCHL5, A values of SW527 cells on day 2 and day 4 were 0.822±0.017 and 1.045±0.023, respectively, which were significantly lower than 0.976±0.016 and 1.284±0.025 of control cells on day 2 and day 4 (P<0.001). In vivo xenografted mouse model, the volume in UCHL5-suppressed group was (166.90±75.05) mm(3,) significantly smaller than (329.80±35.84) mm(3) in control group (P=0.029). Flow cytometry analysis showed the apoptotic rate of SW527 cells was (8.60±1.13)% after knockdown of UCHL5, significantly higher than (2.95±0.07)% of control group (P=0.020). TCGA database analysis showed that the expression of UCHL5 was positively correlated with the expressions of genes related to cell proliferation, in paralled with the increased expression of UCHL5, the expression of the pro-apoptosis associated genes was decreased. Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis demonstrated that the overall survival and relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients with high expression of UCHL5 were much shorter (all P<0.001). Conclusions: Down-regulation of UCHL5 inhibits the proliferation and tumor formation and promotes apoptosis of SW527 cells. High expression of UCHL5 may predict poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.","[Report of incidence and mortality of gallbladder cancer in China, 2014].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605978,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],2019 02 15,"Objective: The incidence and mortality of gallbladder cancer from Chinese cancer registries in 2014 were analyzed to describe the prevalence of gallbladder cancer in China.

Methods: All admission data were retrieved from the Psychiatric Hospital and Municipal Hospital of TongLing from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Daily air pollution and meteorological data were collected from the Tongling Environmental Protection Agency and Meteorological Bureau, respectively. A distributed lag non-linear model combined with the generalized additive model were applied to explore the effects of PM(2.5), multi-pollutants, and the interaction between temperature and PM(2.5) on schizophrenia admission. The stratification of temperature was divided by three criteria. The low temperature layer was defined as <P(5) or <P(10) or <P(20); P(5)-P(95) or P(10)-P(90) or P(20)-P(80) was defined as the middle temperature layer; >P(95) or >P(90) or >P(80) was defined as the high temperature layer. Results: From 2014 to 2017, 6 642 patients were admitted for schizophrenia in Tongling, and the median of PM(2.5) and temperature were 47.0 μg/m(3) and 17.5 ℃, respectively. The median concentration of PM(2.5) (P(50)) was taken as a reference. When the exposure concentration of PM(2.5) was P(90), the lagged effect appeared in the first day with RR=1.03 (95%CI: 1.00-1.07) and reached the maximum in the fifth day with RR=1.16 (95%CI: 1.13-1.19).

Methods: From April 2012 to June 2013, we used cluster randomized sampling method to investigate 9 354 children aged 5-17 years old from 68 primary and middle schools in the seven Northeastern Cities (Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Liaoyang and Dandong) in Liaoning Province, and measured their blood pressure (BP). A spatial statistical model nested by aerosol optical depth (AOD) was used to inverse PM(2.5) concentrations. Generalized additive model was used to quantify the association between PM(2.5) exposure and blood pressure in children. To examine the associations, two-level regression model was used to evaluate individual characteristics' modifying effect on the health influence of PM(2.5). Results: The prevalence of hypertension in children was 13.78% (1 289/9 354). The results showed that there was an associations between hypertension and pollutants, and the multivariable regression analysis indicated that the increase in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the OR of hypertension associated with a 10 μg/m(3) increase for PM(2).5 were 3.12 (95%CI: 2.71-3.54) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), 1.45 (95%CI:1.12-1.78) mmHg, and 1.55 (95%CI: 1.10-2.19), respectively. Compared with non-breastfeeding children (OR=2.10, 95%CI: 1.39-3.17), children who were breastfeeding (OR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.00-2.20) exhibited consistently weaker effects, and the interaction effect of P value was 0.002. Conclusion: Study findings indicate that long-term exposure to PM(2.5) is associated with increased arterial BP and hypertension among the children.

Our results suggest that a HIIT training program with TRX have benefits in BMI, handgrip strength, gait speed, and quality of life in older adults.",Preserved Left Atrial Mechanics Following a 5-h Laboratory Triathlon in Euhydrated Athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605921,International journal of sports medicine,2019 02 15,"The purpose of this study was to investigate echocardiographic changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling and left atrial (LA) strain mechanics following prolonged exercise. Ten male triathletes completed a 60-min swim, 180-min bike exercise, and a 60-min all-out run in a laboratory environment. Special attention was paid to prevent dehydration and energy deficit during the exercise protocol. All participants underwent comprehensive echocardiographic analyses of Doppler- and volumetric-derived LV diastolic filling indices and novel speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE)-derived LA strain indices. LV stroke volume (pre: 108.0±15.9 vs. post: 88.8±19.0 mL; p=0.03) and LA passive emptying volume (pre: 31.2±7.5 vs. post: 22.4±9.8 mL; p=0.05) were significantly reduced following the exercise protocol. Of the STE-derived indices of LA function, reservoir and conduit strain did not change significantly, while there was a trend towards enhanced contraction strain (pre: 15.1±3.8 vs. post: 19.4±4.8%; p=0.07). Resting heart rate was significantly higher post-exercise (53.1±5.0 vs. 81.9±16.9 bpm; p<0.001) and its change correlated strongly with depression of Doppler-derived ratio of early to late ventricular filling velocities (r=0.74, p=0.01) and reduction of LA passive emptying volume (r=0.86, p=0.01). Following prolonged exercise, LV stroke volume was reduced due to heart rate related reduction in LA passive emptying volume whereas global LA strain mechanics were not compromised in this study.",[Correction: Motivation for Specialisation in General Practice - A Quantitative Study of NRW's Medical Students in Support of Targeted Recruitment].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605920,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),2019 01 03,,Clinical Characteristics and Neuroimaging Findings in Internal Jugular Venous Outflow Disturbance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605919,Thrombosis and haemostasis,2019 04 04,"Recently, internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS) is gaining increasing attention from clinical researchers due to a series of confounding symptoms that impair the quality of life in affected individuals but cannot be explained by other well-established causes. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the clinical features, neuroimaging characteristics and pathogenesis of IJVS, and explore their possible correlations, in attempt to provide useful clues for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Forty-three eligible patients with unilateral or bilateral IJVS confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography of the brain and neck were enrolled in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging along with magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography angiography was applied to identify the radiological pattern of parenchymal or arterial lesions. Cerebral perfusion and metabolism were evaluated by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Of the 43 patients (46.0 ± 16.0 years old; 30 female), 14 (32.6%) had bilateral and 29 had unilateral IJVS. The common clinical symptoms at admission were tinnitus (60.5%), tinnitus cerebri (67.6%), headache (48.8%), dizziness (32.6%), visual disorders (39.5%), hearing impairment (39.5%), neck discomfort (39.5%), sleep disturbance (60.5%), anxiety or depression (37.5%) and subjective memory decline (30.2%). The presence of bilateral demyelination changes with cloudy-like appearance in the periventricular area and/or centrum semiovale was found in 95.3% (41/43) patients. SPECT findings showed that 92.3% (24/26) patients displayed cerebral perfusion and metabolism mismatch, depicted by bilaterally and symmetrically reduced cerebral perfusion and increased cerebral glucose consumption. IJVS may contribute to alterations in cerebral blood flow and metabolism, as well as white matter lesion formation, all of which may account for its clinical manifestations.",PCSK9 in Haemostasis and Thrombosis: Possible Pleiotropic Effects of PCSK9 Inhibitors in Cardiovascular Prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605918,Thrombosis and haemostasis,2019 02 25,"Since increased cholesterol levels are crucial in determining the development of atheroma, their reduction represents a mainstay in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention. The most recent spectacular advancement in cholesterol-lowering therapy is represented by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Although their benefit over currently available treatments has been ascribed primarily to their strong low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reducing action, several clues suggest that PCSK9 inhibitors may also influence platelet function and blood coagulation. PCSK9 knockout mice develop less venous and arterial thrombosis and show reduced in vivo platelet activation upon arterial injury. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) treated with P2Y12 inhibitors, a direct association between PCSK9 serum levels and residual platelet reactivity was found. A direct correlation between urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-thromboxane-B2, a marker of in vivo platelet activation, and circulating PCSK9 levels was reported in patients with atrial fibrillation. Moreover, recombinant human PCSK9 added in vitro to human platelets potentiated activation induced by weak agonists. Finally, blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), which is associated with stroke and ACS risk, is cleared from the circulation by members of the LDL receptor (LDLR) family. Given that PCSK9 degrades LDLR, it is conceivable that PCSK9 inhibitors by enhancing the expression of LDLR may slightly decrease circulating FVIII, in this way contributing to the prevention of cardiovascular events. This review aims to discuss the possible and hypothetical interactions between PCSK9 and the haemostatic system and to examine the possible pleiotropic effects of PCSK9 inhibitors in cardiovascular prevention.",Plasma Protein Oxidation as a Determinant of Impaired Fibrinolysis in Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605917,Thrombosis and haemostasis,2019 04 04, We investigated clinical and laboratory determinants of plasma protein oxidation and its associations with clot fibrinolysis in type 2 diabetes patients.,[Correction: Health Literacy].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605916,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),2019 06 05,,Sports Medicine International Open -recently published.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605915,International journal of sports medicine,2019 01 08,

The transformant API41 obtained produced 28.5 U/mL of inulinase and its wild-type strain P10 yielded only 8.62 U/mL. Most (97.5%) of the inulinase produced by the transformant API41 was secreted into the culture. During a 10-L fermentation, 66.2% (w/w) lipid in the yeast cells of the transformant API41 and 14.38 g/L of cell dry weight were attained from inulin of 80.0 g/L within 120 h, high inulinase activity (23.7 U/mL) was also produced within 72 h, and the added inulin was actively hydrolyzed. This confirmed that the genetically engineered yeast of A. melanogenum P10 is suitable for direct production of lipids from inulin.

In this article, we review the recent progress related to carbon nanotube (CNT) devices in soft electronics by describing the materials and devices, processing methods, and example applications in soft electronic systems. First, solution-processed semiconducting SWNT deposition methods along with doping techniques used to achieve stable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices are discussed. Various strategies for developing high-performance SWNT-based FETs, such as the proper material choices for the gates, dielectrics, and sources/drains of FETs, and methods of improving FET performance, such as hysteresis repression in SWNT-based FETs, are described next. These SWNT-based FETs have been used in flexible, stretchable, and wearable electronic devices to realize functionalities that could not be achieved using conventional silicon-based devices. We conclude this review by discussing the challenges faced by and outlook for CNT-based soft electronics.",DCA for genome-wide epistasis analysis: the statistical genetics perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605896,Physical biology,2019 02 25,"Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is a now widely used method to leverage statistical information from many similar biological systems to draw meaningful conclusions on each system separately. DCA has been applied with great success to sequences of homologous proteins, and also more recently to whole-genome population-wide sequencing data. We here argue that the use of DCA on the genome scale is contingent on fundamental issues of population genetics. DCA can be expected to yield meaningful results when a population is in the quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) phase studied by Kimura and others, but not, for instance, in a phase of clonal competition. We discuss how the exponential (Potts model) distributions emerge in QLE, and compare couplings to correlations obtained in a study of about 3000 genomes of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.",The half magnetization plateau in Ni3V2O8 studied by electron spin resonance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605894,Journal of physics.

Specifically, a half plateau region is observed in the high field magnetization curve for magnetic fields in the range of 11-19 T. This experimental observation is theoretically unexpected for a standard kagome lattice antiferromagnet, and consequently, the underlying magnetic structure is still unclear. Multi-frequency electron spin resonance results in this study strongly support a collinear magnetic arrangement at the half plateau region. The resonant modes can be well fit by only considering the antiferromagnetic interactions on a four-spin sublattice of the spine sites.",Comparative performance of the finite element method and the boundary element fast multipole method for problems mimicking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605893,Journal of neural engineering,2019 06 10,A study pertinent to the numerical modeling of cortical neurostimulation is conducted in an effort to compare the performance of the finite element method (FEM) and an original formulation of the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) at matched computational performance metrics.,Benchmarking transcranial electrical stimulation finite element models: a comparison study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605892,Journal of neural engineering,2019 03 13,"To compare field measure differences in simulations of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) generated by variations in finite element (FE) models due to boundary condition specification, use of tissue compartment smoothing filters, and use of free or structured tetrahedral meshes based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.","Suppression of riboflavin-sensitized singlet oxygen generation by l-ascorbic acid, 3-O-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid and Trolox.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605891,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 04 01,"Riboflavin (RF), a water-soluble vitamin B2, is an endogenous singlet oxygen photosensitizer in human skin and eye. Time profiles of the near-infrared phosphorescence of singlet oxygen generated by RF have been measured in the absence and presence of l-ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C), 3-O-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid (3-EtAA) and Trolox (TX, a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). These substances suppress the RF-photosensitized singlet oxygen generation. For example, the quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation is decreased to a third by adding 0.4 mmol dm-3 AA or TX (the concentration of dissolved oxygen in air-saturated water is 0.27 mmol dm-3). AA and TX are more efficient suppressors of RF-photosensitized singlet oxygen generation than 3-EtAA. The bimolecular rate constants for quenching of the excited singlet and triplet states of RF by AA, 3-EtAA and TX have been determined through measurements of fluorescence and transient absorption. These measurements suggest that the observed suppression is due to the quenching of the excited singlet and triplet states of RF by AA, 3-EtAA and TX. The bimolecular rate constants for quenching of singlet oxygen by AA, 3-EtAA and TX were determined to be 1.8 × 108, 0.27 × 108, and 4.4 × 108 mol-1 dm3 s-1, respectively.",Resting state connectivity in neocortical epilepsy: The epilepsy network as a patient-specific biomarker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605890,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 01 25,"Localization related epilepsy (LRE) is increasingly accepted as a network disorder.

It provides the potential to directly analyze the health information of at-risk individuals. Although air quality standards have received significant attention in many countries, the potential for better biotoxicity assessment has remained largely unexplored. Here we propose a method using one kind of luminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphereum to detect the biotoxicity of atmospheric particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5). Combined with the results of air pollution data of the year 2013-2014, this method has been proven to have good biotoxicity detection performance, and can evaluate the severity of at least 85% of PM2.5 related biotoxicity in Shanghai during this time period. Based on an established algorithm of this detection system, the biotoxicity of twelve PM2.5 real samples (collected over a month) were tested and divided into different biotoxicity levels. It allows an effective evaluation of biotoxicity of PM2.5 due to the quick and sensitive response of bioluminescence to the concentration of toxic components, which provides a valuable reference to evaluate the biotoxicity of PM2.5. This established method can be easily applied to the analysis and evaluation of any other PM2.5 samples assay by following the steps.",Exposure of Catasetum fimbriatum aerial roots to light coordinates carbon partitioning between source and sink organs in an auxin dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605871,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Light energy is essential for carbon metabolism in plants, as well as controlling the transport of metabolites between the organs. While terrestrial plants have a distinct structural and functional separation between the light exposed aerial parts and the non-exposed roots, epiphytic plants, such as orchids, have shoots and roots simultaneously fully exposed to light. The roots of orchids differ mainly from non-orchidaceous plants in their ability to photosynthesize. Since the roots of Catasetum fimbriatum can synthesize auxin which is acropetally transported to the shoot region, we decided to investigate whether: (1) light treatment of C. fimbriatum roots raises the auxin levels in the plant; and (2) distinct auxin concentrations can change the source-sink relationships, altering the amounts of sugars and organic acids in leaves, pseudobulbs and roots. Among the organs studied, the roots accumulated the highest concentrations of indole-3-acetic-acid (IAA); and when roots were exposed to light, IAA accumulated in the leaves. However, when polar auxin transport (PAT) was blocked with N-(1-Naphthyl)phthalamic acid (NPA) treatment, a significant accumulation of sugars and organic acids occurred in the pseudobulbs and leaves, respectively, suggesting that auxin flux from roots to shoots was involved in carbon partitioning of the aerial organs. Considering that C. fimbriatum plants lose all their leaves seasonally, it is possible the roots are a substituting influence on the growth and development of this orchid during its leafless period.",Added value of multimodal MRI to the clinical diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia variants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605869,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 04 02,To determine the added value of multimodal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to language assessment in the differential diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.,"Effects of polluted seawater on oxidative stress, mortality, and reproductive parameters in the marine rotifer Brachionus koreanus and the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605868,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 03 08,"Although many efforts have been made to understand the toxic effects of metals in aquatic invertebrates, there are limited data regarding metal toxicity in natural ecosystems, as most previous studies were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the field seawater sample found a variety of metals. Exposure to several dilutions of the field seawater sample impacted several endpoints in both species, including mortality and reproduction. Interestingly, the rotifer and copepod test species exhibited different patterns of effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymatic activities, suggesting that different regulatory mechanisms may be activated in the two species in response to exposure to toxic chemicals.

Effects of exposure to these compounds over generations are poorly documented. Therefore, our aims were to characterize behavioral responses and underlying molecular mechanisms in zebrafish exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs and PBDEs as well as in four unexposed offspring generations. Zebrafish (F0) were chronically exposed from the first meal onward to a diet spiked with a mixture containing 22 PCB and 7 PBDE congeners in proportions and concentrations reflecting environmental situations (ΣPCBs = 1991 and ΣPBDEs = 411 ng/g). Four offspring generations (F1 to F4) were obtained from this F0 and were not further exposed. Behavior was assessed at both larval and adult stages. Mechanisms related to behavioral defects (habenula maturation and c-fos transcription) and methylation (dnmts transcription) were monitored in larvae. Exposed adult F0 as well as F1 and F3 adults displayed no behavioral change while F2 expressed anxiety-like behavior. Larval behavior was also disrupted, i.e. hyperactive after light to dark transition in F1 or hypoactive in F2, F3 and F4. Behavioral disruptions may be related to defect in habenula maturation (observed in F1) and change in c-fos transcription (observed in F1 and F2). Transcription of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase (dnmt3ba) was also modified in all generations. Our results lead us to hypothesize that chronic dietary exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCB and PBDE triggers multigenerational and transgenerational molecular and behavioral disruptions in a vertebrate model."

We examined the prognostic impact of the percentage of erythroid cells in the bone marrow (bmery) in 2453 primary untreated MDS patients in a retrospective multi-center analysis. Bmery were quantified in bone marrow smears at the time of diagnosis and were correlated with overall survival (OS) and AML evolution. We identified three distinct risk categories: ""< = 10% bmery"" (poor), ""11-25 or >45% bmery"" (intermediate), and ""26-45% bmery"" (good) with distinct OS of 23, 40 and 48 months, respectively. The percentage of bmery showed prognostic significance concerning OS (Dxy = 0.08, p < 0.001) and AML-free survival (Dxy = 0.15, p < 0.001). Considering the IPSS-R by stratification, the Dxy were 0.09 for survival, and 0.18 for transformation (p < 0.001). Added to the IPSS-R, bmery enhances the prognostic power for both survival (Dxy = 0.39) and time to AML (Dxy = 0.59). Survival and time to AML differ in MDS according to the percentage of bmery. The best outcome was found in those who had normal or near normal bmery counts. Moreover, adding bmery as differentiating feature to the IPSS-R may enhance its prognostic significance.",In silico drug design of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta inhibitors from 2-acylamino-3-aminothienopyridines based on quantitative structure-activity relationships and molecular docking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605855,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 04 03,"Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKK-β), a specific regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is considered a valid target to design novel candidate drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis and various cancers.

The kinase has been clinically observed to harbor a gatekeeper mutation T798M in its active site, which causes acquired resistance to the first-line targeted breast cancer therapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Previously, several theories have been proposed to explain the molecular mechanism of gatekeeper mutation-caused drug resistance, such as blocking of inhibitor binding and increasing of ATP affinity. In the current study, the direct binding of three wild type-selective inhibitors (Lapatinib, AEE788 and TAK-285) and two wild type-sparing inhibitors (Staurosporine and Bosutinib) to the wild-type ErbB2 and its T798M mutant are investigated in detail by using rigorous computational analysis and binding affinity assay. Substitution of the polar threonine with a bulky methionine at residue 798 can impair and improve the direct binding affinity of wild type-selective and wild type-sparing inhibitors, respectively. Hindrance effect is responsible for the affinity decrease of wild type-selective inhibitors, while additional nonbonded interactions contribute to the affinity increase of wild type-sparing inhibitors, thus conferring selectivity to the inhibitors for mutant over wild type. The binding affinity of Staurosporine and Bosutinib to ErbB2 kinase domain is improved by 11.9-fold and 2.1-fold upon T798M mutation, respectively. Structural analysis reveals that a nonbonded network of S-π contact interactions (for Staurosporine) or an S-involving halogen bond (for Bosutinib) forms with the sulfide group of mutant Met798 residue.",Water deficit and abscisic acid treatments increase the expression of a glucomannan mannosyltransferase gene (GMMT) in Aloe vera Burm. F.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605853,Phytochemistry,2019 03 15,"The main polysaccharide of the gel present in the leaves of or Aloe vera Burm.F., (Aloe barbadensis Miller) a xerophytic crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant, is an acetylated glucomannan named acemannan. This polysaccharide is responsible for the succulence of the plant, helping it to retain water. In this study we determined using polysaccharide analysis by carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE) that the acemannan is a glucomannan without galactose side branches. We also investigated the expression of the gene responsible for acemannan backbone synthesis, encoding a glucomannan mannosyltransferase (GMMT, EC 2.4.1.32), since there are no previous reports on GMMT expression under water stress in general and specifically in Aloe vera. It was found by in silico analyses that the GMMT gene belongs to the cellulose synthase-like A type-9 (CSLA9) subfamily. Using RT-qPCR it was found that the expression of GMMT increased significantly in Aloe vera plants subjected to water stress. This expression correlates with an increase of endogenous ABA levels, suggesting that the gene expression could be regulated by ABA. To corroborate this hypothesis, exogenous ABA was applied to non-water-stressed plants, resulting in a significant increase of GMMT expression after 48 h of ABA treatment.",Acylated pelargonidin glycosides from the red-purple flowers of Iberis umbellata L. and the red flowers of Erysimum × cheiri (L.)

By applying the P450 enzyme inhibitors, naproxen and resveratrol, it was shown that the oxidative reaction involved in the postulated conversion of vincamine and vincadifformine is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. In combination with the identification of 9-hydroxyvincamine as a postulated intermediate, this result confirms that the observed stress-induced reverse changes in the alkaloid pattern are caused by modifications of the alkaloids which regularly accumulate in the healthy Vinca minor plants. Up to now, just two main types of defense compounds are distinguished: phytoalexins, which are synthesized de novo from primary metabolites and phytoanticipins, which are constitutively present in plants - either intrinsically active or are activated after cell death by hydrolysis or oxidation of the precursors. In contrast, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that indole alkaloids, representing typical phytoanticipins, are just slightly modified in response to a stress-related elicitation. Accordingly, these modified alkaloids neither represent classical phytoalexins (being synthesized de novo), nor can they be classified as phytoanticipins, since modification does not occur postmortem. Consequently, we propose a new category for these modified alkaloids that we call phytomodificines.",Air pollution exposures and blood pressure variation in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients: A retrospective cohort study in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605850,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Air pollution exposure has been associated with hypertension, but limited studies have examined the associations in diabetic patients. We aimed to examine the associations of exposure to air pollution with blood pressure in diabetic patients. We identified patients who were previously diagnosed as type-2 diabetes mellitus from hospital records from January 2013 to May 2017. We used generalized linear models to estimate adverse effects of air pollution on systolic/diastolic blood pressure in diabetic patients. A total of 40,125 patients were enrolled in this study. An IQR increase in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 exposure was associated with an increased risk of higher systolic blood pressure level (β = 0.628 for PM2.5, β = 0.758 for PM10, β = 0.766 for NO2, β = 0.516 for SO2, β = 0.482 for O3, all P value < 0.05).

Yet little is known about whether groundwater PFAS contaminations in Fuxin could be introduced into home-produced vegetables and eggs in local residences via the application of groundwater for the irrigation or feeding purposes. In the present study, ten PFAS analytes were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to investigate the extent of PFAS contaminations in the groundwater, soil, and home-produced vegetable and egg samples derived from Fuxin. As the predominant PFAS contaminants, perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were observed in groundwater beneath the Fuxin FIP with the maximum concentrations of 21.2 and 2.51 µg/L, respectively, which were 24-fold and 5-fold higher individually compared to those reported previously. Both of them were also higher than the updated health advisories for PFBS and PFOA in drinking water issued by the Minnesota Department of Health and the US Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, short-chain PFASs involving perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and PFBS were found to be the major contaminants in both home-produced vegetables and eggs from the residential gardens around the FIP. Statistically significant relationships were determined between the levels of PFBA, PFOA, and PFBS in local groundwater and those observed in home-produced vegetables (p = 0.003, p = 0.025, and p < 0.001), suggesting potential entry of those PFAS contaminants into home-produced vegetables via irrigation with groundwater beneath the FIP.",Characterization of fava bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes for phytoremediation of cadmium and lead co-contaminated soils coupled with agro-production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605848,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"The identification of high yield genotypes that are capable of accumulating multiple heavy metals in the non-edible parts (roots and shoots), but not in the edible parts (seeds) and have desired nutritional value is necessary for accomplishing phytoremediation coupled with agro-production. In this study, 17 fava bean genotypes were screened in two different field conditions to examine their phytoremediation potential in terms of uptake and translocation of Cd and Pb. Ten genotypes, LBAO, JNJX, DCAN, QXCJ, QIKM, LXYC, YDL6, RBCD, QPID and ZHW6 were found as the best accumulators for Cd and Pb with permissible limit of metals in seeds. The concentration of plant nutrients were genotype and soil type dependent and there was a significant correlation between these two factors. Furthermore, the three genotypes DCAN, LBAO and LXYC showed best performance in alluvial soil type while QPID, RBCD and LXYC were the best in red soil type. Genotype LXYC was similar for both soil types and appeared to be the best fit for phytoremediation coupled with agro-production for slightly or moderately Cd and Pb co-contaminated soil. Therefore, fava bean LXYC genotype is suggested as a potential candidate for phytoremediation of Cd/Pb co-contaminated soils coupled with agro-production.","Brominated flame retardants in atmospheric fine particles in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China: Spatial and temporal distribution and human exposure assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605847,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Atmospheric fine particle (PM2.5) samples were collected over a whole year (April 2016 - March 2017) across five sampling locations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, to investigate the occurrence of novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The concentrations of ∑9NBFRs were in the range of 0.63-104 pg/m3 (15.6 ± 16.8 pg/m3) in atmospheric PM2.5, while the levels of ∑9PBDEs (excluding BDE-209) ranged from 0.05 to 19.1 pg/m3 (2.9 ± 3.8 pg/m3) and BDE-209 concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 138 pg/m3 (22 ± 28 pg/m3). Relatively higher levels of NBFRs and PBDEs were found at urban sampling sites in Beijing City and Shijiazhuang City. Decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) and BDE-209 were the dominant compounds with the relative abundances of 72% in ∑9NBFRs and 90% in ∑10PBDEs, respectively. Generally, the levels of most target BFRs in summer were lower than those in other seasons. However, there were no notable seasonal differences in levels of DBDPE and BDE-209 in atmospheric PM2.5 samples across the BTH region. Significant and positive correlations were found between the concentrations of BFRs and PM2.5. Daily human exposure via inhalation revealed that children have a higher probability of suffering from the adverse effects of BFRs than that of adults. In addition, residents living near sampling locations across the BTH region may suffer high exposure risks to BDE-209 and NBFRs."

At a HRT of 10.6 days, PBR-AB provided the highest removal efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus and zinc (87 ± 2, 91 ± 3 and 98 ± 1%), while the highest organic carbon removals were achieved in PBR-PPB (87 ± 4%). The decrease in HRT from 10.6, to 7.6 and 4.1 day caused a gradual deterioration in organic carbon and nitrogen removal, but did not influence the removal of phosphorus and Zn in both photobioreactors. The decrease in HRT caused a severe wash-out of microalgae in PBR-AB and played a key role in the structure of bacterial population in both photobioreactors.

Based on the urinary data, daily intake for the individuals was back-calculated using a physiology based biokinetic (PBBK) model properly parameterized for BPA, coupled with an exposure reconstruction algorithm. Re-running the PBBK model in forward mode allowed the estimation of biologically effective dose (free plasma BPA) and the respective daily area under the curve (AUC). Finally, risk characterization ratio was derived using both external and internal dose metrics. The urinary BPA levels were found low, with GM of 0.79, 1.51 and 0.20 μg/g creatinine for mothers, children and fathers respectively, similar to the levels of other European countries. Based on the above and accounting for the dynamics of exposure and biokinetics, daily intake was estimated, median exposure levels have been estimated equal to 0.019, 0.035 and 0.005 μg/kg_bw/d for mothers, fathers and children respectively. The highest estimated intake level was found in a child, equal to 0.87 μg/kg_bw/d, while the maximum intake for mothers and fathers were 0.7 and 0.8 μg/kg_bw/d respectively. The respective RCR levels using the EFSA t-TDI of 4 μg/kg_bw/d were 2 magnitudes of order lower below 1, independently of the selected method. It has to be noted that had daily intake been estimated solely based on the urinary concentrations mass balance, the estimated intake would be lower, as a result of the oversimplification on exposure and elimination time dynamics. This highlights the importance for using PBBK modelling based exposure reconstruction schemes for rapidly metabolized and excreted compounds such as BPA, as well as the study design of efficient sampling for rapidly metabolized compounds.",Discovery of first-in-class thiazole-based dual FFA1/PPARδ agonists as potential anti-diabetic agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605833,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 06,"The free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1 or GPR40) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) have attracted a lot of attention due to their role in promoting insulin secretion and sensibility, respectively, which are two major features of diabetes.

In order to improve its clinical potential, either structural modification or the development of novel targeted delivery systems for triptolide have been executed worldwide in the past decades. In this review, we systematically summarized strategies that have been utilized to develop triptolide-targeted delivery methods, including direct conjugation of triptolide to selected ligands such as sugar, short peptide, oligonucleotide, antibody and most importantly encapsulation of triptolide with well-designed nano-vehicle. Thanks to the potent multiple biological activities of triptolide, either direct conjugation of triptolide to selected ligands or encapsulation of triptolide with nanocarriers could provide better anti-inflammatory or anticancer activity. Thus, these targeted delivery strategies could be taken as a starting point for future utilization of triptolide and also other NPs in experimental clinical therapy.","Discovery of potent, orally bioavailable ERK1/2 inhibitors with isoindolin-1-one structure by structure-based drug design.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605831,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 06,"Constitutive activation of MAPK (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK) pathway is frequently observed in many tumors and thus has become an interesting therapeutic target for cancer therapy.

Previous studies have demonstrated its mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic ability. However, its effect on mammalian oocyte maturation remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of DBP on oocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that DBP could significantly reduce mice oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and polar body extrusion (PBE) rates. In addition, oocyte cytoskeleton was damaged and cortical granule-free domains (CGFDs) were also disrupted. Finally, DBP induced early apoptosis of oocyte and granulosa cells (GCs). Collectively, these data demonstrate that DBP could reduce meiosis competence and mouse oocyte development.",Wetting transitions on rough surfaces revealed with captive bubble experiments. The role of surface energy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605814,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"Wettability of solid surfaces is mostly probed with sessile drops rather than bubbles because this method is readily followed out. This recurrent use may lead to a misleading connection of certain phenomena to the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of materials. For instance, the Cassie-Baxter regime and the wicking effect are generally associated only to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, respectively. However, the same phenomenology should be observed when air bubbles (underwater conditions) in contact with solid surfaces are used instead. In particular, one might expect that rough-hydrophilic surfaces become superaerophobic due to the appearance of a hybrid dewetting regime, like the Cassie-Baxter regime described for rough-hydrophobic surfaces. Otherwise, rough-hydrophobic surfaces might become superaerophilic due to air-wicking.",Electrospun nanostructured Co3O4/BiVO4 composite films for photoelectrochemical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605813,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"Co3O4/BiVO4 (Co/BiV) based nanostructured photoanode films were fabricated by simple facile electrospinning method and were characterized by a variety of techniques. It was found that the films have web-linked structure, composed of BiVO4 and Co3O4 nanostructures. The photoanode was used for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) degradation of bisphenol-A (BPA) by illumination at 0.25 V vs. SCE assisted by 1 mM peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The removal percentage of BPA was enhanced to 96% for the Co/BiV film that was much better than that of BiVO4 film, which was 48%. The pseudo-first kinetic constants were raised from 0.1126 min-1 to 0.4714 min-1, respectively. The enhanced PEC performance of Co/BiV films can be attributed its p-n heterojunction setup and synergetic contribution of PMS, which efficiently inhibits the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The free radicals quenching experiment and electron spin resonance suggested that the major reactive oxygen species were photogenerated holes, superoxide radicals and sulfate radicals. These findings demonstrate that PMS assisted Co/BiV films, are good candidates for PEC application in environmental purification.",Automated geographic atrophy segmentation for SD-OCT images based on two-stage learning model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605812,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 02 03,"Automatic and reliable segmentation for geographic atrophy in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images is a challenging task. To develop an effective segmentation method, a two-stage deep learning framework based on an auto-encoder is proposed. Firstly, the axial data of cross-section images were used as samples instead of the projection images of SD-OCT images. Next, a two-stage learning model that includes offline-learning and self-learning was designed based on a stacked sparse auto-encoder to obtain deep discriminative representations. Finally, a fusion strategy was used to refine the segmentation results based on the two-stage learning results. The proposed method was evaluated on two datasets consisting of 55 and 56 cubes, respectively. For the first dataset, our method obtained a mean overlap ratio (OR) of 89.85 ± 6.35% and an absolute area difference (AAD) of 4.79 ± 7.16%. For the second dataset, the mean OR and AAD were 84.48 ± 11.98%, 11.09 ± 13.61%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate segmentation results on these two datasets without using retinal layer segmentation.",Tributyltin and perfluorooctane sulfonate play a synergistic role in promoting excess fat accumulation in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) via in ovo exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605811,Chemosphere,2019 04 05,"The ubiquitous environmental obesogens tributyltin (TBT) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) may accumulate in parent and be transferred to their offspring, resulting in trans-generational adverse effects. In this study, we investigated the combined toxic and obesogenic effects of TBT and PFOS on the early life stages of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). In ovo nanoinjection was used to simulate the maternal transfer process. Doses were controlled at 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 2.5 ng/egg (TBT) and at 0, 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 ng/egg (PFOS), with a full factorial design for mixture formulations. Relatively high doses of agents in mixtures were needed to induce significant mortality (TBT ≥ 0.5 ng/egg) or delayed hatching (PFOS = 5.0 ng/egg) of embryos. The interaction between TBT and PFOS in mixtures had significant effects on the observed hatching delay, but not on acute mortality. Compared with controls, separate exposure to TBT (or PFOS) notably elevated adipose areas at the doses of 0.05 and 0.5 ng/egg, but not at the highest doses. Combined exposure significantly promoted the fat accumulation in newly hatched larvae, even when the doses of TBT and PFOS were both at the levels that did not show obesogenic effect. The interactive effect of TBT and PFOS could aggravate the total obesogenic effect of their mixtures, indicating a synergistic interaction. These results highlight the importance of paying close attention to interaction effects when addressing the impacts of mixtures of environmental obesogens.","Assessment of phytotoxicity, environmental and health risks of historical urban park soils.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605810,Chemosphere,2019 04 05,"Urban soil areas can be contaminated with potentially dangerous heavy metals (HM), which might have got there by means of the human activity. The aim of the present study was to determine the contamination level of the city park soils and its impact on urban ecosystem. The indices assessing soil contamination such as Enrichment Factor (EF), Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), Nemerow Pollution Index (IPIN), and indices assessing health risks, namely Hazard Index (HI) and Carcinogenic Risk (CR), have been calculated. Furthermore, the phytotoxic effect of the soil samples has been determined. The soil contains in average 58.6 mg/kg Zn, 0.3 mg/kg Cd, 27.2 mg/kg Pb and 16.6 mg/kg Cu. Based on EF index, it has been confirmed that the increased amounts of Zn, Cd and Pb in the soil are of the anthropogenic origin. The soil may be classified as moderately to strongly polluted in the case of Zn and Pb according to Igeo. Nevertheless, soil contamination in the park is at a safe level as per IPIN. Based on HI and CR indices, it is possible to state that the soil in the park does not pose any health risks. Subject to the outcomes of the toxicity test, the concentrations of HMs found out in the soils are not inhibitory for plants.",Sulfonamides removal under different redox conditions and microbial response to sulfonamides stress during riverbank filtration: A laboratory column study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605809,Chemosphere,2019 04 05,"Riverbank filtration (RBF) as a barrier of pathogenic microorganisms and organic micropollutants recently has been proven capable of removing sulfonamides. However, the study about the effect of redox conditions on biodegradation of common and persistent sulfonamides in RBF is limited and the response of microbial communities to sulfonamides stress during RBF is unknown. In this study, two column set-ups (with residence time 5 days and 11 days respectively), simulating different redox conditions of riverbank filtration systems, were operated for seven months to investigate 1) the long-term effect of redox conditions on ng∙L-1 level sulfonamides (sulfapyridine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethazine, sulfaquinoxaline) removal, and 2) the microbial community evolution represented by the phylogenetic and metabolic function shift under non-lethal selective pressures of sulfonamides. The results showed that sulfonamides were more degradable under anoxic conditions than oxic and suboxic conditions. In the sulfonamides stressed community, the phylogenetic diversity increased slightly. Relative abundance of an intrinsic sulfonamides resistant bacteria Bacillus spp. increased, suggesting that sulfonamide resistance developed in specific bacteria under sulfonamides contamination pressure in RBF systems. At the same time, an activated transport function in the stressed microbial community was noticed. The predicted relative abundance of gene folP, which encodes dihydropteroate synthase, also increased significantly, indicating a detoxification mechanism and sulfonamides resistance potential under non-lethal selective pressures of sulfonamides in RBF systems.",Bimetallic metal-organic frameworks derived cobalt nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube nanopolyhedra as advanced electrocatalyst for high-performance of activated carbon air-cathode microbial fuel cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605807,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 24,"A new type of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube embedded cobalt nanoparticles nanopolyhedra (Co-NCNTNP) electrocatalyst synthesized via pyrolysis bimetallic metal-organic frameworks was investigated to modify the activated carbon air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC). X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope characterization confirmed the combination of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube and transition metal element in Co-NCNTNP. Rotating disk electrode measurement revealed the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of as-prepared Co-NCNTNP was mainly proceeded via a four-electron pathway like Pt/C. When fabricated into activated carbon cathode, the optimized MFC reached the maximum power density of 2252 ± 46 mW m-2, which was 154% higher than that of control. Moreover, the resistance including total resistance and charge transfer resistance of modified cathode significantly decreased comparing to the control, which was beneficial to better MFC performance. Therefore, all attracting properties suggested that noble-metal-free and high-efficiency Co-NCNTNP could be considered as a Pt-alternative electrocatalyst for ORR in MFC.",Label-free immunosensors based on a novel multi-amplification signal strategy of TiO2-NGO/Au@Pd hetero-nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605806,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 24,"A label-free electrochemical immunosensor for quantitative detection of human epididymis specific protein 4 antigen (HE4 Ag) was developed by a novel multi-amplification signal system. The multi-amplification signal system was formed by loading bimetallic Au@Pd holothurian-shaped nanoparticles (Au@Pd HSs) on titanium oxide nanoclusters functionalized nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (TiO2-NGO). The Au@Pd HSs were obtained via seed-mediated approach with in-situ grown palladium nanoarms on gold nanorods (Au NRs) surfaces, which possessed good electrocatalysis for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction and excellent biocompatibility. The TiO2-NGO with the high catalytic activity and large specific surface area was synthesized by hydrothermal method. Using H2O2 as an electrochemically active substrate, the prepared label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on the TiO2-NGO/Au@Pd HSs hetero-nanostructures as the signal amplification platform exhibited excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability for the detection of HE4 Ag. Meanwhile, the linear range from 40 fM to 60 nM with the detection limit of 13.33 fM (S/N = 3) was obtained, indicating the immunosensor offers a promising method for clinical detection of HE4 Ag.",OXTR rs53576 polymorphism impacts interpersonal adaptability: Dispositional forgiveness as a mediator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30605805,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 04 05,"Polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene have been shown to be related to individual differences in social skills that are important for building and maintaining social relationships, such as the capability to efficiently process social information and regulate emotions. However, what remains unclear is the potential roles of OXTR polymorphisms in interpersonal adaptability, namely the ability to cope with the situational demands of interpersonal interactions. In this study, we examined the roles of OXTR rs53576 polymorphism in interpersonal adaptability, empathic perception, and dispositional forgiveness in a cohort of 573 college freshmen. The results indicated that the scores on interpersonal adaptability and dispositional forgiveness, apart from empathic perception, increased as functions of the number of G alleles of OXTR rs53576. Moreover, dispositional forgiveness, but not empathic perception, mediated the association between OXTR rs53576 and interpersonal adaptability. The findings highlight the influences of the OXTR gene on adaptive interpersonal interactions, especially when individuals face changing social situations."
