Potential applications of BALOs include biomass reduction, their use against pathogenic bacteria in agriculture, and in medicine as an alternative against antibiotic resistant pathogens. Such different environments and uses mean BALOs should be active under a range of viscosities. In this study, the predatory behavior of two strains of the periplasmic predator B. bacteriovorus, and of the epibiotic predator Micavibrio aeruginosavorus, was examined in viscous polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solutions at 28o C and at 37o C, using fluorescent markers and plate counts to track predator growth and prey decay. We found that at high viscosities, although swimming speed was largely decreased, the three predators reduced prey to levels similar to those of non-viscous suspensions, albeit with short delays. Prey motility and clumping didn't affect the outcome. Strikingly, under low initial predator concentrations, predation dynamics were faster with increasing viscosity, an effect that dissipated with increasing predator concentrations. Changes in swimming patterns and in futile predator-predator encounters with viscosity, as revealed by path analysis under changing viscosities, along with possible PVP-mediated crowding effects, may explain the observed phenomena.

Here, using a well-controlled motor task, we explored how deactivation is shaped during typical human development and whether deactivation is related to task performance. Healthy right-handed children (8-11 years), adolescents (12-15 years), and young adults (20-24 years; 20 per group) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with their eyes closed while performing a repetitive button-press task with their right index finger in synchronization with a 1-Hz sound. Deactivation in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex (SM1), bilateral visual and auditory (cross-modal) areas, and bilateral default mode network (DMN) progressed with development. Specifically, ipsilateral SM1 and lateral occipital deactivation progressed prominently between childhood and adolescence, while medial occipital (including primary visual) and DMN deactivation progressed from adolescence to adulthood. In adults, greater cross-modal deactivation in the bilateral primary visual cortices was associated with higher button-press timing accuracy relative to the sound. The region-specific deactivation progression in a developmental period may underlie the gradual promotion of sensorimotor function segregation required in the task. Task-induced deactivation might have physiological significance regarding suppressed activity in task-irrelevant regions. Furthermore, cross-modal deactivation develops to benefit some aspects of task performance in adults.",Reading concept analysis: Why Draper has a point.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136083,Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals,2019 05 28,"Peter Draper has offered a critique of concept analysis in nursing, suggesting that many concept analysis studies can be regarded as low-grade literature reviews. Although I will argue en passant that he was right, defending Draper is not my main concern in this paper. Instead, I undertake a close reading of a single study, and identify a series of puzzles about what it says. The puzzles pertain to the distinction between concept and phenomenon; the function of definition; discriminating between the concept of interest and other concepts; how defining attributes are derived; in what sense concept analysis clarifies the concept; whether concept analysis can adjudicate current debates; the role of model cases. The point is to show how a precise and detailed interrogation of this kind sets an agenda of questions which can be asked about other examples of the same genre. The approach gives rise to concerns about the politics of reading in the current academic environment, and I refer to these concerns briefly at the end.",Cytocholestasis and Hypercalcemia - what's the connection?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136082,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 05 28,"A 63-year-old woman with hypertension, smoking and past history of alcohol abuse was referred to consultation due to cytocholestasis without hyperbilirubinemia.

Here, we characterized the taxonomic and functional gene diversity (16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing analyses), as well as the specific bacterial abundances, in biofilms from diverse nearby and distant locations, both inshore and offshore, and tested them for their ability to induce settlement of the biofouling tubeworm Hydroides elegans, an inhabitant of bays and harbors around the world. We found that compositions of the bacterial biofilms were site specific, with the greatest differences between inshore and offshore sites. Further, biofilms were highly diverse in their taxonomic and functional compositions across inshore sites, whilst relatively low diversity was found at offshore sites. H. elegans settled on all biofilms tested, with settlement strongly correlated with bacterial abundance. Bacterial density in biofilms was positively correlated with biofilm age. Our results suggest that the localized distribution of H. elegans is not determined by ""selection"" to locations by specific bacteria, but is more likely linked to the prevailing local ecology and oceanographic features that affect the development of dense biofilms and the occurrence of larvae.

However, pre- and post-processing of data can be labour-intensive, preventing wider uptake of the method. We have now developed R.SamBada, an R-package providing a pipeline for landscape genomic analysis based on Samβada, spanning from the retrieval of environmental conditions at sampling locations to gene annotation using the Ensembl genome browser. As a result, R.SamBada standardizes the landscape genomics pipeline, eases the search for candidate genes of local adaptation, enhancing reproducibility of landscape genomic studies. The efficiency and power of the pipeline is illustrated using two examples: sheep populations from Morocco with no evident population structure, and Lidia cattle from Spain displaying population sub-structuring. In both cases, R.SamBada enabled rapid identification and interpretation of candidate genes, which are further discussed in the light of local adaptation.

We totally identified 5058 proteins in sheep hypothalamus, where 22 in PF vs. MF, and 39 proteins in PL vs. ML were differentially expressed, respectively. We then conducted a functional analysis including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis to reveal the potential roles of these DEPs. The proteins ENSOARP00000020097, ENSOARP00000006714, GH, HDAC4, and XRN2 in PF vs. MF, and BAG4, IGF1R, HSD11B1, and TTR in PL vs. ML appeared to modulate reproduction, presumably by influencing the activities of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In addition, HH3, a DEPs identified in PL vs. ML, may participate in regulating reproduction by way of methylation and acetylation. This study provides an alternative method to identify DEPs associated with sheep prolificacy from the hypothalamus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The purity of the domains and the chiral molecular conformation are confirmed by spatially revolved synchrotron micro-XRD experiments and neutron diffraction, respectively. Macroscopic inversion twin symmetry observed between the crystal wings suggests a pseudoracemic structure that is not a solid solution or a layered crystal structure, but an unusual structural variant of conglomerates and racemic twins. Computed interaction energies for molecular pairs in the racemic and enantiopure polymorphs of HCT, and the observation of large opposing unit cell dipole moments for the enantiopure domains in these twin crystals, suggest a plausible crystal nucleation mechanism for this unusual crystal habit.",Neuromelanin or DaT-SPECT: which is the better marker for discriminating advanced Parkinson's disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136060,European journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"To investigate whether the neuromelanin-positive substantia nigra pars compacta area (NM-SNc) on neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI), and the specific binding ratio (SBR) on 123 I-N-v-fluoropropyl-2b-carbomethoxy3b-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) can be correlated with motor fluctuations (MF) in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).",Low compliance with hepatocellular carcinoma screening guidelines in hepatitis B/C virus co-infected HIV-patients with cirrhosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136059,Journal of viral hepatitis,2019 05 28,"The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is increasing. In patients with cirrhosis, guidelines recommend HCC screening every 6 months. We assessed compliance with HCC screening guidelines in cirrhotic HBV/HCV-HIV-co-infected patients. HBV/HCV-HIV-co-infected patients with cirrhosis were enrolled from 4 European prospective cohorts participating in the COHERE collaboration, followed from 1 January 2005-1 January 2015. Assessment of liver cirrhosis was based on clinical diagnosis and liver biopsy or Fibroscan. Compliance with HCC screening guidelines was defined as one ultrasound every 6 months. Generalized estimating equation models adjusted for repeated measurements were fitted to determine predictors of low compliance. Different sensitivity analyses were performed and validation of the data was carried out by randomly checking 10% of each cohort's data. 646 HIV-patients with the diagnosis of cirrhosis were included: 518 (80%) HCV-, 85 (13%) HBV- and 43 (7%) HBV/HCV-co-infected. Median age at cirrhosis diagnosis was 44 years, median follow-up time since diagnosis was 5.3 years. Screening ≤6 months was performed in 6-18% of individuals from 2005-2015. If the screening interval was increased to 9 or 12 months, compliance improved to 7-24% and 7-30% respectively. Thus, compliance with HCC screening guidelines in cirrhotic HIV-patients co-infected with HBV and/or HCV in Europe is low. In light of an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of liver cirrhosis this situation needs to be addressed urgently. This article is protected by copyright.

This fungus can survive for years in soil as melanized microsclerotia. We found that VdCmr1, a transcription factor, is required for melanin production and increased survival following UV irradiation in V. dahliae, but not for microsclerotia production or virulence. Here, we provided evidence how VdCmr1 protects against high temperature (HT) and UV irradiation in V. dahliae. The results indicate that VdCmr1 mediates entry to the diapause period in V. dahliae in response to HT, and contributes to the expression of proteins to minimize protein misfolding and denaturation. VdCmr1 deletion results in the misregulation of DNA repair machinery, suggestive of reduced DNA repair capacity following UV irradiation and in correlation with the low survival rate of UV-treated VdCmr1 mutants. We discovered a putative VdCmr1-dependent gene cluster associated with secondary metabolism and stress responses. We also functionally characterized two VdCmr1-responsive genes participating in HT and UV response. These results shed further light on the roles of VdCmr1 in protection from HT or UV irradiation, and the additional insights into the mechanisms of this protection may be useful to exploit for more effective disease control.

Various theories, including autoimmunity, Mycobacterial infection and aberrant response to food and other ingested materials, have been abandoned for lack of robust proof. This review will provide the evidence, obtained from patients with this condition, that the common predisposition to Crohn's is a failure of the acute inflammatory response to tissue damage. This acute inflammation normally attracts large numbers of neutrophil leukocytes which engulf and clear bacteria and autologous debris from the inflamed site. The underlying predisposition in Crohn's disease is unmasked by damage to the bowel mucosa, predominantly through infection, which allows faecal bowel contents access to the vulnerable tissues within. Consequent upon failure of the clearance of these infectious and antigenic intestinal contents, it becomes contained, leading to a chronic granulomatous inflammation, producing cytokine release, local tissue damage and systemic symptoms. Multiple molecular pathologies extending across the whole spectrum of the acute inflammatory and innate immune response lead to the common predisposition in which defective monocyte and macrophage function plays a central role. Family linkage and exome sequencing together with GWAS have identified some of the molecules involved, including receptors, molecules involved in vesicle trafficking, and effector cells. Current therapy is immunosuppressant, which controls the symptoms but accentuates the underlying problem, which can only logically be tackled by correcting the primary lesion/s by gene therapy or genome editing, or through the development of drugs that stimulate innate immunity.

Although animal-derived natural polymers are well studied, they typically lack injectability and fail to eliminate the potential risks of immunogenic reactions or unknown pathogen contamination. Despite extensive research activities to explore ideal injectable hydrogels, such state-of-the-art technology remains inaccessible to non-specialists. In this article, the design of a new injectable hydrogel platform that can be extemporaneously prepared from commercially available animal-component-free materials is described. The hydrogels can be prepared simply by mixing mutually reactive aqueous solutions without necessitating specialized knowledge or equipment. Their solidification time can be adjusted by choosing proper buffer conditions from immediate to an extended period of time, that is, few or several tens of minutes depending on the concentration of polymeric components, which not only provides injectability, but enables 3D encapsulation of cells. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells can be encapsulated and cultured in the hydrogels at least for 2 weeks by traditional cell culture techniques, and retrieved by collagenase digestion with cell viability of approximately 80%.

Within this pathway, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET and AXL act as upstream regulators of RAS/RAF/MEK/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). MAPK signaling is active in both early and advanced stages of tumorigenesis, and it promotes tumor proliferation, survival and metastasis. MAPK regulatory effects on cellular constituent of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is for immunosuppressive purposes. Cross-talking between MAPK with oncogenic signaling pathways including WNT, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, NOTCH and (in particular) with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is contributed to the multiplication of tumor progression and drug resistance. Developing resistance (intrinsic or acquired) to MAPK targeted therapy also occurs due to heterogeneity of tumors along with mutations and negative feedback loop of interactions exist between various kinases causing rebound activation of this signaling. Multidrug regimen is a preferred therapeutic avenue for targeting MAPK signaling. To enhance patient tolerance and to mitigate potential adversarial effects related to the combination therapy, determination of a desired dose and drug along with pre-evaluation of cancer-type-specific kinase mutation and sensitivity especially for patients receiving triplet therapy is an urgent need.

All rights reserved.",Division plane placement in pleomorphic archaea is dynamically coupled to cell shape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136034,Molecular microbiology,2019 06 12,"One mechanism for achieving accurate placement of the cell division machinery is via Turing patterns, where nonlinear molecular interactions spontaneously produce spatiotemporal concentration gradients. The resulting patterns are dictated by cell shape. For example, the Min system of Escherichia coli shows spatiotemporal oscillation between cell poles, leaving a mid-cell zone for division. The universality of pattern-forming mechanisms in divisome placement is currently unclear. We examined the location of the division plane in two pleomorphic archaea, Haloferax volcanii and Haloarcula japonica, and showed that it correlates with the predictions of Turing patterning. Time-lapse analysis of H. volcanii shows that divisome locations after successive rounds of division are dynamically determined by daughter cell shape. For H. volcanii, we show that the location of DNA does not influence division plane location, ruling out nucleoid occlusion. Triangular cells provide a stringent test for Turing patterning, where there is a bifurcation in division plane orientation. For the two archaea examined, most triangular cells divide as predicted by a Turing mechanism; however, in some cases multiple division planes are observed resulting in cells dividing into three viable progeny. Our results suggest that the division site placement is consistent with a Turing patterning system in these archaea.",In Situ Incorporation of Pores and Nanoparticles into Polymer Surfaces Using Melt Crystallization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136033,Macromolecular rapid communications,2019 05 28,"Engineering the surface properties of a material without affecting its bulk properties is desirable for many applications, but it is often not readily achievable because it requires a complex series of processing steps. This study presents for the first time a simple and straightforward method that can convert regular flat polymer surfaces into various porous composite surfaces. The controlled dissolution of the polymer surface by a dispersion and subsequent melt crystallization allows for the successful embedding of dispersed inorganic or organic particles in the pore walls.

We hypothesized that the down-regulation of GLP-1R by hyperglycemia might reduce the renal-protective effects of GLP-1R agonists in diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this study, we examined the effects of high glucose on the expression of GLP-1R and its signaling pathways in the HBZY-1rat mesangial cell line. We found that high glucose reduced GLP-1R mRNA levels in HBZY-1 cells and in the renal cortex in db/db mice comparing with control groups. In consistence, GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 induced CREB phosphorylation was attenuated by high glucose but not low glucose treatment, which is paralleled with abrogated anti-inflammatory functions in HBZY-1 cells linked with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. In consistence, GLP-1R inhibition aggravated the high glucose-induced activation of NF-κB and MCP-1protein levels in cultured HBZY-1 cells while over-expression of GLP-1R opposite effects. We further proved that metformin restored high glucose-inhibited GLP-1R mRNA expression and decreased high glucose evoked inflammation in HBZY-1 cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that high glucose lowers GLP-1R expression and leads to inflammatory responses in mesangial cells, which can be reversed by metformin. These data support the rationale of combinative therapy of metformin with GLP-1R agonists in DN. This article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, optical and noninvasive methods to detect the increase of the amounts of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in living cells is a promising strategy to find out symptoms and environmental cause of neurodegenerative diseases, also for identifying compounds that could inhibit gathering of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Therefore, we generated a pair of fluorescent protein (Azg; Azamigreen and Kuo; Kusabiraorange) tagged ubiquitin on its N-terminus (Azg-Ub and Kuo-Ub) and developed an Azg/Kuo-based FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assay to estimate the amount of poly-ubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo. The FRET intensity was attenuated in the presence of ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor, PYR-41, indicating that both fluorescent ubiquitin is incorporated into ubiquitin chains likewise normal ubiquitin. The FRET intensity was enhanced by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, and was reduced in the presence of the autophagy activator Rapamycin, designating that ubiquitin chains with fluorescent ubiquitin act as the degradation signal equally with normal ubiquitin chains. In summary, the above optical methods provide powerful research tools to estimate the amounts of poly-ubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo, especially noninvasively in living cells.

Compared to traditional cryogenic methods for separation, based on different boiling points of H2 and D2, the use of ultramicroporous materials offers a more efficient alternative method. Due to their rigid structures, permanently high porosity, tunable pore sizes and adjustable internal surface properties, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials built through the coordination between organic linkers and metal ions/clusters, are more suitable for this approach than zeolites or carbon-based materials. Here, dynamic gas flow studies on H2/D2 quantum sieving in MFU-4, a metal-organic framework with ultra-narrow pores of 2.5 Å, are presented. A specially designed sensor with a very fast response based on surface acoustic waves is used. On-chip measurements of diffusion rates in the temperature range 27-207 K reveal a quantum sieving effect, with D2 diffusing faster than H2 below 64 K and the opposite selectivity above this temperature.

Upon 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH), the hepatocytes proliferate and contribute to liver regeneration. After severe liver injury when the proliferation of residual hepatocytes are blocked, the biliary epithelial cells (BECs) lose their morphology and express the hepatoblast and endoderm markers, dedifferentiate into bi-potential progenitor cells (BP-PCs), then proliferate and re-differentiate into mature hepatocytes. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the formation of BP-PCs after extreme liver injury. Using zebrafish liver extreme injury model, we found that the mTORC1 signaling regulated dedifferentiation of BECs and proliferation of BP-PCs. mTORC1 signaling was upregulated in BECs during extreme hepatocytes ablation and continuously expressed in later liver regeneration. Inhibition of mTORC1 by early chemical treatment before hepatocyte ablation blocked the dedifferentiation from BECs into BP-PCs. Late mTORC1 inhibition after liver injury reduced the proliferation of BP-PC-derived hepatocytes and BECs, but did not affect BP-PC re-differentiation. mTOR and raptor mutants exhibited defects in BEC transdifferentiation including dedifferentiation, BP-PC proliferation, and re-differentiation, similar to the chemical inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: mTORC1 signaling governs the BECs-driving liver regeneration by regulating the dedifferentiation of BECs and the proliferation of BP-PC-derived hepatocytes and BECs.

Such changes in ecosystems are particularly likely when the host is a predator that mediates the dynamics of trophic cascades. Here, we experimentally tested how parasite load of a small predatory fish, the threespine stickleback, can affect the occurrence and strength of trophic cascades and ecosystem functioning. In a factorial mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the density of stickleback (low vs. high), and the level of parasite load (natural vs. reduced). In addition, we used two stickleback populations from different lineages: an eastern European lineage with a more pelagic phenotype (Lake Constance) and a western European lineage with a more benthic phenotype (Lake Geneva). We found that stickleback caused trophic cascades in the pelagic but not the benthic food chain. Evidence for pelagic trophic cascades was stronger in treatments where parasite load of stickleback was reduced with an antihelmintic medication, and where fish originated from Lake Constance (i.e., the more pelagic lineage). A structural equation model revealed that differences in stickleback lineage and parasite load were most likely to impact trophic cascades via changes in the composition, rather than overall biomass, of zooplankton communities. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence that parasites of predators can influence the cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels with consequences on ecosystem functioning.",How do I structure logistic processes in preparation for outsourcing of cellular therapy manufacturing?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135995,Transfusion,2019 05 28,"As cell and gene therapies (CGT) assume center stage in early-phase clinical trials for several acute and chronic diseases, there is heightened interest in the standardization and automation of manufacturing processes in preparation for commercialization. Toward this goal, a hybrid and oftentimes geographically separated model comprising regional cell procurement and infusion facilities and a centralized cell manufacturing unit is gaining traction in the field. Although CGT processing facilities in academic institutions are not involved directly in the manufacturing of these therapies, they must be prepared to collaborate with commercial or contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and be ready to address several supply-chain challenges that have emerged for autologous and allogeneic CGT. Academic center cell-processing facilities must handle many events up- and downstream of manufacturing such as donor screening, cell collection, product labeling, cryopreservation, transportation, and thaw infusion. These events merit closer evaluation in the context of multifacility manufacturing since standard procedures have yet to be established. Based on our institutional experience, we summarize logistical challenges encountered in the handling and distribution of CGT products in early phase studies, specifically those involving CMO (outsourced) manufacturing. We also make recommendations to standardize processes unique to the CGT supply chain, emphasizing the need to maintain needle-to-needle traceability from product collection to infusion.

A wealth of studies have explored the effects of large mammals on arthropods, but to date they have reported such widely varying results that generalizations have been elusive. Three factors are likely drivers of this variability: the widely varying life-history characteristics of different arthropod groups, the highly variable landscapes that mammalian herbivores commonly inhabit, and temporal variation in environmental conditions. 2. Here, we use an 18-year-old exclosure experiment stratified across three distinct coastal prairie habitats in northern California to address the effects of a reintroduced mammalian herbivore, tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) on the composition, richness, and abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods over two years with very different precipitation regimes. 3. We found that elk shifted the composition of arthropod communities, increasing the abundance of ants, beetles, spiders and mites, decreasing the abundance of woodlice and bristletails in some but not all habitats types, and having no effect on the abundance of bugs, crickets and springtails. Elk also increased richness and changed the composition of ant-genera and beetle morpho-species. Interestingly, the effects of elk on arthropod composition, richness and abundance varied little between years, despite very different precipitation levels, biomass accumulation, and thatch height. 4. Elk reduced shrub cover, aboveground herbaceous biomass, and thatch height and increased soil compaction, and these changes predicted the abundance and richness of arthropods, although taxonomic groups varied in their responses, presumably due to differences in environmental requirements. 5. Synthesis. Our research highlights the importance of using long-term experiments to assess the cascading effects of large herbivores on the composition of ground-dwelling arthropod communities and to identify the mechanisms that indirectly shape arthropod responses to herbivores among variable habitats and years in order to develop a greater understanding of the variable responses of arthropods to large mammalian herbivores.

One of the most effective and sustainable ways to manage plant pathogens is to use genetic modification (GM) and genome editing, expanding the breeder's toolkit. For use in the field, these solutions must be efficacious, with no negative effect on plant agronomy, and deployed thoughtfully. They must also not introduce a potential allergen or toxin. Expensive regulation of biotech crops is prohibitive for local solutions. With 11-30% average global yield losses and greater local impacts, tackling plant pathogens is an ethical imperative. We need to increase world food production by at least 60% using the same amount of land, by 2050.

However, few studies have documented the individual and combined consequences of these direct and indirect effects. 2. We studied an ant-tended aphid along an elevational gradient, where lower elevations were more arid. Hypotheses of stronger species interactions at lower elevations and a greater sensitivity of higher trophic levels to climate led us to predict increased top-down control of aphids by natural enemies (third trophic level) but even stronger protection from mutualist ants (fourth trophic level) with increasing aridity. As a result, we predicted that mutualism strength and aphid abundance would increase with aridity. 3. We documented patterns of aphid abundance and tested for both the direct and multi-trophic indirect effects of aridity on aphid performance. To do so, we used both observational and manipulative methods across two years in replicate high and low elevation valleys, where summer temperatures decreased by 3.7°C and precipitation increased by 27 mm/mo from low to high elevations. 4. Aphid colonies were 75% larger in the most (vs. least) arid sites, and this was best explained by changes in interactions with predators and ants. Aphids were unaffected by the direct effects of the abiotic environment or its indirect effects via host plant quality. In contrast, natural enemy effects increased with aridity; under ant exclusion, natural enemies had no effect on aphids in the least arid sites but depressed colony growth by 252% in the most arid sites. Ant activity also increased with aridity, with ants discovering more aphid colonies and experimental baits and allocating more foragers per aphid, although there was no effect of aridity on ant abundance or community composition. Correspondingly, the mutualist services provided by ants increased with aridity; ants provided no benefits to aphids in the least arid sites but doubled colony growth in the most arid sites. 5. In summary, an elevational cline in herbivore abundance was driven by a monotonic increase in trophic level sensitivity to aridity. These findings illustrate that predicting species responses to climate change will require a multi-trophic perspective. This article is protected by copyright.

In addition to cyanobacterial genes, plastids recruited for their functioning eukaryotic proteins encoded by the host nucleus and also bacterial proteins of non-cyanobacterial origin. Thus, plastid proteins and plastid-localized metabolic pathways evolved by tinkering using gene toolkits from different sources. This mixed heritage seems especially complex in secondary algae containing green plastids, the acquisition of which appears to have been facilitated by many previous acquisitions of red algal genes (the ""red carpet hypothesis"").

However, the limited number of significant cancer-related genes obtained so far only partially explains the biological complexity of HNSCC and hampers the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We pursued a multi-scale omics approach based on whole-exome sequencing, global DNA methylation and gene expression profiling data derived from tumor samples of the HIPO-HNC cohort (n=87), and confirmed new findings with datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Promoter methylation was confirmed by MassARRAY analysis and protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. We discovered a set of cancer-related genes with frequent somatic mutations and high frequency of promoter methylation. This included the ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), which showed variable promoter methylation and expression in both tumor samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections unraveled a gradual loss of RYR2 expression from normal mucosa via dysplastic lesion to invasive cancer, and indicated that reduced RYR2 expression in adjacent tissue and precancerous lesions might serve as risk factor for unfavorable prognosis and upcoming malignant conversion. In summary, our data indicate that impaired RYR2 function by either somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing is a common event in HNSCC pathogenesis. Detection of RYR2 expression and/or promoter methylation might enable risk assessment for malignant conversion of dysplastic lesions. This article is protected by copyright.

Eighteen residents engaged in individual interview sessions. Self-perception of health was positive, despite reporting multiple chronic health problems. Participants did not subscribe to a narrative that being old meant decline, loss, and despair. Obstacles to health care access were normalized, and a redemptive capacity to bounce back from adversity was remarkable.

We studied the influence of soil water availability and palm height on the plasticity of xylem anatomy of oil palm fronds and their embolism resistance at well-drained and seasonally flooded riparian sites in lowland Sumatra, Indonesia. We found overall mean P12 and P50 values, i.e., the xylem pressures at 12 or 50% loss of hydraulic conductance, of -1.05 and - 1.86 MPa, respectively, indicating a rather vulnerable frond xylem of oil palm. This matches diurnal courses of stomatal conductance, which in combination with the observed low xylem safety evidence a sensitive water loss regulation. While the xylem anatomical traits vessel diameter (Dh), vessel density and potential hydraulic conductivity (Kp) were not different between the sites, palms in the moister riparian plots had on average by 0.4 MPa higher P50 values than plants in the well-drained plots. This could largely be attributed to differences in palm height between systems. As a consequence, palms of equal height had by 1.3 MPa less negative P50 values in the moister riparian plots than in the well-drained plots. While palm height was positively related to P50, Dh and Kp decreased with height. The high plasticity in embolism resistance may be an element of the drought-response strategy of oil palm, which, as a monocot, has a relatively deterministic hydraulic architecture. We conclude that oil palm fronds develop a vulnerable water transport system, which may expose the palms to increasing drought stress in a warmer and drier climate. However, the risk of hydraulic failure may be reduced by considerable plasticity in the hydraulic system and the environmental control of embolism resistance, and a presumably large stem capacitance.",IMPACT OF PELVIC AND RAD-BOARD LEAD SHIELDS ON OPERATOR AND PATIENT RADIATION DOSE IN TRANS-RADIAL CORONARY PROCEDURES.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135929,Radiation protection dosimetry,2019 05 28,Trans-radial approach for cardiac catheterisation procedures has long been associated with high operator and patient radiation dose.

Resolving palaeognath phylogenetic relationships has historically proved difficult, and short internal branches separating major palaeognath lineages in previous molecular phylogenies suggest that extensive incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) might have accompanied a rapid ancient divergence. Here, we investigate palaeognath relationships using genome-wide data sets of three types of noncoding nuclear markers, together totaling 20,850 loci and over 41 million base pairs of aligned sequence data. We recover a fully resolved topology placing rheas as the sister to kiwi and emu + cassowary that is congruent across marker types for two species tree methods (MP-EST and ASTRAL-II). This topology is corroborated by patterns of insertions for 4274 CR1 retroelements identified from multispecies whole-genome screening, and is robustly supported by phylogenomic subsampling analyses, with MP-EST demonstrating particularly consistent performance across subsampling replicates as compared to ASTRAL. In contrast, analyses of concatenated data supermatrices recover rheas as the sister to all other nonostrich palaeognaths, an alternative that lacks retroelement support and shows inconsistent behavior under subsampling approaches. While statistically supporting the species tree topology, conflicting patterns of retroelement insertions also occur and imply high amounts of ILS across short successive internal branches, consistent with observed patterns of gene tree heterogeneity. Coalescent simulations and topology tests indicate that the majority of observed topological incongruence among gene trees is consistent with coalescent variation rather than arising from gene tree estimation error alone, and estimated branch lengths for short successive internodes in the inferred species tree fall within the theoretical range encompassing the anomaly zone. Distributions of empirical gene trees confirm that the most common gene tree topology for each marker type differs from the species tree, signifying the existence of an empirical anomaly zone in palaeognaths.

The growing problem about toxicity of antifungal drugs and multidrug resistance aggravates the need for the development of new effective strategies. Natural compounds in this context represent promising alternatives having potential to be exploited for improving human health. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the antifungal effect of a naturally occurring phenolic, octyl gallate (OG), on Candida albicans and to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that OG at 25 μg/ml could effectively inhibit C. albicans. Mechanistic insights revealed that OG affects mitochondrial functioning as Candida cells exposed to OG did not grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. Dysfunctional mitochondria triggered generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which led to membrane damage mediated by lipid peroxidation. We explored that OG inhibited glucose-induced reduction in external pH and causes decrement in ergosterol levels by 45%. Furthermore, OG impedes the metabolic flexibility of C. albicans by inhibiting the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase, which was also confirmed by docking analysis. Additionally, OG affected virulence traits such as morphological transition and cell adherence. Furthermore, we depicted that OG not only prevented biofilm formation but eliminates the preformed biofilms. In vivo studies with Caenorhabditis elegans nematode model confirmed that OG could enhance the survival of C. elegans after infection with Candida. Toxicity assay using red blood cells showed only 27.5% haemolytic activity. Taken together, OG is a potent inhibitor of C. albicans that warrants further structural optimization and pharmacological investigations.",LARGE VARIATION IN BRANCH AND BRANCH-TIP HYDRAULIC FUNCTIONAL TRAITS IN DOUGLAS-FIR (PSEUDOTSUGA MENZIESII) APPROACHING LOWER TREELINE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135912,Tree physiology,2019 05 28,"Few studies have quantified intraspecific variation of hydraulic functional traits in conifers across elevation gradients that include range boundaries. In the Intermountain West, U.S., the lower elevational-limit of forests (lower treeline) is generally assumed to be caused by water limitations to growth and water relations, yet few studies directly show this. To test this assumption, we measured changes in a suite of traits the characterize drought tolerance such as drought-induced hydraulic vulnerability, hydraulic transport capacity, and morphological traits in branch-tips and branches of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) along a 400-m elevation gradient in southeastern Idaho that included lower treeline. As elevation decreased, vulnerability to hydraulic dysfunction and maximum conductivity both decreased in branches; some hydraulic safety-efficiency trade-offs were evident. In branch-tips, the water potential at the turgor loss point decreased, while maximum conductance increased with decreasing elevation, highlighting that branch-tip-level responses to less moisture-availability accompanied by warmer temperatures might not be coordinated with branch responses. As the range boundary was approached, we did not observe non-linear changes in parameters among site or increased variance within sites, which current ecological hypotheses on range limits suggest. Our results indicate that there is substantial plasticity in hydraulic functional-traits in branch-tips and branches of Douglas-fir, although the direction of the trends along the elevation gradient sometimes differed between organs. Such plasticity may mitigate the negative impacts of future drought on Douglas-fir productivity, slowing shifts in its range that are expected to occur with climate change.","Midday napping in children: Associations between nap frequency and duration across cognitive, positive psychological well-being, behavioral, and metabolic health outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135911,Sleep,2019 05 28,"Poor sleep and daytime sleepiness in children and adolescents have short and long-term consequences on various aspects of health.

A method using the ratio of urine excretion to thyroid retention activity was proposed to retrospectively determine individual-specific ITB levels; bioassay functions and dose coefficients corresponding to ITB levels were calculated separately using the latest biokinetic model and fundamental data. Moreover, insensitive measurement points of time, which led to similar results regardless of ITB level, were determined based on the dose per unit content.

'Suchazao' Exposed to Temperature Stresses Reveals Modification in Protein Synthesis and Photosynthetic and Anthocyanin Biosynthetic Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135909,Tree physiology,2019 05 28,"To determine the mechanisms in tea plants responding to temperature stresses (heat and cold), we examined the global transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of the tea plant cultivar 'Suchazao' under moderately low temperature (ML), severely low temperature (SL), moderately high temperature (MH), and severely high temperature (SH) using RNA-Seq and HPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The identified differentially expressed genes indicated that the synthesis of stress-resistance protein might be redirected to cope with the temperature stresses. We found that heat shock protein genes Hsp90 and Hsp70 played more critical roles in tea plants in adapting to thermal stress than cold, while LEA played a greater role under cold than heat stress, more types of zinc finger genes were induced under cold stress as well. In addition, energy metabolisms were inhibited by SH, SL, and ML. Furthermore, the mechanisms of anthocyanin synthesis were different under the cold and heat stresses. Indeed, the CsUGT75C1gene, encoding UDP-glucose: anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyl transferase, was up-regulated in the SL-treated leaves but down-regulated in SH. Metabolomics analysis also showed that anthocyanin monomer levels increased under SL. These results indicate that the tea plants share certain foundational mechanisms to adjust to both cold and heat stresses. They also developed some specific mechanisms for surviving the cold or heat stresses. Our study provides effective information about the different mechanisms tea plants employing in surviving cold and heat stresses, as well as the different mechanisms of anthocyanin synthesis, which could speed up the genetic breeding of heat- and cold-tolerant tea varieties.",STRATEGY OF COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGE OPTIMISATION IN CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AND NECK SOFT TISSUE IN EMERGENCY PATIENTS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135908,Radiation protection dosimetry,2019 05 28,"With regards to the use of ionisation radiation in the computed tomography (CT), optimal parameters should be used to reduce the risk of incidence of secondary cancers in patients who are constantly exposed to X-rays.

The concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb are estimated by radiochemical separation followed by alpha counting. Grain size, season, Tsunami waves and place of sampling have a decisive bearing on 210Po and 210Pb concentration in abiotic components. Plankton shows a higher Kd factor (104) compared to seaweeds and sea grass (103). Pond ecosystems recorded the highest Kd factor (4·3 × 104) compared to other freshwater and marine ecosystems. Bioaccumulation of 210Po and 210Pb varies with respect to variety of seafood. The committed effective dose (CED) calculated for shellfish species maintained a higher range of 2.5 × 10-2 mSv/y to 9.8 × 10-1 mSv/y and for fish species fluctuated from 3.8 × 10-4 mSv/y to 2.0 × 10-1 mSv/y.

Two different methods were employed to determine the reference air kerma rate, namely a conventional ionisation chamber and a G(E) function method used a newly developed scintillation spectrometer. To fulfil the requirement of the ISO 4037 and suppress scattering of Cs gamma ray within the room as far as possible, a suitable lead collimator was introduced to limit the irradiation area at test points and placed at the middle height in an irradiation room with a grating floor. From measured results of de-convoluted photon fluence spectrum and the variation of evaluated reference air kerma rates between 1.0 m and 3.0 m from the centre of the source, gamma ray scattering from the room structures was found to be negligible. The reference air kerma rate at distances between1.0 m and 3.0 m could be then interpolated by simply considering the inverse square law of the distance and air attenuation. The resulting Cs gamma ray calibration field could provide ambient dose equivalent rates of 0.7-7.2 μSv h-1 for use with environmental radiation monitoring devices. Finally, we attempted to calibrate a widely used NaI(Tl) scintillation survey metre, obtaining a quite satisfactory calibration factor. These results also imply that such survey metres can be employed to monitor affected areas and assess the progress of decontamination, as they can provide appropriate measurements of the ambient dose equivalent rate."

Following these discoveries, many mouse models have been developed and tested to analyze the effects of gene dose alterations in small chromosomal segments and single genes of 22q11.2. Despite several limitations to modeling mental illness in mice, mouse models have identified several genes on 22q11.2 Tbx1, Dgcr8, Comt , Sept5 and Prodh that contribute to dimensions of ASD and schizophrenia, including working memory, social communication and interaction and sensorimotor gating. Mouse studies have identified that heterozygous deletion of Tbx1 results in defective social communication during the neonatal period and social interaction deficits during adolescence/adulthood. Over-expression of Tbx1 or Comt in adult neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus delays the developmental maturation of working memory capacity. Collectively, mouse models of variants of these four genes have revealed several potential neuronal mechanisms underlying various aspects of psychiatric disorders, including adult neurogenesis, microRNA processing, catecholamine metabolism, and synaptic transmission. The validity of the mouse data would be ultimately tested when therapies or drugs based on such potential mechanisms are applied to humans.",The functional false discovery rate with applications to genomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135886,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",2019 05 28,"The false discovery rate (FDR) measures the proportion of false discoveries among a set of hypothesis tests called significant. This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the FDR. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating FDRs and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an ""informative variable"", is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The FDR is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first application is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.",Exercise induction of key transcriptional regulators of metabolic adaptation in muscle is preserved in type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135885,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 05 28,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

This method requires expected mortality rates from general population life tables: each cancer patient is assigned an expected (background) mortality rate obtained from the life tables, typically at least according to their age and sex, from the population they belong to. However, those life tables may be insufficiently stratified, as some characteristics such as deprivation, ethnicity, and comorbidities, are not available in the life tables for a number of countries. This may affect the background mortality rate allocated to each patient, and it has been shown that not including relevant information for assigning an expected mortality rate to each patient induces a bias in the estimation of the regression parameters of the excess hazard model. We propose two parametric corrections in excess hazard regression models, including a single-parameter or a random effect (frailty), to account for possible mismatches in the life table and thus misspecification of the background mortality rate. In an extensive simulation study, the good statistical performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated, and we illustrate their use on real population-based data of lung cancer patients. We present conditions and limitations of these methods and provide some recommendations for their use in practice.",Long-term Outcomes in a Large Randomized Trial of HIV-1 Salvage Therapy: 96-week Results of AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5241 (OPTIONS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135883,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 06 10,Short-term (48-week) results of the OPTIONS trial showed that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can be safely omitted from salvage therapy as long as the regimen has a cumulative activity of >2 active antiretroviral (ARV) medications.

LTs include the di-hydroxy acid LT (LTB4) and the cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs; LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), all of which are involved in both acute and chronic inflammation. We and other groups identified a high-affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT1; the LTC4 and LTD4 receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2; and the LTE4 receptor, GPR99. Pharmacological studies have shown that BLT1 signaling stimulates degranulation, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of neutrophils, whereas CysLT1 and CysLT2 signaling induces airway inflammation by increasing vascular permeability and the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. Recently, we and other groups suggested that the LTB4-BLT1 axis and the cysteinyl LTs-CysLT1/2 axis are involved in chronic inflammatory diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, obesity, cancer, and age-related macular degeneration using animal models for disease and gene knockout mice. This review describes the classical and novel functions of LTs and their receptors in several inflammatory diseases and discusses the potential clinical applications of antagonists for LT receptors and inhibitors of LT biosynthesis."

Through first principles simulations, we report a new N-rich aluminum nitride AlN5, which crystallizes with the space group P1[combining macron] at 20 GPa and then transforms into the I4[combining macron]2d phase at 60 GPa. We have identified and proved the delocalization effects of π electrons in the strongly covalent Lewis poly-nitrogen structure via the one-dimensional particle in a box mechanism, which contributes to the metallization and stability of the system. This implies that not all strongly covalently bonded systems with highly localized electrons exhibit nonmetallic properties in III-V main group nitrides. Furthermore, pressure results in the hybridization configuration mutation from sp2 in the P1[combining macron] phase to a mixture of sp2 and sp3 hybridization in the I4[combining macron]2d phase, which leads to phase transition from metal to insulator. With increasing pressure, the band gap increases abnormally, exhibiting anti-metallization induced by the strong hybridization. Interestingly, the P1[combining macron] and I4[combining macron]2d structures are simultaneously accompanied by a high energy density and hardness, which enable them to have a greater ability to resist elasticity, plastic deformation and external force destruction in potential applications. Their energy density and hardness are up to 3.29 kJ g-1 and 15.2 GPa in the P1[combining macron] phase but especially 6.14 kJ g-1 and 31.7 GPa in the I4[combining macron]2d phase.",On the ubiquity of helical α-synuclein tetramers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135803,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 14,"The experimental finding that α-synuclein (αS) occurs physiologically as a helically folded tetramer begs the question: why are helical tetramers the most populated multimers? While the helical tetramer is known to resist aggregation, the assembly mechanism of αS peptides remains largely unknown. By rationally designing a series of helical multimers from dimer to octamer, we characterized the free energy landscape of wild-type and mutated multimers using molecular dynamics computer simulations. Competition between supramolecular packing and solvation results in well-hydrated dimers and trimers, and more screened pentamers to octamers, with the helical tetramer possessing the most balanced structure with the lowest activation energy. Our data suggest that familial mutants are very sensitive to alterations in monomer packing that would in turn raise the energy barriers for multimerization. Finally, the hypothesis that the αS tetramer forms a soluble, benign ""dead end"" to circumvent aggregation is supported by its computed very weak association with negatively charged cell membranes."

Recent studies indicated that integrins participated in TLR-mediated innate immunity. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of integrin β3 and TLR4 signaling using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced sepsis and LPS-treated macrophage cell model. In a lethal CLP model, the survival rate of integrin β3 mice was higher than that of wild type mice. The levels of ALT, AST, Cre, BUN and LDH in the serum and CD14 protein expression in the tissues were significantly decreased in integrin β3 mice. A similar effect with regard to CD14 down-regulation was observed in septic TLR4 mice. In wild type macrophages, the inhibition of integrin β3 by P11 or with a specific antibody, inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 release at the early time period of LPS stimulation. However, during the late periods of LPS stimulation this effect was not noted. CD14 expression levels had no change in such treatment. In contract, LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 release and LPS-induced CD14 expression were significantly decreased in integrin β3macrophages. The inhibition of the TLR4 pathway by TAK-242, or in TLR4 mutant macrophages abolished LPS-induced CD14 expression. Integrin β3 pathway activation by vitronectin exhibited no effect in CD14 expression. Furthermore, recombinant CD14 protein stimulation reversed integrin β3 deficiency and caused lower TNF-α and IL-6 release. Moreover, the molecular interaction of TLR4 and integrin β3 was significantly increased following LPS stimulation. In conclusion, integrin β3 positively regulated TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses via CD14 expression in macrophages in septic condition.

However, systems failures and inefficiencies lurk in every organization, often emerging only after patients have experienced harm or delays. Simulation and debriefing, focused on identifying systems gaps, can proactively lead to improvements in safety and quality. Systems-focused debriefing requires a different approach than traditional, learner-focused debriefing. We describe PEARLS for Systems Integration, a conceptual framework, debriefing structure and script that facilitators can use for systems-focused debriefing. The framework builds on Promoting Excellence And Reflective Learning in Simulation, using common debriefing strategies (plus/delta, focused facilitation, and directive feedback) in a modified format, with new debriefing scripts.

Due to its anatomy and position in the facial skeleton, the orbit becomes a region susceptible to trauma which may also involve the penetration of foreign bodies (FBs). These events can have serious repercussions depending on their extent due to the proximity of the orbit with other noble structures of the face and skull. Because of this, a system of prehospital management of traumas must be established, in order to promote a better prognosis for patients. The present study aims to report the case of a patient suffering from a motorcycle accident with multiple fragments of FBs in the region of orbit-zygomatic-maxillary complex. The emergency surgical removal of the fragments was performed by a multidisciplinary team, involving Ophthalmology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology (OMST). Wound cleansing and debridement were performed with subsequent removal of the foreign bodies by the OMST team, in addition to the reduction and fixation of related fractures. As for Ophthalmology, the evisceration of the affected eye was performed due to its anatomical and functional impairment. The patient is 12 months postoperatively, with no aesthetic or functional complaints regarding OMST. The anatomical knowledge of the traumatized region, besides the establishment of the conduct regarding the removal of possible associated foreign bodies are required so that the success of the treatment can be obtained, aiming to minimize the damages to the patient.",Transnasal Endoscopic Retrieval of a Metallic Intraorbital Intraconal Foreign Body Facilitated by an Intraoperative Magnetic Stick.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135659,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 05 28,"Here, we report the case of an intraorbital intraconal foreign body that was successfully retrieved by a transnasal endoscopic approach facilitated intraoperatively by a magnetic stick.

GLUT1 upregulation was highly specific for distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi, yet poorly sensitive, likely because of expression of other GLUT isoforms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate GLUT2 and GLUT3, as melanoma biomarkers. A tissue microarray, consisting of 91 primary melanomas, 18 melanoma metastases, and 56 nevi, was examined using GLUT2 and GLUT3 immunohistochemistry. A semiquantitative scoring method was used to determine the percentage of positive tumor cells and staining intensity. GLUT2 was negative in all melanomas and benign nevi examined. Increased GLUT3 expression was more frequent in melanoma than in nevi (P < 0.0001), and in metastatic melanoma than in primary melanomas (P < 0.001). Of melanoma cases, 85.3% express either GLUT1 or GLUT3 or both, 39.4% of melanoma cases coexpressed GLUT1 and GLUT3, 17.4% of melanoma cases only expressed GLUT1, 28.4% of melanoma cases only expressed GLUT3, and 14.7% of melanoma cases were negative for both markers. Patients whose melanoma exhibited a high level of GLUT3 had significantly lower survival rates than those with low GLUT3 expression (P = 0.002). Evaluating both GLUT1 and GLUT3 increased the diagnostic value by increasing the sensitivity while the specificity remained high. In conclusion, GLUT2 was not expressed in melanocytes. GLUT3 expression was upregulated in melanoma compared with nevi, especially in those with worse prognosis.

T cell receptor beta chain repertoire was examined via Sanger sequencing of mutant and wild-type in blood and tumour from metastatic melanoma patients at times of tumour progression (n = 8) and via Illumina sequencing in tumour derived T cells and in uncultured T cells (uncultured), wild-type and mutant from blood before and after immune checkpoint blockade (n = 1). Mutant from tumour (3 of 5; P < 0.001), but not blood (0 of 9), were enriched compared to wild-type for binding melanoma-associated antigen pentamers. T cell receptor beta analysis in patients with tumour progression (n = 8) detected increased melanoma associated T cells in mutant compared to wild-type from blood (Monte Carlo P = 10 ). Comparison of blood samples before and after immune checkpoint blockade with prior tumor from one metastatic melanoma patient detected increased T cell receptor beta sharing between tumour and mutant compared to tumour and wild-type or tumour and uncultured: 11.0% (72/656), 1.5% (206/13 639) and 1.3% (381/29 807), respectively (Monte Carlo P = 10 for mutant versus wild-type and mutant versus uncultured).

However, because elevated ICP can be due to multiple pathophysiological processes, its interpretation is not straightforward. We propose a formal taxonomy of intracranial hypertension, which defines ICP elevations into 3 major pathophysiological subsets: increased cerebral blood volume, masses and edema, and hydrocephalus. (1) Increased cerebral blood volume increases ICP and arises secondary to arterial or venous hypervolemia. Arterial hypervolemia is produced by autoregulated or dysregulated vasodilation, both of which are importantly and disparately affected by systemic blood pressure. Dysregulated vasodilation tends to be worsened by arterial hypertension. In contrast, autoregulated vasodilation contributes to intracranial hypertension during decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure that occur within the normal range of cerebral autoregulation. Venous hypervolemia is produced by Starling resistor outflow obstruction, venous occlusion, and very high extracranial venous pressure. Starling resistor outflow obstruction tends to arise when cerebrospinal fluid pressure causes venous compression to thus increase tissue pressure and worsen tissue edema (and ICP elevation), producing a positive feedback ICP cycle. (2) Masses and edema are conditions that increase brain tissue volume and ICP, causing both vascular compression and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure leading to oligemia. Brain edema is either vasogenic or cytotoxic, each with disparate causes and often linked to cerebral blood flow or blood volume abnormalities. Masses may arise from hematoma or neoplasia. (3) Hydrocephalus can also increase ICP, and is either communicating or noncommunicating. Further research is warranted to ascertain whether ICP therapy should be tailored to these physiological subsets of intracranial hypertension.","Safe, Effective Chin and Jaw Restoration With VYC-25L Hyaluronic Acid Injectable Gel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135570,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],2019 05 28,"VYC-25L, a hyaluronic acid soft-tissue filler with lidocaine, is designed to restore and create facial volume in the chin and jaw.",Psoriatic spondylitis or ankylosing spondylitis with psoriasis: same or different?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135567,Current opinion in rheumatology,2019 05 28,"Of the four musculoskeletal domains of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the axial domain is the least studied.

However, immunoediting and ensuing antigen loss remain the major obstacles to curative therapy in up to 25% of patients. For example, to achieve the CD19-negative phenotype, malignant cells can pick from a broad array of mechanisms, including focal loss-of-function mutations, dysregulated trafficking to the cell surface, alternative splicing, and lineage switching. In other cases, where resistance is mediated by insufficient antigen density, trogocytosis has been proposed as a possible underlying mechanism. To overcome these barriers, compensatory strategies will be needed, which could include using combinatorial CARs, harnessing epitope spreading, and targeting tumor neoantigens."

CSM has unique morphologic and immunohistochemical features, characterized by intradermal syncytial growth of spindled, ovoid, and histiocytoid cells and consistent staining for S-100 protein and EMA, and differs from other myoepithelial tumors by showing only infrequent keratin staining. Rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene is now known to occur in up to half of all skin and soft tissue myoepithelial tumors, with a wide family of documented fusion partners. In 2013, we reported frequent (80%) EWSR1 rearrangements in CSM, but were unable to identify the fusion partner using available studies at that time. After recent identification of an index case of CSM harboring an EWSR1-PBX3 fusion, we used a combination of targeted RNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies to investigate the genetic features of a cohort of CSM. An EWSR1-PBX3 fusion was identified in all 13 cases successfully tested. RNA sequencing was successful in 8/13 cases, all of which were found to have identical breakpoints fusing exon 8 of EWSR1 to exon 5 of PBX3. FISH confirmed both EWSR1 and PBX3 rearrangements in 9/9 cases tested, which included 4 confirmed to have EWSR1-PBX3 fusion by RNA-Seq, 3 cases that failed RNA-Seq, and 2 cases examined by FISH alone. Two cases failed RNA sequencing but had no additional tissue remaining for FISH studies.

Fourteen tumors were WHO/ISUP grade 2 and 4 were grade 1. All were stage category pT1. The tumors had branching papillae with thin fibrovascular cores, covered by cuboidal to columnar cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, smooth luminal borders, and mostly regular and apically located nuclei with occasional nuclear clearing and inconspicuous nucleoli. Tubule formation and clear cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed in 5 and 9 tumors, respectively. Ten tumors had pseudocapsules. Psammoma bodies, necrosis, mitotic figures and intracellular hemosiderin are absent from all tumors. In contrast, papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1 consisted of delicate papillae covered by a single layer of cells with scanty pale cytoplasm with nuclei generally located in a single layer on the basement membrane of the papillary cores, while type 2 tumors had broad papillae covered by pseudostratified cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and more randomly located nuclei. Both had occasional psammoma bodies, foamy macrophages and intracellular hemosiderin. Immunohistochemically, all were positive for pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen, MUC1, CD10, GATA3, and L1CAM. Cytokeratin 7 was positive in 16 tumors (1 had <5% positivity). CD117 and vimentin were always negative. α-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR/p504s) showed variable staining (range, 10% to 80%) in 5 tumors. However, all tumors in the control group were negative for GATA3 and positive for AMACR/p504s and vimentin immunostains. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the study group demonstrated chromosome 7 trisomy in 5 tumors (33%), trisomy 17 in 5 tumors (33%), and trisomy 7 and 17 in 3 tumors (20%). Chromosome Y deletion was found in 1 of 7 male patients and chromosome 3p was present in all tumors. No tumor recurrence or metastasis occurred. In summary, we propose the term papillary renal neoplasm with reverse polarity for this entity.",PD-L1 Expression in Urothelial Carcinoma With Predominant or Pure Variant Histology: Concordance Among 3 Commonly Used and Commercially Available Antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135485,The American journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 14,"The introduction of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has transformed the management of advanced bladder cancer (BC). Despite its limitations, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry may serve as a predictive biomarker of anti-PD-L1/PD1 therapy. While urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients with predominant or pure variant histology (UCV) account for up to one-third of advanced cases, to date, most ICB BC studies have excluded patients with such histologies. To assess the potential utility of ICB in patients with UCV, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in UCV and compared 3 commonly used and commercially available PD-L1 antibodies. Full sections from 84 UCV cases were stained with clones SP263, 22C3, and SP142, all of which are considered predictive assays to identify UC patients who are more likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, respectively. Expression on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) was assessed. Staining extent and characteristics were evaluated, and concordance among the 3 clones was determined at various cutoff points as used in previous studies in BC. We found that PD-L1 was expressed in a significant percentage of UCV cases at different cutoff points (cutoff 1% TC: 37% to 54%, cutoff 5% TC: 23% to 37%), with the highest expression in UC with squamous differentiation. These figures are equal to or higher than those for classic/pure UC (4% to 30%). The results suggest that patients with UCV may benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and argue against the exclusion of UC with predominant or pure variant histology from clinical ICB studies. The highest expression in both TC and IC was observed with clone SP263, followed by 22C3 and SP142, and all clones showed strong agreement in a pairwise comparison, both in TC and IC (R-values: 0.780 to 0.901), which indicates that all 3 clones are potentially useful in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in UCV.",Macrotrabecular Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Aggressive Subtype of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135484,The American journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 12,"The macrotrabecular (MT) pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been suggested to represent a distinct HCC subtype. We retrospectively reviewed 231 HCC cases. Detailed pathologic evaluation for histologic patterns, including MT-pattern, was performed for each case and recorded as percentage involved at 10% intervals. MT-pattern was defined as having trabeculae >6 cells thick. After excluding all recognized HCC subtypes, remaining cases were deemed conventional HCC (CV-HCC) and served as controls. HCCs with a component of ≥10%, ≥30% and ≥50% MT-pattern were identified in 41 (17.7%), 24 (10.4%) and 4 (1.7%) cases, respectively. The clinicopathologic features of HCCs with 10% to 29% MT-pattern (n=17, 7.4%) were largely similar to CV-HCC. No significant difference was observed between the 30% and 49% (n=20) and ≥50% (n=4) MT groups, hence these were combined for further analysis as MT-HCC. MT-HCCs (≥30% MT-pattern) were larger tumors (5.5 vs. 3.1 cm), were less likely to be associated with cirrhosis (54% vs. 79%), were more likely to have hepatitis B (21% vs. 5%) and less likely hepatitis C infection (33% vs. 58%) compared with CV-HCC. MT-HCC was associated with the presence of anaplastic tumor cells (42% vs. 14%), higher alpha-fetoprotein level, higher AJCC stage, and higher histologic grade. Compared with patients with CV-HCC, patients with MT-HCC had poorer overall survival. Patients with MT-HCC who underwent primary resection or transplantation had a higher recurrence rate and worse recurrence-free survival. Our findings suggest that ≥30% MT-pattern could be used as the more appropriate cut-off for defining MT-HCC, which represents a unique and aggressive HCC histologic subtype."

Implementation of the RRT was based on a collaborative pragmatic quality improvement approach. A team of intensive care specialist trained medical doctors (n = 2) and clinical nurse consultants (n = 2) set up the service with executive support and funding. Roles and responsibilities were clearly detailed, reinforcing a positive, partnership-driven culture. A constantly evolving education strategy was a critical element of implementation and maintenance. Ongoing evaluation includes process and patient outcome data. Serious patient deterioration-related incidents have decreased significantly (from 7 to 1 per year) and the RRT has been universally accepted by clinicians. Key lessons learned include the need for specific protected funding, a partnership approach ensuring hospital clinicians retain responsibility of patient treatment, ongoing education and reinforcement, and strong nursing leadership.

There was no protocol to detect opioid withdrawal at this organization. The purpose of this project was to develop a nursing-driven opioid withdrawal management tool using the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) to address an increase in opioid-addicted patients. Evidence-based practice change was executed using the San Diego 8A's method for adult trauma step-down patients experiencing opioid withdrawal with the COWS tool affecting frequency of nursing attempts at managing opioid withdrawal over an 8-week period. Training was provided to 45 nurses on COWS use in opioid-positive patients exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. Nurses were tested and retested to establish reliability. Nursing management included communication with MDs, safe opioid use education, social work consultation, use of nonopioid pain relief, or other symptomatic medication management. Nursing withdrawal management: pre-COWS = 25%; post-COWS = 96%. There was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of patients evaluated correctly following COWS initiation (n = 28, χ = 29, P < .0001, 95% CI, 47.71-83.74). Data were collected on a matched cohort of symptomatic toxicology-positive patients before and after change (n = 28 pre-COWS and n = 28 post-COWS).

Keywords reflecting the scope of the term ""robot"" were defined for the purposes of this specific search. This broad search yielded large numbers of patents germane to nursing care. These results were narrowed using keywords and the Cooperative Patent Classification schemes to determine relevance, ensure rigor, and capture the most relevant results.

Equipment usability and user interfaces remain an area not fully elucidated. Infusion pumps play a vital role in care delivery, often essential for critical therapies. While pump function is comparatively simple, their programming, configuration, and form provide opportunity for error. Our purpose was to assess qualities nurses identified as important to pump operation by electronic survey. A self-developed usability survey was distributed to a random sample of 500 nurses, stratified by unit type and employed at the large academic quaternary care hospital. The overall response rate was 48% (n = 240). Descriptive and inferential statistics describe the responses and represent more than 5500 weekly infusions. Nurses described confident use of the system with some differences by unit type. Ninety percent of respondents indicated they have omitted use of the dose error reduction system, which should raise safety concerns. Users reported issues with the user interface and error prevention systems. Qualitative items elicited suggestions for improving aspects of the pump.

This review aims to describe the development of consumer mHealth interventions for chronic condition self-management. A scoping review methodology was used to search medical databases for eligible reports, published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, that provided information on consumer mHealth interventions for respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Twenty-one reports were included, representing the development of 14 mHealth interventions. Most were developed collaboratively, using user-centered and participatory design processes. Predesign work involved a thorough needs assessment, and redesign processes were described as iterative, engaging with usability testing and design improvements. Tensions from competing priorities between patients and healthcare professionals were uncovered, with the intention to develop a useful product for the patient while ensuring clinical relevance. This review provides clear evidence that consumer mHealth interventions are developed inconsistently even when engaging with participatory or user-centered design principles, sometimes without direct involvement of patients themselves. Further, the incomplete description of the development processes presents challenges to furthering the knowledge base as healthcare professionals need timely access to quality information on mHealth products in order to recommend safe, effective consumer mHealth interventions.",eHealth Services in the Near and Distant Future in Swedish Home Care Nursing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135467,"Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN",2019 05 28,"Sweden and other developed countries are putting deliberate efforts into eHealth and digitalization of home care nursing. eHealth services have big potential in this area because they can provide mobile access to healthcare information.

We sent a survey to the 264 Swedish municipalities responsible for home care nursing and received 144 responses (55%). The results show a large diversity of eHealth services in use. A few can be considered core services since they are broadly implemented or will be in the near future. Trials are also being carried out with more specialized services. The respondents envision more automation and remote monitoring services, while technical and usability issues are the main obstacles to implementation today.

Recent work has elucidated important subtypes of HCA and biomarkers to identify them, including HCA at an increased risk for malignant transformation. Another key complication of HCAs is the risk of spontaneous tumoral hemorrhage, which may be life-threatening. Identification of a predictive biomarker for this clinical complication would therefore be of clinical value. It has been suggested that Argininosuccinate Synthase 1 (ASS1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) identifies HCA with a high propensity for hemorrhage. The aim of our study was to validate ASS1 IHC as a predictive marker of hemorrhage. Eighty-nine HCAs were collected for ASS1 IHC and subtyped according to published criteria. Clinical records were examined for evidence of tumoral hemorrhage. Twenty-one (23.6%) HCAs were complicated by clinically detected hemorrhage and were more likely to be resected (P=0.0002). Hemorrhage complicated all WHO subtypes of HCA. There was no association between hemorrhage and HCA subtype (P=0.92). Neither the distribution of ASS1 expression nor the intensity of ASS1 expression compared to normal liver showed a significant association with hemorrhage (P=0.051 and 0.34). Interlaboratory comparison of 8 cases showed good agreement regarding the intensity (6/8 and 7/8) and distribution of staining (7/8 and 7/8) across 3 laboratories performing ASS1 IHC. In conclusion, all subtypes of HCA may be complicated by hemorrhage. ASS1 IHC expression did not correlate with hemorrhagic complications. Caution is prudent before routine implementation of ASS1 IHC in clinical practice.",Worth Its Weight in Gold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135442,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,Being a nurse can mean investing emotionally in things you never thought you'd care about.,Decolonization Reduces Risk of Postdischarge MRSA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135441,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,According to this study.,Comprehensive EHR Associated with Higher Nurse Satisfaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135440,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,According to this study.,"Proton-Pump Inhibitor Use Associated with Kidney Injury, Electrolyte Abnormalities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135439,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,According to this study.,Little Change in RNS' Work Schedules in a 10-Year Period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135438,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,According to this study.,Healthy Lifestyle Most Important for Prevention of ASCVD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135437,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,According to this study.,Not Compatible with Nursing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135436,The American journal of nursing,2019 05 28,": Updated several times a week with posts by a wide variety of authors, AJN's blog Off the Charts allows us to provide more timely-and often more personal-perspectives on professional, policy, and clinical issues.

He identifies the humanistic roots of the medical profession and describes efforts to revitalize humanism in medicine in recent decades. He then details anti-humanistic behaviors and policies in the current political environment and makes the case that these behaviors and policies threaten humanism in medicine.

However, the detailed mechanism regulating the recruitment of NFATs to calcineurin remains poorly understood. Here, we report that calcineurin A (CNA), encoded by PPP3CB or PPP3CC, is constitutively ubiquitinated on lysine 327, and this polyubiquitin chain is rapidly removed by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 16 (USP16) in response to intracellular calcium stimulation. The K29-linked ubiquitination of CNA impairs NFAT recruitment and transcription of NFAT-targeted genes. USP16 deficiency prevents calcium-triggered deubiquitination of CNA in a manner consistent with defective maintenance and proliferation of peripheral T cells. T cell-specific USP16 knockout mice exhibit reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Our data reveal the physiological function of CNA ubiquitination and its deubiquitinase USP16 in peripheral T cells.

In the brain and periphery, galanin and opioids signal through their respective GPCRs, GalR1-3 and the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). In this issue of the JCI, Cai and collaborators reveal that heteromers between GalR1 and MOR in the rat ventral tegmental area attenuate the potency of methadone, but not other opioids, in stimulating the dopamine release that produces euphoria. These studies help us understand why some synthetic opioids, such as methadone, do not trigger the release of dopamine in the mesolimbic system but still possess strong analgesic properties.",Fra-2-expressing macrophages promote lung fibrosis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135379,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 05 28,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly disease with limited therapies. Tissue fibrosis is associated with Type 2 immune response, although the causal contribution of immune cells is not defined. The AP-1 transcription factor Fra-2 is upregulated in IPF lung sections and Fra-2 transgenic mice (Fra-2tg) exhibit spontaneous lung fibrosis. Here we show that Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is attenuated upon myeloid-inactivation of Fra-2 and aggravated in Fra-2tg bone marrow chimeras. Type VI collagen (ColVI), a Fra-2 transcriptional target, is up-regulated in three lung fibrosis models, and macrophages promote myofibroblast activation in vitro in a ColVI- and Fra-2-dependent manner. Fra-2 or ColVI inactivation does not affect macrophage recruitment and alternative activation, suggesting that Fra-2/ColVI specifically controls the paracrine pro-fibrotic activity of macrophages. Importantly, ColVI knock-out mice (KO) and ColVI-KO bone marrow chimeras are protected from Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Therapeutic administration of a Fra-2/AP-1 inhibitor reduces ColVI expression and ameliorates fibrosis in Fra-2tg mice and in the Bleomycin model. Finally, Fra-2 and ColVI positively correlate in IPF patient samples and co-localize in lung macrophages. Therefore, the Fra-2/ColVI pro-fibrotic axis is a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for lung fibrosis, and possibly other fibrotic diseases.",Adaptation to Spanish and validation of the Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135377,Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,2019 05 28,The Rhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT) is a widely used patient-based questionnaire developed to evaluate control of rhinitis.

To secure stable profits, some miners organize mining pools and share the rewards from the pool in proportion to each miner's contribution. However, some miners may exhibit malicious behaviors which cause a waste of distributed computation resource, even posing a threat on the efficiency of blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose a new game-theoretic framework to incentivize miners mining honestly and help to bring about a higher total welfare of blockchain networks. We first formulate the mining process as a noncooperative iterated game. We then propose a mechanism in terms of zero-determinant strategies (ZD strategies) to encourage the cooperative mining and improve the efficiency of mining in PoW-based blockchain networks. In addition, we theoretically analyze the maximum system welfare of the target pool through the method of optimization. Numerical illustrations are also presented to support our theoretical results.",Connectivity-Preserving Synchronization of Time-Delay Euler-Lagrange Networks With Bounded Actuation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135375,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,2019 05 31,"This paper proposes a strategy to overcome the threats posed to connectivity-preserving synchronization of Euler-Lagrange networks by time-varying delays and bounded actuation. It first introduces a suitable distributed negative gradient plus damping injection controller, based on which it establishes that the local connectivity of time-delay Euler-Lagrange networks can be preserved by appropriately regulating the interagent connections and increasing the damping injection locally. Yet, actuator saturation may impede the proper modulation of the interagent connections and the injection of sufficient damping and, thus, may threaten the maintenance of connectivity. This paper then develops an indirect coupling control framework which integrates the bounded actuation constraints into the control design. The framework endows every agent with a virtual proxy and couples initially adjacent agents through their virtual proxies. The interproxy couplings then tackle the time-varying delays while the agent-proxy couplings account for the saturation of actuators. Lyapunov-Krasovskii analysis proves that the indirect coupling strategy can drive time-delay Euler-Lagrange networks with bounded actuation to connectivity-preserving synchronization by limiting the energy of the agent-proxy and interproxy couplings according to the actuation constraints. Experiments with Geomagic Touch haptic robots validate the proposed designs compared to a conventional proportional plus damping controller.",Assessment of e-Social Activity in Psychiatric Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135374,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2019 06 06,"This work introduces a novel method to assess the social activity maintained by psychiatric patients using information and communication technologies. In particular, we model the daily usage patterns of phone calls and social and communication apps using point processes. We propose a novel nonhomogeneous Poisson process model with periodic (circadian) intensity function using a truncated Fourier series expansion, which is inferred using a trust-region algorithm. We also extend the model using a mixture of periodic intensity functions to cope with the different daily patterns of a person. The analysis of the usage of phone calls and social and communication apps of a cohort of 259 patients reveals common patterns shared among patients with relatively high homogeneity and differences among patient pathologies.",Convolutional Neural Networks as Asymmetric Volterra Models Based on Generalized Orthonormal Basis Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135372,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 05 28,"This paper introduces a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to derive Volterra models of dynamical systems based on generalized orthonormal basis function (GOBF)-Volterra. The approach derives the parameters of the model through a CNN and the neural network's learned weights represent the poles of a system. Simulation results show that the parameters of the system can be exactly recovered when no noise is applied. Furthermore, when noise is present, the errors in the parameters are very small for both the linear and nonlinear cases. Finally, the approach is used to identify the model of a quadcopter using data from actual flight tests. Comparisons with previous works demonstrate that CNNs can be satisfactorily used for the identification of dynamical systems.",A mm-Sized Free-Floating Wirelessly-Powered Implantable Optical Stimulation Device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135371,IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,2019 05 30,"This paper presents a mm-sized, free-floating, wirelessly-powered, implantable optical stimulation (FF-WIOS) device for untethered optogenetic neuromodulation. A resonator-based 3-coil inductive link creates a homogeneous magnetic field that continuously delivers sufficient power (>2.7 mW) at an optimal carrier frequency of 60 MHz to the FF-WIOS in the near field without surpassing the specific absorption rate (SAR) limit, regardless of the position of the FF-WIOS in a large brain area. Forward data telemetry carries stimulation parameters by on-off-keying (OOK) the power carrier at a data rate of 50 kbps to selectively activate a 4×4 μLED array. Load-shift-keying (LSK) back telemetry controls the wireless power transmission (WPT) by reporting the FF-WIOS received power level in a closed-loop power control (CLPC) mechanism. LEDs typically require high instantaneous power to emit sufficient light for optical stimulation. Thus, a switched-capacitor based stimulation (SCS) architecture is used as an energy storage buffer with one off-chip capacitor to receive charge directly from the inductive link and deliver it to the selected μLED at the onset of stimulation. The FF-WIOS system-on-a-chip (SoC) prototype, fabricated in a 0.35-μm standard CMOS process, charges a 10 μF capacitor up to 5 V with 37% efficiency and passes instantaneous current spikes up to 10 mA in the selected μLED, creating a bright exponentially decaying flash with minimal wasted power. An in vivo experiment was conducted to verify the efficacy of the FF-WIOS by observing light-evoked local field potentials (LFP) and immunostained tissue response from the primary visual cortex (V1) of two anesthetized rats.",Equivalent Circuit Model Viewed from Receiver Side in Human Body Communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135370,IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,2019 05 28,"Human body communication (HBC) is a signal transmission method that uses the human body as a part of the transmission path. The incoming signal through the receiver electrode can be modeled as a signal from a signal source which consists of the equivalent signal source voltage and output impedance. These values are important parameters for analyzing the transmission characteristics of HBC as well as for designing the front-end circuit of the receiver. In this paper, an equivalent circuit model of signal transmission from a transmitter on the human body to an off-body receiver touched by a finger was constructed. The ground electrode of the transmitter was in contact with the human body. This is a different configuration compared to capacitive HBC configurations that leave the ground electrode floating. The relationship between the received signal voltage and the distance between the transmitter's electrodes, the size of the receiver ground, and the transmitter-receiver distance were evaluated. Results were analyzed by using the equivalent circuit model. The transmitter-receiver distance and the distance between the transmitter's electrodes were both independently related to the equivalent signal source voltage. The receiver ground size which was related to the capacitive coupling between the receiver ground and the human body was related to the equivalent output impedance."

Many image textures, especially the small-scale or stochastic textures are rich in high-frequency variations, and are difficult to be preserved. Current state-of-the-art denoising algorithms typically adopt a nonlocal approach consisting of image patch grouping and group-wise denoising filtering. To achieve a better image denoising while preserving the variations in texture, we first adaptively group high correlated image patches with the same kinds of texture elements (texels) via an adaptive clustering method. This adaptive clustering method is applied in an over-clustering-and-iterative-merging approach, where its noise robustness is improved with a custom merging threshold relating to the noise level and cluster size. For texture-preserving denoising of each cluster, considering that the variations in texture are captured and wrapped in not only the between-dimension energy variations but also the within-dimension variations of PCA transform coefficients, we further propose a PCA-transform-domain variation adaptive filtering method to preserve the local variations in textures. Experiments on natural images show the superiority of the proposed transform-domain variation adaptive filtering to traditional PCA-based hard or soft threshold filtering. As a whole, the proposed denoising method achieves a favorable texture-preserving performance both quantitatively and visually, especially for stochastic textures, which is further verified in camera raw image denoising.",Sparse Wavenumber Recovery and Prediction of Anisotropic Guided Waves in Composites: A Comparative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135358,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 05 30,"Guided wave methodologies are among the established approaches for structural health monitoring. For guided wave data, being able to accurately estimate wave properties in the absence of ample measurements can greatly facilitate the often time-consuming and potentially expensive data acquisition procedure. Nevertheless, inherent complexities of the guided waves, including their multi-modal and frequency dispersive nature, hinder processing, analysis, and behavior prediction. The severity of these complexities is even higher in anisotropic media, such as composites. Several methods, including sparse wavenumber analysis, have been proposed in the literature to characterize guided wave propagation by extracting wave characteristics in a particular medium from the information contained in a few measurements, and subsequently using this information for full wavefield prediction. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of guided wave reconstruction techniques, based on sparse wavenumber analysis, for predicting the behavior of guided waves in composite materials. We implement these techniques on several experimental and simulation datasets. We study their performance in estimating the frequency-dependent (dispersive) and anisotropic velocities of guided waves and in reconstructing full wavefields from limited available information.",Debiasing-based Noise Suppression for Ultrafast Ultrasound Microvessel Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135357,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 05 30,"Ultrasound microvessel imaging (UMI) based on the combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) clutter filtering and ultrafast plane wave imaging has recently demonstrated significantly improved Doppler sensitivity, especially to small vessels that are invisible to conventional Doppler imaging. Practical implementation of UMI is hindered by high computational cost associated with SVD, and low blood signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in deep regions of the tissue due to the lack of transmit focusing of plane waves. Concerning the high computational cost, an accelerated SVD clutter filtering method based on randomized SVD (rSVD) and randomized spatial downsampling (rSD) was recently proposed by our group, which showed the feasibility of real-time implementation of UMI. Concerning the low blood flow SNR in deep imaging regions, here we propose a noise suppression method based on noise debiasing that can be easily applied to the accelerated SVD method to bridge the gap between real-time implementation and high imaging quality. The proposed method experimentally measures the noise-induced bias by collecting noise signal using the identical imaging sequence as regular UMI, but with the ultrasound transmission turned off. The estimated bias can then be subtracted from the original power Doppler (PD) image to obtain effective noise suppression. The feasibility of the proposed method was validated under different ultrasound imaging parameters (including transmitting voltages and TGC settings) with a phantom experiment. The noise-debiased images showed an increase of up to 15.3 dB and 13.4 dB in SNR as compared to original PD images on the blood flow phantom and an in vivo human kidney data set, respectively. The proposed noise suppression method has negligible computational cost and can be conveniently combined with the previously proposed accelerated SVD clutter filtering technique to achieve high quality, real-time UMI imaging.",A moving morphable components based shape reconstruction framework for electrical impedance tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135356,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 06 10,"This paper presents a new computational framework in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for shape reconstruction based on the concept of moving morphable components (MMC). In the proposed framework, the shape reconstruction problem is solved in an explicit and geometrical way. Compared with the traditional pixel or shape-based solution framework, the proposed framework can incorporate more geometry and prior information into shape and topology optimization directly and therefore render the solution process more flexibility. It also has the affords potential to substantially reduce the computational burden associated with shape and topology optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested with noisy synthetic data and experimental data, which demonstrates the most popular biomedical application of EIT: lung imaging. In addition, robustness studies of the proposed approach considering modeling errors caused by non-homogeneous background, varying initial guesses, differing numbers of candidate shape components, and differing exponent in the shape and topology description function are performed. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed approach is tolerant to modeling errors and is fairly robust to these parameter choices, offering significant improvements in image quality in comparison to the conventional absolute reconstructions using smoothness prior regularization and total variation regularization.",Automated Classification of Apoptosis in Phase Contrast Microscopy Using Capsule Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135355,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 05 30,"Automatic and accurate classification of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, will facilitate cell biology research. State-of-the-art approaches in apoptosis classification use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these networks are not efficient in encoding the part-whole relationships, thus requiring a large number of training samples to achieve robust generalization. This paper proposes an efficient variant of capsule networks (CapsNets) as an alternative to CNNs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CapsNets achieve competitive performances in target cell apoptosis classification, while significantly outperforming CNNs when the number of training samples is small. To utilize temporal information within microscopy videos, we propose a recurrent capsule network constructed by stacking a CapsNet and a bi-directional long short-term recurrent structure. Our experiments show that when considering temporal constraints, recurrent capsule network achieves 93.8prediction compared to CNNs.",Adaptive feature recombination and recalibration for semantic segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135354,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 05 30,"Fully Convolutional Networks have been achieving remarkable results in image semantic segmentation, while being efficient. Such efficiency results from the capability of segmenting several voxels in a single forward pass. So, there is a direct spatial correspondence between a unit in a feature map and the voxel in the same location. In a convolutional layer, the kernel spans over all channels and extracts information from them. We observe that linear recombination of feature maps by increasing the number of channels followed by compression may enhance their discriminative power. Moreover, not all feature maps have the same relevance for the classes being predicted. In order to learn the inter-channel relationships and recalibrate the channels to suppress the less relevant ones, Squeeze and Excitation blocks were proposed in the context of image clas sification with Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this is not well adapted for segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks since they segment several objects simultaneously, hence a feature map may contain relevant information only in some locations. In this paper, we propose recombination of features and a spatially adaptive recalibration block that is adapted for semantic segmentation with Fully Convolutional - Networks the SegSE block. Feature maps are recalibrated by considering the cross-channel information together with spatial relevance. Experimental results indicate that Recombination and Recalibration improve the results of a competitive baseline, and generalize across three different problems: brain tumor segmentation, stroke penumbra estimation, and ischemic stroke lesion outcome prediction. The obtained results are competitive or outperform the state of the art in the three applications.",Fast and High-resolution Three-dimensional Hybrid-domain Photoacoustic Imaging Incorporating Analytical Focused Transducer Beam Amplitude.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135353,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 05 30,"Recently, many reconstruction methods have been developed to improve the lateral resolution of acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ARPAM) in out-of-focus regions. Though these methods enhance image resolution to some extent, they require advanced computational hardware and large computational time, especially for three-dimensional cases. However, some methods do not consider the finite size of a transducer, while others employ numerical discretization to build a focused transducer model which is less efficient and accurate. To overcome these problems, we propose a three-dimensional ARPAM imaging reconstruction method with high precision, high efficiency, and low memory cost. It inherits the framework of model-based reconstructions and incorporates the forward acoustic model in hybrid-domain. This hybrid-domain acoustic model promotes an analytical solution to establish a focused transducer model. Furthermore, the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) and deconvolution methods are introduced to reduce the required computational time and memory volume for three-dimensional reconstructions. According to the experiment results reconstructed by the proposed method, the lateral resolution of an ARPAM image recorded by a 20MHz focused transducer (NA 0.393) can reach 88.39μm. This resolution exceeds the diffraction limitation of the focused transducer (137.8μm).

Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections -- one between each layer and its subsequent layer -- our network has [Formula: see text] direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially improve parameter efficiency. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet).

However, their requirement for a huge set of positive training pairs is very demanding in practice and the performance is largely constrained for the unseen testing samples due to the severe data shifting issue. In contrast, this paper advocates a different paradigm: part of the learning can be performed online but with nominal costs, so as to achieve online metric adaptation for different query probes. By exploiting easily-available negative samples, we propose a novel solution to achieve the optimal local metric adaptation effectively and efficiently. The insight of our method is the local hard negative samples can actually provide tight constraints to fine tune the metric locally. Our local metric adaptation method is generally applicable to be used on top of any offline-learned baselines. In addition, this paper gives in-depth theoretical analyses of the proposed method to guarantee the reduction of the classification error both asymptotically and practically. Extensive experiments on various VIR tasks have confirmed our effectiveness and superiority."

BRCT domains of TOPBP1 selectively bind conserved phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus of 53BP1. Mutation of these sites does not affect formation of 53BP1 or ATM foci following DNA damage, but abolishes recruitment of TOPBP1, ATR and CHK1 to 53BP1 damage foci, abrogating cell cycle arrest and permitting progression into S-phase.

Thus, many dry-adapted species utilize either metabolic (that produced from metabolism) or dietary (that found in food) water to meet their hydric needs. It is suspected that desert reptiles can fulfill their hydric needs solely through dietary water intake. However, food consumption does not improve the hydration state of Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum), a binge-feeding desert lizard, and meal consumption by snakes leads to increased voluntary drinking. Therefore, we predicted that meal consumption would not improve hydration state in dehydrated western diamondbacked rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox). We found no significant difference in the change in plasma osmolality between moderately dehydrated snakes that consumed a meal and those that did not. In fact, snakes that received a meal reached severe dehydration more than a week sooner than snakes that did not receive a meal. Additionally, consuming a meal when severely dehydrated did not reduce plasma osmolality, whereas severely dehydrated snakes provided with water ab lib. returned to a normosmotic state. These results provide the most convincing evidence that carnivorous desert reptiles likely rely on free-standing water to fulfill their hydric needs. These species have thus had to adapt to sporadic water availability through minimizing water loss and tolerating considerable variation in plasma osmolality."

In this study, we evaluated the expansion of a capybara population in a residential park in São Paulo state, and the implications of such expansion to the occurrence of ticks and BSF. The capybara population was quantified during 2004-2013. In 2012, there was a BSF human case in the area, culminating in the complete fencing of the residential park and the official culling of all capybaras. Quantification of ticks in the environment was performed by dry ice traps from 2005 to 2018. Domestic dogs in 2006-2011 and capybaras in 2012 were serologically tested for the presence of anti-R. rickettsii antibodies. Our results show that capybara numbers increased ≈5 times from 2004 (41 capybaras) to 2012 (230 capybaras). Dry ice traps collected A. sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum. The number of A. dubitatum adult ticks was generally higher than A. sculptum adults during 2005-2006; however, during 2012-2013, A. sculptum outnumbered A. dubitatum by a large difference. During 2016-2018 (after capybara culling), the number of both species fell close to zero. The low numbers of A. sculptum adult ticks during 2005-2006 coincided with relatively low capybara numbers (<80). Thereafter, in 2012, we counted the highest numbers of both A. sculptum ticks and capybaras (230 animals). All 40 canine blood samples were seronegative to R. rickettsii, in contrast to the 48.3% seropositivity (83/172) among capybaras. Our results support that the emergence of BSF in the residential park was a consequence of the increase of the local capybara population, which in turn, provided the increment of the A. sculptum population.

The purpose of the current study is to assess the activity of a novel-engineered IFN-α2b. The crystallographic structure of IFN-α2b and its receptors was acquired from Protein Data Bank. Various amino acid substitutions were designed based on structural properties and other biological characteristics of residues to find the most effective amino acid on IFN affinity to advanced activities. The IFN-α2b mutants and receptors have been modeled and the interactions between two proteins have been studied as in silico by protein-protein docking for both mutants and native forms. The proper nucleic acid sequence IFN-α2 (T79Q) has been prepared based on the selected mutant. The modified IFN gene was cloned in pcDNA 3.1(-) and introduced to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.

Part A,2019 05 28,"
Background:
 Laparoscopic bariatric surgery has been performed safely since 1991. In a persistent search for fewer and smaller scars, single port, needlescopic surgery, and other approaches have been implemented. Our goal was to analyze the safety and feasibility of using incisionless autostatic liver retraction for sleeve gastrectomy. 
Materials and Methods:
 Candidates for sleeve gastrectomy were selected, excluding those <18 and having had prior upper left quadrant surgery. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either a standard five-port technique with a fan-type liver retractor (Group A); or a four-port technique with the liver retracted using a polypropylene 1 suture passed through the right crura and retrieved at the epigastrium employing a fascial closure needle (Group B). All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon. The primary endpoint was surgery duration. Secondary outcomes were quality of surgical-field visualization, complications inherent to liver retraction, and postoperative morbidity. 
Results:
 One hundred patients were recruited (n = 50/group). The groups (both 90% females) were demographically and anthropomorphically comparable. Surgery duration was 30.4 ± 4.6 and 29.6 ± 4.7 minutes for Groups A and B, respectively (P = .41). Visualization was considered very good in 80% versus 82%, good in 16% versus 12%, and poor in 4% versus 6% (P = NS). Two patients from each group (4%) had self-limited minor bleeding from the liver attributed to the retraction technique. No 30-day morbidity was observed. 
Conclusions:
 Liver retraction using a polypropylene suture was both effective and inexpensive. Visualization and the duration of surgery were comparable to a standard liver retractor. This low-cost alternative may diminish the need for expensive instruments and reduce the number of scars without jeopardizing the safety and quality of sleeve gastrectomy.",CircNAPEPLD is expressed in human and murine spermatozoa and physically interacts with oocyte miRNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135264,RNA biology,2019 06 14,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have a critical role in the control of gene expression. Their function in spermatozoa (SPZ) is unknown to date. Twenty-eight genes, involved in SPZ/testicular and epididymal physiology, were given in circBase database to find which of them may generate circular transcripts. We focused on circNAPEPLDiso1, one of the circular RNA isoforms of NAPEPLD transcript, because expressed in human and murine SPZ. In order to functionally characterize circNAPEPLDiso1 as potential microRNA (miRNA) sponge, we performed circNAPEPLDiso1-miR-CATCH and then profiled the expression of 754 miRNAs, by using TaqMan® Low Density Arrays. Among them, miRNAs 146a-5p, 203a-3p, 302c-3p, 766-3p and 1260a (some of them previously shown to be expressed in the oocyte), resulted enriched in circNAPEPLDiso1-miR-CATCHed cell lysate: the network of interactions generated from their validated targets was centred on a core of genes involved in the control of cell cycle. Moreover, computational analysis of circNAPEPLDiso1 sequence also showed its potential translation in a short form of NAPEPLD protein. Interestingly, the expression analysis in murine-unfertilized oocytes revealed low and high levels of circNAPEPLDiso1 and circNAPEPLDiso2, respectively. After fertilization, circNAPEPLDiso1 expression significantly increased, instead circNAPEPLDiso2 expression appeared constant. Based on these data, we suggest that SPZ-derived circNAPEPLDiso1 physically interacts with miRNAs primarily involved in the control of cell cycle; we hypothesize that it may represent a paternal cytoplasmic contribution to the zygote and function as a miRNA decoy inside the fertilized oocytes to regulate the first stages of embryo development.

Abnormal proliferation and metastasis are regarded to play important roles in patients' death, whereas we know little about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Under this circumstance, our current study aims to investigate the role of hub genes in ovarian cancer. Bioinformatics analysis of the data from GEO and analyses of ovarian cancer samples were performed. Then, the results showed that KIF23, a hub gene, was mainly related to cell cycle and positively associated with poor prognosis. Meanwhile, both miR-424-5p and miR-503-5p directly targeted to 3'UTR of KIF23 to suppress the expression of KIF23 and inhibit ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, we discovered that miR-424/503 was epigenetically repressed by hypermethylation in the promoter regions, which directly modulated the expression of KIF23 to improve the oncogenic performance of cancer cells in vitro. Together, our research certifies that miR-424/503 cluster is silenced by DNA hypermethylation, which promotes the expression of KIF23, thereby regulating the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells. Interposing this process might be a novel approach in cancer therapy.",PML-RARα induces all-trans retinoic acid-dependent transcriptional activation through interaction with MED1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135261,Transcription,2019 06 05,"Transcriptional activation by PML-RARα, an acute promyelocytic leukemia-related oncofusion protein, requires pharmacological concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the mechanism by which the liganded PML-RARα complex leads to the formation of the preinitiation complex has been unidentified. Here we demonstrate that the Mediator subunit MED1 plays an important role in the ATRA-dependent activation of the PML-RARα-bound promoter. Luciferase reporter assays showed that PML-RARα induced significant transcription at pharmacological doses (1 μM) of ATRA; however, this was submaximal and equivalent to the level of transcription driven by intact RARα at physiological doses (1 nM) of ATRA. Transcription depended upon the interaction of PML-RARα with the two LxxLL nuclear receptor recognition motifs of MED1, and LxxLL→LxxAA mutations led to minimal transcription. Mechanistically, MED1 interacted ATRA-dependently with the RARα portion of PML-RARα through the two LxxLL motifs of MED1. These results suggest that PML-RARα initiates ATRA-induced transcription through its interaction with MED1.",A Systematic Review of Characteristics of Nonprobability Community Venue Samples of Sexual Minority Individuals and Associated Methods for Assessing Selection Bias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135260,LGBT health,2019 05 28,"The majority of research on sexual minority individuals relies on nonprobability community venue samples. These samples are prone to selection bias; however, empirical syntheses of evidence of these biases are not available. We conducted, therefore, a systematic review of published sexual minority health research to summarize methods used to identify characteristics and health outcomes found to differ in nonprobability samples. We searched five health and social science databases to identify observational studies that included a nonprobability sexual minority community sample and applied an empirical method to infer selection bias. We extracted data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, behaviors, and health outcomes and examined whether the nonprobability sample was found to differ disproportionately (over- or underrepresenting the characteristic) based on appropriate statistical tests (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). A total of 21 studies were included. Nineteen studies used a cross-sample comparison, one used time/location sampling weights, and one used frequency of venue attendance adjustment to assess differences. The evidence was mostly consistent, that is, associations were in the same direction in >50% of studies examined, for nine variables. Nonprobability community venue samples tended to overrepresent sexual minority individuals with the following characteristics: higher income, current employment, lesbian/gay-identified, greater number of sex partners, past-year sexually transmitted infection diagnosis, suicidal ideation, alcohol use, and substance use; nonprobability community venue samples tended to underrepresent married/partnered sexual minority individuals. This review provides a nuanced empirical picture of aggregate differences in sample characteristics presumed to threaten the validity of nonprobability sexual minority community venue studies, and highlights feasible methods that can be applied to future studies to add specificity to researchers' description of selection biases.",Student Veterans' Coping With Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms: A Glaserian Grounded Theory Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135258,Issues in mental health nursing,2019 05 28,"The present study investigated the ways in which student military veterans cope with their posttraumatic stress symptoms. The participants were a total of 21 military veterans attending a U.S. university. The results of the grounded theory data analysis reveal the core category of modulating intrusions, a process indicating how student veterans cope with recurrent and unwanted posttraumatic stress experiences. Our findings also demonstrate that veterans cope by either avoiding or allowing themselves to experience the pain associated from their traumatic experiences. The proposed framework can be meaningfully used to facilitate the development of adaptive coping among veterans with posttraumatic stress."

Methods: Patients with early RA were included in the COmbinatietherapie Bij Reumatoïde Artritis (COBRA)-light trial and followed for 52 weeks. As the COBRA-light strategy proved to be non-inferior to the COBRA strategy, all patients were pooled. Predictors for sick leave and improved worker productivity were assessed through a 3 month time-lag multivariable logistic generalized estimating equations model. Results: At baseline, 97 patients had a paid job, 59 had no job, and for six patients the work status was unknown. During the trial, 13 patients stopped working (8%) and six started working (4%). Only sick leave in the past 3 months predicted sick leave. By excluding this variable, patient global assessment and actual hours of sick leave became predictors. Increased worker productivity was predicted by higher patient global assessment levels, Sharp van der Heijde score ≥ 1, actual hours on sick leave, and higher worker productivity in the past 3 months. Conclusion: Sick leave and improved worker productivity were mainly predicted by non-disease-specific variables. Both outcomes can be predicted on a 3 month basis, using the outcome over the past 3 months for the next 3 months. By applying this model in daily practice, decisions for therapy change could be based not solely on disease activity but also taking into account a possible high risk for sick leave in the upcoming 3 months.",Implementation of a Clinical Pharmacist Service in the Hospice Setting: Financial and Clinical Impacts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135238,Journal of pain & palliative care pharmacotherapy,2019 05 28,"Hospice is a unique environment among all clinical fields of practice. Although every other specialty aims to work toward a curative goal or prevention of mortality, hospice completely redirects focus solely on pain and symptom management and sustaining the highest quality of life possible.

Burnout itself is increased when professionals perceive there is low congruence between themselves and their job. Aims: The aim of this study is to identify how person-job congruence is associated with compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction, and how these in turn relate to staff recovery attitudes. Method: A cross-sectional survey of 132 CMHT staff, utilising the Areas of Worklife Scale, Professional Quality of Life Scale and Recovery Knowledge Inventory. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed negative associations between ""Workload"" congruence and Secondary Traumatic Stress (p = 0.001). Low congruence in ""Workload"" (p = <0.001) ""Reward"" (p = 0.005) and ""Values"" (p = 0.005) were associated with increased Burnout. ""Workload"" congruence was positively associated with Compassion Satisfaction (p = 0.041). Compassion Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue were not significantly associated with recovery attitude. Conclusions: Interventions to address Compassion Fatigue are indicated to target: workloads, rewards, and aligning organisational and personal values.

Countries that have not yet introduced the HPV vaccine could benefit greatly, but before implementation it is necessary to perform country-specific economic assessments that include current screening practices. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer so as to calculate the long-term health benefits and costs of HPV vaccination and current screening by VIA. Starting from a previous transition probability matrix used for a model from Spain, the present model was calibrated to cervical cancer incidence from Morocco. Cost survey data was used to estimate the cost of screening and clinical procedures from the public healthcare perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as 2018US$per additional year of life saved (YLS) and both costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3%. Results: The expected reduction in lifetime risk of cervical cancer for current screening would be 14% at a cost of US$551/YLS compared with no intervention, assuming VIA every 3 years in women aged 30-49 at 10% coverage. HPV vaccination of preadolescent girls at 70% coverage would reduce lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 62% at a cost of US$1,150/YLS, compared with no intervention. When implementing HPV vaccination in combination with current screening, vaccination would be dominated, and the combined strategy would provide 69% reduction at a cost of US$2,843/YLS, compared with screening alone. Current screening would be dominated by vaccination when screening coverage is higher than 15%, whereas the combined strategy rapidly exceeds US$4,000/YLS. Conclusions: HPV vaccination could be highly effective and cost-effective in Morocco. Current screening would be good value for money compared with no intervention, but scaling-up screening coverage would make it inefficient compared with vaccination.","Volatile composition, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of artemisia tournefortiana Reichb. from Kashmir, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135230,Natural product research,2019 05 28,"The importance of the present study is to find out the phytochemical profile of essential oil (EO) of Artemisia tournefortiana Reichb. and its biological evaluation.

The epidemiologic trends associated with chronic ankle instability (CAI) suggest that current rehabilitation approaches may be inadequate. We sought to synthesize best-practices evidence for the rehabilitation of patients with acute ankle sprains and CAI through the integration of emerging paradigms in perception, the dynamics of skill acquisition, and the biopsychosocial model of function, disability, and health. From the best available evidence, 4 key factors emerged for effective treatment and rehabilitation strategies that focus on pain reduction, external ankle support for up to 1 year, progressive return to motion, and coordination training. We combined these factors into a meta-theoretical framework that centers on the perceptual interdependence of the cellular, local, and global functioning levels by linking insights from the body-self neuromatrix, the dynamics of skill acquisition, and the biopsychosocial model. Based on the best-practice recommendations from systematic reviews, ankle-sprain rehabilitation represents a multidimensional phenomenon governed by perception. The impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with CAI may be linked to perceptual-interdependence alterations. Pain and edema reduction, the use of external ankle support for up to 1 year, progressive return to motion, and coordination training foster enhanced perceptual interdependence from cells to society.

There is great interest in studying the survival of these bacteria in powdered foods, but discrepancies have been reported between broth-grown and lawn-grown bacterial cells and their thermal resistance and desiccation tolerance once inoculated onto powdered foods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three different powdered food inoculation methods, two broth-grown and one lawn-grown. To evaluate these methods on three types of powdered food matrices, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (ATCC 700720), Salmonella surrogate Enterococcus faecium (NRRL B-2354), and Cronobacter sakazakii (ATCC 29544) were inoculated onto nonfat dry milk powder, organic soy flour, and all-purpose flour using one of the three previously developed inoculation methods. In the first broth-grown method, labeled broth-grown pelletized inoculation, a bacterial cell pellet was added to powdered foods directly and mixed with a sterile wooden stick. The second broth-grown method, labeled broth-grown spray inoculation, used a chromatography reagent sprayer to spray the bacterial cell suspension onto the powdered foods. The third inoculation method, lawn-grown liquid inoculation, made use of a spot inoculation and a stomacher to incorporate each bacterium into the powdered foods. Results indicated that the method of inoculation of each powder impacted repeatability and bacteria survivability postequilibration (4 to 6 days). Broth-grown spray inoculation, regardless of the powder and bacterium, resulted in the highest log reduction, with an average ∼1-log CFU/g reduction following equilibration. Broth-grown pelletized inoculation resulted in the second-highest log reduction (∼0.79 log CFU/g), and finally, lawn-grown liquid inoculation was the most stable inoculation method of the three, with ∼0.52-log CFU/g reduction.

Human perception and performance,2019 05 28,"In past research on imitation, some findings suggest that imitation is goal based, whereas other findings suggest that imitation can also be based on a direct mapping of a model's movements without necessarily adopting the model's goal. We argue that the 2 forms of imitation are flexibly deployed in accordance with the psychological distance from the model. We specifically hypothesize that individuals are relatively more likely to imitate the model's goals when s/he is distant but relatively more likely to imitate the model's specific movements when s/he is proximal. This hypothesis was tested in 4 experiments using different imitation paradigms and different distance manipulations. Experiment 1 served as a pilot study and demonstrated that temporal distance (vs. proximity) increased imitation of a goal relative to the imitation of a movement. Experiments 2 and 3 measured goal-based and movement-based imitation independently of each other and found that spatial distance (vs. proximity) decreased the rate of goal errors (indicating more goal imitation) compared with movement errors. Experiment 4 demonstrated that psychological distance operates most likely at the input-that is, perceptual-level. The findings are discussed in relation to construal level theory and extant theories of imitation.

Human perception and performance,2019 05 28,"The sociomotor framework proposes that people can represent their actions in terms of the behavior these actions evoke in others, so that anticipating the behavior of others triggers own actions. In social interactions, such as imitation, it thus highlights the acting model rather than the responding person. In line with this idea, motor actions are facilitated if they are foreseeably imitated rather than counterimitated by a social partner. In the present study, we investigate how exactly another's behavior is represented in such sociomotor actions. The effect of being imitated can be explained by two distinct forms of compatibility between model and imitator actions: correspondence of anatomical features (imitative compatibility) and correspondence of spatial features (spatial compatibility). Both types of features often go hand in hand, though research on motor priming shows that spatial and anatomical features of other's actions are represented independently. We therefore investigated to which degree the benefit of anticipated imitation is caused by spatial or imitative compatibility. Across 5 experiments, we found that only spatial compatibility of the imitator's behavior influenced the model's actions, while imitative compatibility had no influence. Actors thus seem to represent actions of their social partners mainly in terms of nonsocial, spatial features.

Sampling weights applied to the sample data facilitate extrapolation to the population of origin, but normative scores are often developed without the use of these sampling weights because the values derived from large samples are presumed to be precise estimates of the population parameter. The present article examines whether applying sample weights in the context of deriving normative comparison standards for measures of cognition would affect the distributions of regression-based normative data when using data from a large population-based study. To address these questions, we examined 3 cognitive measures from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging tracking cohort (N = 14,110, Age 45-84 years at recruitment): Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test - Immediate Recall, Animal Fluency, and the Mental Alternation Test. The use of sampling weights resulted in similar model parameter estimates to unweighted regression analyses and similar cumulative frequency distributions to the unweighted analyses. We randomly sampled progressively smaller subsets from the full database to test the hypothesis that sampling weights would help maintain the estimates from the full sample, but discovered that the weighted and unweighted estimates were similar and were less precise with smaller samples. These findings suggest that although use of sampling weights can help mitigate biases in data from sampling procedures, the application of weights to adjust for sampling biases do not appreciably impact the normative data, which lends support to the current practice in creation of normative data.

Using a multistate vibronic coupling Hamiltonian parametrized by TDDFT calculations for 13 electronic states of Frenkel and CTX type, along with 78 vibrational modes, quantum dynamical simulations are carried out using the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. In line with time-resolved spectroscopic results [ De Sio , A. ; et al. Nat.

These coherent features, whose presence may seem surprising in a high-dimensional aggregate or thin film material, can be traced back to a dominant vibronic signature of CC stretch-type high-frequency modes. These vibrational signatures are found to be enhanced due to a collective vibronic response that is prompted by the initial generation of a delocalized bright exciton and its subsequent relaxation, by internal conversion, to a polaronic local exciton ground state.",Total Synthesis of (-)-Preussochromone D.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135164,Organic letters,2019 06 12,"An efficient, stereoselective synthesis of the natural product (-)-preussochromone D is reported.

Among many layered titanates, lepidocrocite-type layered titanates have significant advantages such as superior intercalation and exfoliation properties, while the synthesis of the 1D-shape forms is still challenging. Here, we report on a facile one-pot hydrothermal conversion of a lepidocrocite-type layered titanate into the corresponding nanowire-shape form. The reaction mechanism involves the decomposition of the starting layered titanate into 1D small segments which assemble into the nanowire. This new nanowire shows properties resulting from the combination of 1D and 2D nanostructural features, excellent cation exchange ability, and high photoinduced charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency. As a demonstration, we evaluate the nanowire as a sequestrating material capable of collecting toxic cations, like Cd2+, from water and photoreducing them (immobilizing them tightly). We find that the nanowire shows an efficient and ultrafast photoimmobilization activity, whereas the starting layered titanate and a benchmark TiO2 photocatalyst (P25) show no activity under the identical conditions. The photoimmobilization rate (within 1 min) is considerably faster than the cation exchange rates reported for state-of-the-art cation exchangers (with no photoimmobilization ability). The nanowire used for photoimmobilization reactions is easily recovered from water by decantation, showing the possible practical use for safe disposal of toxic cations in the environment.",Structural Insights into the Inhibition of Amyloid Fibril Formation by Fibrinogen via Interaction with Prefibrillar Intermediates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135143,Biochemistry,2019 06 11,"Abnormal protein aggregation tends to result in the formation of β-sheet rich amyloid fibrils, which are related to various kinds of amyloidoses and neurodegenerative diseases. The susceptibility to aggregation of protein molecules is dealt with by proteostasis in living systems, in which molecular chaperones play an important role. Recently, several secreted proteins have been examined as extracellular chaperones with a potency to suppress the formation of amyloid fibrils, although the whole picture that includes their inhibition mechanisms is not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of fibrinogen (Fg), one of the extracellular proteins identified as a potential member of the group of chaperones, on fibril formation. Insulin B chain was used as an amyloid formation model system because its prefibrillar intermediate species in the nucleation phase were well characterized. We revealed that Fg efficiently inhibited amyloid fibril formation via a direct interaction with the surface of the prefibrillar intermediates. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and a stoichiometry analysis suggested a structural model in which the surface of the rod-shaped prefibrillar intermediates is surrounded by Fg molecules. From such a specific manner of interactions, we propose that the role of Fg is to disturb fibril growth by confining the nuclei even when the nucleation occurs inside the prefibrillar intermediate. The structural property of the B-chain intermediates complexed with Fg would provide insights into the general principles of the functions of chaperones and other potential chaperone-like proteins involved in amyloid-related diseases.","Synthesis and Magnetism of Extended Solids Containing Transition-Metal Cations in Square-Planar, MO4 Coordination Sites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135142,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 12,"With the exception of systems containing Cu2+, complex metal oxides containing paramagnetic transition-metal cations in square-planar coordination are rare.

In the sensing cell, anti-MUC1 antibody immobilized on a chitosan-multiwalled carbon nanotube (CS-MWCNT)-modified anodic BPE channel was used for capturing mucin-1 (MUC1) or MCF-7 cancer cells. Then ferrocene (Fc)-labeled mucin 1 aptamers were introduced through hybridization. Under an applied voltage, the ferrocene was oxidized and the electroactive molecules of 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) in the cathodic reporting cell were reduced according to electroneutrality. This produced a strongly basic 1,4-benzoquinone anion radical (BQ•-), which turned on the fluorescence of pH-responsive fluorescent molecules of (2-(2-(4-hydroxystyryl)-6-methyl-4 H-pyran-4-ylidene)malononitrile) (SPM) coexisting in the cathode reporting cell for both spectrophotometric detection and imaging. This strategy allowed sensitive detection of MUC1 at a concentration down to 10 fM and was capable of detecting a minimum of three MCF-7 cells.

The combination of mass difference and mass defect produces two labeled peak clusters separated by 5 Da in MS1 spectra that are detected as five isotopic peaks at high resolution with mass differences of 15, 17, and 18 mDa per tag. Synthesis of each of the 5-plex mdDiLeu tags is accomplished by a single straightforward reaction step, making it accessible to any lab. To demonstrate 5-plex mdDiLeu for quantitative proteomics, we perform proof-of-principle experiments of mdDiLeu-labeled Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate digest on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer."

It has been discovered that the sliding of A-site cations in the perovskite compound through and out of the three-dimensional [PbI6]4- crystal frame is one of the main reasons that are responsible for decomposition of the perovskite compound. Herein, we report an effective method to enhance the stability of the FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05PbI2.5Br0.5 perovskite film through the incorporation of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI). Both density functional theory calculation and the X-ray diffraction patterns have confirmed the formation of two-dimensional (PA)2PbI4 with the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite as a result of the reaction between PAI and PbI2 in the perovskite film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals less -COOH (carboxyl) groups on the surface of the perovskite film containing (PA)2PbI4, which indicates the suppressed penetration of oxygen and moisture into the perovskite material. This is further confirmed by the surface water wettability test of the (PA)2PbI4 film that exhibits excellent hydrophobic property with over 110° contact angle. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the introduction of PAI additives that resulted in the upshift of the conduction band minimum of the perovskite by 160 meV, leading to a more favorable energy alignment with an adjacent electron transporting material. As a consequence, enhanced 17.23% PCE with suppressed hysteresis was obtained with the 5% PAI additive (molar ratio) in perovskite solar cells that retained nearly 50% of the initial efficiency after 2000 h in air without encapsulation under 45% average relative humidity.",ADAMTS1 Promotes Adhesion to Extracellular Matrix Proteins and Predicts Prognosis in Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135123,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",2019 05 30,"Despite, several studies demonstrating pro-metastatic effects of the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 in breast cancer, its role in facilitating the metastatic cascade remains unclear.

Methods Rats were randomly divided into four groups: blank, root alcohol, stem alcohol and leaf alcohol, with 8 in each group. After 14 days of continuous intragastric administration, the body mass change curves were drawn. The cardiac coefficient was calculated. The contents of creatine kinase （CK）, creatine kinase isoenzyme （CK-MB）, lactate dehydrogenase （LDH） and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase （α-HBDH） as well as the content changes of oxidative stress indexes - total superoxide dismutase （T-SOD） and malondialdehyde （MDA） in the serum of rats were detected. The cardiac pathomorphology changes in the rats were observed. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule （ICAM-1） and heme oxygenase （HO-1） in myocardial tissue was detected. Results Body mass growth rate： stem alcohol group was the smallest, followed by leaf alcohol group. The difference of cardiac coefficient of every group had no statistical significance （P>0.05）. The myocardial tissues of stem alcohol group suffered the most serious damage, followed by the leaf alcohol group. The contents of CK, CK-MB, LDH and α-HBDH in stem alcohol group increased （P<0.05）. The increase of MDA content and decrease of T-SOD content in stem alcohol group had statistical significance compared with the blank group and root alcohol group, while the leaf alcohol group only had statistical significance in the decrease of T-SOD content compared with the blank group （P<0.05）. The positive expression of ICAM-1 enhanced and the expression of HO-1 protein decreased in every group after the intervention of different extracts. The change trend was stem alcohol > leaf alcohol > root alcohol group. Conclusion The alcohol extract from the stem has the highest cardiotoxicity, followed by the leaf extract, and its mechanism of toxicity may be related to oxidative stress.",Mass Spectral Character of Fentanyl Analogues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135118,Fa yi xue za zhi,2019 05 28,"Objective To provide the reference for the identification of unknown fentanyl analogues by studying the characteristic ions and main fragmentation pathways of fentanyl analogues in the modes of collision induced dissociation （CID） and electron ionization （EI）.

The mass spectrum obtained was analyzed. The CID and EI fragmentation routes of fentanyl analogues were speculated. Results The CID and EI fragmentation pathways were highly similar. In the CID mode, characteristic ions were formed by the carbon-nitrogen bond cleavage between the piperidine ring and the N-phenyl-amide moiety, within the piperidine ring, and between the phenethyl and piperidine ring. While in the EI mode, dissociation of the piperidine ring, as well as cleavage between the piperidine ring and the phenethyl were the main fragmentation pathways.

Methods Three DNA extraction kits were selected to extract DNA from peripheral blood of 10 unrelated individuals. The DNA yield and purity of the three DNA extraction kits were compared. According to the results of comparison, one DNA sample was selected to concentrate and dilute, then used as the initial sample of whole genome amplification （WGA）. REPLI-g® Single Cell Kit was used to amplify the initial sample at the whole genome level. The amplification yield and amplification times were calculated, and the distribution of DNA fragments was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Goldeneye® DNA ID System 20A Kit was used to perform the STR typing of the initial sample and DNA samples amplified at the whole genome level to evaluate the performance of REPLI-g® Single Cell Kit in trace DNA amplication in terms of purity and yield as well as the success rate of STR typing. Results After comparison, one DNA sample was selected from QIAsymphony® DNA Investigator® Kit extracts to concentrate and dilute as the initial sample of WGA. After amplifying the whole genome of a series of initial samples by REPLI-g® Single Cell Kit, the lowest average of amplification yield reached 8.77×103 ng, while the average of the corresponding amplification times reached 1.40×106. DNA fragments were large and concentrated. The STR typing success rate of WGA samples became lower with the decrease of initial samples used, but when the amount of samples was lower than 0.5 ng, the STR typing success rate of samples after DNA WGA was higher than that of samples without DNA WGA. Conclusion REPLI-g® Single Cell Kit can increase the yield of template DNA. Especially for trace DNA, the STR typing success rate can be improved to a certain extent.",Full Sibling Testing Based on NGS-SNP Genotyping Method and IBS Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135116,Fa yi xue za zhi,2019 05 28,"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of single nucleotide polymorphism （SNP） genoty-ping in combination with identity by state （IBS） strategy in full sibling testing.

Results Based on family members and previous research, 44, 30, 111, 71 and 1 000 pairs of full siblings （FS）, grandparent-grandchild （GG）, uncle/aunt-nephew/niece （UN）, first cousins （FC） and unrelated individuals （UI） were obtained, respectively. The average IBS scores were 148, 130, 132, 124 and 120, respectively. Except for the GG and UN pairs, the distribution differences among the other relationships had statistical significance （P<0.05）. The false rates of Fisher discriminant function to determine relationships were 1.3%, 22.3%, 17.0% and 38.7% for FS, GG, UN and FC, respectively. Based on the simulation data, the thresholds t1=128 and t2=141 were recommended to determine full sibling relationships （the false rate ≤0.05%）. Conclusion The 90 SNP genetic markers included in the Precision ID Identity Panel meet the testing requirements for full sibling relationships.

Translational quality control is maintained by both proteins and RNA through intricate processes. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases help maintain high levels of translational accuracy through the esterification of tRNA and proofreading mechanisms. tRNA is often recognized by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase in a sequence and structurally dependent manner, sometimes involving modified nucleotides. Additionally, some proofreading mechanisms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases require tRNA elements for hydrolysis of a noncognate aminoacyl-tRNA. Finally, tRNA is also important for proper decoding of the mRNA message by codon and anticodon pairing.

Yet, atypical JAK2- and MPL-mutations were described in some triple-negative patients. Whether noncanonical and/or concomitant JAK2- and MPL-mutations exist in myelofibrosis (MF) regardless of phenotype-driver mutations is not yet elucidated. For this, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using blood genomic DNA from 128 MF patients (primary MF, n = 93; post-ET-MF, n = 18; post-PV-MF, n = 17). While no atypical JAK2- or MPL-mutations were seen in 24 CALR-positive samples, two JAK2-mutations [c.3323A > G, p.N1108S; c.3188G > A, p.R1063H] were detected in two of the 21 (9.5%) triple-negative patients.

Some have argued that protected areas might be useful in ensuring provision of ecosystem services as well. However, research is only beginning to explore the effect of protection on ecosystem services, and whether protection is important to the provision of ecosystem services is known only for a few services in a few types of landscapes. We seek to fill this gap by investigating the effect of watershed protection status and land use/land cover on the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity. We compared the ecosystem services provided in and around streams located in four watershed types: IUCN category II protected forests, unprotected forests, unprotected forests with recent timber harvesting, and unprotected areas with agriculture. We visited 28 streams distributed across these watershed types, in Quebec, Canada, and used field surveys to quantify clean water provision, carbon storage, recreation, wild foods, habitat quality, and terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. Our results show that the quantity and quality of ecosystem services and biodiversity was generally higher in sites with intact forest - whether protected or not - relative to those embedded in production landscapes with forestry or agriculture. Clean water provision, carbon storage, habitat quality, and tree diversity were significantly higher in and around streams surrounded by forest. Recreation, wild foods, and aquatic biodiversity did not vary between watershed types. While some services can be provided by both protected and unprotected areas, protection status may help secure the continued supply of services that are sensitive to changes in land use/land cover. These findings provide needed information about the ecosystem service and biodiversity trade-offs and synergies that result from developing a watershed, or from protecting it.

It was found that phenolic compounds exhibit potential inhibitor properties for these enzymes. For α-amylase, studied phenolic compounds showed IC50 values in the range of 601.56-2067.78 nM. For α-glycosidase, Ki values were found in the range of 169.25±27.22-572.88±106.76 nM. For AR, Ki values in the range of 8.48±0.56-43.26±7.63 μM. However, genistein showed the best inhibition effect towards AR and α-glycosidase, but delphinidin chloride exhibited the best inhibition effect against α-amylase enzyme. We determined that all compounds showed non-competitive inhibition effect against AR and α-glycosidase. Also, studied phenolic compounds may be useful in the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications. This article is protected by copyright.

Research into mTBI and CTE pathophysiology are difficult to undertake in athletes, with observational trials and post-mortem analysis the current mainstays. Thus, animal models play an important role in the study of mTBI, however, traditional animal models have focused on acute, severe injuries rather than the more typical mTBI's seen in sport injuries. Recently, a number of animal models have been developed that are both appropriately scaled and biomechanically relevant to the forces sustained by athletes. This review aimed to examine the literature for variables included in these animal models, and the resulting neurotrauma as evidenced by pathology and behavioral deficits. A systematic search of the literature was performed in multiple electronic databases. The inclusion criteria required mimicry of athlete mTBI conditions: freedom of head movement, lack of surgical alteration of the skull, and application of direct contact force. Studies were analyzed for variables including apparatus design features (impact force, change in animal head velocity, and kinetic energy transfer to the head), demonstrated pathology (phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 aggregation, diffuse axonal injury, gliosis, cytokine inflammation response, and genetic integrity), and behavioral changes. These studies suggested that appropriate animal models can assist in understanding the pathological and functional outcomes of athlete mTBI, and could be used as a platform for future studies of diagnostic/prognostic markers and in the development of treatment interventions.",Identification of functional lncRNAs in gastric cancer by integrative analysis of GEO and TCGA data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135068,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 05 28,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant cancer of digestive system, identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for GC is urgently demanded. The aim of this study was to determine potential long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of GC. Raw noncoding RNA microarray data (GSE53137, GSE70880, and GSE99417) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes between GC and adjacent normal gastric tissue samples were screened by an integrated analysis of multiple gene expression profile after gene reannotation and batch normalization. Differentially expressed genes were further confirmed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, Gene Ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, survival analysis were extensively applied to identify hub lncRNAs and discover potential biomarkers related to diagnosis and prognosis of GC. In total of 246 integrated differential genes including 15 lncRNAs and 241 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were obtained after intersections of differential genes between GEO and TCGA database. ceRNA network comprised of three lncRNAs (UCA1, HOTTIP, and HMGA1P4), 26 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 72 mRNAs. Functional analysis revealed that three lncRNAs were mainly dominated in cell cycle and cellular senescence. Survival analysis showed that HMGA1P4 was statistically related to the overall survival rate. For the first time, we identified that HMGA1P4, a target of miR-301b/miR-508, is involved in cell cycle and senescence process by regulating CCNA2 in GC. Finally, the expression levels of three lncRNAs were validated to be upregulated in GC tissues. Thus, three lncRNAs including UCA1, HOTTIP, and HMGA1P4 may contribute to GC development and their potential functions might be associated with the prognosis of GC."

Although many genetic factors are involved in the regulation of leaf senescence in cereals, the key regulators remain to be determined. Plant transcription factors with a conserved DOF (DNA-binding one zinc finger) domain play roles in multiple physiological processes. Here, we show a novel function for OsDOF24 as a repressor of leaf senescence in rice (Oryza sativa). In wild-type leaves, OsDOF24 expression rapidly decreased during natural senescence (NS) and dark-induced senescence (DIS). The gain-of-function mutant osdof24-D, which contains an enhancer-trap T-DNA in the OsDOF24 promoter, exhibited delayed leaf yellowing during NS and DIS. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsDOF24 showed the same phenotype during DIS. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that senescence-associated genes (Osl85, Osl57, and OsNAP) and chlorophyll degradation genes (NYC1, NYC3, and SGR) were downregulated in the osdof24-D mutant during dark incubation. Among the phytohormones, only methyl jasmonate induced OsDOF24 expression. Furthermore, the reduced expression of jasmonate biosynthesis-related genes (OsLOX2, OsLOX8, OsHI-LOX, OsAOS1, and OsAOS2) in osdof24-D decreased endogenous jasmonate levels, resulting in delayed leaf senescence under DIS conditions. Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that OsDOF24 binds to the promoter region of OsAOS1. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsDOF24 suppresses the induction of leaf senescence during vegetative growth by deactivating jasmonate biosynthetic pathways.",Impaired plasmalogen synthesis dysregulates liver X receptor-dependent transcription in cerebellum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135054,Journal of biochemistry,2019 05 28,"Synthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) is regulated by modulating the stability of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (Far1) on peroxisomal membrane, a rate-limiting enzyme in plasmalogen synthesis. Dysregulation of plasmalogen homeostasis impairs cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured cells by altering the stability of squalene epoxidase. However, regulation of PlsEtn synthesis and physiological consequences of plasmalogen homeostasis in tissues remain unknown. In the present study, we found that the protein but not the transcription level of Far1 in the cerebellum of the Pex14 mutant mouse expressing Pex14p lacking its C-terminal region (Pex14ΔC/ΔC) is higher than that from wild-type mouse, suggesting that Far1 is stabilized by the lowered level of PlsEtn. The protein level of squalene epoxidase was increased, whereas the transcriptional activity of the liver X receptors (LXRs), ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is lowered in the cerebellum of Pex14ΔC/ΔC and the mice deficient in dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, the initial enzyme for the synthesis of PlsEtn. These results suggest that the reduction of plasmalogens in the cerebellum more likely compromises the cholesterol homeostasis, thereby reducing the transcriptional activities of LXRs, master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis.",Effect of deactivation of activity patterns related to smoking cue reactivity on nicotine addiction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135053,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"With approximately 75% of smokers resuming cigarette smoking after using the Gold Standard Programme for smoking cessation, investigation into novel therapeutic approaches is warranted. Typically, smoking cue reactivity is crucial for smoking behaviour. Here we developed a novel closed-loop, smoking cue reactivity patterns EEG-based neurofeedback protocol and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy on nicotine addiction. During an evoked smoking cue reactivity task participants' brain activity patterns corresponding to smoking cues were obtained with multivariate pattern analysis of all EEG channels data, then during neurofeedback the EEG activity patterns of smoking cue reactivity were continuously deactivated with adaptive closed-loop training. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 60 nicotine-dependent participants were assigned to receive two neurofeedback training sessions (∼1 h/session) either from their own brain (n = 30, real-feedback group) or from the brain activity pattern of a matched participant (n = 30, yoked-feedback group). Cigarette craving and craving-related P300 were assessed at pre-neurofeedback and post-neurofeedback. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months following the final neurofeedback visit. In the real-feedback group, participants successfully deactivated EEG activity patterns of smoking cue reactivity. The real-feedback group showed significant decrease in cigarette craving and craving-related P300 amplitudes compared with the yoked-feedback group. The rates of cigarettes smoked per day at 1 week, 1 month and 4 months follow-up decreased 30.6%, 38.2%, and 27.4% relative to baseline in the real-feedback group, compared to decreases of 14.0%, 13.7%, and 5.9% in the yoked-feedback group. The neurofeedback effects on craving change and smoking amount at the 4-month follow-up were further predicted by neural markers at pre-neurofeedback. This novel neurofeedback training approach produced significant short-term and long-term effects on cigarette craving and smoking behaviour, suggesting the neurofeedback protocol described herein is a promising brain-based tool for treating addiction.",FAHN/SPG35: a narrow phenotypic spectrum across disease classifications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135052,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 12,"The endoplasmic reticulum enzyme fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) plays a major role in the formation of 2-hydroxy glycosphingolipids, main components of myelin. FA2H deficiency in mice leads to severe central demyelination and axon loss. In humans it has been associated with phenotypes from the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration, FAHN), hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP type SPG35) and leukodystrophy (leukodystrophy with spasticity and dystonia) spectrum. We performed an in-depth clinical and retrospective neurophysiological and imaging study in a cohort of 19 cases with biallelic FA2H mutations. FAHN/SPG35 manifests with early childhood onset predominantly lower limb spastic tetraparesis and truncal instability, dysarthria, dysphagia, cerebellar ataxia, and cognitive deficits, often accompanied by exotropia and movement disorders. The disease is rapidly progressive with loss of ambulation after a median of 7 years after disease onset and demonstrates little interindividual variability. The hair of FAHN/SPG35 patients shows a bristle-like appearance; scanning electron microscopy of patient hair shafts reveals deformities (longitudinal grooves) as well as plaque-like adhesions to the hair, likely caused by an abnormal sebum composition also described in a mouse model of FA2H deficiency. Characteristic imaging features of FAHN/SPG35 can be summarized by the 'WHAT' acronym: white matter changes, hypointensity of the globus pallidus, ponto-cerebellar atrophy, and thin corpus callosum. At least three of four imaging features are present in 85% of FA2H mutation carriers. Here, we report the first systematic, large cohort study in FAHN/SPG35 and determine the phenotypic spectrum, define the disease course and identify clinical and imaging biomarkers.",Reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in patients with schizophrenia during remission of positive symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135051,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"While there is consistent evidence for increased presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum of patients with schizophrenia during psychosis, it is unclear whether this also holds for patients during psychotic remission. This study investigates whether striatal dopamine synthesis capacity is altered in patients with schizophrenia during symptomatic remission of positive symptoms, and whether potential alterations relate to symptoms other than positive, such as cognitive difficulties. Twenty-three patients with schizophrenia in symptomatic remission of positive symptoms according to Andreasen, and 24 healthy controls underwent 18F-DOPA-PET and behavioural-cognitive assessment. Imaging data were analysed with voxel-wise Patlak modelling with cerebellum as reference region, resulting in the influx constant kicer reflecting dopamine synthesis capacity. For the whole striatum and its subdivisions (i.e. limbic, associative, and sensorimotor), averaged regional kicer values were calculated, compared across groups, and correlated with behavioural-cognitive scores, including a mediation analysis. Patients had negative symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-negative 14.13 ± 5.91) and cognitive difficulties, i.e. they performed worse than controls in Trail-Making-Test-B (TMT-B; P = 0.01). Furthermore, kicer was reduced in patients for whole striatum (P = 0.004) and associative (P = 0.002) and sensorimotor subdivisions (P = 0.007). In patients, whole striatum kicer was negatively correlated with TMT-B (rho = -0.42, P = 0.04; i.e. the lower striatal kicer, the worse the cognitive performance). Mediation analysis showed that striatal kicer mediated the group difference in TMT-B. Results demonstrate that patients with schizophrenia in symptomatic remission of positive symptoms have decreased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, which mediates the disorder's impact on cognitive difficulties. Data suggest that striatal dopamine dysfunction contributes to cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia.",Haunted by the past: old emotions remain salient in insomnia disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135050,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 12,"Studies suggest that sleep supports persistent changes in the neuronal representation of emotional experiences such that they are remembered better and less distressful when recalled than when they were first experienced. It is conceivable that sleep fragmentation by arousals, a key characteristic of insomnia disorder, could hamper the downregulation of distress. In this study, we sought further support for the idea that insomnia disorder may involve a lasting deficiency to downregulate emotional distress. We used functional MRI in insomnia disorder (n = 27) and normal sleepers (n = 30) to identify how brain activation differs between novel and relived self-conscious emotions. We evaluated whether brain activity elicited by reliving emotional memories from the distant past resembles the activity elicited by novel emotional experiences more in insomnia disorder than in normal sleepers. Limbic areas were activated during novel shameful experiences as compared to neutral experiences in both normal sleepers and insomnia disorder. In normal sleepers, reliving of shameful experiences from the past did not elicit a limbic response. In contrast, participants with insomnia disorder recruited overlapping parts of the limbic circuit, in particular the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, during both new and relived shameful experiences. The differential activity patterns with new and old emotions in normal sleepers suggest that reactivation of the long-term memory trace does not recruit the limbic circuit. The overlap of activations in insomnia disorder is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder involves a deficiency to dissociate the limbic circuit from the emotional memory trace. Moreover, the findings provide further support for a role of the anterior cingulate cortex in insomnia.",Cell-specific overexpression of COMT in dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135049,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"The mechanism by which dopaminergic neurons are selectively affected in Parkinson's disease is not fully understood. In this study, we found a dramatic increase in the expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), along with a lower level of DNA methylation, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons from patients with parkin (PARK2) gene mutations compared to those from healthy controls. In addition, a significant increase in the expression of COMT was found in dopaminergic neurons of isogenic PARK2 induced pluripotent stem cell lines that mimicked loss of function of PARK2 by CRISPR Cas9 technology. In dopamine transporter (DAT)-Cre mice, overexpression of COMT, specifically in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, produced cataleptic behaviours associated with impaired motor coordination. These findings suggest that upregulation of COMT, likely resulting from DNA hypomethylation, in dopaminergic neurons may contribute to the initial stage of neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.",Longitudinal progression of grey matter atrophy in non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135048,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"Recent models of Alzheimer's disease progression propose that disease may be transmitted between brain areas either via local diffusion or long-distance transport via white matter fibre pathways. However, it is unclear whether such models are applicable in non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with domain-specific cognitive deficits and relatively spared episodic memory. To date, the anatomical progression of disease in non-amnestic patients remains understudied. We used longitudinal imaging to differentiate earlier atrophy and later disease spread in three non-amnestic variants, including logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (n = 25), posterior cortical atrophy (n = 20), and frontal-variant Alzheimer's disease (n = 12), as well as 17 amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients. Patients were compared to 37 matched controls. All patients had autopsy (n = 7) or CSF (n = 67) evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology. We first assessed atrophy in suspected sites of disease origin, adjusting for age, sex, and severity of cognitive impairment; we then performed exploratory whole-brain analysis to investigate longitudinal disease spread both within and outside these regions. Additionally, we asked whether each phenotype exhibited more rapid change in its associated disease foci than other phenotypes. Finally, we investigated whether atrophy was related to structural brain connectivity. Each non-amnestic phenotype displayed unique patterns of initial atrophy and subsequent neocortical change that correlated with cognitive decline. Longitudinal atrophy included areas both proximal to and distant from sites of initial atrophy, suggesting heterogeneous mechanisms of disease spread. Moreover, regional rates of neocortical change differed by phenotype. Logopenic-variant patients exhibited greater initial atrophy and more rapid longitudinal change in left lateral temporal areas than other groups. Frontal-variant patients had pronounced atrophy in left insula and middle frontal gyrus, combined with more rapid atrophy of left insula than other non-amnestic patients. In the medial temporal lobes, non-amnestic patients had less atrophy at their initial scan than amnestic patients, but longitudinal rate of change did not differ between patient groups. Medial temporal sparing in non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease may thus be due in part to later onset of medial temporal degeneration than in amnestic patients rather than different rates of atrophy over time. Finally, the magnitude of longitudinal atrophy was predicted by structural connectivity, measured in terms of node degree; this result provides indirect support for the role of long-distance fibre pathways in the spread of neurodegenerative disease. 10.1093/brain/awz091_video1 awz091media1 6041544065001.",Loss of STEP61 couples disinhibition to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor potentiation in rodent and human spinal pain processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135041,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 12,"Dysregulated excitability within the spinal dorsal horn is a critical mediator of chronic pain. In the rodent nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, BDNF-mediated loss of inhibition (disinhibition) gates the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) responses at lamina I dorsal horn synapses. However, the centrality of this mechanism across pain states and species, as well as the molecular linker involved, remain unknown. Here, we show that KCC2-dependent disinhibition is coupled to increased GluN2B-mediated synaptic NMDAR responses in a rodent model of inflammatory pain, with an associated downregulation of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP61. The decreased activity of STEP61 is both necessary and sufficient to prime subsequent phosphorylation and potentiation of GluN2B NMDAR by BDNF at lamina I synapses. Blocking disinhibition reversed the downregulation of STEP61 as well as inflammation-mediated behavioural hypersensitivity. For the first time, we characterize GluN2B-mediated NMDAR responses at human lamina I synapses and show that a human ex vivo BDNF model of pathological pain processing downregulates KCC2 and STEP61 and upregulates phosphorylated GluN2B at dorsal horn synapses. Our results demonstrate that STEP61 is the molecular brake that is lost following KCC2-dependent disinhibition and that the decrease in STEP61 activity drives the potentiation of excitatory GluN2B NMDAR responses in rodent and human models of pathological pain. The ex vivo human BDNF model may thus form a translational bridge between rodents and humans for identification and validation of novel molecular pain targets."

However, these extended symmetries require the death rate parameter to sometimes take a negative value.

Despite the power of using genome-wide genetic markers in systematics and related fields, approaches such as the multispecies coalescent remain unable to easily account for unsampled lineages. The Empidonax difficilis/Empidonax occidentalis complex of small tyrannid flycatchers (Aves: Tyrannidae) is a classic example of widely distributed species with limited phenotypic geographic variation that was broken into two largely cryptic (or ""sibling"") lineages following extensive study. Though the group is well-characterized north of the US Mexico border, the evolutionary distinctiveness and phylogenetic relationships of southern populations remain obscure. In this article, we use dense genomic and geographic sampling across the majority of the range of the E. difficilis/E. occidentalis complex to assess whether current taxonomy and species limits reflect underlying evolutionary patterns, or whether they are an artifact of historically biased or incomplete sampling. We find that additional samples from Mexico render the widely recognized species-level lineage E. occidentalis paraphyletic, though it retains support in the best-fit species delimitation model from clustering analyses. We further identify a highly divergent unrecognized lineage in a previously unsampled portion of the group's range, which a cline analysis suggests is more reproductively isolated than the currently recognized species E.difficilis and E. occidentalis. Our phylogeny supports a southern origin of these taxa. Our results highlight the pervasive impacts of biased geographic sampling, even in well-studied vertebrate groups like birds, and illustrate what is a common problem when attempting to define species in the face of recent divergence and reticulate evolution.[Phylogenomics; RADseq; Tyrannidae; ultraconserved elements.].",Generation of Yellow Flowers of the Japanese Morning Glory by Engineering its Flavonoid Biosynthetic Pathway toward Aurones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135027,Plant & cell physiology,2019 05 28,"Wild-type plants of the Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil) produce blue flowers that accumulate anthocyanin pigments, whereas its mutant cultivars show wide range flower color such as red, magenta, and white. However, I. nil lacks yellow color varieties even though yellow flowers were curiously described in words and woodblocks printed in the nineteenth century. Such yellow flowers have been regarded as ""phantom morning glories,"" and their production has not been achieved despite efforts by breeders of I. nil. The chalcone isomerase (CHI) mutants (including line 54Y) bloom very pale yellow or cream-colored flowers conferred by the accumulation of 2´, 4´, 6´, 4-tetrahydoroxychalcone (THC) 2´-O-glucoside. To produce yellow phantom morning glories, we introduced two snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) genes to the 54Y line by encoding aureusidin synthase (AmAS1) and chalcone 4´-O-glucosyltransferase (Am4´CGT), which are necessary for the accumulation of aureusidin 6-O-glucoside and yellow coloration in A. majus. The transgenic plants expressing both genes exhibit yellow flowers, a character sought for many years. The flower petals of the transgenic plants contained aureusidin 6-O-glucoside, as well as a reduced amount of THC 2´-O-glucoside. In addition, we identified a novel aurone compound, aureusidin 6-O-(6″-O-malonyl)-glucoside, in the yellow petals.

In this work, the phonon-limited charge transport properties of α-graphyne (α-GY), α-graphdiyne (α-GDY), and β-graphyne (β-GY) were investigated using the Boltzmann transport equation within the first-principles framework while considering the electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Despite all three investigated compounds being 2D Dirac carbon materials, each demonstrated distinctly different carrier mobilities by one order of magnitude (2.2 × 104 cm2 V-1 s-1 for α-GY, 2.1 × 103 cm2 V-1 s-1 for α-GDY and 1.9 × 103 cm2 V-1 s-1 for β-GY at room-temperature and a carrier connection of n ∼ 3 × 1012 cm-2). The essential differences in the mobilities of these materials originated from the acetylenic linkage limiting the group velocity and the E2g phonon modes limiting the scattering time. For example, a few uniformly equivalent acetylenic linkages and E2g phonon modes tend to generate high mobilities. A simple mobility relationship was determined using the number of E2g photon modes, allowing for a quick estimation of the mobilities for Dirac materials. α-GY was identified as a promising alternative to graphene for next generation nanoelectronic devices.",Ene reactions of 2-borylated α-methylstyrenes: a practical route to 4-methylenechromanes and derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135020,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 12,"4-Methylenechromanes were prepared via a three-step process from 2-borylated α-methylstyrenes.

These features make CNTs highly suitable materials for the fabrication of flexible electronics. CNTs can also be made into dispersions which can be used as the feedstock material for droplet-based 3D printing technologies, e.g., inkjet printing and aerosol jet printing to fabricate printed electronics. These printing techniques involve several physical processes including deposition of ink droplets on flexible polymeric substrates such as polyimides, evaporation of the solvent and formation of thin films of CNTs, all of which have not been thoroughly investigated. Besides, alignment of the CNTs in the resultant thin films dictates their electrical performance. In this work, we examine the effect of substrate temperature and CNT concentration on the evaporation dynamics and also the alignment in the deposition patterns. Evaporation-driven self-assembly of CNTs and their preferential alignment are observed. Image analysis and Raman spectroscopy are utilised to evaluate the degree of alignment of the CNT network. It is found that the contact line dynamics depends greatly on the CNT concentration. Besides, the substrate temperature plays a significant role in determining the order of the CNTs in the drying deposition pattern. Our findings show the possibility of controlling the film morphology and the degree of alignment of CNTs for printed electronics in the printing process.",A computational study on H2S release and amide formation from thionoesters and cysteine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135017,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 12,"The recognition of the biological activity of H2S has drawn much attention to the development of biocompatible H2S release reactions. Thiol-, particularly cysteine-triggered systems which mimic the enzymatic conversion of cysteine or homocysteine to H2S have been intensively reported recently. Herein, a density functional theory (DFT) study was performed to address the reaction mechanism of H2S release and potential amide bond formation from thionoesters and cysteine to gain deeper mechanistic insights. Three possible mechanisms were considered and we found that the one starting from the nucleophilic addition of the ionized mercapto of cysteine on thionoester to generate a dithioester intermediate (Path A) is kinetically favored over the others starting from the nucleophilic addition of the amine of cysteine to generate thionoamide intermediates (Paths B and C). Dithioester then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic addition of an amine group and the rate-limiting water-assisted proton transfer to generate a cyclic thiol intermediate, and finally affords H2S and dihydrothiazole via water-assisted elimination. The hydrolysis of thionoamide or dihydrothiazole to produce amide is highly difficult under neutral conditions but is operative under strong basic conditions, which explains the experimental observation that dihydrothiazole rather than amide is the major product. Meanwhile, the ring opening reaction of the cyclic thiol intermediate to form the more stable thionoamide is detrimental to H2S release and becomes competitive under basic conditions."

The present study investigated the health benefits of bilberry anthocyanin (BA) on aging perimenopausal Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats that entered into perimenopause through natural aging were treated for 8 weeks with BA, and received either a low dose (LD, 35 mg per kg of bodyweight), medium dose (MD, 70 mg per kg of bodyweight), or high dose (HD, 140 mg per kg of bodyweight). The experimental results suggested that all three dosages of BA, especially the high dose, significantly reduced the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. In addition, BA supplementation markedly reduced the serum malondialdehyde (MDA), effectively increased the activity of hepatic total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), significantly raised the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), increased the number of estrogen receptors, and effectively up-regulated the expression levels of G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2). In summary, BA has a great effect on improving the serum cholesterol in natural aging perimenopausal rats via the estrogen receptor signaling pathway, and it may be used as a dietary supplement for perimenopause women to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.","Peptide identification from a Porphyra dioica protein hydrolysate with antioxidant, angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134998,Food & function,2019 05 28,"A Porphyra dioica protein extract was enzymatically hydrolysed and then fractionated using semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance chromatography.

Crucial to the performance of these devices is the generation of free charges, which occurs through the dissociation of excitons. Here we study excitons in polythiophenes, their stability and energetics of dissociation and separation into charge carriers. Excitons are excited electron and hole pairs bound by Coulomb interactions. To separate into unbound charges, the exciton binding energy must be overcome. We use a tight binding Hamiltonian to describe the exciton binding energy and its dissociation potential, for an exciton confined to a single polymer chain. Our model accounts for polaronic effects, arising from reorganization of nuclei and from polarization of the surrounding dielectric, which stabilize the separated carriers and thereby affect the exciton dissociation potential. We examine the effects of an applied electric field on the dissociation potential, and relate the field strength necessary to unbind the hole-electron pair to the maximum attractive Coulomb force between them. We apply our model to study the exciton at a donor-acceptor interface on a block-copolymer.

Using a computational assay approach, we investigated the unconventional photoluminescence mechanism of PEI-PDLLA. The results revealed that such photoluminescence should be related to the ""clustered heteroatom chromophores"" formed by through-space electronic interactions of N-heteroatoms in PEI. The copolymers can function as a fluorescent nanoprobe (PEI-PDLLA NPs) via a facile nanoprecipitation method and the self-assembly mechanism of PEI-PDLLA NPs was also investigated in-depth by molecular dynamics simulation.

In this work, we report the thermoelectric properties of Cu2Se compounds with different sample preparation processes and the inclusion of a nanoscale Ag2Se powder synthesized with a unique wet chemistry procedure. The Cu2Se compounds were prepared by solid state reaction (SSR), fast quenching (FQ) and mechanically alloyed with nanostructured Ag2Se (NM) followed by hot pressing. High temperature transport properties were assessed by the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity measurements. Structural characterization demonstrates that the nano-Ag2Se included sample is multi-phase with several nanoscale features not seen in the Cu2Se samples prepared in the standard method. As a result, the Cu2Se-NM sample possesses a miniscule thermal conductivity, with values as low as 0.5 W m-1 K-1. Fortunately, the nano-inclusions present in the Cu2Se-NM sample do not significantly disrupt electronic transport, preserving the power factor at a consistently high value over a broad range of temperatures.

The relative risk (RR), mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined. RESULTS Twenty-one randomized controlled trials were included in this analysis. Overall, HVHF was associated with lower mortality compared with control measures (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.81 to 0.96, P=0.004) in critically ill patients. Sub-analysis revealed HVHF reduced mortality in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, but no similar effect in other diseases. HVHF decreased levels of plasma tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6. The heart rate of the HVHF group after treatment was slower than the control group, while we found higher mean arterial pressure in the HVHF group, but oxygenation index was not significantly different between the two groups.

The students were instructed to capture photographs of the environmental hazards using their mobile phone cameras and share them on a social media platform. Immediately after the tour, the students discussed their experiences with the faculty. Two weeks after the toxic tour, the students engaged in a focus group discussion in which they discussed their experiences, advantages, and disadvantages of the toxic tour and participant photography method and their attitudes toward environmental health. This pedagogical exercise led to the active engagement of the students with the environmental hazards in the area. They shared 70 photographs on the social media platform. In reflection, students described that they found the method very useful to actively engage with the environment, look for and find the hazards, revisit, and reflect on the photos, and use the photos to share the knowledge and experience. They also demonstrated a positive social determinants and public health attitude during the discussions.

However, little is known about the altered miRNA profiles of testicular tissues in nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Using microarray technology, the miRNA expression profiles of testicular biopsies from patients with NOA and of normal testicular tissues were determined. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to predict the enriched biological processes and functions of identified miRNAs. The microarray data were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the results of which were then validated with a larger sample size. Correlations between the miRNA expression levels and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of miRNAs for azoospermia. Hierarchical clustering showed that 129 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the NOA and control groups. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in spermatogenesis, cell cycle, and mitotic prometaphase. In the subsequent qRT-PCR assays, the selected miRNA expression levels were consistent with the microarray results, and similar validated results were obtained with a larger sample size. Some clinical characteristics were significantly associated with the expression of certain miRNAs. In particular, we identified a combination of two miRNAs (miR-10b-3p and miR-34b-5p) that could serve as a predictive biomarker of azoospermia. This study provides altered miRNA profiles of testicular biopsies from NOA patients and examines the roles of miRNAs in spermatogenesis.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying the behavior of spermatogonia, including spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal and spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation, are not fully understood. Recent studies demonstrated that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in spermatogonial development, but whether MTOR itself was also involved in any specific process of spermatogonial development remained undetermined. In this study, we specifically deleted Mtor in male germ cells of mice using Stra8-Cre and assessed its effect on the function of spermatogonia. The Mtor knockout (KO) mice exhibited an age-dependent perturbation of testicular development and progressively lost germ cells and fertility with age. These age-related phenotypes were likely caused by a delayed initiation of Mtor deletion driven by Stra8-Cre. Further examination revealed a reduction of differentiating spermatogonia in Mtor KO mice, suggesting that spermatogonial differentiation was inhibited. Spermatogonial proliferation was also impaired in Mtor KO mice, leading to a diminished spermatogonial pool and total germ cell population. Our results show that MTOR plays a pivotal role in male fertility and is required for spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation.",Mars walking simulation: An electromyographic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134914,Neurology India,2019 05 28,"With a long duration return mission to Mars on the horizon, we must learn as much about the environment and its influence on the musculoskeletal system as possible to develop countermeasures and mitigate deleterious health effects and maladaptation.",Neurophysiological changes in simulated microgravity: An animal model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134913,Neurology India,2019 05 28,"Microgravity (MG) is one of the main problems that astronauts have to cope with during space missions. Long-duration space travel can have detrimental effects on human neurophysiology. Despite scientific efforts, these effects are still insufficiently investigated. Animal earth-based analogs are used to investigate potential nervous system associated perturbations that might occur during prolonged space missions. Hindlimb unloading, Tail suspension and Pelvic suspension models are currently used in MG studies. Loss of homeostasis of certain biological pathways in the nervous system can lead to the functioning and expression of receptors/genes, and the release and functioning of neurotransmitters and neuronal membrane ion channels into specific brain regions. The potential impact of MG on molecular mechanisms linked to neurophysiology through animal earth-based analogs is reviewed. The effect of molecular signalling pathways on the decline of neuronal connectivity and cognitive and neuroplasticity function under MG simulated conditions will be studied. The role of biomarkers including neurotransmitters, genes or receptors will be highlighted in the healthy and MG-affected brain. MG-mediated neurodegenerative mechanisms linked to learning and memory impairment will be highlighted. This review depicts the current rodent models applied to simulate MG ground based approaches and investigates the MG induced changes in the nervous system. The neuropathological profile of the above animal MG ground-based models can be comparable to the effects of ageing, anxiety and other neurological disorders. The advantages and limitations of the existing approaches are discussed.

NASA has scheduled deep space exploration of extraterrestrial locations such as the Moon and Mars in the 2030s. Adverse health effects related to the human exposure to microgravity from previous, relatively shorter missions have been documented. A lengthy deep space travel to Mars could be overburdened by significant adverse health effects. Astronauts demonstrate a significant increase in the number of many types of circulating white blood cells (neutrophils, monocytes, T-helper cells, and B-cells) but a decrease in natural killer cells. It is unclear whether these changes are due to increased production or decreased clearance of these cells. In this review, viral reactivation in astronauts will be discussed, including the occurrence of clinical cases before, during, or after spaceflight and their management during and after flight.

This allowed birds access to the pens each with feeders or waterers. There were markedly more chickens observed in the pens each with feeders or waterers and a light intensity of 20 lux than 5 lux. Moreover, more feed was consumed in the 20 lux pens than 5 pens. There were also high numbers of chickens in the transit compartment with its low light intensity (1 to 2 lux) and no feeders or waterers. Broiler chickens exhibited a preference for 20 lux light intensity for feeding compared to 5 lux light intensity.

European donors are considered to be strong supporters of HSS. Nevertheless, little is known about how their support for HSS translates into concrete policies at partner country level. Furthermore, as development cooperation is a shared policy between the EU and its Member States, it remains unclear to what extent European donors share a similar approach. Objective: This article reviews a PhD thesis on European aid and HSS. The thesis investigated (1) the approaches of European donors towards IHA, and (2) the extent to which there are similarities or differences between them. An original analytical framework was developed to make a fine-grained analysis of European donors' approaches in the DRC, Ethiopia, Uganda and Mozambique. In addition, the relation of European donors with the Global Fund was investigated. Methods: An abductive research approach was used during which literature review, data generation, analysis and research design mutually influenced each other. The research built on a wide range of empirical data, including semi-structured interviews with 123 respondents, policy documents and descriptive statistical analysis. Results and conclusion: Four 'types' of European donors were identified, which vary in their focus (issue-specific versus comprehensive) and their level of support to and involvement of recipient states. Despite this heterogeneity at a specific level, there is still a general degree of 'unity' among European donors, especially compared with the US. Yet, there are signs that the 'transatlantic' divide on HSS may be converging, as European donors tend to focus more explicitly on result-oriented approaches traditionally associated with the US and Global Health Initiatives. Consequently, European donors play a limited role in bringing HSS more to the forefront in IHA.",Factors influencing recanalization of thrombotic venous occlusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134852,VASA. Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,2019 05 28," The outcome of a thrombotic vessel occlusion is related to the resolution of thrombus and restitution of blood flow. Thrombus formation simultaneously activates an enzymatic process that mediates endogenous fibrinolysis to maintain vessel patency. The balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis determines the extent of thrombus formation, its resolution, and clinical outcome. Endogenic fibrinolysis is frequently unable to overcome coagulation and to resolve the thrombus. Therefore, for a complete resolution of thrombus in an acute phase, exogenic fibrinolytic agents are needed. Currently, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is most frequently used for therapeutic thrombolysis. Also, heparins, particularly low-molecular-weight heparins and direct oral anticoagulants which are known as anticoagulant drugs, have some pro-fibrinolytic properties. Besides the extent and age of a clot, different other factors influence the lysis of thrombus. Thrombus structure is one of the most important determinants of thrombus lysis. The concentration of thrombolytic agent (tPA) around and inside of thrombus importantly determines clot lysis velocity. Further, flow-induced mechanical forces which stimulate the transport of thrombolytic agent into the clot influence thrombolysis. Inflammation most probably represents a basic pathogenetic mechanism of activation of coagulation and influences the activity of the fibrinolytic system. Inflammation increases tissue factor release, platelet activity, fibrinogen concentration and inhibits fibrinolysis by increasing plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Therefore, recanalization of a thrombotic vessel occlusion is inversely related to levels of some circulating inflammatory agents. Consequently, inhibition of inflammation with anti-inflammatory drugs may improve the efficacy of prevention of thromboembolic events and stimulate recanalization of thrombotic occlusions of veins.",Decreased BDNF in female but not male rats after exposure to stress: a sex-sensitive rat model of stress?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134851,"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 28,"The literature has consistently emphasized a relationship between chronic stress and depression as well as the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It is also well known that there are gender disparities with regard to depression. However, there has been a lack of biobehavioral experimental investigations of these relationships with regard to the role of BDNF in sex differences in response to stress. It was hypothesized that stress (chronic unpredictable mild stress [CUMS], shock stress [SS]) would result in greater deleterious alterations in behavior (open field activity [OFA]) and biological (serum BDNF, body weight [BW]) indices of depression for female rats as compared to male rats. Subjects consisted of 79 Sprague-Dawley rats with 11-16 rats per each condition. CUMS consisted of 14 d of stress whereby on each stress day, rats were exposed to 20-min periods of predator stress and unpredictable environmental stress. SS consisted of a 2-h per day session of immobilization and tail-shocks repeated for three consecutive days. Serum BDNF was collected via trunk blood and quantitated using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There were pronounced sex differences with regard to stress-induced behavioral and biological alterations. Both stressors decreased vertical activity (VA) (i.e. increased depressive-related behavior) and SS decreased serum BDNF in female rats, but not in male rats. Findings indicate a potential relationship between depressive-like behaviors and BDNF after exposure to stress. The clear sex differences in stress responding emphasize the need for more stress research that involves male and female subjects. Lay summary Stress decreased vertical activity (VA) in female but not male rats while shock stress (SS) decreased serum BDNF in female but not male rats. VA was positively correlated with serum BDNF for female rats. These findings suggest sex differences in response to stress.",Effects of microbial feed additives on feed utilization and growth performance in growing Barki lambs fed diet based on peanut hay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134850,Animal biotechnology,2019 05 28,"The effects of supplementing diet of growing lambs with microbial feed additive mixture (direct-fed microbial; DFM) based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactic acid bacteria and exogenous enzymes on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen (N) utilization, ruminal fermentation, blood chemistry and growth performance were studied.

Lambs were offered a control diet of peanut hay and concentrates (1:1 dry matter (DM) basis) or the control diet supplemented with DFM at 0.5 g/day (Bactozyme treatment) for 16 weeks. There was no effect on feed efficiency but Bactozyme lambs had increased (p = 0.009) feed intake, average daily gain (p = 0.042) and final body weight (p = 0.047). Bactozyme treatment had greater neutral detergent fiber (p = 0.020) and acid detergent fiber (p = 0.034) digestibility compared with the control treatment. Metabolism experiment showed that the feed additive mixture increased (p<0.05) N intake and N retention. Bactozyme treatment had greater blood total protein (p = 0.027), and globulin (p = 0.025) concentrations compared with the control treatment. It is concluded that supplementing growing Barki lambs with DFM at 0.5 g daily enhanced final body weight gain and fiber digestion without affecting feed efficiency.",Protective neuroendocrine effects of environmental enrichment and voluntary exercise against social isolation: evidence for mediation by limbic structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134849,"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 28,"Previous research indicates that loneliness and social isolation may contribute to behavioral disorders and neurobiological dysfunction. Environmental enrichment (EE), including both cognitive and physical stimulation, may prevent some behavioral, endocrine, and cardiovascular consequences of social isolation; however, specific neural mechanisms for these benefits are still unclear. Therefore, this study examined potential neuroendocrine protective effects of both EE and exercise. Adult female prairie voles were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: paired control, social isolation/sedentary, social isolation/EE, and social isolation/voluntary exercise. All isolated animals were housed individually for 8 weeks, while paired animals were housed with their respective sibling for 8 weeks. Animals in the EE and voluntary exercise conditions received EE items (including a running wheel) and a running wheel only, respectively, at week 4 of the isolation period. At the end of the experiment, plasma and brains were collected from all animals for corticosterone and FosB and delta FosB (FosB/ΔFosB) - immunoreactivity in stress-related brain regions. Overall, social isolation increased neuroendocrine stress responses, as reflected by the elevation of corticosterone levels and increased FosB/ΔFosB-immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) compared to paired animals; EE and voluntary exercise attenuated these increases. EE and exercise also increased FosB/ΔFosB-immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to other conditions. Limbic structures statistically mediated hypothalamic immunoreactivity in EE and exercise animals. This research has translational value for socially isolated individuals by informing our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying responses to social stressors. Highlights Prolonged social isolation increased basal corticosterone levels and basolateral amygdala immunoreactivity. Environmental enrichment and exercise buffered corticosterone elevations and basolateral amygdala hyperactivity. Protective effects of environmental enrichment and exercise may be mediated by medial prefrontal cortex and limbic structures."

Methods: A total of 1342 cases that undergone cranial MRI study were retrospectively analyzed. Patients without a previous stroke and over 45 years were enrolled in the study. Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the participants were obtained from institutional computerized database. Subcortical and periventricular white matter were evaluated in axial FLAIR images according to Fazekas's grading scale. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for assessing the predictors of Fazekas's grading scale. Results: MPR of Fazekas 0, Fazekas 1, Fazekas 2 and Fazekas 3 groups were 3, 3, 4 and 3%, respectively. MPR difference between study groups was not significant (p = .32). RPR of Fazekas 0, Fazekas 1, Fazekas 2 and Fazekas 3 groups were 6, 7, 7 and 7%, respectively. RPR difference between study groups was significant (p < .001). Conclusion: We suggest that increased RDW and RPR values may indicate higher Fazekas's score and dementia in cranial imaging studies. The radiologist should pay particular attention in interpretation of cranial MRI of these patients.",Early male aging or poor clinical consideration for males in IVF centers? An original study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134836,The aging male : the official journal of the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male,2019 05 28,"The Italian law 40/2004 allows the use of assisted reproduction techniques only if there are no other effective therapeutic approaches to overcome infertility. According to article 4 paragraph 1, the impossibility of removing the otherwise impeding causes to achieve a pregnancy must be ascertained before the couple undergoes assisted reproduction techniques. On this premises, we sought to evaluate the percentage of couples who underwent or were addressed to assisted reproduction techniques despite a known and potentially treatable male infertility factor in fertility centers in the city of Catania, Italy. To accomplish this, andrologists, urologists and endocrinologists were asked to report the number of couples already addressed to assisted reproduction techniques which they counseled in the trimester April-June 2018 having a under 35-year-old female partner and at least one among the following untreated conditions: (A) oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and FSH <8 mIU/ml, (B) third-degree varicocele (mono or bilateral form), and (C) leukocytospermia or urogenital infections. Of the 320 enrolled couples, 75 (23%) met the criterion A, 45 (14%) the criterion B, and 62 (19%) the criterion C. More than a half couples were addressed to assisted reproduction techniques despite a potentially treatable male infertility factor.",Parental PTSD and school performance in 16-year-olds - a Swedish national cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134834,Nordic journal of psychiatry,2019 05 28,"Aim: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in parents can have severe consequences also for their children. Prevalence of PTSD is high among refugees. Refugee children have been reported to perform poorly in school. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of PTSD in refugee and native Swedish parents on children's school performance and to compare the impact of PTSD with that of other major psychiatric disorders. Methods: Register study where multiple regression models were used to analyse school performance in 15-16-year-olds in a national cohort (n = 703,813). PTSD and other major psychiatric disorders (bipolar, depression and/or psychotic disorders) were identified from out- and in-patient hospital care. Results: Maternal and paternal PTSD were associated with lower grades, with adjusted effects of 0.30-0.37 SD in refugee and 0.46-0.50 SD in native Swedish families. Impact of PTSD was greater than that of other psychiatric disorders and comorbidity to PTSD did not increase this impact. Although the impact of PTSD on grades was greater in children in native Swedish families, consequences with regard to eligibility to secondary education were greater for children in refugee families, where 35% of these children were ineligible. Conclusions: Parental PTSD has major consequences for children's school performance and contributes to the lower school performance in children in refugee families in Sweden. Identification and treatment of PTSD in refugee parents is important for offspring educational achievement. Psychiatric clinics and treatment centres need to have a strategy for support, including educational support, to the offspring of their patients with PTSD.",Utilization of glycerol and crude glycerol for polysaccharide production by an endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum CGMCC 6882.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134832,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,2019 06 14,"Crude glycerol is becoming a financial and environmental liability due to its surplus production from biodiesel industry, and its utilization as a fermentation feedstock for value-added chemicals production has been widely studied. In present work, the capacity of an endophytic fungus, Chaetomium globosum CGMCC 6882, using glycerol and crude glycerol for polysaccharide production was investigated. Results showed that the polysaccharide titers from glucose and glycerol were 1.85 and 3.8 g/L, respectively. Moreover, spore morphology of C. globosum CGMCC 6882 was favorable for polysaccharide production. Meanwhile, impurities in crude glycerol have no effect on polysaccharide production by C. globosum CGMCC 6882. Finally, characteristic results of polysaccharides produced from glucose, glycerol, and crude glycerol have suggested that metabolic flux might be a determinant factor on polysaccharide structure. Taken together, this research provided an innovative approach of utilizing crude glycerol produced from the biodiesel production process.",Functional Multipotency of Stem Cells and Recovery Neurobiology of Injured Spinal Cords.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134830,Cell transplantation,2019 05 28,"This invited concise review was written for the special issue of Cell Transplantation to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the American Society for Neural Therapy and Repair (ASNTR). I aimed to present a succinct summary of two interweaved lines of research work carried out by my team members and collaborators over the past decade. Since the middle of the 20th century, biomedical research has been driven overwhelmingly by molecular technology-based focal endeavors. Our investigative undertakings, however, were orchestrated to define and propose novel theoretical frameworks to enhance the field's ability to overcome complex neurological disorders. The effort has engendered two important academic concepts: Functional Multipotency of Stem Cells, and Recovery Neurobiology of Injured Spinal Cords. Establishing these theories was facilitated by academic insight gleaned from stem cell-based multimodal cross-examination studies using tactics of material science, systems neurobiology, glial biology, and neural oncology. It should be emphasized that the collegial environment cultivated by the mission of the ASNTR greatly promoted the efficacy of inter-laboratory collaborations. Notably, our findings have shed new light on fundamentals of stem cell biology and adult mammalian spinal cord neurobiology. Moreover, the novel academic leads have enabled determination of potential therapeutic targets to restore function for spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases.",Anti-Platelet Therapy in Mild Cerebral Infarction Patients on the Basis of CYP2C19 Metabolizer Status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134829,Cell transplantation,2019 05 28,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of CYP2C19 metabolizer status on the clinical therapeutic efficacy of cerebral infarction. Patients with cerebral infarction ( n = 180; NIHSS score ≤ 5) were recruited and divided into Group A and Group B according to CYP2C19 metabolizer status. In Group A, patients received routine clopidogrel therapy for 1 year; in Group B, the patients with extensive metabolizer (EM) were treated with clopidogrel, and patients with intermediate metabolizer (IM) and poor metabolizer (PM) were treated with aspirin for 1 year. On admission, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was determined, and the therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with Modified Rankin Scale score after 1 year of treatment. The outcomes and adverse effects were recorded during the treatment. After routine clopidogrel treatment, the efficacy in EM patients was significantly better than in PM and IM patients. After adjustment of therapeutic protocol, the therapeutic efficacy in PM and IM patients was markedly improved, which was accompanied by significant reduction in recurrence rate of cerebral infarction. Although the adverse effects increased in patients receiving aspirin treatment, they resolved after symptomatic therapy. CYP2C19 metabolizer status is closely related to the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the anti-platelet treatment according to the CYP2C19 metabolizer status to maximize therapeutic efficacy without increasing recurrence and adverse effects.",Retrospective Case Series of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treated with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134828,Cell transplantation,2019 05 28,"Returning veterans are frequently diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Considering a recent case-controlled study of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) reporting a reduction in suicidal ideation, we investigated retrospectively three veterans with chronic TBI/PTSD symptoms who were treated with multiple rounds of HBOT with neurophysiological testing performed before and after treatment. Improvements were detected on parameters within neurocognitive domains, including reductions in suicide-related symptoms. These findings independently confirm that HBOT may be effective in treating specific symptoms of TBI/PTSD that are not currently addressed with existing therapeutic approaches.",Protective Effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Cognitive Function in Patients with Vascular Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134827,Cell transplantation,2019 05 28,"Recent studies have shown that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has a therapeutic effect on vascular dementia (VD); however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. This article aims to reveal the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of HBO on VD. A total of 158 patients with VD were prospectively included in the study and were randomly divided into control group and HBO group. The control group was given conventional treatment and the HBO group was treated with HBO in addition to conventional treatment. The following HBO protocol was practiced: 5 days per week, 60 min each, 100% oxygen at 2 standard atmospheric pressures for 12 weeks. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and serum Humanin levels were detected before and after treatments in both groups. The baseline characteristics were not different dramatically between groups ( p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in MMSE scores and serum Humanin levels between the two groups before treatment ( p > 0.05). After treatment, compared with the control group, the MMSE scores and serum Humanin levels in the HBO group were significantly increased ( p < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that the serum Humanin levels were positively correlated with MMSE scores ( r = 0.409, p < 0.05) and this correlation was independent of baseline characteristics (β = 0.312, p < 0.05). HBO therapy can improve cognitive function in patients with VD, and its mechanism may be related to elevated serum Humanin levels.",Hydrogen sulfide promotes osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134826,Journal of drug targeting,2019 05 28,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter, plays an important role in the regulation of bone homeostasis. However, the precise effect of H2S on osteoclasts was still elusive. The goal of this study was to determine the potential role of H2S in regulation of osteoclasts and the underlying mechanisms by which H2S affected osteoclastogenesis. The present study applied western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, pit formation assay, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and annexin v-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double-staining assay. The results showed that the expressions of cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine c-lyase (CSE) were obviously increased in osteoclast differentiation induced by the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL). In addition, H2S promoted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inhibited apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. Mechanistically, H2S inhibited autophagy in Raw 264.7 cells. Autophagy activator (rapamycin) alleviated the induction of osteoclast differentiation by H2S. Further studies showed that H2S inhibited autophagy by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Taken together, our results implicated that exogenous H2S could promote osteoclastogenesis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to downregulate autophagy.",A neuropsychological and behavioral study of PLS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134825,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2019 05 28,"Background: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare motor neuron disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper motor neurons, resulting in spasticity and disability. There is, however, mounting evidence that the disease is not limited to upper motor neurons alone and that cognitive and behavioral changes within the spectrum of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are part of the clinical phenotype. Objectives: To provide an in-depth classification of the cognitive and behavioral profiles of PLS by using the golden standard, a full neuropsychological evaluation, as well as a comprehensive behavioral assessment in a cohort of 30 cases. Results: Only 7 out of 30 PLS patients scored within normal range on all of the tests within our battery. The neuropsychological profile of PLS consists of deficits in social cognition (affective theory of mind (ToM) in particular), fluency, executive functions and memory. Using the revised Strong criteria, we could classify 57% of patients within the FTD spectrum (of which 17% had behavioral variant FTD). An additional 20% of patients had deficits which were not characteristic of FTD. Conclusions: This study confirms that PLS is not a restricted phenotype (only affecting upper motor neurons) and that behavioral and cognitive changes are common. Therefore, clinicians treating PLS patients should routinely assess cognition and behavior as part of routine care as cognitive and behavioral changes impact management, decision-making and care-giver burden. This assessment should be sensitive to the neuropsychological profile of PLS (social cognition (affective ToM in particular), fluency, executive functions and memory) and behavioral changes."

Metal sequestration in old organs has been considered as a mechanism for plant survival in polluted soils. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of the old leaves as a sink for HMs accumulation in C. procera. Two instruments were used: atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy. Soil and plant samples were collected from around one of the worst congested traffic areas in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Samples from roots, stem, and green and old leaves were prepared and analyzed by both instruments. Calotropis procera was able to concentrate Fe, Mn, Sr, and Zn in the roots, but their translocation to stem and green leaves was low. Old leaves had greater ability to accumulate significantly higher concentrations of different metals, especially Fe and Sr, than other parts of the plants, indicating that C. procera uses these metabolically less-active leaves as sinks for heavy metals. Fe and Sr attained higher bioconcentration and accumulation values, compared to Zn and Mn. There were significant positive correlations between XRF and AAS for all elements in the different organs.",Unmodified household coffee maker assisted extraction and purification of anticancer agents from Dillenia indica fruits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134812,Natural product research,2019 05 28,"Bioassay targeted, 80% aqueous ethanol crude extract of the fruits of Dillenia indica Linn, using the unmodified household coffee maker, afforded five compounds, namely betulinic acid (1), rhamnazin (2), dillenetin (3), luteolin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (4) and hypolaetin-8-O-β-D-glucoside (5). The crude extract, fractions and purified compounds were tested against MDA MB-231, A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines by MTT assay, using betulinic acid 1, as a positive control. Compound 3 showed the best activity against A549 (IC50 = 26.60 ± 2.5 µM) and HeLa cancer cell lines (IC50 =19.35 ± 0.9 µM), whereas compound 5 was found to show the best activity against MDA MB-231 (IC50 = 34.62 ± 5.2µM) cancer cell line.

Programed death ligand 1 PD-L1, expressed on cancer cell membranes also blocks the cytotoxic activity of PD1+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: We assessed the immunohistochemical detection of these immune-tolerance related markers in a series of 98 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) treated with surgery. The Tumor Infiltration Lymphocyte TIL density (mean number per x400 optical field) and the percentage of FOXP3+ TILs were assessed. Results: PD-L1 expression was directly linked with the TIL density (p = 0.01) and with the extent of infiltration with FOXP3+ TILs, named as the FIL-score (p = 0.01). FIL-score was significantly higher in stage I disease (p = 0.04). IL6 expression was linked with high TIL-score. A low TIL-score, characterizing immune deficient tumors defined a significantly poorer prognosis subgroup of patients (p = 0.03). Stratification of these tumors according to the FIL-score showed that FOXP3 expression by TILs correlated with an even a poorer prognosis in univariate (p = 0.007; median survival 14 vs. 44 months, respectively) and in multivariate analysis (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 4.3). Conclusion: Tumor stroma infiltration by FOXP3+ Tregs is an early event in the progression of NSCLC. Low lymphocytic infiltration defines poor prognosis, which becomes worse when the small numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes characterizing these tumors contain FOXP3 + Tregs. Furthermore, the direct association of FOXP3+ Treg infiltration density with PD-L1 expression by cancer cells implies a co-ordinated immune-suppressive activity in NSCLC.",Psychometric and Clinimetric Validity of the Modified 25-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134810,American journal of rhinology & allergy,2019 05 28,"Productivity losses are a significant part of the disease burden associated with rhinosinusitis, but existing measures of disease-specific quality of life exclude explicit assessment of the impact of the disease on productivity.",Asymmetric Cycloaddition of ortho-Hydroxyphenyl-Substituted para-Quinone Methides and Enamides Catalyzed by Chiral Phosphoric Acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134809,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 11,"A BINOL-based chiral phosphoric acid was employed as an efficient catalyst in enantioselective cycloaddition of ortho-hydroxyphenyl-substituted para-quinone methides and enamides, which gave rise to acetamido-substituted tetrahydroxanthenes with three adjacent stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 99%) and excellent stereoselectivities (up to >99:1 diastereomeric ratio and up to 98% ee).",Dietary Branched-Chain Amino Acids Regulate Food Intake Partly through Intestinal and Hypothalamic Amino Acid Receptors in Piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134808,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 11,"Strategies to increase feed intake are of great importance for producing more meat in swine production. Intestinal and hypothalamic amino acid receptors are found to largely participate in feed intake regulation. The purpose of the current research is to study the function of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation in the regulation of feed intake through sensors that can detect amino acids in piglets. Twenty-four piglets were assigned one of four treatments and fed one of the experimental diets for either a short period (Expt. 1) or a long period (Expt. 2): a normal protein diet (NP, 20.04% CP), a reduced-protein diet (RP, 17.05% CP), or a reduced-protein test diet supplemented with one of two doses of BCAAs (BCAA1, supplemented with 0.13% l-isoleucine, 0.09% l-leucine, and 0.23% l-valine; BCAA2, supplemented with the 150% standardized ileal digestibility BCAA requirement, as recommended by the National Research Council (2012)). In Expt. 1, no differences were observed in the feed intake among piglets fed different diets ( P > 0.05). In Expt. 2, compared with the RP group, the feed intake of piglets was significantly increased after sufficient BCAAs were supplemented in the BCAA1 group, which was associated with decreased cholecystokinin secretion ( P < 0.05), down-regulated expression of type-1 taste receptors 1/3 (T1R1/T1R3) in the intestine, as well as increased expression of pro-opiomelanocortin, activated general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in the hypothalamus ( P < 0.05). However, the feed intake was decreased for unknown reasons when the piglets were fed a BCAA over-supplemented diet. Our study confirmed that a BCAA-deficient diet inhibited feed intake through two potential ways: regulating the amino acid T1R1/T1R3 receptor in the intestine or activating GCN2/eIF2α pathways in the hypothalamus.",Absorption of Anthocyanin Rutinosides after Consumption of a Blackcurrant ( Ribes nigrum L.) Extract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134806,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 11,"The dominant anthocyanins in blackcurrant are delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Data on their absorption and distribution in the human body are limited. Therefore, we performed a human pilot study on five healthy male volunteers consuming a blackcurrant ( Ribes nigrum L.) extract. The rutinosides and their degradation products gallic acid and protocatechuic acid were determined in plasma and urine. The rutinosides' concentrations peaked in both plasma and urine samples within 2 h of extract ingestion. The recoveries of delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside from urine samples were 0.040 ± 0.011% and 0.048 ± 0.016%, respectively, over a 48 h period. Protocatechuic acid concentration increased significantly after ingestion of the blackcurrant extract. Our results show that after ingestion of a blackcurrant extract containing delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, significant quantities of biologically active compounds circulated in the plasma and were excreted via urine. Furthermore, these results contribute to the understanding of anthocyanin metabolism in humans.",Structural Features of Hydrolyzable Tannins Determine Their Ability to Form Insoluble Complexes with Bovine Serum Albumin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134805,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 11,"The ability of 32 purified and characterized hydrolyzable tannins to form insoluble complexes with model protein bovine serum albumin was investigated with a turbidimetric 96-well plate reader method. The results showed a clear relationship between the hydrolyzable tannin structure and the intensity of haze that formed during the tannin-protein complexation. In addition to molecular weight, structural features such as number of galloyl groups, degree of oxidative coupling between the galloyls, positional isomerism, and cyclic vs acyclic glucose core were the major structural features that affected the ability of the monomeric hydrolyzable tannins to form insoluble complexes with bovine serum albumin. While oligomers were superior to monomers in their capability to precipitate the model protein, their activity depended less on the functional groups, but mostly on their size and overall flexibility. These results allowed us to construct an equation that predicted the protein precipitation capacity of the studied hydrolyzable tannins with high accuracy.",Targeted Permeability Control in the Subsurface via Calcium Silicate Carbonation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134804,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 11,"Efforts to develop safe and effective next-generation energy and carbon-storage technologies in the subsurface require novel means to control undesired fluid migration. Here we demonstrate that the carbonation of calcium silicates can produce reaction products that dramatically reduce the permeability of porous media and that are stable. Most calcium silicates react with CO2 to form solid carbonates but some polymorphs (here, pseudowollastonite, CaSiO3) can react to form a range of crystalline calcium silicate hydrates (CCSHs) at intermediate pH. High-pressure (1.1-15.5 MPa) column and batch experiments were conducted at a range of temperatures (75-150 °C) and reaction products were characterized using SEM-EDS and synchrotron μXRD and μXRF. Two characteristics of CCSH precipitation were observed, revealing unique properties for permeability control relative to carbonate precipitates. First, precipitation of CCSHs tends to occur on the surface of sand grains and into pore throats, indicating that small amounts of precipitation relative to the total pore volume can effectively block flow, compared to carbonates which precipitate uniformly throughout the pore space. Second, the precipitated CCSHs are more stable at low pH conditions, which may form more secure barriers to flow, compared to carbonates, which dissolve under acidic conditions.",Active-Site-Rich 1T-Phase CoMoSe2 Integrated Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Electrochemical Sensor and Energy Storage Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134803,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 11,"The presence of defect/distortion on layered structure of metal chalcogenides facilitate the higher electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. In this work, we have successfully synthesized Co-doped MoSe2(CoMoSe2, Co2MoSe2, Co3MoSe2, and Co4MoSe2) in 1T phase crystal structure by using hydrothermal technique and integrated with graphene oxide (GO). Various analytical techniques such as TEM, STEM, FESEM, XRD, RAMAN, EDX, ICP, and XPS confirmed the formation of 1T phase and defective sites on Co-doped MoSe2. Consequently, the relevant electrochemical studies were followed and reported the significant enhancement in electrocatalytic activity of MoSe2 due to the Co doping and GO hybridization. The proposed GO@CoMoSe2 electrocatalyst was developed to an electrode material for electrochemical sensor and supercapacitor applications. As expected, the GO@CoMoSe2 modified glassy carbon electrode exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the sensing of Metol (LOD, 0.009 μM; sensitivity, 2.397 μA μM-1 cm-2). Meanwhile, GO@CoMoSe2-coated nickel foam (NF) achieved feasible specific capacity (431.47 C g-1). In addition, the GO@CoMoSe2//AC asymmetric device exhibited the feasible energy density of 58.32 W h kg-1 at power density of 1800.25 W kg-1. Thus, we concluded that the Co doping and GO hybridization with MoSe2 provide the interesting idea to find out the excellent electrocatalysts with improved electrochemical performances toward the sensing and battery type supercapacitor applications."

Here, we present the antibacterial capabilities of the nanoassemblies formed by Fmoc-pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine-OH, their substantial effect on bacterial morphology, as well as new methods developed for the functional incorporation of these nanoassemblies within resin-based composites. These amalgamated materials inhibit and hinder bacterial growth and viability and are not cytotoxic toward mammalian cell lines. Importantly, due to the low dosage required to confer antibacterial activity, the integration of the nanoassemblies does not affect their mechanical and optical properties. This approach expands on the growing number of accounts on the intrinsic antibacterial capabilities of self-assembling building blocks and serves as a basis for further design and development of enhanced composite materials for biomedical applications.",Highly Thermally Conductive Fluorinated Graphene Films with Superior Electrical Insulation and Mechanical Flexibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134789,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"Graphene-based heat-spreading films have captured high attention in academic study and commercial applications because of their extremely high thermal conductivity and desired flexibility. However, the electrical conductivity limits their utilizations in many electronic fields. Herein, to address this problem, fluorinated graphene (F-graphene) that is exfoliated from commercial fluorinated graphite was first used to prepare the flexible free-standing composite film via vacuum filtration of uniform poly(vinyl alcohol)-assisted F-graphene suspension. The well-organized alignment of F-graphene lamellas makes the composite film show an ultrahigh in-plane thermal conductivity of 61.3 W m-1 K-1 at 93 wt % F-graphene. Despite at such high filler loading, the fabricated F-graphene film still possesses a superior electrical insulation property. Therefore, these results suggest that F-graphene, as the novel thermally conductive filler, demonstrates fascinating characters in the preparation of a thermally conductive yet electrically insulating nanocomposite.",The Importance of the Interfacial Contact: Is Reduced Graphene Oxide Always an Enhancer in Photo(Electro)Catalytic Water Oxidation?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134788,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 28,"Optimizing interfacial contact between graphene and a semiconductor has often been proposed as essential for improving their charge interactions. Herein, we fabricated bismuth vanadate-reduced graphene oxide (BiVO4/rGO) composites with tailored interfacial contact extents and reveal their disparate behavior in photoelectrochemical (PEC) and powder suspension (PS) water oxidation systems. BiVO4/rGO with a high rGO coverage on the BiVO4 surface (BiVO4/rGO HC) exhibited an 8-fold enhancement in the PEC photocurrent density with respect to neat BiVO4 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, while BiVO4/rGO with a low rGO coverage (BiVO4/rGO LC) gave a lesser 3-fold enhancement. In contrast, BiVO4/rGO HC delivered a detrimental effect while BiVO4/rGO LC exhibited an enhanced performance for oxygen evolution in the PS system. The phenomenon is attributed to changes in the hydrophobicity of the BiVO4/rGO composite in conjunction with the interfacial contact configuration. Better BiVO4/rGO interfacial contact was found to improve the charge separation efficiency and charge transfer ability of the composite material, explaining the superior PEC performance of BiVO4/rGO HC. Additionally, optimization of the interfacial contact extent was revealed to further improve the energetics of the composite material, as evidenced by a Fermi level shift to a more negative potential. However, the high hydrophobicity of BiVO4/rGO HC arising from the higher rGO reduction extent triggered poor water miscibility, reducing the surface wettability and therefore hampering the photocatalytic O2 evolution activity of the sample. The study underlines water miscibility as a governing issue in the PS system.",FKBP14 Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132235,,2019 05 28,"FKBP14 kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (FKBP14-kEDS) is characterized by congenital muscle hypotonia and weakness (typically improving during childhood), progressive scoliosis, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, gross motor developmental delay, myopathy, and hearing impairment.

The study aim was to investigate the role of AXL inhibition in kidney fibrosis due to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice underwent UUO and were treated with oral AXL inhibitor bemcentinib (n = 22), Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, n = 10), ACEI and bemcentinib (n = 10) or vehicle alone (n = 22). Mice were sacrificed after 7 or 15 days and kidney tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, ELISA, Sirius Red (SR) staining, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) quantification. RNA was extracted from frozen kidney tissues and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. After 15 days the ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys showed less fibrosis compared to the ligated vehicle-treated kidneys in SR analyses and Hyp quantification. Reduced IHC staining for Vimentin (VIM) and alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), as well as reduced mRNA abundance of key regulators of fibrosis such as transforming growth factor (Tgfβ), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), Smad2, Smad4, myofibroblast activation (Aldh1a2, Crlf1), and EMT (Snai1,2, Twist), in ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys was compatible with reduced (partial) EMT induction. Furthermore, less F4/80 positive cells, less activity of pathways related to the immune system and lower abundance of MCP1, MCP3, MCP5, and TARC in ligated bemcentinib-treated kidneys was compatible with reduction in inflammatory infiltrates by bemcentinib treatment.

However, their dispersal mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the majority of WIF are soil-borne. For this reason, the presented research aimed to quantify the contribution of soil as a source and medium for the dispersal of WIF to deadwood using high-throughput sequencing. We tested effects of tree species (specifically Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) on the percentage of WIF shared between soil and deadwood in a Chinese subtropical forest ecosystem. We also assessed the taxonomic and ecological functional group affiliations of the fungal community shared between soil and deadwood. Our results indicate that soil is a major route for WIF colonization as 12%-15% (depending on the tree species) of soil fungi were simultaneously detected in deadwood. We also demonstrate that tree species (p < 0.01) significantly shapes the composition of the shared soil and deadwood fungal community. The pH of decomposing wood was shown to significantly correspond (p < 0.01) with the shared community of wood-inhabiting (of both studied tree species) and soil fungi. Furthermore, our data suggest that a wide range of fungal taxonomic (Rozellida, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota) and ecological functional groups (saprotrophs, ectomycorrhizal, mycoparasites, and plant pathogens) may use soil as a source and medium for transport to deadwood in subtropical forest ecosystem. While 12%-62% of saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, and mycoparasitic WIF may utilize soil to colonize deadwood, only 5% of the detected plant pathogens were detected in both soil and deadwood, implying that these fungi use other dispersal routes. Animal endosymbionts and lichenized WIF were not detected in the soil samples. Future studies should consider assessing the relative contributions of other possible dispersal mechanisms (e.g. wind, water splash, water dispersal, animal dispersal, and mycelial network) in the colonization of deadwood by soil fungi.",Genetic analysis of the relation between IL2RA/IL2RB and rheumatoid arthritis risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134763,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2019 05 28,"The biological mechanisms driving disease chronicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are largely unidentified.

We here systematically investigated the suitability of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis for mutation detection in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with respect to clinicopathological disease stage. Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed to detect common point mutations in the KRAS and BRAF oncogenes in cfDNA from 65 patients and compared to mutations in tumor tissue. Stage of disease was classified according to UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) criteria. In tumor tissue, KRAS or BRAF mutations were present in 35 of 65 cases (44% UICC stage I, 50% stage II, 47% stage III, and 62% stage IV). Although cfDNA was detected in 100% of patients, ddPCR displayed the tumor tissue mutation in only 1 of 6 (17%) stage II patients, whereas 10 of 18 (56%) reported variants were verified in cfDNA samples of the stage IV cohort. No BRAF or KRAS mutation was detected in cfDNA from patients with wild-type tumor tissue. In one case of mutant stage II colon cancer (KRAS-G12C), the G12D variant was detected in cfDNA instead. Further workup revealed that circulating tumor-derived DNA and liver metastases originated from a synchronous KRAS-mutated cancer of the pancreas. Our results demonstrate that ddPCR-based analysis is highly specific and useful for mutation monitoring, but the sensitivity limits its usefulness for early cancer detection.",Comparative study of breast cancer with or without concomitant Paget disease: An analysis of the SEER database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134761,Cancer medicine,2019 05 28,Most mammary Paget disease (MPD) is associated with underlying in situ or invasive breast cancer.

Morphological changes, cell organelles integrity, and cell survival with the tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT) assay were utilized as tests of cytotoxicity. Preliminary investigation was performed by addition of the hydrogel components to the cell culture medium and by incubations of the CNC-HM in direct and indirect contact with a confluent monolayer of A375 melanoma cells. Direct contact assays suffered from interference of physical stress. Careful evaluation of cytotoxicity was obtained considering the overall picture provided by microscopy and biochemical tests performed with the CNC-HM in indirect contact with two melanoma cell lines (A375, M14) and human fibroblasts. CNCs have been demonstrated to be a safe precursor material and CNC-HMs have a good biocompatibility provided that the excess of cations, in particular of Ca2+ is removed.

Impressively, we find that the CoFe oxyhydroxide was in situ formed in the OER process, serves as the real catalytic active species for OER. Moreover, the direct conversion from CoFe borate to CoFe oxyhydroxide is reported for the first time in metal borate OER catalysts. The discovery in this work i.e., metal borate as precursor can efficient catalyze OER in alkaline medium, significantly widen the family of OER catalysts."

Soil microbes may promote plant diversity by driving negative frequency-dependent plant population dynamics, or may favor species exclusion by providing one species an average fitness advantage over others. However, past empirical research has focused overwhelmingly on the consequences of frequency-dependent feedbacks for plant species coexistence and has generally neglected the consequences of microbially mediated average fitness differences. Here we use theory to develop metrics that quantify microbially mediated plant fitness differences, and show that accounting for these effects can profoundly change our understanding of how microbes influence plant diversity. We show that soil microbes can generate fitness differences that favour plant species exclusion when they disproportionately harm (or favour) one plant species over another, but these fitness differences may also favor coexistence if they trade off with competition for other resources or generate intransitive dominance hierarchies among plants. We also show how the metrics we present can quantify microbially mediated fitness differences in empirical studies, and explore how microbial control over coexistence varies along productivity gradients.

The highest yield of 1,4-butanediol reached over 80%, which is similar to the value obtained over ReOx-Au/CeO2 + ReOx/C catalysts. Mixture catalysts of CeO2 + ReOx/C showed almost the same performance, giving 89% yield of 1,4-butanediol. The reactivity trends of possible intermediates suggest that the reaction mechanism over ReOx/CeO2 + ReOx/C catalysts is similar to that over ReOx-Au/CeO2 + ReOx/C: deoxydehydration (DODH) of 1,4-anhydroerythritol to 2,5-dihydrofuran over ReOx species on CeO2 support with the promotion of H2 activation by ReOx/C, isomerization of 2,5-dihydrofuran to 2,3-dihydrofuran catalyzed by ReOx on C support, hydration of 2,3-dihydrofuran catalyzed by C, and hydrogenation to 1,4-butanediol catalyzed by ReOx/C. The activity of ReOx/CeO2 + ReOx/C is higher than that of ReOx-Au/CeO2 + ReOx/C which is probably related to the reducibility of ReOx/C and the move of Re species between supports. The high-valent Re species such as Re7+ on CeO2 and C supports are mobile in the solvent; however, the low-valent Re species including metal Re species have much lower mobility. Metallic Re and cationic low-valent Re species with high reducibility and low mobility can be present on carbon support as a trigger for H2 activation and promoter of the reduction of Re species on CeO2.",Unveiling the Non-Linear Optical Response of Trichtenotoma childreni Longhorn Beetle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134739,Journal of biophotonics,2019 05 28,"The wings of some insect species are known to fluoresce under illumination by ultraviolet light.

The aim of this study was to explore the construction of unsafe care using accounts of adverse events concerning the patient, as reported by patients, relatives, and health care professionals. Twenty-nine adverse events reported in an acute care setting in a Swedish university hospital were analyzed through discourse analysis, where the construction of what was considered to be real and true in the descriptions of unsafe care was analyzed. In the written reports about unsafe events, the patient was spoken of in three different ways: (a) the patient as a presentation of physical signs, (b) the patient as suffering and vulnerable, and (c) the patient as unpredictable. When the patient's voice was subordinate to physical signs, this was described as being something that conflicted with patient safety. The conclusion was that the patient's voice might be the only sign available in the early stages of adverse events. Therefore, it is crucial for health care professionals to give importance to the patient's voice to prevent patients from harm and not unilaterally act only upon abnormal physical signs.",Myosin: Formation and maintenance of thick filaments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134719,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,2019 05 28,"Skeletal muscle consists of bundles of myofibers containing millions of myofibrils, each of which is formed of longitudinally aligned sarcomere structures. Sarcomeres are the minimum contractile unit, which mainly consists of four components: Z-bands, thin filaments, thick filaments, and connectin/titin. The size and shape of the sarcomere component is strictly controlled. Surprisingly, skeletal muscle cells not only synthesize a series of myofibrillar proteins but also regulate the assembly of those proteins into the sarcomere structures. However, authentic sarcomere structures cannot be reconstituted by combining purified myofibrillar proteins in vitro, therefore there must be an elaborate mechanism ensuring the correct formation of myofibril structure in skeletal muscle cells. This review discusses the role of myosin, a main component of the thick filament, in thick filament formation and the dynamics of myosin in skeletal muscle cells. Changes in the number of myofibrils in myofibers can cause muscle hypertrophy or atrophy. Therefore, it is important to understand the fundamental mechanisms by which myofibers control myofibril formation at the molecular level to develop approaches that effectively enhance muscle growth in animals.",New basic insights on the potential of chitosan-based medical device for improving functional recovery after radical prostatectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134718,BJU international,2019 05 28,"Previous studies have demonstrated promising effects of a Chitosan-Membrane (CS-Me) for protection of neurovascular bundles on potency recovery in patients that undergo nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.

However, the relationship between CHB, metabolic syndrome (MS) and steatosis is poorly understood. In this tertiary care, single-center retrospective cohort study of 617 CHB patients, we examined the prevalence of MS and steatosis in a predominantly Asian US cohort. Patients were predominantly male (57%) with a mean age of 53 years, Asian (88%), on HBV therapy (64%) and had undetectable DNA (65%). 21% had MS, of which hypertension (41%), dyslipidemia (41%) and obesity (32%) were most common. Patients with MS were more likely to be older (60 vs 52 [p<0.001]), have steatosis (40 vs 17% [p<0.001]) and have a higher ALT (29 vs 25 [p=0.003]). Of the 22% of patients with steatosis by ultrasound, a higher prevalence of MS (38 vs 16% [p<0.001]) and higher ALT (31 vs 24 [p<0.001]) were observed. Asian patients had a lower BMI than non-Asians (mean 24 vs 26 [p=0.001]) but similar prevalence of MS risk factors and steatosis. Asian patients with a BMI between 25-30 and two other MS risk factors had steatosis at the same rate as patients with a BMI>30 and at least two other MS risk factors. We found a strong association between MS, steatosis and elevated ALT in HBV patients. Asian HBV patients have lower BMI than non-Asians yet have the same prevalence of steatosis and other MS risk factors, supporting guidelines for lower BMI targets in Asians.

Dysfunction of Sertoli cells could cause disordered spermatogenesis and reduced fertility in males. In this study, we focused on the expression and function of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a lysosomal depalmitoylating enzyme, in Sertoli cells. Here, we show that PPT1 expression in Sertoli cells is responsive to cholesterol treatment and that specific knockout of Ppt1 in Sertoli cells causes male subfertility associated with poor sperm quality and a high ratio of sperm deformity. Specifically, Ppt1 deficiency leads to poor cell variably accompanied with abnormal lysosome accumulation and increased cholesterol levels in Sertoli cells. Further, Ppt1 deficiency results in poor adhesion of developing germ cells to Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium, which is likely to be responsible for the reduced male fertility as a consequence of declines in sperm count and motility as well as a high incidence of sperm head deformity. In summary, PPT1 affects sperm quality and male fertility through regulating lysosomal function and cholesterol metabolism in Sertoli cells.",The Academic Outcomes of Working Memory and Metacognitive Strategy Training in Children: A Double-Blind Randomised Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134713,Developmental science,2019 05 28,"Working memory training has been shown to improve performance on untrained working memory tasks in typically developing children, at least when compared to non-adaptive training; however, there is little evidence that it improves academic outcomes. The lack of transfer to academic outcomes may be because children are only learning skills and strategies in a very narrow context, which they are unable to apply to other tasks. Metacognitive strategy interventions, which promote metacognitive awareness and teach children general strategies that can be used on a variety of tasks, may be a crucial missing link in this regard. In this double-blind randomised controlled trial, 95 typically developing children aged 9-14 years were allocated to three cognitive training programmes that were conducted daily after-school. One group received Cogmed working memory training, another group received concurrent Cogmed and metacognitive strategy training, and the control group received adaptive visual search training, which better controls for expectancy and motivation than non-adaptive training. Children were assessed on four working memory tasks, reading comprehension, and mathematical reasoning before, immediately after, and three months after training. Working memory training improved working memory and mathematical reasoning relative to the control group. The improvements in working memory were maintained three months later and these were significantly greater for the group that received metacognitive strategy training, compared to working memory training alone. Working memory training is a potentially effective educational intervention when provided in addition to school; however, future research will need to investigate ways to maintain academic improvements long-term and to optimise metacognitive strategy training to promote far-transfer.

We hypothesized that interindividual variations in fertility depend on the proportion of the fully functional sperm population contained in the insemination dose. The objective of this study was to identify protein markers of the fully functional sperm subpopulation. Insemination doses from four high-fertility (HF) and four low-fertility (LF) bulls with comparable post-thaw quality parameters were selected for proteomic analysis using iTRAQ technology. Thawed semen was centrifuged through a Percoll gradient to segregate the motile (high density [HD]) from the immotile (low density [LD]) sperm populations. Sperm proteins were extracted with sodium deoxycholate and four groups were compared: LD and HD spermatozoa from LF and HF bulls. A total of 498 unique proteins were identified and quantified. Comparison of HD spermatozoa from HF and LF bulls revealed that five proteins were significantly more abundant in the HF group (AK8, TPI1, TSPAN8, OAT, and DBIL5) whereas five proteins were more abundant in the LF group (RGS22, ATP5J, CLU, LOC616319, and CCT5). Comparison of LD spermatozoa from HF and LF bulls revealed that four proteins were significantly more abundant in the HF group (IL4I1, CYLC2, OAT, and ARMC3) whereas 15 proteins were significantly more abundant in the LF group (HADHA, HSP90AA1, DNASE1L3, SLC25A20, GPX5, TCP1, HIP1, CLU, G5E622, LOC616319, HSPA2, NUP155, DPY19L2, SPERT, and SERPINE2). DBIL5, TSPAN8, and TPI1 showed potential as putative markers of the fully functional sperm subpopulation."

J. Org. Chem. 2015;80:6143-6151). To interpret this unexpected behaviour, a 1 H NMR analysis and a thorough study of the chiroptical properties of 1 as a function of the nature of the solvent have been performed. The 1 H NMR spectra of 1 reveal that a self-encapsulation phenomenon takes place in DMSO-d6 and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 solvents. Thanks to the separation of the two enantiomers of 1 by HPLC on chiral stationary phase, the two enantiomers of 1 have been studied in detail by polarimetry, electronic (ECD), and vibrational (VCD) circular dichroism spectroscopies. Except for ECD spectroscopy, these chiroptical techniques reveal spectroscopic changes as a function of the nature of the solvent. For instance, in DMSO and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, in which the self-encapsulation phenomenon takes place, the sign of the specific optical rotation of [CD(-)254 ]-1 and [CD(+)254 ]-1 is changed. These results have then been compared with those obtained with cryptophane-223 bearing only one acetate group on the propylenedioxy linker (compound 2) and with cryptophane-223 bearing six acetate groups (compound 3). A self-encapsulation phenomenon is also observed with compound 2.

Nelore cows were submitted to a P4/estradiol based TAI protocol (D0 = insemination). On D12, cows in the control group (n=184) received a new P4 intravaginal device (0.96 g); whereas cows in the P4-LA group (n=192) received the P4 device and 75 mg P4-LA. Cows identified as non-pregnant (n=120) by regression of corpus luteum using color-Doppler ultrasonography on D20 had the P4 device removed and received 500ug of sodium cloprostenol, 1mg of estradiol cypionate and 300 IU of eCG and were re-inseminated on D22. There was no difference (P>0.10) in the pregnancy rate at D20, D30 and D60 after first TAI between the control (69%, 59.7% and 57%, respectively) and P4-LA (67%, 55.7%, and 55.2%, respectively) groups. Pregnancy losses were similar between both groups (P>0.1). For cows submitted to the second TAI, the pre-ovulatory follicle size did not differ (P>0.1), but the estrous detection and pregnancy rates were greater (P<0.05) in the P4-LA group (92.2% [59/64] and 60.9% [39/64], respectively) than in controls (75% [42/56] and 44.6% [25/56]). The cumulative pregnancy rate after two TAIs did not differ (P>0.1) between control (73.3% [135/184]) and P4-LA (76% [146/192]) groups. The use of P4-LA at 12 days after TAI potentially increases the pregnancy rates for a new early resynchronization strategy associated with the Doppler imaging for pregnancy diagnosis and results in an alternative to perform two TAIs in 22 days in beef cows.

Therefore, complete sequences of amino acids also encode fold-related global dynamic information, in addition to the local information that arises from static physical properties. We show that the relative magnitudes of these two contributions can be determined using Fourier methods, which represent the global properties of the sequences. It has also been shown that the behavior of Fourier components of 〈B〉 differs, with very high statistical significance, between structural groups, and that this information is not available from a comparable analysis of static amino acid properties.",Phylogenetic and population structural inference from genomic ancestry maintained in present-day common wheat Chinese landraces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134682,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 05 28,"Hexaploid common wheat is one of the most important food crops worldwide. Common wheat domestication began in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East approximately 10,000 years ago and then spread west into Europe and eastward into East Asia and China. However, the possible spreading route into and within China is still unclear. In this study, we successfully extracted DNA from single ancient wheat seeds and sequenced the whole genome of seven ancient samples from Xiaohe and Gumugou cemeteries in Xinjiang, China. Genomic inference and morphological observation confirmed their identity as hexaploid common wheat grown in prehistoric China at least 3200 years before present (BP). Phylogenetic and admixture analyses with RNA-seq data of modern hexaploid wheat cultivars from both China and Western countries demonstrated a close kinship of the ancient wheat to extant common wheat landraces in southwestern China. The highly similar allelic frequencies in modern landraces of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau with the ancient wheat support the previously suggested southwestern spreading route into the highland China. A subsequent dispersal route from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau margins to the Yangtze valley was proposed in this study. Furthermore, the common wheat populations grown in the Middle and Lower Yangtze valley wheat zones were also proposed to be established by population admixture with the wheat grown in the Upper Yangtze valley. Our study reports ancient common wheat sequences at a genome-wide scale, providing important information on the origin, dispersal, and genetic improvement under cultivation of present-day wheat landraces grown in China.

Serum levels of sex hormones were improved upon MT supplementation, and the expression of the testosterone synthesis proteins, StAR and P450scc was rescued as well. MT treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of SIRT1, SOD2, and GPx4 and down-regulated the expression of GRP78 and CHOP, indicating an attenuation of oxidative stress (OS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In TM3 cells, MT treatment protected against H2 O2 -induced steroidogenic collapse by improving mitochondrial function and attenuating OS and ER stress. These results indicate that MT treatment can improve steroidogenesis in mice fed with HFD and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of obesity-associated hypogonadism."

GPs with this linkage specificity are found in two families thus far-glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) and the recently discovered glycoside hydrolase family 149 (GH149). Previously, we reported a crystallographic study of a GH94 laminaribiose phosphorylase with specificity for disaccharides, providing insight into the enzyme's ability to recognize its' sugar substrate/product. In contrast to GH94, characterized GH149 enzymes were shown to have more flexible chain length specificity, with preference for substrate/product with higher degree of polymerization. In order to advance understanding of the specificity of GH149 enzymes, we herein solved X-ray crystallographic structures of GH149 enzyme Pro_7066 in the absence of substrate and in complex with laminarihexaose (G6). The overall domain organization of Pro_7066 is very similar to that of GH94 family enzymes. However, two additional domains flanking its catalytic domain were found only in the GH149 enzyme. Unexpectedly, the G6 complex structure revealed an oligosaccharide surface binding site remote from the catalytic site, which, we suggest, may be associated with substrate targeting.

Differences across hepatocellular health (cellular adenosine triphosphate/glutathione content), function (urea production/albumin secretion) and taurocholic acid transport (biliary clearance/excretion index) were compared using amiodarone and ciclosporin A as positive controls. Ambrisentan had the weakest potency in all six endpoints, while sitaxsentan, bosentan and CI-1034 had more potent effects on hepatobiliary transport than health/function endpoints. Normalization to clinical Cmax gave the following relative rank order of safety based on margins for each endpoint: ambrisentan ≥ CI-1034 ~ bosentan > sitaxsentan. These data suggested impaired hepatobiliary disposition might contribute to a more prominent role in liver injury associated within sensitive human populations exposed to these compounds than direct hepatocellular toxicity. Rat, dog and monkey MPCCs also showed greater sensitivity potential to disrupted hepatobiliary disposition compared with hepatocellular health/functional endpoints. Drug metabolism competency was exhibited across all species. In vivo, rats and dogs appear more resistant to transaminase elevations and/or histological evidence of liver injury caused by these mechanisms even at exceedingly high systemic exposures relative to sensitive humans. Rats and dogs are resistant to hepatobiliary toxicants due to physiological differences in bile composition/handling. Although traditional animal testing provides adequate safety coverage for advancement of novel pharmaceuticals into clinical trials, supplemental assays employing human MPCCs may strengthen weight-of-evidence predictions for sensitive human populations.

Twenty-one participants with different CYP4F2*3 polymorphisms were enrolled (8 for *1/*1, 7 for *1/*3, and 6 for *3/*3). All participants were treated twice daily for 5 days with 200 mg of ketoconazole or placebo. Finally, a single dose of 10 mg vitamin K1 was administered, plasma levels of vitamin K1 were measured, and its pharmacokinetics was assessed. Ketoconazole elevated the plasma levels of vitamin K1 and increased the average area under the concentration-time curve (AUCinf ) and peak concentration by 41% and 40%, respectively. CYP4F2*3 polymorphism also affected plasma levels of vitamin K1 and its pharmacokinetics in a gene dose-dependent manner. The average AUCinf value was 659.8 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*1/*1, 878.1 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*1/*3, and 1125.2 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*3/*3 (P = .010). This study revealed that ketoconazole and CYP4F2*3 polymorphism substantially increased the exposure of vitamin K1 in humans.

Mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) is an essential photorespiratory enzyme converting glycine to serine. SHMT1 regulation remains poorly understood although it could involve the phosphorylation of serine 31. Here we report the complementation of Arabidopsis thaliana shm1-1 by SHMT1 wild-type, phosphorylation mimetic (S31D) or non-phophorylatable (S31A) forms. All SHMT1 forms could almost fully complement the photorespiratory growth phenotype of shm1-1, however each transgenic line had only 50% of normal SHMT activity. In response to either a salt or drought stress, Compl-S31D lines showed a more severe growth deficiency compared to the other transgenic lines. This sensitivity to salt appeared to reflect reduced SHMT1-S31D protein amounts and a lower activity that impacted leaf metabolism leading to proline under-accumulation and over-accumulation of polyamines. The S31D mutation in SHMT1 also led to a reduction in salt-induced and ABA-induced stomatal closure. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of maintaining photorespiratory SHMT1 activity in salt and drought stress conditions and indicate that SHMT1 S31 phosphorylation could be involved in modulating SHMT1 protein stability.",Is Trimming the Fat Enough?

In Phelipanche ramosa, strigolactone-induced germination was shown to require one of the CYP707A proteins involved in abscisic acid catabolism. Here, germination and gene expression were analyzed to investigate the role of CYP707As in germination of both parasitic plants and Arabidopsis upon perception of germination stimulants, after using pharmacological inhibitors and Arabidopsis mutants disrupting germination signals. CYP707A genes were up-regulated upon treatment with effective germination stimulants in both parasitic plants and Arabidopsis. Obligate parasitic plants exhibited both an intensified up-regulation of CYP707A genes and increased sensitivity to the CYP707A inhibitor Abscinazole-E2B, while Arabidopsis cyp707a mutants still positively responded to germination stimulation. In Arabidopsis, CYP707A regulation required the canonical karrikin signaling pathway KAI2/MAX2/SMAX1 and the transcription factor WRKY33. Finally, CYP707As and WRKY33 also modulated Arabidopsis root architecture in response to the synthetic strigolactone rac-GR24, and wrky33-1 exhibited a shoot hyper-branched phenotype. This study suggests that the lack of host-independent germination in obligate parasites is associated with an exacerbated CYP707A induction, and that CYP707As and WRKY33 are new players involved in a variety of strigolactone/karrikin responses.",Rapid evolution in plant-microbe interactions - a molecular genomics perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134629,The New phytologist,2019 05 28,"Rapid (co-)evolution at multiple timescales is a hallmark of plant-microbe interactions. The mechanistic basis for the rapid evolution largely rests on the features of the genomes of the interacting partners involved. Here, we review recent insights in genomic characteristics and mechanisms that enable rapid evolution of both plants and phytopathogens. These comprise fresh insights in allelic series of matching pairs of resistance and avirulence genes, the generation of novel pathogen effectors, the recently recognized small RNA warfare, and genomic aspects of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In addition, we discuss the putative contributions of permissive host environments, transcriptional plasticity and the role of ploidy on the interactions. We conclude that the means underlying the rapid evolution of plant-microbe interactions are multifaceted and depend on the particular nature of each interaction.

In 2001, a representative national sample of 390 Danish eighth-graders (M = 13.95, SD = .37) completed validated self-report questionnaires. Polyvictimization was related to higher PTSS and psychiatric symptoms. Importantly, polyvictimization was significantly linked to high attachment anxiety, which was linked with low perceived social support, which in turn was linked with high PTSS levels and psychiatric symptoms. Polyvictimization might have dire consequences in early adolescence. An individual's high attachment anxiety might be connected with lack of perceived social support, which should be seen as a possible psychological distress mechanism subsequent to exposure to a number of potentially traumatic events.",Crude polysaccharide from a wild mushroom enhances immune response in murine macrophage cells by TLR/NF-κB pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134626,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2019 05 28,"Mushroom crude polysaccharides offer a complete package of various medicinal activities.

Influx of extracellular calcium (Ca2+ ) is one of the first phenomena that occur following axonal injury, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a target substrate for calcium ions, regulates the status of cytoskeletal proteins such as F-actin. Herein, we found that peripheral axotomy activates CaMKII in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, and inhibition of CaMKII impairs axon outgrowth in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS, respectively). Most importantly, we also found that the activation of CaMKII promotes PNS and CNS axon growth, and regulatory effects of CaMKII on axon growth occur via affecting the length of the F-actin. Thus, we believe our findings provide clear evidence that CaMKII is a critical modulator of mammalian axon regeneration.",A prospective review of perinatal mortality at Hospital Nacional Guido Valadares (HNGV).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134624,The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,2019 05 28,Timor-Leste has one of the highest perinatal mortality rates in the Asia-Pacific region.

A series of assays were used to figure out the functions of miR-27a and PLK2 in synovial angiogenesis and chondrocyte apoptosis in rats with KOA. Furthermore, the putative binding site between miR-27a and PLK2 was determined. Downregulated miR-27a was found in synovial tissues and cartilage tissues of KOA rats. Upregulated miR-27a and downregulated PLK2 inhibited synovial injury and promoted apoptosis of synovial cells, inhibited synovial angiogenesis, inhibited cartilage injury and chondrocyte apoptosis, inhibited cartilage collagen destruction, and alleviates inflammatory injury of synovial tissue and cartilage tissue in KOA rats. Overexpression of PLK2 reverses the effect of upregulation of miR-27a on synovial angiogenesis and chondrocyte injury in KOA rats.

Moreover, life-related stresses is causing caregivers to become fatigued and exhausted, with some even choosing to end their life due to their overwhelming burdens of care. Evidence demonstrates that failure to cope effectively with the burdens of care greatly increases the risk of personal physical, mental, and family problems for the caregivers. Therefore, caregiver burden is an increasingly important issue and challenge for the long-term care service system. Positive psychology has been studied widely in recent years, and current related research has focused on exploring caregivers' positive coping experiences. Empirical studies indicate that caregivers overcome crisis because they acquire coping strategies and learn to adjust during the caring process. Furthermore, these articles show the successful handling of caring stress to be highly correlated with resilience. This research examined caregiver's burden and resilience. The findings suggest how nurses may identify the potential of caregivers in the caring processing and what kind of support that nurses should provide to caregivers. Further, this study elaborates on how caregivers build resilience. According to the literature, current nursing interventions should enhance caregiver's resilience. In general, this research aimed to offer a new direction for long-term care based on positive energy and caregiver resilience.

Applying smart technologies such as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), big data, blockchains, and the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud calculation, and network management allows designers to access information on relational and adaptive environmental designs. Moreover, these technologies help us learn evolutionary computation information in order to provide advanced mechanisms. Models that help promote the implementation of smart neighborhoods and cities integrate smart technologies and IoT in order to improve air quality and living convenience and achieve living environments that are livable and healthy. This article primarily addresses the impacts of climate change on our living environment and how we may use green and smart buildings to ameliorate the effects of this change on daily life, promote the efficient use of water resources, and make living spaces significantly more environmentally friendly. In addition, we hope to apply the idea of smart IoT and big data analysis to design ""passive toughness adaptation"" and ""automatic sensing prevention"" into healthy living environments, which may facilitate our ability to handle the problems of super-ageing societies and to adapt to the diminishing birthrate.

DTI tractography was used to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) within the corpus callosum, fornix, cingulum bundles, perforant pathways, and uncinate fasciculi. Injury severity was indexed using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores obtained at the time of the injury. Verbal memory was measured by performance on the long-delay free recall (LDFR) trial of the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's version. Participants were between the ages of 10-18 and included 21 children with TBI (injured before age 9) and 19 typically-developing children (TDC). Children with TBI showed lower FA across all pathways and poorer LDFR performance relative to TDC. Within the TBI group, mediation analysis revealed neither a significant total effect of GCS on LDFR nor significant direct effects of GCS on LDFR across pathways; however, the indirect effects of GCS on LDFR through FA of the corpus callosum, left perforant pathway, and left uncinate fasciculus were significant and opposite in sign to their respective direct effects. These results suggests that the predictive validity of GCS for LDFR is initially suppressed by the substantial variance accounted for by FA, which is uncorrelated with GCS, and the predictive validity of GCS increases only when FA is considered, and the opposing path is controlled. These findings illustrate the complex associations between acute injury severity, white matter pathways, and verbal memory several years following pediatric TBI.",Resting-state functional hypoconnectivity of amygdala in clinical high risk state and first-episode schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134583,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 28,"Resting-state functional hypoconnectivity of the amygdala with several brain regions has been identified in patients with schizophrenia. However, little is known about it in individuals at clinical high risk state. Treatment-seeking, drug-naive young adults were recruited for the study. The participants included 33 adults at Clinical High Risk (CHRs), 31 adults with first-episode schizophrenia (FSZs), and 37 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls. All the participants were subjected to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Seed-based voxel-wise amygdala/whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) was calculated and compared. In the CHR group, the right amygdala showed decreased FC with clusters located in the left orbital, right temporal, insular, and bilateral frontal and cingulate areas. In the FSZ group, the right amygdala showed decreased FC with clusters located in the right temporal, insular, cingulate, and frontal areas. Exactly 30% of the voxels showing decreased FC in the FSZ group coincided with those in the CHR group. No difference in FC was identified between the CHR and FSZ groups. Voxel-wise FC values with the left or right amygdala in the bilateral occipital cortex were negatively correlated with the PANSS total score in the FSZ group. Resting-state functional hypoconnectivity of the amygdala is a valuable risk phenotype of schizophrenia, and its distribution, rather than degree, distinguishes CHR state from schizophrenia. This particular hypoconnectivity in CHRs and FSZs is relatively independent of the symptomatology and may reflect a dysfunctional dopamine system.",Neuroimaging gender dysphoria: a novel psychobiological model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134582,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 05 28,"Gender identity development is complex and involves several key processes. Transgender people experience incongruence between their biological and identified gender. This incongruence can cause significant impairment in overall functioning and lead to gender dysphoria (GD). The pathophysiology of GD is complex and is poorly understood. A PubMed search based on predetermined eligibility criteria was conducted to review neuropsychiatric articles focused on neurological, biological and neuroimaging aspects of gender development, transgender identity and GD. The information obtained from the literature was then used to formulize a GD model. Distinct gray matter volume and brain activation and connectivity differences were found in individuals with GD compared to controls, suggesting a neurobiological basis of GD; which leads to the concept of brain gender. Individuals with GD encounter a recurrent conflict between their brain gender and the societal feedback; which causes recurrent and ongoing cognitive dissonance, finally leading to GD and functional connectivity and activation changes in the transgender brain. GD has neurobiological basis, but it is closely associated with the individuals' interaction with the external world, their self-perception and the feedback received in return. We propose a novel model where the development of GD includes cognitive dissonance, involving anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum as the key brain structures. This model can be used to generate testable hypotheses using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand the neuropsychobiology of GD.",Biofilm characterization of Fusarium solani keratitis isolate: increased resistance to antifungals and UV light.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134579,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2019 06 10,"Fusarium solani has drawn phytopathogenic, biotechnological, and medical interest. In humans, it is associated with localized infections, such as onychomycosis and keratomycosis, as well as invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. One pathogenicity factor of filamentous fungi is biofilm formation. There is still only scarce information about the in vitro mechanism of the formation and composition of F. solani biofilm. In this work, we describe the biofilm formed by a clinical keratomycosis isolate in terms of its development, composition and susceptibility to different antifungals and ultraviolet light (UV) at different biofilm formation stages. We found five biofilm formation stages using scanning electron microscopy: adherence, germination, hyphal development, maturation, and cell detachment. Using epifluorescence microscopy with specific fluorochromes, it was elucidated that the extracellular matrix consists of carbohydrates, proteins, and extracellular DNA. Specific inhibitors for these molecules showed significant biofilm reductions. The antifungal susceptibility against natamycin, voriconazole, caspofungin, and amphotericin B was evaluated by metabolic activity and crystal violet assay, with the F. solani biofilm preformation to 24 h increased in resistance to natamycin, voriconazole, and caspofungin, while the biofilm preformation to 48 h increased in resistance to amphotericin B. The preformed biofilm at 24 h protected and reduced UV light mortality. F. solani isolate could produce a highly structured extra biofilm; its cellular matrix consists of carbohydrate polymers, proteins, and eDNA. Biofilm confers antifungal resistance and decreases its susceptibility to UV light. The fungal biofilm functions as a survival strategy against antifungals and environmental factors.",Genetic Selections with SICLOPPS Libraries: Toward the Identification of Novel Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors and Chemical Tools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134578,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 28,"Cyclic peptide libraries have successfully been employed for the identification of inhibitors of highly challenging targets. While several methodologies exist for the generation of cyclic peptide libraries, genetically encoded libraries hold several advantages over purely in vitro methods of library generation, including the ability to conduct cell-based functional screens and straightforward hit deconvolution.

Coupling to a custom-made in vitro translation system, namely the flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system, has unveiled the remarkable tolerance of the ribosome toward molecules, remote from what nature has selected to carry out its elaborate functions. Among the very diverse molecules and chemistries that have been ribosomally incorporated, a plethora of entities capable of mediating intramolecular cyclization have revolutionized the design and discovery of macrocyclic peptides. These macrocyclization reactions (which can be spontaneous, chemical, or enzymatic) have all served as tools for the discovery of peptides with natural-like structures and properties. Coupling of the FIT system and mRNA display techniques, known as the random non-standard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) system, has in turn allowed for the simultaneous screening of trillions of macrocyclic peptides against challenging biological targets. The macrocyclization methodologies are chosen depending on the structural and functional characteristics of the desired molecule. Thus, they can emanate from the peptide's N-terminus or its side chains, attributing flexibility or rigidity, or even result in the installation of fluorescent probes.",Peptide Display Technologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134576,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 28,"With an increased interest in the use of peptides as therapeutics comes the need for strategies to allow for the discovery of novel hit candidates, in high-throughput manners, from highly complex peptide libraries. Early development of peptide therapeutics arose from the deployment of natural peptides and subsequent modification to enhance medicinal properties.

Despite having rather poor drug-like properties, OT is used as a treatment for labor induction, postpartum hemorrhage, and lactation support. The potential use of OT in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases has recently renewed interest in the pharmacology of OT. Oxytocin is one of the most extensively studied cyclic peptides and since the elucidation of its structure in 1953 thousands of peptidic OT analogs with antagonistic and agonistic properties have been synthesized and biologically evaluated. Among them are atosiban, a mixed oxytocin receptor (OTR)/vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist used as a tocolytic agent approved (in certain countries), and carbetocin, a longer acting OTR agonist on the market for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Many other OT analogs with improved pharmacological properties (e.g., barusiban, Antag III) have been identified. These peptides have been tested in clinical trials and/or used as pharmacological tools.

To this end, a cross-sectional study was carried out in Tébessa, an Algerian eastern province, to, firstly, investigate the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep and, secondly, determine the potential risk factors that may be associated with seropositivity. A total of 376 serum samples from 39 flocks, collected between September 2015 and October 2017, were tested for anti-T.gondii antibodies via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA). A T. gondii seroprevalence of 35.37% (95% CI 30.54-40.21%) was recorded, and 84.61% (95% CI 73.29-95.94%) of the flocks sampled had, at least, one seropositive animal. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that abortion during the latest pregnancy (OR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.02-2.44; p = 0.05), presence of goats in sheep flocks (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 1.04-2.98; p = 0.037), and the sampling period were the variables significantly associated with seropositivity. The present study reports, for the first time in this part of Algeria, the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection and bears out the highly dissemination capacity of the parasite. This is of a great importance for veterinarians in charge of veterinary public health, veterinary practitioners, and breeders in order to improve the control and prophylactic measures of toxoplasmosis. Nevertheless, further study should be conducted to explore the impact of the parasite on public and animal health.","Molecular identification and detection of Wohlfahrtia magnifica in ovine vulvar myiasis in Gansu, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134557,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 28,"Traumatic myiasis causes substantial economic losses to farmers worldwide. In the present study, six flocks of sheep (2261 sheep) were investigated in Gansu, China, and 207 of 552 larvae were genetically characterized based on three genes, including cyt b, EF-1α, and white gene, by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. A survey of sheep in China revealed that the prevalence of vulvar myiasis of six sheep flocks was 5.00% (11/220, Flock1), 4.85% (10/206, Flock2), 4.50% (9/200, Flock3), 5.00% (15/300, Flock4), 4.68% (15/320, Flock5), 0% (0/1015, Flock6), respectively.

Therefore, the objective of this present study is to evaluate and compare the effect of dietary chitin and chitosan from cricket and shrimp on growth performance, carcass, and organ characteristics of broiler chickens. One hundred fifty-day-old male Cobb500 broiler chicks of similar average weight were randomly allotted into one of the five dietary treatments with three replicates. Treatment 1 (T1) chicks were fed basal diet only (control), treatment 2 and 3 (T2 and T3) chicks were given basal diet with 0.5 g/kg diet of cricket chitin and cricket chitosan, respectively, while treatment 4 and 5 (T4 and T5) chicks were served basal diet with 0.5 g/kg diet of shrimp chitin and shrimp chitosan respectively. No significant variation occurred between cricket chitin and shrimp chitin, although data on growth performance were higher in cricket chitin, but growth performance varied significantly between cricket chitosan and shrimp chitosan. This study revealed that cricket chitin at 0.5 g/kg significantly improved growth performance, carcass quality, and organ characteristics of broilers more than chitosan. Birds fed basal diet alone, although gained more weight, also accumulated more fat having the poorest feed conversion ratio (FCR) and the highest mortality. However, carcass of birds fed cricket chitin was the leanest and thus economically beneficial as they consumed the least amount of feed with the best FCR.","Effects of dietary ramie level on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, and meat quality of Boer goats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134555,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 28,"This study was conducted to evaluate the use of ramie as forage on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, and meat quality of Boer goats. For this, 60 Boer lambs were divided into four groups fed the TMR with 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40% (control, and groups I, II, III, respectively) ramie. The experiment lasted for 90 days with a pretest for 15 days. Venous blood and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle samples were collected after 24 h fasted at the end of the experiment. The results showed that ramie seems no significant changes in average daily gain (ADG) and other parameters for growth performance, only 40% ramie in TMR significantly reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI) (P < 0.05). Compared to the control, group II (20%) showed significant increases in total protein (TP) and globulin (GLB) levels, and decreases in albumin/globulin level (P < 0.05) in serum. Meanwhile, serum total cholesterol (TC) (P < 0.05) and free thyroxine (FT4) level were significantly reduced with up to 20% or more ramie in TMR. Moreover, the total amino acid and flavor amino acid levels in LD muscle were not affected by ramie. However, significant increases (P < 0.05) were observed in linoleic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid levels in group II. Overall, these results indicated that up to 20% ramie in TMR have no impairment in growth performance, health and meat quality, whereas high level ramie might have a negative effect on feed intake.",Tropical milk production systems and milk quality: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134554,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 28,"We reviewed information on dairy cattle production systems in the tropics, the factors involved, and their influence on milk composition. Genetic factors had greater influence on milk production; specialized breeds produced more milk, and there was an inverse relation between the content of fat, protein, total solids, and the amount of milk produced. Season was related to the availability of forage, and the type of grazing system. Greater pasture area increased individual production, while a greater supply of feed concentrate did not increase milk production. The number of calvings positively affected milk production through the fifth calving, with subsequent declines in production. Milk production increased to a maximum and then declined as lactation progressed. Specialized systems had higher production and better hygienic milk quality; milking and container equipment are critical for maintaining milk sanitary quality. Factor interaction is highly complex, preventing the generation of specific recommendations and general principles applicable to the specific conditions for each system.",Maternal Nutritional and Water Homeostasis as a Presage of Fetal Birth Weight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134553,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 28,"Birth weight is a key determinant of perinatal outcomes which affect physical development and metabolic function. In this study, we evaluated the potential role of maternal body composition and nutritional status in programing fetal birth weight. This was a longitudinal study that included 29 pregnant women and their full-term newborns. Maternal dietary energy and fluid intake and body adipose tissue were assessed. In addition, we measured the serum content of copeptin, aldosterone, and angiotensin II in maternal and umbilical cord blood. The measurements were done across the three trimesters of pregnancy, on average, at 11.6 weeks, 18.3 weeks, and 30.2 weeks. Each newborn's birth weight was determined at the percentile line, using the World Health Organization (WHO) standards based on the gestational age, gender, and weight. We found no appreciable relation of fetal birth weight to the maternal dietary and fluid intakes, and the content of angiotensin II, aldosterone, or copeptin. However, birth weight correlated with increases in body adipose tissue in early pregnancy stages. Further, birth weight correlated positively with copeptin and adversely with angiotensin II in cord blood. We conclude that the present findings may be helpful in the assessment of a critical level of body adipose tissue in women of child-bearing age, above which the potential risk of macrosomia appears. The female population of child-bearing age needs a continual update on the nutritional knowledge to prevent modifiable maternal and fetal perinatal complications.",Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma Reduces Healing Time of Chronic Venous Leg Ulcers: A Prospective Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134552,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 28,"The study investigated whether the application of dressings with autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) would reduce the healing time in patients with chronic venous leg ulcers. This is a prospective observational study that included 100 patients diagnosed with lower extremity venous insufficiency complicated by ulceration of a leg or foot, who had been after angioplasty of stenotic artery. Patients were divided into two groups of 50 each: treated with PRP (study group) and treated with conventional hydrocolloid dressings (control group). We followed the wound changes at Day 10, Day 20, and Day 30 of treatment and compared them with the baseline appearance at Day 0. We evaluated the appearance, area, and depths of wounds with ultrasound. The granulation process was examined histologically to document skin formation and wound tissue neovascularization. The findings were that treatment with PRP dressings resulted in a significant progressive reduction in ulcer size, irrespective of the ulcer's initial size, compared to treatment with conventional dressings. Further, the best effect of PRP was noticed in the category of largest wounds. After a month of treatment with PRP dressings, more than 50% of all ulcers were completely healed. The young epidermis appeared together with the granulation tissue, and the formation of dermis took shape after 20 days of treatment. We conclude that the use of PRP dressings is a safe, nonsurgical adjunctive procedure for treating chronic venous leg ulcers. The potential benefit of PRP dressings over conventional ulcer treatment requires further in-depth exploration.",Development and evaluation of emulsifiable concentrate formulation containing Sophora alopecuroides L. extract for the novel management of Asian citrus psyllid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134551,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 28,"Utilization of non-host plants semiochemicals to mediate insect behavior offers a promising opportunity for novel management of insect pests in field crops and fruits. Therefore, there is still a substantial opportunity for the development of natural prophylactic as an eco-friendly approach in the novel pest management programs. Sophora alopecuroides extract has been used as a natural pesticide in the control of agricultural and household pests, but the low persistence effect and rapid biodegradability limit its use on a wider scale in pest management programs. In this study, an emulsifiable concentrate formulation containing S. alopecuroides extract (SAE-EC) was developed with a simple procedure and evaluated for its ovicidal, antifeedant, and repellent effects against Diaphorina citri under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Our results indicated that SAE-EC at 15, 30, and 50 mg/mL concentrations provide complete protection against psyllids for a period of 96 h after application both under laboratory and semi-field conditions, while the aqueous methanolic extract of S. alopecuroides loses its persistence 48 h after application. Furthermore, the emulsifiable concentrate at 20 and 30 mg/mL concentrations, only 15.97% and 31.97% of eggs were able to hatch, and at similar concentrations, 72.86% and 85.5% of honeydew secretion were reduced as compared to the control. SAE-EC at 30 mg/mL concentration has not shown any phytotoxic symptoms on Murraya paniculata seedlings. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study revealed the presence of alkaloids in emulsifiable concentrate after 3 months of its preparation placed under ambient temperature. Furthermore, the particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of the emulsifiable concentrate were also confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Our finding indicated that emulsifiable concentrate formulation prolongs the persistence of S. alopecuroides extract and enhances its efficacy both under laboratory and semi-field conditions. It has been concluded that the emulsifiable concentrate formulation containing S. alopecuroides extract might be developed as an eco-friendly novel prophylactic against citrus psyllid.",Molecular mechanism for the discrepant inhibition of microcystins on protein phosphatase 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134550,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 28,"Due to variable amino acid residues at positions 2 and 4, microcystins (MCs) had diversified variants with different toxicities. To evaluate the discrepant toxicity, the inhibition effects of five typical MC variants (with the changed amino acid residues at position 4) target to PP1 were evaluated. The inhibition sequence was verified as follows: MCLR (IC50 = 2.6 μg/L) > MCLF (IC50 = 4.4 μg/L) > MCLA (IC50 = 5.5 μg/L) > MCLY (IC50 = 7.9 μg/L) > MCLW (IC50 = 13.6 μg/L). To further clarify the inhibition mechanism for variant toxicity, the interactions between MCs and PP1 were evaluated with the assistance of MOE molecule simulation. Results show the hydrophobic interaction (Adda5 with PP1) and the hydrogen bonds (especially for Z4 → Glu275) were positively correlated with MC toxicity, while the hydrogen bonds (Leu2 ← Arg96, IsoAsp3 ← Arg96, and IsoAsp3 ← Tyr134) and the ion bonds (between Mn2+ and His173/Asn124/Asp92) were negatively correlated with toxicity. However, the hydrogen bonds (Ala1 → Glu275, Mdha7 ← Gly274, Z4 ← Arg221, and Adda5 ← His125), the covalent combination (between Mdha7 and Cys273), and the ion bonds (between Mn2+ and His248/Asp64/His66) were weakly correlated with toxicity. By further analysis, the steric hindrance and hydrophobicity introduced by different Z4 residues affected the changes for combination area and energy of MC-PP1 complexes, leading to the discrepancies in MC toxicity.",Cadmium immobilization and alleviation of its toxicity for soybean grown in a clay loam contaminated soil using sugarcane bagasse-derived biochar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134549,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 28,"Incorporation of organic amendments is one of the most eco-friendly and economic strategies for the restoration of contaminated soils through diminishing mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in these soils. This study was carried out under field conditions during the summer season of 2017 on a clay loam soil naturally polluted with Cd (7.61 mg kg-1) due to successive irrigations with wastewater. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of sugarcane bagasse-derived biochar (SBDB) at different rates on fractionation of Cd in soil and its implications on the growth of soybean and concentrations of Cd within the different plant parts. Incorporation of SBDB into the chosen contaminated soil caused noticeable changes in soil pH, electrical conductivity and organic matter, especially with increasing the rate of application. Immobilization of Cd in the used soil was highly influenced by soil properties. According to the sequential extraction procedure, application of SBDB had an efficient role in reducing the soluble/exchangeable fraction. Moreover, it declined both the reducible and oxidizable forms of Cd. The dry weight of soybean organs (roots, seeds, and straw) improved significantly with SBDB additions. The highest dry weight values of straw and seeds for soybean plants were recorded when the soil was treated with SBDB at rates of 15 and 30 t ha-1. Concentrations of Cd in straw and seeds of soybean were markedly affected by its availability in the soil. They decreased from 2.77, 0.96, and 0.62 mg kg-1 at the control treatment (CK) to 1.75, 0.47, and 0.20 mg kg-1 at B4 treatment (30 t SBDB) ha-1 in roots, straw, and seeds of soybean, respectively. In conclusion, the use of SBDB showed high efficiency in the amelioration of Cd-polluted soils and in decreasing Cd toxicity on soybean plants."
