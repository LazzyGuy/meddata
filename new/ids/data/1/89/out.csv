The accumulation of NGR-MSNPs in C6 cells was shown to be higher than that of unmodified MSNPs. Anticancer drugs can cause autophagy in tumor cells, whereas autophagy inhibitors can block this reaction and enhance the therapeutic effect of the drugs. In this study, we demonstrated that MSNP-TMZ-PDA-NGR had stronger autophagy- and apoptosis-inducing effects in C6 cells than TMZ alone, and its anticancer effect was further enhanced when combined with autophagy inhibition. These results demonstrate that the combination of targeting vehicles and autophagy inhibitors may have research value in the treatment of gliomas.",Prion dimer is heterogenous and is modulated by multiple negative and positive motifs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600179,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 12,"The conversion of the normal prion protein (PrP) into a scrapie prion (PrPSc) is incompletely understood. Theoretically, the smallest PrP aggregate is a dimer. Human PrP contains two cysteines at positions 179 (C179) and 214 (C214) enabling disulfide bonding. Here, we report that our recombinant human PrP (r-hPrP) preparations contain 0.2-0.8% dimer, which is linked by either one or two disulfide bonds, connected by C179-C179, C214-C214, or C179-C214. Furthermore, dimerization is regulated by multiple motifs. While residues 36-42 inhibit, residues 90-125, and 195-212 promote dimerization. Mutating individual residue between 36 and 42 enhances dimerization whereas mutating the positively charged residues within 95-115, or the negatively charged residues within 195-212 prevent dimerization. Although deletion of the entire octapeptide-repeat (5OR) region prevents dimerization, mutating the histidines within the 5OR enhances dimerization. In addition, we found that two out of three brain lysates from patients with inherited prion disease had more PrP dimers than controls. Thus, PrP dimerization may contribute to prion diseases.",Evaluation of changes in retinal and choroidal thickness using spectral domain optical coherence tomography in unilateral non granulomatous acute anterior uveitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600178,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,2019 02 12,To assess retinal and choroidal thickness changes in eyes with a first episode of unilateral non granulomatous acute anterior uveitis (AU).,Psychiatric comorbidities go untreated in patients with epilepsy: Ignorance or denial?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600177,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 01 02,"Psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients with epilepsy (PWE).

The information derived gave impact to human biomechanical assessment on body balance and ergonomics posture during gait. Various experiments designed at generating foot pressure data returns only with limited knowledge generated. Obviously, the procedure for experiment design needs to be properly understood from the foot morphology aspects; healthiness, footwear, surface in contact, load and forces impacts, and the foot sensitivity as well as the specification for the foot pressure. This paper reviews the proper preliminary experimental setups for foot pressure measurement analysis during static or dynamic gait. The strength and limitations of recent devices used and considerable variables are also discussed. The overall review explains that the comfortable natural gait in relation to the aspects of sensitivity, load, time duration, and stability are the standard considerations for plantar pressure experiments.",Preclinical biomechanical testing models for the tibiotalar joint and its replacements: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600154,Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 01 02,"In recent years, total ankle replacements have gained increasing popularity as an alternative to fusion. Preclinical testing of TARs requires reliable in vitro models which, in turn, need thorough knowledge of the kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. Surprisingly few studies have been published to simulate the in vivo kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. Among these studies, there is a wide range of methods and magnitudes of applied loads. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the applied loads, positions that were tested during static simulations, and ranges of motion simulated that have been used in human cadaveric models of the tibiotalar joint. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for studies pertaining to cadaveric tibiotalar joint kinematics. Our search yielded 12 appropriate articles that were included in the systematic review. While it is well known that loads at the tibiotalar joint are frequently as high as 5 times bodyweight [1], these studies reported applied loads varying from 200N-750N, below average bodyweight. Three studies used dynamic loading of custom apparatuses to drive cadaver limbs along predetermined paths to simulate gait. Conversely, the other nine studies applied static loads (∼300N), performed at discreet points during the stance phase, considerably lower than physiological conditions. The present systematic review calls for an urgent need to establish a consensus for preclinical evaluation of TARs for biomechanical function.",[Effectiveness of a Decalogue for cardiovascular prevention in diabetics].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600153,Semergen,2019 03 22,"To assess the effects of a visual Decalogue aid on the degree of knowledge, control perception and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF).",Characterization and antioxidant activity of an acidic exopolysaccharide from Lactobacillus plantarum JLAU103.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600152,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 05 21,"An acidic exopolysaccharide (EPS) designated as EPS103 was isolated, purified and characterized from Lactobacillus plantarum JLAU103. EPS103 had a relatively lower molecular weight of 12.4 KDa and was consisted of arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, mannose, fructose, galactose, and glucose in an approximate molar ratio of 4.05: 6.04: 6.29: 5.22: 1.47: 5.21: 2.24: 1.83. A specific spectrogram of acidic polysaccharide was obtained by FT-IR analysis, and both α- and β-type configurations were presented in EPS103 based on the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Microstructural analysis of EPS103 demonstrated a smooth and glittering cube structure, and presence of many homogeneous rod-shaped lumps. Comprehensive study of in vitro antioxidant activity indicated that EPS103 possess strong scavenging abilities against hydroxyl, ABTS, and DPPH radicals with the maximum of 80.4%, 65.5%, and 60.5%, respectively, at 10 mg/mL concentration.

CVMs are particularly prevalent when the developing fetus is exposed to high levels of phenylalanine in-utero in mothers with Phenylketonuria. Yet, elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism leading to CVMs has proven difficult. In this study we used RNA-Seq to investigate an avian model of MPKU and establish differential gene expression (DEG) characteristics of the early developmental stages HH10, 12, and 14. In total, we identified 633 significantly differentially expressed genes across stages HH10, 12, and 14. As expected, functional annotation of significant DEGs identified associations seen in clinical phenotypes of MPKU including CVMs, congenital heart defects, craniofacial anomalies, central nervous system defects, and growth anomalies. Additionally, there was an overrepresentation of genes involved in cardiac muscle contraction, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, migration, proliferation, metabolism, and cell survival. Strikingly, we identified significant changes in expression with multiple genes involved in Retinoic Acid (RA) metabolism and downstream targets. Using qRTPCR, we validated these findings and identified a total of 42 genes within the RA pathway that are differentially expressed. Here, we report the first elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular malformations in MPKU conducted at early developmental timepoints. We provide evidence suggesting a link between PHE exposure and the alteration of RA pathway. These results are promising and offer novel findings associated with congenital heart defects in MPKU.",The association between anti-tumor potency and structure-activity of protein-kinases inhibitors based on quinazoline molecular skeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600149,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 01 20,"Quinazoline was originally utilized as an anti-tumor treatment, and its various derivatives can be directly extracted from plants. In recent years, protein kinases (PK) have been well recognized in the development of tumor drugs. Functionally, PK serves a vital role in the apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, migration and cell cycle of tumor cells. Due to its good physicochemical properties, quinazoline skeleton, a superior type of PK inhibitor, has been extensively used in anti-tumor drug design. An increasing number of studies on quinazoline synthesis have been reported and used by different groups to effectively develop novel derivatives. Thus, several studies have been approved for the use of quinazoline derivatives as inhibitors of other kinases, including Src and histone deacetylase. The aim of the present review was to summarize the mechanism of quinazoline compounds as PK inhibitors, their biological structure-activity relationship such as the substituted quinazoline compounds with different functional groups in the apoptotic process, and their effect on the proliferation of tumor cells. The development of novel agents based on the antitumor functions of quinazoline molecular compounds may improve the clinical outcomes of the affected population, particularly in patients with cancer.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-aryl-4-indolyl-maleimides as potent mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600148,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 02 01,"A series of 3-aryl-4-indolylmaleimide IDH1/R132H inhibitors with a novel structure was obtained by high-throughput screening and structure-based optimization.

Evaluation of the biological activities and function at cellular level showed that compounds 7h, 7i and 7k could effectively suppress the production of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid in U87MG cells expressing IDH1/R132H. Additionally, 7h could reversed the differentiation block of the myeloid leukemic cell line, TF-1, caused by the overexpression of IDH1/R132H.

People with T1DM have a 2-6-fold higher risk of epilepsy than the general population. The onset of T1DM anticipates the onset of epilepsy by a mean period between 1,5 and 2,8 years. These two disorders share four potential distinct pathogenic factors: a) genetic predisposition; b) factors involved in autoimmune responses (i.e. anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies-GADAbs); c) effects of hypo/hyperglycaemia; d) cerebrovascular damages resulting in ischaemic processes. Seizures semiology prominently includes focal (up to patterns of epilepsia partialis continua) or secondarily generalized seizures but also reflex seizures and various forms of generalized seizures. EEG abnormalities are more common in people with an inappropriate metabolic control with a prominent involvement of fronto-temporal regions. Epilepsy management does not differ between patients with and without diabetes and insulin, nutritional recommendations and physical activity may also produce significant benefits on seizures control.

Thirty-seven malignant tumors (MTs), 12 burned out tumors (BOTs), 28 Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), 2 dermoid cysts and other benign lesions were included. MTs + BOTs exhibited more microliths and macrocalcifications compared with benign lesions (p < 10-4). LCTs manifested mostly a dominant peripheral vascularization pattern compared with other lesions. MTs + BOTs were stiffer compared with benign lesions (p < 2 × 10-4) but with a moderate area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 80%. By focusing on LCTs versus MTs + BOTs, diagnostic performance led to an AUROC of 89% for the best stiffness parameter.

The emission through multi-element phased arrays has been the most widely accepted method to improve focusing in recent years; however, the number and size of transducers represent a bottleneck that limits the focusing accuracy of the technique. To overcome this limitation, a new disruptive technology, based on 3-D-printed acoustic lenses, has recently been proposed. As the submillimeter precision of the latest generation of 3-D printers has been proven to overcome the spatial limitations of phased arrays, a new challenge is to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations required to design this type of ultrasound lens. In the study described here, we evaluated two improvements in the numerical model applied in previous works for the design of 3-D-printed lenses: (i) allowing the propagation of shear waves in the skull by means of its simulation as an isotropic solid and (ii) introduction of absorption into the set of equations that describes the dynamics of the wave in both fluid and solid media. The results obtained in the numerical simulations are evidence that the inclusion of both s-waves and absorption significantly improves focusing.",Epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries in Iraq: A burn hospital-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600127,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2019 05 13,"This study was conducted to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of burn injuries, estimate the case fatality rate for burn patients, and determine the main determinants of the associated death among burn patients who were admitted to Baghdad Burn Hospital, Medical City Teaching Hospitals, Baghdad, Iraq during 2015.

Between January 2012 and December 2016, 17 children (7 boys and 10 girls, mean (range) age 7 (4-12) years) were treated. Preoperatively, the mean (range) maximal incisal opening was 1.4 (0-5) mm. Distraction osteogenesis was used to elongate the mandibular body or ramus, or both, after the release of ankylosis. Distraction began after five to seven days at a rate of 0.5mm twice daily, and the distractor was removed three to five months after the completion of distraction. The mean (range) follow-up time after removal was 29.6 (16-45) months, and the distance of distraction was 14.4 (10-18) mm.

The pathophysiology of severe OHSS includes a humorally mediated capillary leak syndrome that is predominantly centered on the intra-abdominal space. Severe OHSS is frequently complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI), which can be due to any of a variety of mechanisms, each requiring a different management strategy. Mechanisms of AKI in severe OHSS include intravascular volume depletion, kidney edema due to capillary leak, intra-abdominal hypertension or compartment syndrome, and obstructive uropathy due to ovarian enlargement. We present a teaching case of severe OHSS complicated by AKI in a woman with underlying stage 4 chronic kidney disease. She had been undergoing IVF with plans to subsequently use a gestational carrier (surrogate) for pregnancy. We use this case to review the presentation and pathophysiology of OHSS complicated by AKI. In addition, we review the management of AKI in OHSS, in particular, the role of paracentesis and/or culdocentesis to manage tense ascites. Last, we highlight that similar cases may occur more frequently in the future given that IVF with subsequent use of a gestational carrier is increasingly being used for patients with comorbid conditions that can be exacerbated by pregnancy, such as advanced chronic kidney disease.",Addressing the Need for Clinical Trial End Points in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Report From the Polycystic Kidney Disease Outcomes Consortium (PKDOC).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600104,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2019 03 25,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease. Expansion of multiple cysts throughout both kidneys is thought to lead to progressive loss of kidney function and kidney failure in some patients. In recent years, much has been learned about the pathophysiology of ADPKD. However, to date, only one therapy has been approved in the United States and in other regions for the treatment of ADPKD. Feasible end points and a clear regulatory pathway may stimulate further development in this area and ultimately lead to more treatments for ADPKD successfully reaching the market. In July 2016, the PKD Outcomes Consortium under the auspices of the Critical Path Institute and the PKD Foundation convened a PKD Summit to facilitate a discussion among patients, regulators, pharmaceutical sponsors, and academic clinical trialists regarding trial end points and the regulatory path to approval of new drugs for ADPKD. Following the summit, participants continued the dialogue using regularly scheduled teleconferences.

To protect our groundwater resources we need to understand the degradation processes under anaerobic conditions. Available iron and manganese oxides are used as electron acceptors for anaerobic degradation and are reduced to the dissolved form of metallic cations in pore water. To monitor this process is a challenge, because anaerobic conditions are difficult to sample directly without introducing oxygen. A few studies have shown an impact of iron reduction on spectral induced polarisation (SIP) signature, often associated with bacterial growth. Our objective is to study the impact of iron and manganese oxide dissolution, caused by degradation of an organic compound, with spectral induced polarisation signatures. Twenty-six vertical columns (30 cm high, inner diameter 4.6 cm) were filled with a sand rich in oxides (manganese and iron) with a static water table in the middle. In half of the columns, a 2 cm high contaminated layer was installed just above the water table. As the contaminant degrades, the initial oxygen is consumed and anaerobic conditions form Every three days over a period of one month, spectral induced polarisation (twenty frequencies between 5mHz and 10 kHz) data were collected on six columns: three contaminated replicates and three control replicates. Chemical analysis was done on twenty columns assigned for destructive water sampling, ten contaminated columns and ten control. The results show an increase of the real conductivity associated with the degradation processes, independent of frequency. Compared with the pore water electrical conductivity in the saturated zone, the real conductivity measurement revealed the formation of surface conductivity before iron was released in the pore water. In parallel, we also observed an evolution of the imaginary conductivity in both saturated and unsaturated zones at frequencies below 1 Hz. Overall, the anaerobic reduction of iron and manganese oxide during the organic degradation increased both the conductive and polarisation component of the complex conductivity.",Hospital volume and outcome in rectal cancer patients; results of a population-based study in the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600101,European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2019 04 17,"Clinically staged T1-3 rectal cancer (cT1-3) is generally treated by total mesorectal excision(TME) with or without neoadjuvant therapy and sometimes requires beyond TME-surgery, whereas cT4 rectal cancer often requires both.

To test the role of catecholamines, major end-point SNS mediators, in this dimorphism, influence of propranolol (β-adrenoceptor blocker) on mitogen/neuroantigen-stimulated CD4+ T cells from female and male EAE rat draining lymph node (dLN) cell cultures was examined. Male rat dLNs exhibited higher noradrenaline concentration and frequency of β2-adrenoceptor-expressing CD4+ T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Propranolol, irrespective of exogenous noradrenaline presence, more prominently augmented IL-2 production and proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in male than female rat dLN cell cultures. In neuroantigen-stimulated dLN cells of both sexes propranolol increased IL-1β and IL-23/p19 expression and IL-17+ CD4+ cell frequency, but enhanced IL-17 production only in male rat CD4+ lymphocytes, thereby abrogating sexual dimorphism in IL-17 concentration observed in propranolol-free cultures. Thus, β-adrenoceptor-mediated signalling may contribute to sex bias in rat IL-17-producing cell secretory capacity.","Association between the intestinal microbiota and allergic sensitization, eczema, and asthma: A systematic review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600099,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 02 09,"The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in development of the immune system and regulation of immune responses. This review summarizes the association between the intestinal microbiota and the development of allergic sensitization, eczema, and asthma in neonates and children. Overall, a greater relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae and a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae is associated with the development of allergic sensitization, eczema, or asthma. Reduced bacterial diversity can be associated with the development of allergic disease. The association between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the development of allergic disease or asthma is less consistent in older children than in neonates, suggesting that early-life microbial exposure plays a more important role. Inconsistencies in the results reported from different studies might partly be explained by heterogeneity in design, study populations, diagnostic criteria, microbiota analysis methods, and reporting on different taxonomic levels. Larger studies that better account for antenatal and postnatal factors will further help determine specific microbial intestinal signatures associated with increased risk of allergy and asthma. This will enable the early identification of infants at high risk and facilitate novel strategies and interventions to prevent and treat these conditions, including modifying the intestinal microbiota early in life.",Hip joint muscle forces during gait in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome are associated with patient reported outcomes and cartilage composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600097,Journal of biomechanics,2019 03 29,"Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) consists of abnormal hip joint morphology and pain during activities of daily living. Abnormal gait mechanics and potentially abnormal muscle forces within FAI patients leads to articular cartilage damage. Therefore, there is a necessity to understand the effects of FAI on hip joint muscle forces during gait and the link between muscle forces, patient reported outcomes (PRO) and articular cartilage health. The purposes of this study were to assess: (1) hip muscle forces between FAI patients and healthy controls and (2) the associations between hip muscle forces with PRO and cartilage composition (T1ρ/T2 mapping) within FAI patients. Musculoskeletal simulations were used to estimate peak muscle forces during the stance phase of gait in 24 FAI patients and 24 healthy controls. Compared to controls, FAI patients ambulated with lower vasti (30% body-weight, p = 0.01) and higher sartorius (4.0% body-weight, p < 0.01) forces. Within FAI patients, lower peak gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, sartorius and iliopsoas forces were associated with worse hip joint pain and function (R = 0.43-0.70, p = 0-0.04), while lower muscle forces were associated with increased T1ρ and T2 values (i.e. altered cartilage composition) within the hip joint cartilage (R = -0.44 to -0.58, p = 0.006-0.05). Although FAI patients demonstrate abnormal muscle forces, it is unknown whether or not these altered muscle force patterns are associated with pain avoidance or weak musculature. Further investigation is required in order to better understand the effects of FAI on hip joint muscle forces and the associations with hip joint cartilage degeneration."

GM oxidation in aqueous solutions causes a viscosity increase, resulting in structured and stable hydrogels. Upon lyophilization, water-insoluble aerogels are obtained, capable of water uptake up to several times their own weight. The materials derived from the three gums have been analyzed and compared. Chemical modifications have been studied by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Polymer structure has been determined by liquid-state and semi-quantitative solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and chemical stability by incubation under variable conditions of pH, ionic strength and solvent nature. The results show that hydrogel formation is due to oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups to carbonyl and carboxyl groups and subsequent formation of hemiacetal and ester bonds. Fenugreek displays the highest stability, compared to guar and sesbania rehydrated aerogels. This feature could be interpreted by its higher degree of substitution (Gal:Man = 1:1) and consequently higher amount of galactose primary alcohols, leading to more extensive crosslinking.",Sulfated polysaccharide JCS1S2 inhibits angiogenesis via targeting VEGFR2/VEGF and blocking VEGFR2/Erk/VEGF signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600033,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 09,"More and more evidences suggested that sulfated natural glycans had impact on angiogenesis.

The degree of substitution of this sulfated polysaccharide was 1.74 and its molecular weight was 56.2 kDa. We provided evidences that JCS1S2 could disrupt angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. This sulfated polysaccharide inhibited migration and tube formation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) whereas showed no effect on the cells proliferation.

To do so, 5 μm-sized cellulose micro-beads (CμBs) were first surface-functionalized by trimellitic anhydride to introduce carboxylate ligands before decorating them with Cu2+ ions by complexation of the carboxylate groups with a CuCl2 solution. The Cu2+-loaded CμBs, dispersed in an aqueous phase, were organized in compact monolayer at the vicinity of a planar electrode. The release of cupric ions and subsequent copper deposition were triggered by an electric field delivered by a tension generator. 2D non-close-packing arrays of copper dots assemblies displaying hexagonal symmetry were generated below or around the micro-beads - depending on the ions concentration in the aqueous phase - leading respectively to copper dots deposited circularly or concentrated in rings.

The layer-by-layer technique used in the film's preparation associated with the behaviour at different pH allowed to explore separately each interaction - polysaccharide-polysaccharide and polysaccharide-ions. The entanglement between polysaccharides, the interaction of the oppositely charged polysaccharides ionic groups (amine for chitosan and carboxylate for xanthan) and the interaction with Ca2+ ions confers a pH-responsive behaviour to the films. The mineralization with in situ hydroxyapatite formation resulted in an additional stability in the mineral phase.

In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed enhanced stability and integrity of OPPC micelles in mice gastrointestine. Furthermore, cellular uptake studies revealed effective transport and accumulation of OPPC micelles loading PTX or rhodamine-123 into Caco-2 cells via clathrin/cavelin-mediated endocytosis and OPPC-mediated P-gp inhibition.

Results presented ester absorbance of the treated fabrics strongly increased in the presence of the homemade l-glutamate salt, a mixture of l-glutamic acid (LGA) and NaOH at a specific ratio. Importantly, anti-wrinkle properties of the treated fabrics were significantly improved. Based on the relative concentration calculation, l-glutamate promoted the reaction of BTCA with cellulose by accelerating the formation of BTCA anhydrides and the esterification of anhydrides with cellulose. Besides, the improved anti-wrinkle property was partially attributed to the fact that the generated LGA reacted with cellulose and formed ionic cross-linking networks through amino groups with carboxyl groups in BTCA, which was confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectra and the computational calculations. Through detailed comparisons, l-glutamate catalyzed fabrics showed as good durability as sodium hypophosphite, indicating a possible alternative for phosphorus-containing catalysts.",Electrospinning in water and in situ crosslinking of hyaluronic acid / cyclodextrin nanofibers: Towards wound dressing with controlled drug release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600010,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 09,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is widely investigated due to its high potential for wound dressing applications. The fabrication of biomimetic HA-based scaffolds by electrospinning is thus extensively studied. However, HA is often dissolved in toxic organic solvents to allow the efficient production of electrospun nanofibers. Indeed, although HA is soluble in water, its ionic nature leading to long-range electrostatic interactions and the presence of counter ions induce a dramatic increase of the viscosity of aqueous HA solutions without insuring enough chain entanglements necessary for a stable and efficient electrospinning. In this study, biocompatible insoluble HA-based nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning in pure water. To this end, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was added as a carrier polymer and it was found that the addition of hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin (HPβCD) stabilized the process of electrospinning and led to the efficient formation of uniform nanofibrous scaffolds. An in situ crosslinking process of the scaffolds is also proposed, insuring a whole fabrication process without any toxicity. Furthermore, the beneficial presence of HPβCD in the HA-based scaffolds paves the way for wound dressing applications with controlled drug encapsulation-release properties. As a proof of concept, naproxen (NAP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was chosen as a model drug. NAP was impregnated into the scaffolds either in aqueous solution or under supercritical CO2. The resulting functional scaffolds showed a regular drug release profile along several days without losing the fibrous structure. This study proposes a simple approach to form stable HA-based nanofibrous scaffolds embedding HPβCD using water as the only solvent, enabling the development of safe functional wound dressings.",Duffy binding-like 1α adhesin from Plasmodium falciparum recognizes ABH histo-blood group saccharide in a type specific manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600009,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 08,"The ability of erythrocytes, infected by Plasmodium falciparum, to adhere to endothelial cells (cytoadherence) and to capture uninfected erythrocyte (rosetting) is the leading cause of death by severe malaria.

The results showed a similar microfibril arrangement decreasing the DA, except for the chitosan sample. The mechanical properties showed an increase of the maximum strain and a reduction of the maximum stress and Young's modulus, decreasing the DA. These changes, not linear with the DA, were related to structural changes at molecular structure level. The knowledge deriving from this study is of interest both for the understanding of the mechanical properties of chitinous biological samples, but also for the design and synthesis of new biomacromolecular materials.",Structural characteristics and hepatoprotective potential of Aralia elata root bark polysaccharides and their effects on SCFAs produced by intestinal flora metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600007,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 08,"The structural characteristics of the polysaccharides from Aralia elata root barks (AERP) were systematically investigated by FT-IR, HPSEC-ELSD and colorimetric methods as well as by GCMS based monosaccharide compositions, Smith degradations, and methylation analysis. The result showed average molecular weights of AERP were between 42.7 kDa and 93.9 kDa. AERP was composed of Ara, Rha, GlcA, Man, Glc, and Gal in a molar ratio of 22.2: 10.3: 8.1: 32.7: 5.7: 21.2 along with a small number of sulfate (3.38%) and acetyl (4.87%) groups. The abundant glycosidic linkages of Man, Ara, Gal, and Rha were observed as more than 90% of all the monosaccharides detected. Studies to evaluate hepatoprotective potentials of AERP showed that they had potent hepatoprotective effects in vivo in carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury (CIALI) in mice by histopathological evaluation, biochemical examinations and ELISA assays. GCMS was further used to determine the effects of AERP on the chemical profiles of nine common short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by intestinal flora metabolism in CIALI mice. These findings not only provide novel insights into the pharmacological actions of AERP on the protection from CIALI in mice, but they also demonstrate that determining SCFA profiles by targeted GC-MS metabolomics is an effective technique to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the effects of plant polysaccharides on intestinal flora metabolism.","Ultralight, hydrophobic, monolithic konjac glucomannan-silica composite aerogel with thermal insulation and mechanical properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600006,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 08,"Konjac glucomannan (KGM) aerogel was prepared by a facile freeze-drying process, which was used as green sustainable biopolymer matrix to synthesis three-dimensional (3D) network interpenetrated KGM-SiO2 aerogel with thermal insulation performance and high mechanical properties. Herein, we explored that the potential structure-performance relationship of KGM aerogel between the physical parameters, morphology and thermal insulation. Besides, the preparation conditions of KGM aerogel including concentration of KGM, Na2CO3-to-KGM mass ratio were investigated. Meanwhile, the KGM aerogel and KGM-SiO2 aerogel were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, thermogravimetric analysis and contact angle test. Results showed that the as-prepared KGM aerogel exhibited excellent thermal insulation performance (λ = 0.021 W m-1 K-1) and low bulk density (ρ = 0.030 g cm-3) when concentration of KGM was 2 wt% and Na2CO3-to-KGM mass ratio of 0.12. In order to improve the mechanical properties and high hydrophobicity of biopolymer aerogel, a novel of KGM-SiO2 aerogel was successful fabricated by incorporating methylsilsesquioxane (MTES) derived SiO2 into the KGM matrix via the freeze-drying method. The obtained aerogel exhibited remarkable compressive strength (δmax = 1.65 MPa at 80% strain), high specific surface area of 416.1 m2 g-1, high hydrophobicity (θ = 146° for water) and low thermal conductivity of 0.032-0.039 W m-1 K-1. Thus, the high-performance KGM-SiO2 aerogel would be further expand the thermal insulation application in sustainable development and energy-saving building.",Controlled graft polymerization on the surface of filter paper via enzyme-initiated RAFT polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600005,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 09,"This study reports on eco-friendly graft polymerization approach for the modification of a cellulosic material via combination between enzymatic catalysis and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT). Polyacrylamide (PAM) was polymerized on a cellulosic filter paper via horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-initiated RAFT polymerization. The results of grafting ratio, conversion, and pseudo-first-order kinetics were proved that the PAM graft polymerization on the filter paper followed RAFT rules. The results of Attenuated total reflection (ATR-FTIR), elemental analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of PAM in PAM-grafted filter paper. The results of water contact angle and Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) evidenced the change in the wetting properties and thermal performance, respectively of the treated filter paper.

The human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) may affect breast-fed infants both locally and systemically. In the present study, HMOs were separated, characterized and investigated for the immunomodulatory effects on RAW264.7 macrophages and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results revealed that HMO-7, one of the neutral HMOs fractions can significantly induce the production of nitric oxide (NO) and PGE2 via up-regulating nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression. Additionally, HMO-7 was found to stimulate the release of ROS, TNF-α and cytokines including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 in RAW264.7 macrophages. Further study showed that macrophage activated by HMO-7 involved in nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.

GOS was able to stimulate the release of nitric oxide (NO), cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and improve the phagocytic rate of peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. It further enhanced immunoglobulins (Ig) release (IgG by 50.6%-74.7%, IgA by 31.3%-34.9%, IgM by 28.3%-66.7%), splenic lymphocyte proliferation (by 74.8%-91.3%), nature killer cells cytotoxicity (by 32.0%-49.6%), immunophenotypes of splenic lymphocytes (from 1.7 to 2.4, 2.2 and 2.7) in immunosuppressed mice. Compared with curdlan, higher immunostimulatory activity of GOS was found in CTX-treated mice. Moreover, GOS could activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and complement receptor 3 (CR3). These results indicated that GOS may be a favorable candidate of functional food in regulating immune responses.",DFT study of the influence of acetyl groups of cellulose acetate on its intrinsic birefringence and wavelength dependence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599992,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 08,"The effect of the acetyl groups of cellulose acetate (CA) on its intrinsic birefringence and its wavelength dependence was investigated using density functional theory (DFT). Seven types of CA repeating-unit models that differ in their degree of substitution (DS) and substitution sites were used in the calculations. The results suggested that the intrinsic birefringence (Δn°) and its wavelength dependence significantly depended on the conformations of the acetyl group at C6. Additionally, the intrinsic birefringence of CA films was estimated as the ensemble average of the calculated Δn° values of the conformers. The increase in the DS of CA led to a more negative intrinsic birefringence and a larger wavelength dependence. The computational results were in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results and suggested that conformational variety and/or its control would be important factors for the design of optical films containing CA.",Solid-state NMR method for the quantification of cellulose and polyester in textile blends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599991,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 30,The valorization of cellulose rich textile waste is promoted by the development of a novel solid-state NMR method for the quantification of cellulose and polyester in textile blends. We applied 13C CP-MAS NMR as a tool for the quantification and structural characterization of cellulose in cotton polyester blends. Gaussian functions were used to integrate the spectra obtained from a set of calibration standards in order to calculate a sigmoidal calibration curve. Acid hydrolysis was chosen as a reference method. The results demonstrated that solid-state NMR enables a reliable determination of cellulose and polyester in both preconsumer and postconsumer waste textiles and suggests a possible extension of the concept to blends of man-made cellulose fibers (MMCFs) and polyester.,"A comprehensive review of techniques for natural fibers as reinforcement in composites: Preparation, processing and characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599990,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 08,"Designing environmentally friendly materials from natural resources represents a great challenge in the last decade. However, the lack of fundamental knowledge in the processing of the raw materials to fabricate the composites structure is still a major challenge for potential applications. Natural fibers extracted from plants are receiving more attention from researchers, scientists and academics due to their use in polymer composites and also their environmentally friendly nature and sustainability. The natural fiber features depend on the preparation and processing of the fibers. Natural plant fibers are extracted either by mechanical retting, dew retting and/or water retting processes. The natural fibers characteristics could be improved by suitable chemicals and surface treatments. This survey proposes a detailed review of the different types of retting processes, chemical and surface treatments and characterization techniques for natural fibers. We summarize major findings from the literature and the treatment effects on the properties of the natural fibers are being highlighted.",Bio-based thin films of cellulose nanofibrils and magnetite for potential application in green electronics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599989,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 30,"The objective of this work was to prepare bio-based thin films and evaluate the additions of magnetite and glycerol on the physico-chemical (flexibility, wettability and barrier properties) and dielectric properties of cellulose/chitosan-based films. The films were prepared by solution casting and presented a suitable dispersion of the constituents observed by SEM and FTIR. The films were thermally stable up to 150 °C and had a higher flexibility, wettability and lower barrier properties upon addition of glycerol. The calculated dielectric constant (εr) for the composite films was based on measurements of capacitance, at 100 and 1000 Hz, with the additions of magnetite and glycerol more than doubling the εr increasing the charge storage capacity. The bio-based thin films have potential to be used as insulators in capacitors on the production of green electronics thus, reducing toxic and nonrenewable e-waste generation.",Tailor-made material characteristics of bacterial cellulose for drug delivery applications in dentistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599988,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 30,"Bacterial cellulose (BC) has shown high potential as innovative wound dressing and drug delivery system. Bringing both together, drug-loaded BC was investigated for applications in dental therapies such as dental extraction or mucosal transplantation. Both applications would benefit from a material which degrades under physiological conditions, and from an antibiotic environment. Consequently, periodate-oxidation of BC was investigated to facilitate modified degradation behaviour. A periodate concentration of 0.14 mol/L at ϑ = 25 °C and t = 8 h resulted in a material loss of <10%, but at the same time a sufficient degree of degradation. Additionally, native and oxidised BC loaded with doxycycline was tested for prophylaxis against infection. An in vitro-toxicity test (MTT assay) provided a first confirmation of biocompatibility, whereas agar diffusion tests proved antibiotic efficiency against pathogenic oral bacteria. Release studies of the drug from native and oxidised BC confirmed a comparative biphasic release behaviour.",Survival and stability of Lactobacillus fermentum and Wickerhamomyces anomalus strains upon lyophilisation with different cryoprotectant agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599986,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"The stability of microorganisms along the time is important for allowing their industrial use as starter agents, improving fermentation processes. This study aimed to evaluate the survival and maintenance of the cell viability of the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus fermentum IAL 4541 and the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus IAL 4533, both isolated from wheat sourdough, after lyophilisation with different cryoprotectant and storage at room temperature along a year. Treatments involved adding control solution (S1 = 0.1% peptone water), and four cryoprotectant solutions S2 (10% sucrose), S3 (5% trehalose), S4 (10% skim milk powder) and S5 (10% skim milk powder plus 5% sodium glutamate) to the microbial cells previously of freeze drying processing. To verify the effect of lyophilisation on the number of microbial cells recovered, microbiological analyses were performed and cell viability was calculated before and after lyophilisation and regularly during a storage period of 365 days at room temperature. Viability after freeze-drying was influenced by the cryoprotectant agent employed, as well the microbial stability conferred along the storage. Differences on the microorganism response to some protectors were observed between the lactic acid bacteria and the yeast evaluated. W. anomalus was more affected by absence of cryoprotectant (S1) during freeze drying processing, but this microorganism was more stable than L. fermentum along the storage without the presence of protectant agents. For L. fermentum, S5 was the best protectant, allowing the recovering of 100% of the bacterial cells after lyophilisation and 87% of cell viability was observed after one year storage, followed by S4 (96 and 74%, respectively). S4 and S5 were the best protectant to W. anomalus (viability >80% after 1 year), but no increase in the yeast cell viability was conferred by addition of glutamate (S5) to skim milk. After 1 year of storage, trehalose was much more effective on protection of the yeast than bacteria (72% and 7% of viability, respectively). S2 was the less protectant agent among the tested, and their effectiveness was higher in L. fermentum (allowing 14% of cell recovering up to 120 days of storage) if compared to W. anomalus (25% of viability until 90 days of storage). Our results demonstrate that freeze-drying is a realistic technology for the stability and maintenance of the potential sourdough starter L. fermentum and W. anomalus for long time; however, the choice of cryoprotectant will influence the process effectiveness.",Between food delicacies and food taboos: A structural equation model to assess Western students' acceptance of Amazonian insect food.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599985,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Interest in commercializing insect-based foods is growing steadily. Nevertheless, most Western consumers still consider insects a food taboo. In this study, we investigated how persuasion strategies based on technology and social communication can intervene to reduce aversion towards the practice of eating a tropical insect from the Ecuadorian Amazon. We used a research design based on ethnoentomological information to place the insect-based food in its cultural context. The study is based on an online survey of 125 students from an international university based in a cross-border region of the Italian Alps. We used a covariance-based structural equation model to test the influence of the 6-item version of the Food Neophobia Scale and of the aforementioned persuasion strategies on stated willingness to consume insects. Results show that food neophobia negatively affects persuasion strategies but that the latter do have a positive influence on stated consumption intention. Additionally, the model shows that the negative effect of Food Neophobia Scale on the willingness to consume insects is fully mediated by persuasion strategies. Our findings are in line with previous studies which indicate that peers' recommendations on the safety and palatability of edible insects, as well as the practice of disguising them in familiar food, increase the stated willingness to consume them. Moreover, the importance of the commercial context where the insects are sold is a driver of entomophagous practices. Finally, our study suggests that the introduction of contextual cultural information about insects as a food source may help to preclude a priori false assumptions regarding entomophagy. This is also one of the aims of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 on insects as novel food which recently came into force. We discuss the implications of the findings for both scholars and practitioners.",Impact of pH on the high-pressure inactivation of microbial transglutaminase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599984,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Microbial transglutaminase (MTG) is an enzyme largely used in the food industry, mainly to improve food texture. However, many globular proteins show low susceptibility to the action of this enzyme. High-pressure processing (HPP), being able to change protein conformation, may be a useful tool to increase the accessibility of globular proteins to the action of MTG. Nevertheless, HPP conditions need to be carefully optimized to avoid the expected decrease of enzymatic activity observed above certain conditions of pressure (P), treatment time (t) or temperature (T). Pressure inactivation of MTG under different HPP conditions (200-600 MPa; 20-40 °C; 10-30 min) was evaluated employing a face-centered composite design at four different pH values (4-7). The regression models obtained presented high coefficients of determination and high F values, although they could not explain some of the associated variability. At all the pH values tested, the three main factors (P, T, and t) significantly (p < 0.05) affected the activity of MTG. At least 20% of MTG was inactivated when low pressures (200 MPa) were used at pH 4 and 5, whereas a higher pressure above 400 MPa was needed to obtain a similar inactivation at pH 6 or 7. MTG pressure-inactivation followed first-order kinetics under all tested conditions. Inactivation rate constants decreased with increasing pressure at constant temperature and pH 4, with a positive activation volume (Va), while the opposite was verified for the other pH values. Both activation energy (Ea) and Va were dependent on pH, however, at the lower pH values, Ea and Va did not vary significantly with pressure and temperature, respectively. Overall, MTG can be considered relatively resistant to pressure, particularly near its optimal pH.",Characterization of dried and freeze-dried sea fennel (Crithmum maritimum L.) samples with headspace gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry and evaluation of an electronic nose discrimination potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599983,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Processed samples (air-dried @ 40 and @ 60 °C and freeze-dried) of sea fennel (Crithmum maritimum L.), an autochthonous spice with interesting market potential, were analyzed by headspace gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry and classification capabilities of an electronic nose in discriminating between samples with stepwise forward statistics were evaluated as well. Freeze-drying process was the most preservative in terms of limiting darkening without compromising appearance of the final product, providing weight loss of about 85% and water activity below the limit for mold growth issues. Headspace analysis of samples highlighted the presence of 35 volatiles grouped as terpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated terpenes, sesquiterpen hydrocarbons, phenyl propanoids, not-terpenic aldehydes and not-terpenic ketones. Correlations emerged between selected sensors and some detected volatile organic compounds. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis and simple K-nearest neighbors obtained a 100% overall correct classification rate in cross-validation of the electronic nose in classifying samples, whereas stepwise quadratic discriminant analysis and Naive-Bayes gave 93.3%. The sea fennel could be a new interesting spice to launch in the food market and the electronic nose showed the potential to be used in monitoring the industrial process aimed at extending its shelf-life."

A phytochemical investigation on these plants revealed a similar triterpenoid profile and a content of ursolic acid (0.7-1%) and amyrin esters (up to 0.5%), quite unusual for dietary plants. The major constituent of the amyrin complex from both plants is α-amyrin palmitate (2a), accompanied by lower amounts of its corresponding palmitoleate (2b) and by the corresponding constitutional isomers from the β-series (3a and 3b, respectively). Ursolic acid (1) was identified as the responsible for the activity of maté and guayusa extracts in the activation of TGR5, a nuclear receptor of relevance for the prevention and management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome because of its involvement in the regulation of energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity.","Nutraceutical compounds: Echinoids, flavonoids, xanthones and caffeine identified and quantitated in the leaves of Coffea arabica trees from three regions of Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599970,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"There are relatively few studies concerning the use of coffee leaves for medicinal purposes and the composition of secondary plant substances. Therefore, we identified and quantitated polyphenolic compounds along with caffeine present in methanol extracts of Coffea arabica leaves from three different regions of Brazil (Ceará, Minas Gerais and São Paulo) by HPLC-ESI-MS. In addition, correlations between polyphenolic content of the coffee leaves and antioxidant assays DPPH, FRAP and ORAC were evaluated. Fifteen compounds belonging to three classes of polyphenols (xanthones, chlorogenic acids and flavonoids) along with the alkaloid caffeine were detected. The mean concentration of total polyphenolic compounds in the leaves of C. arabica, harvested from three different regions of Brazil was quite variable. The highest values were detected in the coffee leaves harvested in Minas Gerais (n = 4) at 40.80(13.00) g/kg (SD), followed by coffee leaves harvested in São Paulo (n = 20) at 24.79(20.19) g/kg, and the lowest in coffee leaves harvested in Ceará (n = 11) in the Northeast of Brazil at 10.30(5.61) g/kg. The three classes of polyphenols, all showed excellent correlations in the antioxidant assays. Coffee leaf tea, appears to be an excellent functional beverage, with its high content of polyphenolic compounds, which may render positive biologic effects, when inbibed as part of the normal human diet.",Animal-based food taboos during pregnancy and the postpartum period of Southeast Asian women - A review of literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599968,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"This paper gives an overview of the various taboos on animal products and the reasons behind such practices among women in the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while they are pregnant, during their postpartum period, and while breastfeeding. Three data search engines, Google® Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, were used one after the other, to generate the papers for this review. The online searches using the term food taboo, its synonyms, and truncations, in combination with the terms pregnancy, postpartum, and breastfeeding, and with the country name, were conducted from January to February 2017. In total, 28 papers were pooled and included in this review. The taboos and the justification for avoidance were collated and grouped per their occurrence, and according to the country where they are practiced. Nine papers provided information on the food taboos during pregnancy, 16 on postpartum food taboos, and six on breastfeeding. The food taboos included various river or seafood, meat from terrestrial animals, and derived products like fish paste, blood and internal organs. Healthcare providers should be aware of the food taboos being adhered to in the region to provide the right information and guidance to the women practicing them. There is a need to educate the public in general, and women, in particular, about the risk of malnutrition when food taboos are followed, and to support their nutritional requirements during pregnancy and the postpartum period by promoting dietary diversification. More research could be conducted to fill in the gap in information with regards to the food taboos and their impact in some of the ASEAN members.

In this study, we performed enzymatic hydrolysis of flaxseed proteins using trypsin under HHP (100 and 300 MPa for 5 and 10 min) to evaluate the effect of presurization on protein denaturation, degree of hydrolysis (DH), and peptide profile and bioactivity of hydrolysate. Spectrofluorimetric analyses showed that 300 MPa induced the maximum destablization of flaxseed protein structures. The same pressure level drastically improved the DH by 1.7 times as compared to that of control. Applying HHP did not modify the peptide profiles of flaxseed protein hydrolysates but their concentrations increased with severity of treatment. Similarly, peptide molecular weight distributions were affected by pressurization parameters, increasing mainly the relative abundance of 500-1500 Da peptides. Finally, pressurization at 300 MPa for 5 and 10 min improved the antioxidant activity of flaxseed protein hydrolysates by 39 and 55%, respectively, compared to the control.",Recovery of phenolic compounds from the by-products of yellow mustard protein isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599965,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Nanofiltration (NF) (MWCO 150-300 Da) was evaluated for the recovery of phenolic compounds from the wastewater from the production of yellow mustard protein isolates.

At low pH, 77% of the phenolic compounds fed to the process were recovered in the retentate. Combination of diafiltration (DF) with NF was beneficial only when processing at low pH. The permeate from the NF process a contained <100 ppm total phenolics, which suggests the possibility of recycling these effluents in the production of yellow mustard protein isolates. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the major phenolic compound found both in the waste effluent and in the products of NF processing. Sinapic acid constituted a secondary fraction, and derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol were also detected.",May the superfruit red guava and its processing waste be a potential ingredient in functional foods?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599964,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Guava (Psidium guajava L.), a popular fruit in tropical countries, can be consumed in natura or transformed into many products.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the phytochemical composition (total phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols, and condensed tannins), phenolic profile, and antioxidant activity (DPPH, modified DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP) of guava's pulp and waste extracts (GPE and GWE) obtained from guava's pulp and waste powders (GPP and GWP). The extraction was performed using a probe-type ultrasound for 2 min at 25 °C, using ethanol:water (30:70, v/v) as the solvent (15 mL for 1 g of sample). The phenolic profile of guava's powders and extracts was performed by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. GPE showed the highest concentration of total phenolics (2348.3 mg GAE 100 g-1 by Folin-Ciocalteu and 518.00 mg GAE 100 g-1 by Prussian Blue), and the greater in vitro antioxidant activity among all the assays tested. On the other hand, GWE was found to hold a higher amount of flavonoids (1006.08 mg QE 100 g-1), flavonols (352.59 mg QE 100 g-1), and condensed tannins (1466.9 mg g-1). Overall, 37 phenolic compounds were identified among all the samples, with 14 compounds being reported for the first time for red guava. Ellagic acid was the major phenolic present in all samples. The results showed that guava's pulp and waste are a rich source of phenolics compounds and may be used as an ingredient for the development of functional foods.",Correlating emulsion properties to microencapsulation efficacy and nutrients retention in mixed proteins system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599963,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"This study investigated six different combinations of proteins as emulsifiers and wall materials in a pilot scale. The potential correlations among formulations, emulsion properties, and microencapsulation stabilities were studied using principal component analysis (PCA). Dairy proteins (milk protein concentrate or sodium caseinate) dominate the overall properties when they are mixed with vegetable proteins (soy protein isolate and pea protein isolate). The presence of sodium caseinate (NaCas) in the formula is positively correlated with higher Vitamin A retention (P < 0.001), which could be associated with its excellent emulsifying properties and molecular flexibility. An improvement in Vitamin A retention of up to 13.93% was found with NaCas samples as compared to milk protein concentrate (MPC) samples. Pea protein isolate (PPI) samples showed significantly higher thermal stability by preventing droplet coalescence. Droplet sizes of all samples increased significantly after thermal treatment. However, only 54% size evolution was found with PPI samples, while the percentages of size increase using other protein blends were ranging from 95 to 150%. The formulas containing PPI show good oxidative stability after 180 days of accelerated temperature storage, which could attribute to its anti-oxidative properties that helped retain the stability of core materials. NaCas showed promising synergistic effects with PPI. The protein combinations of NaCas + PPI has a smaller droplet size and better emulsion thermal stability of liquid emulsion which resulted in the best microencapsulation efficiency (ME%) at 96.08% and highest nutrient retention of powder microcapsule. Overall, this combination is featured as a better wall material.",Cross-cultural effects of food product familiarity on sensory acceptability and non-invasive physiological responses of consumers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599962,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"This research evaluated the effects of product familiarity on the sensory acceptability and physiological responses of consumers toward different food stimuli using two populations (Asian vs. Western). Two studies were conducted: (1) an online questionnaire and (2) a tasting session. For (1), n = 102 (60% Asians and 40% Westerners) evaluated 31 food items visually for familiarity and liking whereas for (2), participants (n = 60; 48% Asians and 52% Westerners) evaluated 10 different foods (tortoise jelly, chili slices, beef jerky, dried tofu, Vegemite®, durian cake, octopus chips, chocolate, corn chips, and wasabi coated peas) by tasting for familiarity and liking (visual/aroma/taste/texture/overall). A novel Android® app (Bio-sensory App) was used to capture sensory and non-invasive physiological responses (temperature, heart rate and facial expressions) of consumers. In (1), Asian and Western participants differed in their familiarity scores, visual liking ratings, and the selection of emotion terms for the stimuli. In (2), cultural differences affected familiarity and the liking scores of appearance, aroma, taste and texture of the products. While food stimuli marginally affected the physiological responses of consumers for both cultures, Asian participants elicited higher temperature values compared to those of Westerners. Both studies (1 and 2) showed that familiarity of food products was positively associated to sensory liking for both cultural groups. These findings are useful to understand consumers acceptability based on both sensory and physiological responses.",Pharmacological and polyphenolic profiles of Phyllanthus phillyreifolius var. commersonii Müll. Arg: An unexplored endemic species from Mauritius.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599961,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Phyllanthus phillyreifolius var. commersonii Müll. Arg is an endemic plant of Mauritius. To date, no study has been performed concerning its polyphenolic profile and pharmacological properties. In this study, a decoction (water), ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the aerial parts of P. phillyreifolius, obtained from different extraction procedures (maceration and Soxhlet), were studied for antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and enzyme inhibitory properties along with their polyphenolic profile. The ethyl acetate macerated extract showed high antibacterial activity against B. cereus (MIC = 0.293 mg/mL) and E. coli (MIC = 0.417 mg/mL) while S. epidermidis was most susceptible to the ethyl acetate-Soxhlet extract (MIC = 0.521 mg/mL). The methanol-Soxhlet extract displayed the most potent cupric and ferric reducing power, and metal chelating effect, while the macerated methanolic extract was the most effective DPPH and ABTS scavenger, and BChE inhibitor. Only the ethyl acetate-Soxhlet extract exhibited α-glucosidase inhibition. All extracts exhibited a strong anti-tyrosinase activity, which was further investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamic. After 48 h exposure to the extracts for HeLa cell lines, the ethyl acetate-Soxhlet extract showed the highest inhibition (IC50 = 533.1 μg/mL) while the decoction extract was more cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 337.4 μg/mL). Treatment of cancer cell lines with all P. phillyreifolius extracts resulted in a time-dependent reduction of cell viability for HeLa and dose-and time-dependent reduction for MDA-MB-231. Gene expression ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was higher for all Soxhlet-extracts. Total phenolics (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) content were highest in the decoction and methanol-Soxhlet extract, respectively (122.43 mg GAE/g extract and 31.28 mg RE/g extract, respectively). The extracts were abundant in ellagitannins, although phenolic acids and flavonoids were also detected. Granatin B was detected for the first time in Phyllanthus species. Overall, the aerial parts of P. phillyreifolius exemplify a potent reservoir of bioactive phytochemicals for therapeutic applications.","An integrated metagenomic/metaproteomic investigation of microbiota in dajiang-meju, a traditional fermented soybean product in Northeast China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599960,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Dajiang-meju have been used as major ingredients for the preparation of traditional spontaneously fermented soybean paste in Northeast China. In this work, we sequenced and analyzed the metagenome of 12 dajiang-meju samples. To complement the metagenome analysis, we analyzed the taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbiota by metaproteomics (LC-MS/MS). The analysis of metagenomic data revealed that the communities were primarily dominated by Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Citrobacter and Leclercia. Moreover, changes in the functional levels were monitored, and metaproteomic analysis revealed that most of the proteins were mainly expressed by members of Rhizopus, Penicillium and Geotrichum. The number of sequences allocated to fungi in the fermentation process decreased, whereas the number of sequences assigned to bacteria increased with time of fermentation. In addition, functional metagenomic profiling indicated that a series of sequences related to carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism were enriched. Additionally, enzymes associated with glycolysis metabolic pathways were presumed to contribute to the generation of flavor in dajiang-meju. Proteins from different dajiang-meju samples involved in global and overview maps, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism and energy metabolism were differentially expressed. This information improves the understanding of microbial metabolic patterns with respect to the metaproteomes of dajiang-meju and provides a powerful tool for studying the fermentation process of soybean products."

Four criteria for such segmentations are discussed (theoretical support for the segmentation base, cross-cultural relevance of the segmentation base, cross-cultural validity of the measurement instrument, validation by measures of responses to marketing parameters). Three dominant approaches are identified in the literature: segmentation by importance of product benefits, by means-end chains, and by food-related lifestyles.

The cultural variety in culinary practices across countries raises the question of how flavor combinations are built and how they transcend individual differences in consumers' preferences. For example, in Latin America, despite having similar cultures and language, the diversity in culinary practices leads to different flavor combinations across nations. Therefore, we hypothesize that each country will show different preferences in flavor combinations that could be understood by social media exploration as an innovative approach. One study was conducted exploring social media in four countries (Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico) on a one-year basis, using a list of fifty-seven keywords associated with beer flavors. In a first analysis, the list of mentions from consumers was categorized in frequencies of flavors per country and analyzed using correspondence analysis (CA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). Results showed that the countries could be clustered in three groups. Cluster 1 with Mexico and Peru, and the rest of the countries in different clusters. The co-occurrence of paired flavors in social media was used to build a similarity matrix that was analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) in order to find a pattern of pairing per country. The obtained map was useful to understand the cultural differences in flavor paring per country. Overall, the analysis of flavor pairing through social media was an effective technique to access the structure of flavor pairing for beer in different countries.",A cross-cultural perspective on feeling good in the context of foods and beverages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599944,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"The aim of the present research was to explore consumers' conceptualization of feeling good in relation to food and beverages from a cross-cultural perspective. Participants from 14 countries across 5 continents and covering 10 languages (N = 8325) responded to an online survey including word association and free listing tasks related to feeling good in the context of food and beverages. Results were analyzed using inductive coding: a list of main codes was generated in English for each of the tasks, after which native speakers for each language coded the responses. Codes were grouped into categories reflecting common themes from which eight dimensions were identified. Results showed that in the context of foods and beverages, feeling good was mainly associated with specific foods and sensory and hedonic properties. Across the 14 countries, 'Sweet and fat food', 'Fruit and vegetables', and 'Protein food' were the three food categories most associated with feeling good. Emotional aspects of food consumption ('Taste good' and emotions) were also relevant. Health and nutrition-related aspects were more relevant for consumers when they were asked to think about how foods and beverages would make them feel good in the future. In other words, food-related feeling good seems to be mainly driven by sensory pleasure at present, but it is also related to nutrition and health in the future. Differences in the strength of the associations between feeling good and the identified categories were found between countries, in line with the existence of cultural differences in food habits, as well as in the importance people attach to the characteristics of foods and beverages. Results from the present work provide insights on the impact of eating and drinking on feeling good in terms of emotional, physical and social aspects, and increase knowledge about the way food and drink can contribute to general well-being.",Identification of angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory peptides derived from oilseed proteins using two integrated bioinformatic approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599943,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) play critical roles in the development of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Inhibiting ACE and DPP-IV activity using peptides has become part of new therapeutic strategies for supporting medicinal treatment of both diseases. In this study, oilseed proteins, including soybean, flaxseed, rapeseed, sunflower and sesame are evaluated for the possibility of generating ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides using different integrated bioinformatic approaches (UniProt knowledgebase, ProtParam, BLAST, BIOPEP, PeptideRanker, Pepsite2 and ToxinPred), and three bovine proteins (β-lactoglobulin, β-casein and κ-casein) as comparisons. Compared with bovine proteins, the potency indices of ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, calculated using the BIOPEP database, suggest that oilseed proteins may be considered as good precursors of ACE inhibitory peptides but generate a relative lower yield of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides following subtilisin, pepsin (pH = 1.3) or pepsin (pH > 2) hydrolysis. Average scores aligned using PeptideRanker confirmed oilseed proteins as significant potential sources of bioactive peptides: over 105 peptides scored over 0.8. Pepsite2 predicted that these peptides would largely bind via Gln281, His353, Lys511, His513, Tyr520 and Tyr523 of ACE to inhibit the enzyme, while Trp629 would be the predominant binding site of peptides in reducing DPP-IV activity. All peptides were capable of inhibiting ACE and DPP-IV whilst 65 of these 105 peptides are not currently recorded in BIOPEP database. In conclusion, our in silico study demonstrates that oilseed proteins could be considered as good precursors of ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides as well as so far unexplored peptides that potentially have roles in ACE and DPP-IV inhibition and beyond.",An innovative green extraction and re-use strategy to valorize food supplement by-products: Castanea sativa bud preparations as case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599942,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"This research takes place in the context of an Alcotra Italy-France trans-frontier project called FINNOVER, which includes among its objectives the ""green"" innovation of agro-industrial chains. Bud-derivatives are a category of natural products produced macerating meristematic tissues of trees and plants. They are quite expensive compared to other botanicals, since the collection period of their raw materials is extremely limited over the time. Pulsed Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction has been employed to extract further valuable material from the buds by-products remaining after the production of Castanea sativa Glyceric Macerates. UV-Visible spectra coupled with chemometrics were employed, as untargeted phytochemical fingerprints, to quickly screen the best experimental conditions of extraction: a duty cycle of 80%, an extraction time of 15 min and a solvent/ratio of 1/10. Targeted phytochemical fingerprints by HPLC have been used to identify and quantify the main bioactive compounds of the most promising marcs extract comparing it with the corresponding commercial Castanea sativa Glyceric Macerate. An innovative extraction and re-use strategy to obtain value-added products from botanicals by-products was developed in alternative to incineration or composting.

All samples were packaged in polypropylene trays sealed with a high barrier film and stored at 2-4 °C for 12 days. The quality and the freshness of sardine fillets packed in MAP were evaluated by microbiological, physical and chemical analyses after 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 12 days of the storage period. The 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values for MAP samples were lower compared to air samples, reaching a final value of 1.09 mg malonaldehyde (MA)/kg and 3.39 mg MA/kg, respectively. The samples packed in Ar reached the fixed threshold for total mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria after 12 days of storage, resulting the best MAP condition adopted, able to increase the sardine shelf-life of 3 days with respect to the other tested conditions. Air packed samples showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) Hx content (50 mg/kg) compared to the rest of the MAP samples (20 mg/kg). At the end of the storage period, the sample packed in Ar showed a significantly lower value (p < 0.05) (around 40 mg/kg), than the other MAP conditions.","Effect of the solar drying process on the sensory and chemical quality of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) cultivated in Antioquia, Colombia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599940,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"The quality of Theobroma cacao L. is influenced by different variables both in the crop and in the processes of postharvest, the latter it includes the fermentation and the drying, fundamental for the formation of aroma and flavor precursors, determinants in the characteristics of quality and differentiation of cocoa in the chocolate industry. The objective of the present research was to evaluate the effect of the solar drying process using a plastic roof solar dryer on the sensory and chemical quality of a mixture of cocoa cultivated in a region of Antioquia, Colombia. The content of total polyphenols, anthocyanins, sugars, mannitol, pH, total acidity, humidity, ethereal extract, ash, crude fiber and odor and flavor descriptors were analyzed. For analyzing the data, we used the methodology of longitudinal data analysis and repeated measurements, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a principal factor analysis. The analyzed sensory characteristics are statistically different over time (p < 0.05). There was a decrease in the content of anthocyanins, total polyphenols and sucrose, and an increase in glucose and fructose during fermentation and drying. The analysis of factors allowed to define a series of groupings as indexes of quality according to the chemical and sensory properties analyzed in the drying process. Overall, the mixture of cocoa clones evaluated in the solar drying process presented indicators of sensory and chemical quality associated with descriptions of odor (spicy, dairy, nut, fruity, sweet cane), flavor (floral and spicy), ethereal extract, and pH that indicate a good benefit of cocoa and show the potential that Colombia has as a producer of fine aroma cocoa in high demand in premium markets.",Contribution of cross-cultural studies to understanding wine appreciation: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599939,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"People from different cultures or geographical regions vary significantly in terms of their food and beverage consumption patterns, preferences, and purchase choices.

We begin by providing a brief historical perspective, and then outline the types of studies and methodologies employed in cross-cultural wine sensory research. We then review systematically cross-cultural studies concerning intrinsic wine factors, extrinsic wine factors, cerebral representation studies and those investigating attitudes and opinions about wine, and cross-cultural research addressing emotional response to wine. Finally, we bring together the major results reported from the varying methodologies to discuss how a cross-cultural approach can help advance our understanding of wine appreciation. We also raise contemporary issues relevant to traditional ways of defining and investigating culture in light of increasing globalisation.

This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant components and antioxidant activities of the edible leaves and stems of ASR extracted using solvent of varying polarities namely water, ethanol, ethyl acetate and hexane. ASR leaf extracts showed higher in both antioxidant components and activities than the stem extracts. Among the antioxidant components, the ethanol leaf extract showed higher phenolic (77.29 ± 1.02 mg GAE/g extract) content while the ethyl acetate leaf extract was rich in flavonoids (157.44 ± 10.19 mg RE/g extract), carotenoids (782.97 ± 10.78 mg BE/g extract) and betalains (betanin: 67.08 ± 0.49 mg/g extract; amaranthin: 93.94 ± 0.68 mg/g extract and betaxanthin: 53.92 ± 0.88 mg/g extract). Nevertheless, the ethanol leaf extract showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity and ABTS radical cation scavenging activity. It also exhibited highest ferric reducing activity among all the extracts. Four polyphenolic compounds from ASR leaf, namely ferulic acid, rutin, quercetin and apigenin, were identified and quantified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography. The existence of these compounds was further verified using tandem mass spectrometry. These current results indicate that ASR leaf particularly the ethanol extract has the potential to be exploited as a source of natural antioxidants.",Freshness assessment of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) through the evaluation of eye chromatic and morphological characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599937,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"The most commonly used method for fish freshness determination is the sensory inspection; alternative sensory methods such as the Quality Index Method (QIM), based on the significant sensory parameters of one specific species, have been recently suggested. Considering that most of the sensory parameters are based on chromatic and morphological visual impression, the set-up of an objective method using computer vision techniques is very promising. The objective of this research was to characterize the changes in eye chromatic and morphological characteristics of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) during 13 days of storage on ice, using a tailored computer vision technique and a 3D scanner. Results obtained by multivariate statistical analysis of the colour spectra of eye images and by the eye concavity index using a 3D scanner permitted to estimate fish unacceptability after 7 days of storage, in agreement with results obtained by QIM sensory analysis. Moreover, 1H NMR was used to evaluate the production of trimethylamine (TMA) and the Ki index, confirming a good correlation with eye chromatic and morphological features. This preliminary study showed the high potentiality of the developed method as a non-destructive technique for raw fish freshness characterization / prediction, being a promising approach to create a robust portable instrument for the evaluation of fish freshness in real transport and marketing conditions."

Despite some decrease in the chromatographic area of several peaks, no relevant qualitative alterations on the chromatographic profile were observed between the digested and undigested herbal infusions. Results obtained showed a decrease on the antioxidant capacity of both tested herbal infusions after the in vitro digestion. This decrease was more pronounced for H. pectinata than for A. gorgonum and was also more pronounced regarding the radical scavenging capacity than regarding the reducing capacity. After complete digestion the superoxide anion and the DPPH-radical scavenging capacities decreased ≈ 43 and 75% for H. pectinata and ≈ 31 and 70% for A. gorgonum. Despite the observed differences before and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, both infusions still had antioxidant activity at the end of this process. Thus, the antioxidant potential of A. gorgonum and H. pectinata infusions from Cape Verde, prepared as traditionally used, seems to be kept in some extend throughout the digestive system.",Identification and quantification of free and bound phenolic compounds contained in the high-molecular weight melanoidin fractions derived from two different types of cocoa beans by UHPLC-DAD-ESI-HR-MSn.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599925,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"The aim of the present study was to establish the profiles of soluble free phenolics (SFPs) and bound phenolics (BPs) in high molecular weight (HMW) melanoidin fractions isolated from raw and roasted beans of two Theobroma cacao L. varieties. Samples were prepared using three methods (saline treatment and acidic and alkaline hydrolysis) to obtain different forms of phenolic compounds. A total of fifteen phenolics, including three flavan-3-ols, seven phenolic acids, one phenolic aldehyde, and four N-phenylpropenoyl-L-amino acids (NPAs), were identified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-ESI-HR-MSn). In HMW fractions from both studied cocoa types, the main SFPs were N-caffeoyl-L-Asp and procyanidin B2, whereas the main BPs were catechin, epicatechin, ellagic acid, protocatechualdehyde, and N-caffeoyl-L-Asp. The concentrations of individual BPs were much higher than the content of total SFPs. It was also found that, as compared to alkaline hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis released a significantly higher amount of BPs from HMW melanoidin fractions. A comprehensive quantitative analysis indicated significant variation in the investigated phenolic compounds depending on the cocoa type and roasting conditions. An increase in treatment temperature from 110 to 150 °C led to a decline in SFPs and an increment in BPs. The HMW fractions of unroasted Criollo beans exhibited the highest content of SFPs and the lowest content of BPs. The highest BP concentrations were obtained for both cocoa bean varieties roasted at 150 °C.

Supercritical anti-solvent fractionation (SAF) of an A. millefollium extract was carried out to improve its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. A selective precipitation of phenolic compounds was achieved in the precipitation vessel fractions, which presented an antioxidant activity twice than original extract, especially when fractionation was carried out at 10 MPa. The main phenolic components identified in this fraction were luteolin-7-O-glucoside, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 6-hidroxyluteolin-7-O-glucoside and apigenin-7-O-glucoside. However, separator fractions presented higher anti-inflammatory activity than precipitation vessel ones, particularly at 15 MPa. This fact could be related to separator fractions enrichment in anti-inflammatory compounds, mainly camphor, artemisia ketone and borneol. Therefore, SAF produced a concentration of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that could be used as high-added valued ingredients.",Killing method affects the browning and the quality of the protein fraction of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae: a metabolomics and proteomic insight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599922,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Insects are being explored as novel protein sources in order to overcome the future food demands connected to world growing population. Insects for food/feed uses are currently slowly killed through freezing by most insect rearing companies, and typically, enzymatic browning takes place in the insect proteins fractions. However, very little is known about the influence of these enzymatic reactions on the protein physical, chemical, nutritional and technological properties. In this work a metabolomics and proteomic study was conducted on Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae, killed by two different methods: freezing (commonly used), and blanching (with the aim to inhibit the enzymatic activities). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) metabolomics demonstrated that slow killing method by freezing, compared with blanching, elicits the activation of several enzymatic pathways, among them melanisation with tyrosine consumption, energetic metabolism and lipolysis. These metabolic changes have an impact also on protein nutritional quality, with a loss of cysteine and lysine, likely involved in the process of melanisation and enzymatic browning. A strong effect was also observed on protein extractability: proteins from prepupae killed by blanching were found to be more extractable in milder conditions by chemical methods, and more prone to enzymatic digestion (97% of proteins released in solution upon proteolysis) than proteins from prepupae killed by freezing. All these data indicate that killing by blanching inhibits the browning reaction and other enzymatic changes occurring during slow killing by freezing, increasing the extractability of proteins in aqueous solutions, avoiding essential amino acid loss, and improving enzymatic digestibility.",Valuable components of bambangan fruit (Mangifera pajang) and its co-products: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599921,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Fruits are important food commodities that can be consumed either raw or processed and are valued for their taste, nutrients, and healthy compounds. Mangifera pajang Kosterm (bambangan) is an underutilized fruit found in Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), Brunei, and Indonesia (Kalimantan). It is highly fibrous and juicy with an aromatic flavour and strong smell. In recent years, bambangan fruit has been gaining more attention due to its high fibre, carotenoid content, antioxidant properties, phytochemicals, and medicinal usages. Therefore, the production, trade, and consumption of bambangan fruit could be increased significantly, both domestically and internationally, because of its nutritional value. The identification and quantification of bioactive compounds in bambangan fruit has led to considerable interest among scientists. Bambangan fruit and its waste, especially its seeds and peels, are considered cheap sources of valuable food and are considered nutraceutical ingredients that could be used to prevent various diseases. The use of bambangan fruit waste co-products for the production of bioactive components is an important step towards sustainable development. This is an updated report on the nutritional composition and health-promoting phytochemicals of bambangan fruit and its co-products that explores their potential utilization. This review reveals that bambangan fruit and its co-products could be used as ingredients of dietary fibre powder or could be incorporated into food products (biscuits and macaroni) to enhance their nutraceutical properties.",Effect of purification of galactooligosaccharides derived from lactulose with Saccharomyces cerevisiae on their capacity to bind immune cell receptor Dectin-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599920,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"Lactulose-derived oligosaccharides (OsLu) are prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) beneficial for human health including immunomodulatory properties; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. OsLu produced by enzymatic synthesis can be purified with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (OsLu-Sc). We show that this purification introduces yeast-derived proteins reactive to Dectin-2, an innate immune receptor for fungal polysaccharides. Using a cell-based bioassay, we tested the binding of OsLu and GOS samples to Dectin-2. While OsLu purified with active charcoal and commercial GOS failed to bind to Dectin-2, we found OsLu-Sc bound to this receptor. The carbohydrate-binding incompetent mutant of Dectin-2 failed to bind to OsLu-Sc. These data suggest that OsLu-Sc introduced carbohydrate ligands for Dectin-2. In accordance with this, proteomic analysis revealed OsLu-Sc contained S. cerevisiae-derived mannoproteins. Therefore, our data highlight the importance of the purification method for OsLu, which may positively affect the bioactivity of OsLu. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010495.","DNA barcoding to promote social awareness and identity of neglected, underutilized plant species having valuable nutritional properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599919,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2019 01 02,"It is estimated that about 7000 plant species and a large number of cultivars and varieties have been cultivated for consumption in human history. However, <0.5% of these currently provide the majority of human food energy needs worldwide (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, and potato). Global issues such as climate change, diffusion of pests, and resistance to agrochemical treatments are posing great concern about the sustainable cultivation of these major staples, especially in equatorial and tropical countries, such as Sub Saharan Africa. In addition, most of these regions contain malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, and the sum of such problems create serious implications at social, political, and economic levels. A possible solution relies on the exploitation of plant biodiversity and particularly on the so-called NUS (Neglected and Underutilized Species). These plants are traditionally grown in their centres of origin and continue to be maintained by sociocultural preferences, however they remain inadequately documented and neglected by formal research and conservation programs. Although they are important in terms of micronutrients and the ability to grow in harsh conditions, these species are falling into disuse due to agronomic, genetic, economic, and cultural reasons. To promote and spread their cultivation at the global scale, along with knowledge on their suitability for human nutrition, reliable identification systems are necessary to guarantee adequate authenticity along the entire supply chain and distribution network. A precise identification of the different species and their varieties is fundamental both to retrieve information on their origin and authenticate the raw materials (i.e., seeds, leaves and fruit) and related processed products that can be distributed at the local or global scale. DNA-based techniques can help achieve this mission. In particular, the DNA barcoding approach has gained a role of primary importance due to its universality and versatility. Here, we discuss the advantages in using DNA barcoding for the identification of some of the most representative NUS species, as well as their traceability and conservation of cultural practices around them.",Cystadenoma of the Seminal Vesicle: A Case Report of Rare Seminal Vesical Tumor and Review of Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599918,Urology,2019 04 25,"Although the secondary involvement of the seminal vesicles by prostate cancer is relatively common, seminal vesicle as a primary site for neoplastic disease is uncommon.1 There are a wide variety of tumors among primary seminal vesicle tumors that are derived from both the epithelium and stroma.

This condition is known to be highly comorbid with, and potentially exacerbated by psychiatric conditions, as well as other gynecological concerns and functional pain syndromes. Many comorbid conditions are also related to a history of trauma, and cases of CPP with comorbidity are known to be resistant to treatment. While the prevalence of a traumatic history among females with CPP has been established, less is known about how the role of trauma is addressed in the intervention literature. The purpose of this systematic review was to explore how the role of trauma, and to a lesser extent, mental health, is addressed in modern intervention studies for females with CPP. All qualitative and quantitative studies providing primary or secondary results of an intervention for females with CPP published between January 1998 and May 2018 were included and coded independently by two reviewers. Twenty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, none focused exclusively on patients with a history of trauma; one study implicitly focused on trauma-specific symptoms as an outcome, while two studies screened patients for a history of trauma. Of the 10 studies with a focus on mental health, only three simultaneously addressed trauma.

As hypothesized, academic self-compassion shared a stronger relationship with academic resourcefulness than a general measure of self-compassion; academic self-compassion independently predicted university adaptation along with academic resourcefulness and expected GPA; and, unlike general self-compassion, academic self-compassion did not moderate the relationship between general and academic resourcefulness, providing support for academic self-compassion being a type of academic self-control that is ""emotion-oriented.""

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine",2019 02 25,"Biological findings show that the activity of the calf muscle group is controlled by the central nervous system during running. The central nervous system tries to retain the peak values of the ground reaction force at constant levels as well as to minimize the vibration amplitude of soft tissues of the lower leg. Furthermore, these objectives are functions of stiffness and damping (compliance properties) of the calf muscle-tendon unit, especially gastrocnemius-Achilles. In this article, a new model for the calf muscle-tendon unit activity is presented in which the coefficients of stiffness and damping are exponential functions of the force produced at the Achilles tendon in the duration of stance phase, that is, they are time variant instead of having constant values. Then, the central nervous system functionality to control the activity of the muscle-tendon unit is formulated through definition of an optimization problem. This problem is solved by additionally considering the hardness of sport shoes. The muscle activity is indeed controlled via optimally adjusting two tuning parameters of the muscle-tendon unit model in terms of the hardness of shoes. This idea is examined separately for two running speeds. The results show the following: (1) The hardness of shoes affects the muscle activity. We find safe areas of the hardness parameters to design sport shoes. (2) When hard shoes are worn, the running speed has negligible effects on the tuning parameters, while with soft shoes the tuning parameters significantly change the muscle activity and the ground reaction force depended on running speed. (3) The ability of muscle in changing its compliance properties (specified by bound limits over the muscle-tendon unit tuning parameters) has the most influence in the safe area. (4) Rising running speed leads to a decrease in the safe area of shoes' parameters.",Lower vitamin D levels during the second trimester are associated with developing gestational diabetes mellitus: an observational cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599810,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 13,"In this study, we aimed to compare serum 25(OH)D levels in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and to identify the serum 25(OH)D levels associated with GDM.

We excluded women with chronic diseases, preeclampsia, pre-GDM, multiple pregnancies, and those taking medications related to calcium or vitamin D metabolism. We took anthropometric measurements and blood samples during the second trimester. Of the 80 pregnant women, pre-pregnancy body mass index was significantly higher among the GDM group than the healthy group (26.4 ± 5.73 kg/m2 vs. 22.6 ± 3.56 kg/m2, p = .001).

This study examined the effect of consuming Cereal & Milk (CM) or a nutritionally-comparable Fruit Smoothie (FS) for breakfast on daily energy intake (EI) in free-living adults and the extent to which individuals compensated for calories ingested in a High Energy Fruit Smoothie (HE). Ten participants (28.4 ± 2.2y; 23.3 ± 1.0 kg·m -2, Mean ± SEM) attended the laboratory on 3 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks. Each week, they received a CM, FS or HE breakfast, then recorded all food/beverages consumed across the remainder of the day.

Objective: This study examines the relationship of plantarflexor electromyography (EMG) with anterior-posterior center of pressure (APCOP) in people poststroke during progressive challenges to standing balance. Methods: Ten people poststroke and 10 controls participated in this study. Anteriorly directed loads of 1% body mass (BM) were applied to the pelvis every 25-40 s until 5%BM was reached. Cross-correlation values between plantarflexor EMG and APCOP (EMG:APCOP) position and velocity were compared. Results: EMG:APCOP velocity correlations were stronger than EMG:APCOP position across all muscles (p < .01), and correlations were predominately stronger in the nonparetic compared with the paretic leg (p < .05). Increasing challenge to standing balance reduced asymmetry of EMG:APCOP relationships. Conclusions: These data suggest that sensory information reflected in APCOP velocity interacts more strongly with plantarflexor activity in people poststroke and controls than APCOP position. Furthermore, increasing challenge to standing balance reduces postural control asymmetry between legs poststroke.",A National Survey of Attitudes of the Zionist Ultra-Orthodox Community in Israel to Organ Donation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599807,"Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.)",2019 01 02,The Council of the Chief Rabbinate formally accepted neurologically declared death as an indication of death for all legal and religious purposes following changes made to practice parameters in order to comply with Jewish Law (halacha).

Although attachment anxiety reliably predicts and is associated with elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), the attachment avoidance-PTSS link has been far less consistent. This suggests both attenuating and enhancing connections between attachment difficulties and post-trauma outcomes. The goal of this study is 2-fold: (a) to review and summarize extant evidence concerning the relation between insecure attachment and PTSS and (b) to review mechanism(s) underlying attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance that may explain the development of PTSS. Following a systematic review of the empirical literature investigating attachment, trauma, and post-trauma reactions, a total of 138 studies were identified and summarized. The review further identifies explanatory mechanisms underlying the association between insecure attachment and PTSS, including stress appraisals, cognitive factors, self-esteem, emotion regulation strategies, social factors, and trauma-specific factors (i.e., type of trauma, extreme stress). Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed."

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine",2019 02 25,"Underactuation is widely used when designing anthropomorphic hand, which involves fewer degrees of actuation than degrees of freedom. However, the similarities between coordinated joint movements and movement variances across different grasp tasks have not been suitably examined. This work suggests a systematic approach to identify the actuation strategy with the minimum number for degrees of actuation for anthropomorphic hands. This work evaluates the correlations of coordinated movements in human hands during 23 grasp tasks to suggest actuation strategies for anthropomorphic hands. Our approach proceeds as follows: first, we find the best description for each coordinated joint movement in each grasp task by using multiple linear regression; then, based on the similarities between joint movements, we classify hand joints into groups by using hierarchical cluster analysis; finally, we reduce the dimensionality of each group of joints by employing principal components analysis. The metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints have the best and most consistent description of their coordinated movements across all grasp tasks. The thumb metacarpophalangeal and abduction/adduction between the ring and little fingers exhibit relatively high independence of movement. The distal interphalangeal joints show a high degree of independent movement but not for all grasp tasks. Analysis of the results indicates that for the distal interphalangeal joints, their coordinated movements are better explained when all fingers wrap around the object. Our approach fails to provide more information for the other joints. We conclude that 19 degrees of freedom for an anthropomorphic hand can be reduced to 13 degrees of actuation distributed between six groups of joints. The number of degrees of actuation can be further reduced to six by relaxing the dimensionality reduction criteria. Other resolutions are as follows: (a) the joint coupling scheme should be joint-based rather than finger-based and (b) hand designs may need to include finger abduction/adduction movements.","Childhood heart problems, adulthood emotional stability, and sex associated with self-report heart conditions in adulthood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599789,Journal of health psychology,2019 01 02,"The present study investigated biomedical, social, and psychological factors associated with self-reported heart conditions in adulthood in a British cohort.

Amounts of biopharmaceutical drugs and industrial enzymes have been successfully produced by fed-batch high-cell-density fermentation (HCDF) of this cell factory. High levels of cell mass in defined media can be easily achieved and therefore large quantities of recombinant proteins with enhanced activities and lower costs can be obtained through HCDF technology. A robust HCDF process makes a successful transition to commercial production. Recently, efforts have been made to increase the heterologous protein production and activity by the HCDF of P. pastoris. However, challenges around selecting a suitable HCDF strategy exist. The high-level expression of a specific protein in P. pastoris is still, at least in part, limited by optimizing the methanol feeding strategy. Here, we review the progress in developments and applications of P. pastoris HCDF strategies for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins. We focus on the methanol induction strategies for efficient fed-batch HCDF in bioreactors, mainly focusing on various stat-induction strategies, co-feeding, and the limited induction strategy. These processes control strategies have opened the door for expressing foreign proteins in P. pastoris and are expected to enhance the production of recombinant proteins.",[Characteristics and prevention of burnout syndrome among nurses].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599782,Orvosi hetilap,2019 04 24,"Within the health care system, nurses face multiple hazards from the aspect of burnout syndrome (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishment) development.

Critical cluster sizes were determined from cluster size distributions recorded as a function of increasing supersaturation, resulting in critical sizes of 6-15 and 1, respectively. Comparison with previous data for propane and toluene reveals a systematic trend in the nucleation behavior, i.e., a change from a steplike increase to a gradual increase of the maximum cluster size with increasing supersaturation. Experimental nucleation rates of 5 · 1015 cm-3 s-1 and 2 · 1015 cm-3 s-1 for lnS ∼ 41 and 104, respectively, were retrieved from cluster size distributions recorded as a function of nucleation time.

Also investigated have been the spectra for mixtures with water of short-chain formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, and isobutyric acid, in each case covering the complete composition range. The neat carboxylic acids feature two Debye-type relaxation terms with relaxation times between 5.6 and 260 ns as well as 0.14 and 1.4 ns, respectively, at room temperature. Depending on the composition, mixtures with water reveal an additional Debye relaxation term in the intermediate frequency range (acetic acid) or a term subject to a relaxation time distribution (propionic, butyric, and isobutyric acid). The relaxations of the neat acids are assigned to the equilibrium between monomers and single-hydrogen-bonded linear dimers and between linear and twofold-hydrogen-bonded cyclic dimers. The latter equilibrium is considerably catalyzed by hydronium and carboxylate ions. Several mixtures with water indicate one of the up to three Debye relaxations to reflect the protolysis of the organic acid. The term with underlying relaxation time distribution is due to noncritical fluctuations in the local concentrations. The Debye relaxations are evaluated to yield the parameters of the relevant elementary chemical reactions, such as the rate and equilibrium constants and the isentropic reaction volumes. A comparison of the correlation length of concentration fluctuations with data for other aqueous systems confirms the idea that the hydrophobic part of the organic constituent promotes the formation of a micro-heterogeneous liquid structure, whereas the hydrophilic moiety is of minor importance in this respect. The high-frequency limiting absorption suggests the equilibrium between conformers of linear dimers to contribute to the spectra well above the frequency range of measurements.",Understanding doped perovskite ferroelectrics with defective dipole model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599744,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"While doping is widely used for tuning physical properties of perovskites in experiments, it remains a challenge to exactly know how doping achieves the desired effects. Here, we propose an empirical and computationally tractable model to understand the effects of doping with Fe-doped BaTiO3 as an example. This model assumes that the lattice sites occupied by a Fe ion and its nearest six neighbors lose their ability to polarize, giving rise to a small cluster of defective dipoles. Employing this model in Monte Carlo simulations, many important features such as reduced polarization and the convergence of phase transition temperatures, which have been observed experimentally in acceptor doped systems, are successfully obtained. Based on microscopic information of dipole configurations, we provide insights into the driving forces behind doping effects and propose that active dipoles, which exist in proximity to the defective dipoles, can account for experimentally observed phenomena. Close attention to these dipoles is necessary to understand and predict doping effects.",Coarse-grained model of titrating peptides interacting with lipid bilayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599743,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 22,"Molecular-level computer simulations of peptide aggregation, translocation, and protonation at and in biomembranes are impeded by the large time and length scales involved.

All-atom force fields can be easily mapped onto the coarse-grained model, and parameters for coarse-grained monopeptides accurately extrapolate to membrane permeation free energies for the corresponding dipeptides and tripeptides. Acid-base equilibria of titratable amino acid residues are further studied using a constant-pH ensemble, capturing protonation state changes upon membrane translocation.

The analysis of the trajectories gives useful insight into the full-dimensional dynamics of the process and suggests that rotational steering plays a key role in the dissociation. The computed reaction probability suggests that, in combination with accurate molecular beam experiments, the specific reaction parameter density functional developed for CHD3 (SRP32-vdW) represents a good starting point for developing a semi-empirical functional able to achieve chemical accuracy for HOD on Ni(111).",Jellium and cell model for titratable colloids with continuous size distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599741,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"A good understanding and determination of colloidal interactions is paramount to comprehend and model the thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal suspensions. In concentrated aqueous suspensions of colloids with a titratable surface charge, this determination is, however, complicated by the density dependence of the effective pair potential due to both the many-body interactions and the charge regulation of the colloids. In addition, colloids generally present a size distribution which results in a virtually infinite combination of colloid pairs. In this paper, we develop two methods and describe the corresponding algorithms to solve this problem for arbitrary size distributions. An implementation in Nim is also provided. The methods, inspired by the seminal work of Torres et al., [J. Chem. Phys. 128, 154906 (2008)] are based on a generalization of the cell and renormalized jellium models to polydisperse suspensions of spherical colloids with a charge regulating boundary condition. The latter is described by the one-pK-Stern model. The predictions of the models are confronted to the equations of state of various commercially available silica dispersions. The renormalized Yukawa parameters (effective charges and screening lengths) are also calculated. The importance of size and charge polydispersity as well as the validity of these two models is discussed in light of the results.",On-the-fly ab initio semiclassical evaluation of time-resolved electronic spectra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599739,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"We present a methodology for computing vibrationally and time-resolved pump-probe spectra, which takes into account all vibrational degrees of freedom and is based on the combination of the thawed Gaussian approximation with on-the-fly ab initio evaluation of the electronic structure. The method is applied to the phenyl radical and compared with two more approximate approaches based on the global harmonic approximation-the global harmonic method expands both the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces to the second order about the corresponding minima, while the combined global harmonic/on-the-fly method retains the on-the-fly scheme for the excited-state wavepacket propagation. We also compare the spectra by considering their means and widths, and show analytically how these measures are related to the properties of the semiclassical wavepacket. We find that the combined approach is better than the global harmonic one in describing the vibrational structure, while the global harmonic approximation estimates better the overall means and widths of the spectra due to a partial cancellation of errors. Although the full-dimensional on-the-fly ab initio result seems to reflect the dynamics of only one mode, we show, by performing exact quantum calculations, that this simple structure cannot be recovered using a one-dimensional model. Yet, the agreement between the quantum and semiclassical spectra in this simple, but anharmonic model lends additional support for the full-dimensional ab initio thawed Gaussian calculation of the phenyl radical spectra. We conclude that the thawed Gaussian approximation provides a viable alternative to the expensive or unfeasible exact quantum calculations in cases, where low-dimensional models are not sufficiently accurate to represent the full system.",Self-assembly of phospholipid molecules in solutions under shear flows: Microstructures and phase diagrams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599738,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 22,"Shear-induced microstructures and their phase diagrams were investigated for phospholipid molecules in aqueous solution by dissipative particle dynamic simulation. Self-assembled microstructures, including spherical and cylindrical micelles, spherical vesicles, lamellae, undulated lamellae, perforated lamellae, and continuous networks, were observed under various shear flows and phospholipid concentrations, where the spatial inhomogeneity and symmetry were analysed. A series of phase diagrams were constructed based on the chain lengths under various phospholipid concentrations. The phase distributions showed that the structures with spherical symmetry could be shear-induced to structures with cylindrical symmetry in the dilute solutions. In the semi-concentrated solutions, the lamellae were located in most spaces under zero shear flows, which could be shear-induced into undulated lamellae and then into cylindrical micelles. For the concentrated solutions, the strong shear flows oriented the directions of multilayer lamellae and phase transitions appeared between several cylindrical network structures. These observations on shear-induced microstructures and their distributions revealed a promising approach that could be used to design bio-microstructures based on phospholipid molecules under shear flows."

We extend OS-CCVB by augmenting the model with three-pair configurations within the independent amplitude approximation. The resulting new electronic structure model, OS-CCVB+i3, involves only a quadratic number of independent wavefunction parameters. It includes the recently reported closed-shell CCVB+i3 as a special case. Its cost is dominated by integral transformations, and it is capable of breaking multiple bonds exactly for all systems examined so far. The strength of OS-CCVB+i3 is highlighted in realistic systems including the [CaMn3O4] cubane subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex and a molecular magnet with the [Cr9] core unit as well as model systems such as N3, V3O3, and P5. We show that OS-CCVB+i3 is only slightly dependent on the underlying perfect-pairing reference, while OS-CCVB shows a stronger dependence.

The phase accumulated during the diffusional motion is treated by an averaging over all possible trajectories in terms of the Gaussian local phase approximation. Predictions of the Gaussian local phase approximation are compared with the Gaussian phase approximation for diffusion in a constant gradient in a slab, a cylinder, and a sphere. The Gaussian local phase approximation, thereby, shows several advantages compared to the Gaussian phase approximation: it is also valid in the static dephasing regime, predicts correctly both transverse components of the magnetization, and yields information about the local magnetization.",Goodness of fit testing in dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599724,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"Dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is a powerful method to characterize the mechanical stability of biomolecules.

This naturally occurs in simulations of transport via ultracold atomic gases. Whether the simulation is numerical or physical, these approaches rely on the rapid development of the steady state. We demonstrate that steady state formation is a manifestation of the Gibbs phenomenon well-known in signal processing and in truncated discrete Fourier expansions. Each particle separately develops into an individual steady state due to the spreading of its wave packet in energy. The rise to the steady state for an individual particle depends on the particle energy-and thus can be slow-and ringing oscillations appear due to filtering of the response through the electronic bandwidth. However, the rise to the total steady state-the one from all particles-is rapid, with time scale π/W, where W is the bandwidth. Ringing oscillations are now also filtered through the bias window, and they decay with a higher power. The Gibbs constant-the overshoot of the first ring-can appear in the simulation error. These results shed light on the formation of the steady state and support the practical use of explicit reservoirs to simulate transport at the nanoscale or using ultracold atomic lattices.",Multi-configurational Ehrenfest simulations of ultrafast nonadiabatic dynamics in a charge-transfer complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599718,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"Multi-configurational Ehrenfest (MCE) approaches, which are intended to remedy the lack of correlations in the standard mean-field Ehrenfest method, have been proposed as coherent-state based ansätze for quantum propagation [D.

The same states seem to contribute to the variation in the σ2s cross sections as well, which can be ascribed to the non-adiabatic transitions between the 2p and 2s channels.

When one translocates a polymer through a narrow pore, a drastic conformational change occurs such that the kinetics of the translocation is expected to depend on the solvent quality. However, the effects of solvent quality on the translocation kinetics have been controversial. In this study, we employ a coarse-grained model for a polymer and perform Langevin dynamics simulations for the driven translocation of a polymer in various types of solvents. We estimate the free energy of polymer translocation using steered molecular dynamics simulations and Jarzynski's equality and find that the free energy barrier for the translocation increases as the solvent quality becomes poorer. The conformational entropy contributes most to the free energy barrier of the translocation in a good solvent, while a balance between entropy and energy matters in a poor solvent. Interestingly, contrary to what is expected from the free energy profile, the translocation kinetics is a non-monotonic function of the solvent quality. We find that for any type of solvent, the polymer conformation stays far away from the equilibrium conformation during translocation due to an external force and tension propagation. However, the degree of tension propagation differs depending on the solvent quality as well as the magnitude of the external force: the tension propagation is more significant in a good solvent than in a poor solvent. We illustrate that such differences in tension propagation and non-equilibrium conformations between good and poor solvents are responsible for the complicated non-monotonic effects of solvent quality on the translocation kinetics.",Time evolution of steep diffusion fronts in highly viscous aerosol particles measured with Mie resonance spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599702,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"Field and laboratory measurements indicate that atmospheric organic aerosol particles can be present in a highly viscous state. In contrast to liquid state particles, the gas phase equilibration to ambient relative humidity (RH) can be kinetically limited and governed by condensed phase diffusion. In water diffusion experiments on highly viscous single aerosol particles levitated in an electrodynamic balance, we observed a characteristic shift behavior of the Mie scattering resonances indicative of the changing radial structure of the particle, thus providing an experimental method to track the diffusion process inside the particle. Due to the plasticizing effect of water, theory predicts extremely steep, front-like water concentration gradients inside highly viscous particles exposed to a rapid increase in RH. The resulting quasi step-like concentration profile motivates the use of a simple core-shell model describing the morphology of the non-equilibrium particle during humidification. The particle growth and reduction of the shell refractive index can be observed experimentally as redshift and blueshift behavior of the Mie resonances, respectively. We can deduce the particle radius as well as a core-shell radius ratio from the measured shift pattern and Mie scattering calculations. Using both the growth information obtained from the Mie resonance redshift and thermodynamic equilibrium data, we can infer a comprehensive picture of the time evolution of the diffusion fronts in the framework of our core-shell model. The observed shift behavior of the Mie resonances provides direct evidence of very steep diffusion fronts caused by the plasticizing effect of water and a method to validate previous diffusivity measurements.",Structures and infrared spectroscopy of large sized protonated ammonia clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599701,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"We investigated in this work the structures and relative population of large sized protonated ammonia clusters,

The approach is presented in a general framework that allows extending the methodology to other correlation methods.

The consistency is achieved by deriving a discrete system of fluctuating hydrodynamic equations whose solution converges to the locally averaged molecular dynamics field exactly in terms of the locally averaged fields. The new equations can be viewed as a generalisation of the classical continuum Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics model in statistical mechanics to include a smooth transition from large-scale continuum hydrodynamics that obeys a Gaussian statistics to all-atom molecular dynamics. Similar to the classical Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics model, the suggested generalised Landau-Lifshitz fluctuating hydrodynamics equations are too complex for analytical solution; hence, a computational scheme for solving these equations is suggested. The scheme is implemented in a popular open-source molecular dynamics code GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations), and numerical examples are provided for liquid argon simulations under equilibrium conditions and under macroscopic flow effects.",A nonequilibrium thermodynamics perspective of thixotropy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599698,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 09,"We propose a new description of elasto-viscoplastic fluids by relating the notion of thixotropy directly to internal viscoelasticity and network structures through a general, thermodynamically consistent approach.

The predictions of the new model are in very good agreement with available steady-state shear rheological data for soft colloidal pastes and blood, i.e., systems exhibiting a yield stress, and with time-dependent rheological data for blood, i.e., during a triangular time-dependent change in the shear rate, exhibiting a hysteresis.

Six western classical tenors were asked to phonate pitch glides from modal to falsetto phonation, or from modal to their stage voice above the passaggio (SVaP). For each pitch glide the sample entropy (SampEn) of the EGG signal was calculated to detect the occurrence of phonatory instabilities and establish a ""ground truth"" for the performed phonation type. The cycles before the maximum SampEn were labeled as modal, and the cycles after the peak were labeled as either falsetto, or SVaP. Three automatic categorizations of vibratory state were performed using clustering: one based only on the EGG, one based on the GAW, and one based on their combination. The error rate (clustering vs ground truth) was, on average, lower than 10% for all of the three settings, revealing no special advantage of the GAW over EGG, and vice versa. Modal voice cycles exhibited a larger contact quotient, larger normalized derivative peak ratio, and lower rise time, compared to SVaP and falsetto. The GAW-based normalized maximum area declination rate was larger in SVaP compared to modal voice."

Alterations to timing information in speech, such as occurs in rapid or foreign-accented speech, can be particularly difficult for older people to resolve. It is currently unclear how prior language experience modulates performance with temporally altered sentence-length speech utterances. The principal hypothesis is that prior experience with a foreign language affords an advantage for recognition of accented English when the talker and listener share the same native language, which may minimize age-related differences in performance with temporally altered speech. A secondary hypothesis is that native language experience with a syllable-timed language (Spanish) is advantageous for recognizing rapid English speech. Native speakers of English and Spanish completed speech recognition tasks with both accented and unaccented English sentences presented in various degrees of time compression (TC). Native English listeners showed higher or equivalent recognition of accented and unaccented English speech compared to native Spanish listeners in all TC conditions. Additionally, significant effects of aging were seen for native Spanish listeners on all tasks. Overall, the results did not support the hypotheses for a benefit of shared language experience for non-native speakers of English, particularly older native Spanish listeners.",A multi-tone active noise control system with a simplified local on-line secondary-path modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599682,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Multi-tone active noise control (multi-tone ANC) technology has been widely studied to reduce the tonal noise with low frequencies. In the case of an ANC system with a time-varying secondary path, an on-line modeling method is necessary. In this work, a multi-tone ANC system with a simplified local on-line secondary-path modeling method is presented. A two-tone signal with small amplitude is added at the sideband of each noise tone to conduct the local modeling. The least mean square algorithm is used as the modeling algorithm which provides tracking for a time-varying secondary path. Notch filters and bandpass filters are adopted to separate the primary tones and the additive tones.

This annoyance may be predicted using noise-exposure relationships with mean energy-based index. However, there is room for improvement of models as other acoustical and non-acoustical factors also influence noise annoyance responses. In this paper, it is proposed to highlight annoying auditory sensations evoked by the railway noise and determine acoustical and psychoacoustical indices combined in a predictive model. A laboratory experiment involving railway pass-by noise in urban areas was carried out. Annoyance ratings, noise sensitivity ratings, and free verbalization data were gathered. The analysis underlined annoying auditory sensations caused by railway pass-by noises. Two indices were proposed to account for irregular amplitude fluctuation and noise event duration-related sensations. A multilevel regression analysis was conducted, leading to two annoyance models considering noise indices and noise sensitivity. These models were finally compared to a similarly obtained multilevel regression model related to tramway noise annoyance. The comparison was carried out as a cross-validation considering the models and the respective datasets collected in laboratory conditions for model construction. Results showed that the railway noise annoyance model led to a good prediction of tramway noise annoyance and vice versa.",Automatic acoustic estimation of sperm whale size distributions achieved through machine recognition of on-axis clicks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599680,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"The waveforms of individual sperm whale clicks often appear as multiple pulses, which are the product of a single pulse reverberating throughout the spermaceti organ. Since there is a relationship between spermaceti organ size and total body size, it is possible to estimate a whale's length by measuring the inter-pulse intervals (IPIs) within its clicks. However, if a click is recorded off-axis, the IPI corresponding to spermaceti organ length is usually obscured. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically estimating the ""true"" IPIs of sperm whales in a recording by measuring them from on-axis clicks only. The routine works by classifying detected clicks with a support vector machine, assessing the stability of their IPIs, and then clustering the stable IPIs using Gaussian mixture models. Results show that the routine is very accurate in obtaining reliable IPIs, but has a high false negative rate. Nonetheless, since sperm whales click very frequently, it is possible to obtain useful IPI distributions with only a few minutes of recording. This algorithm makes it possible to estimate the body lengths of multiple sperm whales automatically with only one hydrophone.

Acoust. Soc. Am. 127(2), EL42-EL47 (2010)]. In order to retrieve the channel impulse response (CIR), the original RBD algorithm uses the source signal phase from a selected single beam output. However, when the impinging multipath signals have low coherence, the channel estimate from a selected beam may not show all paths correctly. In this research, the maximum likelihood estimator, which is called the alternating projection, is applied to separate multipath signals. Then the multiple CIRs obtained from those separated signals are coherently combined. This results in more robust detection of existing multipaths. The performance of the proposed method is verified using Noise09 sea experiment data, where the proposed method better resolves the multipath arrival structure.",Acoustic analysis of a broadband spiral source for the simultaneous generation of multiple Bessel vortices in air.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599678,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"A detailed characterization and analysis of the acoustic field radiated by an active diffraction grating is presented.

Understanding acoustic attenuation mechanisms in narrow, viscous-fluid-filled channels is of fundamental importance in such applications. Motivated by recent work on acoustic propagation in narrow, air-filled channels, a theoretical framework is presented that demonstrates the controlling mechanisms of acoustic propagation in arbitrary Newtonian fluids, focusing on attenuation in air and water. For rigid-walled channels, whose widths are on the order of Stokes's boundary layer thickness, attenuation in air at 10 kHz can be over 200 dB m-1; in water it is less than 37 dB m-1. However, in water, fluid-structure-interaction effects can increase attenuation dramatically to over 77 dB m-1 for a steel-walled channel, with a reduction in phase-speed approaching 70%. For rigid-walled channels, approximate analytical expressions for dispersion relations are presented that are in close agreement with exact solutions over a broad range of frequencies, revealing explicitly the relationship between complex phase-speed, frequency and channel width.",Transmission and absorption in a waveguide with a metamaterial cavity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599676,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,The reflection and transmission of acoustic waves along a waveguide of uniform width by a metamaterial cavity is considered.

This allows a solution to be formulated in terms of an integral equation across the interface between the metamaterial cavity and the waveguide. Attention focuses on the resonant and damping effects of a metamaterial cavity of tapered height where rainbow trapping phenomena are encountered.

The sound signal and wind noise are measured separately with the spherical microphone array and analyzed in the spherical harmonic domain. The wind noise is found to be irregularly distributed in the spherical harmonic domain, distinct from the sound signal which is concentrated in the first few spherical harmonic modes. This difference is utilized to reduce wind noise without degrading the desired sound pressure level (SPL) by use of a low pass filter method in the spherical harmonic domain. Experimental results with both single-tonal and multi-tonal sound signals demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce wind noise by more than 10 dB in the frequency range below 500 Hz. The SPL of the desired sound signal can be extracted from wind noise with an error within 1.0 dB, even when the sound level is 8 dB lower than wind noise."

The linguistic similarity hypothesis suggests similarity between sentence-level semantic content of the target and masker speech increases masking. Sentence recognition in a two-talker masker was evaluated with respect to semantic content and syntactic structure of the masker (experiment 1) and linguistic similarity of the target and masker (experiment 2). Target and masker sentences were semantically meaningful or anomalous. Masker syntax was varied or the same across sentences. When other linguistic features of the masker were controlled, variability in syntactic structure across masker tokens was only relevant when the masker was played continuously (as opposed to gated); when played continuously, sentence-recognition thresholds were poorer with variable than consistent masker syntax, but this effect was small (0.5 dB). When the syntactic structure of the masker was held constant, semantic meaningfulness of the masker did not increase masking, and at times performance was better for the meaningful than the anomalous masker. These data indicate that sentence-level semantic content of the masker speech does not influence speech-on-speech masking. Further, no evidence that similarities between target/masker sentence-level semantic content increases masking was found.",Effect of back wood choice on the perceived quality of steel-string acoustic guitars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599660,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Some of the most prized woods used for the backs and sides of acoustic guitars are expensive, rare, and from unsustainable sources. It is unclear to what extent back woods contribute to the sound and playability qualities of acoustic guitars. Six steel-string acoustic guitars were built for this study to the same design and material specifications except for the back/side plates which were made of woods varying widely in availability and price (Brazilian rosewood, Indian rosewood, mahogany, maple, sapele, and walnut). Bridge-admittance measurements revealed small differences between the modal properties of the guitars which could be largely attributed to residual manufacturing variability rather than to the back/side plates. Overall sound quality ratings, given by 52 guitarists in a dimly lit room while wearing welder's goggles to prevent visual identification, were very similar between the six guitars. The results of a blinded ABX discrimination test, performed by another subset of 31 guitarists, indicate that guitarists could not easily distinguish the guitars by their sound or feel. Overall, the results suggest that the species of wood used for the back and sides of a steel-string acoustic guitar has only a marginal impact on its body mode properties and perceived sound.",A mathematical model of bowel sound generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599659,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Humans have been interested in bowel sounds and wondered about their origins for millennia. To better understand the phenomenon, a mathematical model of bowel sound generation was developed based on a spring-mass-damping system. This is similar to vocal folds models for speech. The bowel sound model has four parameters that link to bowel activities: the individual wave component, pressure index, component quantity, and component interval time. All types of bowel sound documented previously can be modelled by combining different values for these parameters. Further, a 2500 ms bowel sound incorporating all the common types was simulated to present the model's accuracy.",A compact method for efficient evaluation of acoustic absorbers with submicron materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599658,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Materials with submicron or nano-scale features possess unique physical properties and are well-suited for application in noise reduction. To date, experimental characterization of the sound absorbing ability of the submicron/nano materials is still a challenging task, because the measuring of sound absorptivity usually requires bulky samples, while the preparation of large quantities of submicron/nano materials or structures is generally costly and laborious. In this work, an acoustic testing method is proposed to evaluate the acoustic absorptivity of submicron/nano materials using small samples. Based on the transfer-matrix algorithm, the method establishes correlations among acoustic-related parameters of a large sensor fixture and a small sample holder. A proof-of-principle experimental setup was developed to test absorbers with well-known acoustic behavior to verify accuracy of the method. Finally, the sound absorption properties of two submicron materials are characterized, with one comprising dispersed silver submicron fibers and the other comprising electrospinning submicron fibers. The results indicate that acoustic absorption coefficients can be effectively retrieved using only 1/200 of the amount of materials that are typically required in the standard test.",Multiplicative and min processing of experimental passive sonar data from thinned arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599657,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Sparse arrays reduce the number of sensors required to achieve a specific angular resolution by using sensor spacing greater than the half-wavelength. These undersampled sparse arrays require processing algorithms to eliminate aliasing ambiguities. Thinned arrays are sparse arrays whose sensor positions lie on an underlying equally spaced grid. Using data from a shallow water passive sonar experiment, this paper investigates two thinned array geometries (coprime and nested) along with two processing algorithms (multiplicative and min). Coprime and nested arrays consist of two interleaved Uniform Line Arrays (ULAs) where one or both of the ULAs are undersampled. Multiplicative and min processors combine the outputs of the conventionally-beamformed subarrays to estimate the spatial spectrum. While these nonlinear processors can suppress aliasing, they are often plagued by high sidelobes and cross term interference. This paper presents sparse array designs for a shallow waveguide that require 33% fewer sensors than a fully-sampled ULA and provide significant sidelobe attenuation. Experimental data analysis reveals that cross term interference dominates the spectral estimates for the coprime and nested multiplicative processors and the coprime min processor. The nested min processor outperforms its sparse counterparts due to its ability to contend with coherent multipath in the environment.",Wave velocities in articular cartilage measured by micro-Brillouin scattering technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599656,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Micro-Brillouin scattering was used to measure gigahertz ultrasonic wave velocities in the articular cartilage of a bovine femur. Velocities propagating parallel to the surface of the subchondral bone were 3.36-3.83 × 103 m/s in a dry cartilage sample. Anisotropy measurements were also performed in a 10-μm-diameter local area of the cartilage matrix. A weak velocity anisotropy reflected characteristics of the layers. The velocity also depended on the water content. In the middle layer, the velocity in the dry sample was 3.58 × 103 m/s, whereas that for a fully wet sample was 2.04 × 103 m/s.",Wave localized finite-difference-time-domain modelling of scattering of elastic waves within a polycrystalline material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599652,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"Ultrasonic studies based on the first arrived signals are of utmost importance when dealing with heterogeneous material especially to seismology, biomedical imaging, as well as for nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring applications. Numerical modelling of elastic waves through polycrystalline features has been primarily held back by huge computational requirements. This article discusses the development of a robust and efficient numerical scheme based on finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) by introducing wave-localized approach to simulate elastic waves in polycrystalline media. The numerical scheme adopts a rotated staggered grid in velocity-stress configuration. The numerical efficiency is improved by adopting parallel computing using efficient graphical processors and by introducing wave-localized computations. It is demonstrated that the proposed tool, especially with the introduction of wave-localized approach, is computationally faster and can handle large-scale grains in comparison with the commercial finite element software, especially when dealing with first arrived signals. This article reports an optimal ratio of FDTD grids per grain to minimize the staircasing effects at the polycrystalline boundaries and was found to be valid over a range of grain sizes. The article also addresses the orientation averaging requirements achieving statistically significant first arrived signal and suggests optimal averaging trials for various grain size models.

While many variables contribute to the quality of TR focusing of sound in a particular room, the most important have been shown to be the number of sound sources, signal bandwidth, and absorption properties of the medium as noted by Ribay, de Rosny, and Fink [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117(5), 2866-2872 (2005)]. However, the effect of room size on TR focusing has not been explored. Using the image source method algorithm proposed by Allen and Berkley [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 65(4), 943-950 (1979)], TR focusing was simulated in a variety of rooms with different absorption and volume properties. Experiments are also conducted in a couple rooms to verify the simulations. The peak focal amplitude, the temporal focus quality, and the spatial focus clarity are defined and calculated for each simulation. The results are used to determine the effects of absorption and room volume on TR. Less absorption increases the amplitude of the focusing and spatial clarity while decreasing temporal quality. Dissimilarly, larger volumes decrease focal amplitude and spatial clarity while increasing temporal quality.",Immediate phonetic convergence in a cue-distractor paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599650,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,2019 01 02,"During a cue-distractor task, participants repeatedly produce syllables prompted by visual cues. Distractor syllables are presented to participants via headphones 150 ms after the visual cue (before any response). The task has been used to demonstrate perceptuomotor integration effects (perception effects on production): response times (RTs) speed up as the distractor shares more phonetic properties with the response. Here it is demonstrated that perceptuomotor integration is not limited to RTs. Voice Onset Times (VOTs) of the distractor syllables were systematically varied and their impact on responses was measured.

A total of 43 children (31 male, 12 female) aged between 6 and 18 yr were recorded. Both microphone signals of various consonant-vowel-consonant words and subglottal accelerometer signals of the sustained vowel /ɑ/ were recorded for each of the children, along with age and standing height. The first three SGRs of each child were measured from the sustained vowel subglottal accelerometer signals. A model relating SGRs to standing height was developed based on the quarter-wavelength resonator model, previously developed for adult SGRs and heights. Based on difficulties in predicting the higher SGR values for the younger children, the model of the third SGR was refined to account for frequency-dependent acoustic lengths of the tracheo-bronchial system. This updated model more accurately estimates both adult and child SGRs based on their heights. These results indicate the importance of considering frequency-dependent acoustic lengths of the subglottal system."

However, the abnormal jump errors caused by the misalignment between the wrapped phase and the fringe order impact the phase unwrapping quality and are more serious in binary defocusing measurement with significant defocusing. This paper proposes a self-alignment technique (SAT) with high speed, no additional patterns, and no accuracy loss to eliminate such jump errors. After analyzing the relation between the grating changes and the misalignment, we designed an assist-code that can perfectly align with the wrapped phase even in significant defocusing. After that, this assist-code is used to adjust the misalignment and eliminate the jump errors. The comparison between the median filter and the proposed SAT method in simulations and experiments demonstrates that the proposed SAT method has the ability to completely remove jump errors for complex textures and step-height objects, even in significant defocusing, indicating its potential to be applied to other phase unwrapping fields, e.g., color-based methods with color coupling problems.",Wide-range and accurate particle sizing using extended interferometric particle imaging technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599635,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"Accurate measurement of particles of a wide size range is generally difficult in interferometric particle imaging (IPI).

The effects of particle size, scattering angle, polarization, and the comprehensive parameters of the imaging system on fringe patterns are thoroughly discussed. In the case of measuring water droplets, the measurable size range of the extended IPI enlarges to 10 μm-1 mm, with high-quality fringe patterns favoring the accuracy of measurement. The relative deviations of extracted diameters are no greater than 9%, demonstrating good accuracy of the particle sizing using the extended IPI technique.",Correcting symmetry imperfections in linear multipole traps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599634,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"Multipole radio-frequency (RF) traps are central to collisional experiments in cryogenic environments. They also offer possibilities to generate new type of ion crystals topologies and in particular the potential to create infinite 1D/2D structures: ion rings and ion tubes. However, multipole traps have also been shown to be very sensitive to geometrical misalignment of the trap rods, leading to additional local trapping minima. The present work proposes a method to correct non-ideal potentials, by modifying the applied RF amplitudes for each trap rod. This approach is discussed for the octupole trap, leading to the restitution of the ideal Mexican-Hat-like pseudo-potential, expected in multipole traps. The goodness of the compensation method is quantified in terms of the choice of the diagnosis area, the residual trapping potential variations, the required adaptation of the applied RF voltage amplitudes, and the impact on the trapped ion structures. Experimental implementation for macroscopic multipole traps is also discussed, in order to propose a diagnostic method with respect to the resolution and stability of the trap drive. Using the proposed compensation technique, we discuss the feasibility of generating a homogeneous ion ring crystal, which is a measure of quality for the obtained potential well.",A tuning method based on the coupled mode frequencies in biperiodic coupled-cavity linear accelerator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599633,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"A coupled-cavity linac (CCL) is widely used around the world in many fields. The radio frequency design is always a fundamental and crucial problem in CCL. In biperiodic structures, especially side-coupled structures, entirely different structures between accelerating cavities (ACs) and coupled cavities (CCs) will cause different frequency drops (δf) with the introduction of coupling slots. In order to achieve precise and consistent frequencies in each cell, the rule of individual cavity frequency drops should be figured out. A model of lumped resonant circuits is chosen to provide accurate prediction for normal mode frequencies. Through solving equivalent circuit equations, a parameter called frequency gap difference (ΔF
g
 ) is proposed, whose value is directly proportional to the frequency difference (df) between AC and CC and the ratio is one-to-one when AC frequency ( f

g
 , a simplified method on how to design and tune a triplet CCL is proposed; instead of tuning each individual cell, the new method only requires measuring the frequencies of the coupled normal modes, which considerably simplifies the tuning process and reduces the turn-around time. The particular design flow and tuning method have been successfully applied in the Nanjing University CCL Project. In addition, through comparing cavities with and without coupling slots, the value of frequency drops with different coupling coefficients is revealed and analyzed.",A 3-mirror surface force balance for the investigation of fluids confined to nanoscale films between two ultra-smooth polarizable electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599632,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"We present a new technique, based on the Surface Force Balance (SFB), for the direct measurement of surface forces between two ultra-smooth and polarizable gold electrode surfaces across thin fluid films. Combining the direct interferometric measurement of surface separation and contact geometry with smooth electrode surfaces has proved challenging in the past, and for this reason, previous measurements with the SFB typically involved two insulating mica surfaces, or one mica surface and one electrode surface, or an alternative less direct measure of the surface separation. Here, we demonstrate that a 3-mirror interferometer can overcome these difficulties: the setup involves two ultra-smooth electrode/mirror surfaces between which the fluid is confined and a third mirror to allow for interferometric detection of the liquid thickness with nanometer resolution and at thicknesses much smaller than the diffraction limit of the light. We conclude with a proof-of-concept measurement across dry nitrogen gas.

Conventional ESR systems are optimized for millimeter-size samples and make use of cavities and resonators that accommodate tubes and capillaries in the range 1-5 mm. Unfortunately, in the case of many interesting materials such as enzymes and inorganic catalytic materials (e.g., zeolites), single crystals can only be obtained in micron-scale sizes (1-200 µm). To boost ESR sensitivity and to enable experiments on microcrystals, the ESR resonator needs to be adapted to the size and shape of these specific samples. Here, we present a unique family of miniature surface resonators, known as ""ParPar"" resonators, whose mode volume and shape are optimized for such micron-scale single crystals. This approach significantly improves upon the samples' filling factor and thus enables the measurement of much smaller crystals than was previously possible. We present here the design of such resonators with a typical mode dimension of 20-50 µm, as well as details about their fabrication and testing methods. The devices' resonant mode(s) are characterized by ESR microimaging and compared to the theoretical calculations. Moreover, experimental ESR spectra of single microcrystals with typical sizes of ∼25-50 µm are presented.

The cold system was based on a cryogenic bath circulator, an air convection circuit, and several thermal insulation combinations such as silica aerogel and expanded polystyrene. The KŌRI tribometer allows one to reach negative temperatures until -20 °C and to perform tribological experiments for velocity from 50 μm s-1 to 1 m s-1 under load up to 50 N and to simultaneously measure resultant forces until 30 N and visualize the contact in real-time. In parallel, an ice manufacturing unit and a specific protocol were developed to grow a transparent ice disc with a controlled initial roughness and surface state. Real-time and simultaneous visualization of the ice-rubber contact provides additional data, such as the apparent contact area and the mean size of a real contact spot during friction, after adequate and dedicated image processing. To illustrate the capability of the KŌRI tribometer, rubber-ice friction measurements were performed at -10 °C and the results are presented here, as a function of time and velocity.",Horizontal displacement monitoring method of deep foundation pit based on laser image recognition technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599627,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"Currently, inclinometers are often used to monitor the horizontal displacement of deep foundation pits; however, this method generally has a high cost and complex operation and cannot monitor in real time.

In addition, the impact of the angle is considered and eliminated.

Nonetheless, SNMR is difficult to employ in a high ambient noise level because of the weak level of nanovolt signals (10-9 V). To solve this problem, pre-polarization (PP) technology is utilized for SNMR detection. That is, the combination of direct current, i.e., PP pulse, with alternating current (AC) pulses is utilized to increase the signal amplitude of shallow hydrogen protons. However, the PP and AC pulses on the same transmitting coil should be output independently when using the PP SNMR system. Meanwhile, to avoid magnetization loss, the process of shutting down the PP field must be both rapid and adiabatic. To solve the above problems, we improved the transmitting part of the PP SNMR system and designed a discharge circuit for PP pulses. The feasibility of the design was demonstrated through both software simulation and actual testing. When the PP current is 91 A, it can be turned off within 3 ms. Via further water measurements in an electromagnetically shielded room, we demonstrated that a PP system with a PP pulse discharge circuit can effectively increase the initial amplitude of the signal."

We then integrate this rate over time to get the amount of oxygen reacted as a function of radial position and time in the degrading sample. To illustrate the usefulness of our analytical expressions, we provide two worked examples investigating the effect of nitrogen blanketing and cone-plate partitioning. We find that, though nitrogen blanketing always produces less degradation, its benefits are limited for short times.

The 2D image is obtained with a multi-channel fiber array spectrometer, which views the entire region of the edge stochastic magnetic layer of LHD, including divertor plates, divertor legs, the stochastic layer, and the last closed flux surface. The scheme introduces new regularization terms in the Lagrangian function, based on the transport feature in magnetized plasma that the transport parallel to the magnetic field lines is much faster than the transport across the magnetic field, thus assuming smooth distribution in the parallel direction.

High beam energies result in more efficient detection of the neutral photofragments produced via dissociative photodetachment (DPD) of the parent anion and increase the mass range that can be studied with PPC spectroscopy. The novel experimental setup couples an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and a hexapole accumulation trap with a 10-stage LINAC to give a kinematically complete measurement of the dissociation dynamics for heavier anions. ESI dramatically increases the range of anions that can be studied by PPC spectroscopy to include multiply charged anions and larger, more complex molecular ions important in biological, atmospheric, and combustion processes. A radiofrequency buffer-gas-cooled hexapole trap is used to accumulate sufficient ion density for single-shot coincidence measurements and thermalize the anions to room temperature. The photoelectron and up to three neutral fragments resulting from DPD are recorded in coincidence using time and position sensitive detectors.

In order to achieve real-time measurements, the gamma ray count rate should reach 400 kcps. Due to the limitation of the detector's decay time, the signal output from the detector is heavily piled up. Meanwhile, the industrial site has a temperature fluctuation of 0-50 °C, causing the peak drift in the energy spectrum. This paper presents a readout electronic system specified for PGNAA and proposes series of algorithms that are dedicated for the gamma-ray spectrometric system.

A new set of experiments was conducted at MTA EK to further improve our understanding of this phenomenon. The research goal was to determine the pressure of the burst at different temperatures. These data represent a durability and usability limit of fuel cladding tubes under loss of coolant accident conditions. A large tube furnace was fitted with two optical telescopes on opposite sides to observe the ballooning and burst of zirconium alloy fuel cladding samples. These telescopes gave an opportunity to capture the ballooning and also to use a high-speed camera to record details of the crack formation and crack propagation during the burst. A precise pressurization system was constructed to feed high-pressure argon into the samples at a given pressurization rate. The previous data were reproduced accurately in this new apparatus with further insight into the phenomena. The change in tube diameter was observed using regular HD cameras. Based on the captured images, an algorithmic method was developed to separate the contours of the cladding tubes from the background and the diameter increase was measured. It was found to be mostly uniform at lower pressures. The formation of a bulge started at 85% of actual burst pressure. Crack formation at high temperature was recorded using a high-speed camera at speeds up to 100.000 fps.

First, an inverter-based temperature-sensing delay line generates a pulse with a width proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). Then, a pulse-shrinking delay line (PSDL) with a pulse-mixing scheme (PMS) measures the PTAT pulse through pulse shrinking. The two delay lines become area efficient when the channel length of transistors is long. Conventionally, the area-efficient PSDL decreases the time resolution. Thus, the all-digital PMS considerably enhances the time resolution and achieves an excellent sensor resolution. Finally, a time subtractor improves sensor accuracy by effectively eliminating the offset error effects. The proposed sensor was implemented in a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 0.35-μm CMOS process and occupied an area of 0.0247 mm2, which is the best area among related studies.

Performing accelerated screening to enable exploration of a broad span of catalyst materials poses additional challenges due to the long time scales associated with accumulation of reaction products and the detection of the reaction products with traditional separation-based analytical methods. The catalyst screening techniques that have been reported for combinatorial studies of (photo)electrocatalysts do not meet the needs of CO2 reduction catalyst research, prompting our development of a new electrochemical cell design and its integration to gas and liquid chromatography instruments. To enable rapid chromatography measurements while maintaining sensitivity to minor products, the electrochemical cell features low electrolyte and head space volumes compared to the catalyst surface area. Additionally, the cell is operated as a batch reactor with electrolyte recirculation to rapidly concentrate reaction products, which serves the present needs for rapidly detecting minor products and has additional implications for enabling product separations in industrial CO2 electrolysis systems. To maintain near-saturation of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes, we employ electrolyte nebulization through a CO2-rich headspace, achieving similar gas-liquid equilibration as vigorous CO2 bubbling but without gas flow. The instrument is demonstrated with a series of electrochemical experiments on an Au-Pd combinatorial library, revealing non-monotonic variations in product distribution with respect to catalyst composition. The highly integrated analytical electrochemistry system is engineered to enable automation for rapid catalyst screening as well as deployment for a broad range of electrochemical reactions where product distribution is critical to the assessment of catalyst performance."

Knowing these concerns, a MDIS is designed, fabricated, and developed at Institute for Plasma Research to produce high current and a low emittance ion beam for accelerator applications. The present manuscript reports the development of MDIS and the characterization results of the first plasma produced by launching a microwave (MW) of frequency 2.45 GHz. The plasma is characterized at a particular distance away from the ion extraction aperture, using three diagnostics tools such as a Langmuir Probe (LP), Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES), and a microwave spectrum analyzer. The required mirror-B magnetic field is created by placing four high power ring magnets (each magnet pole strength is 1.38 T) around the cylindrical source chamber. All diagnostics measurements are performed under an operating pressure of range 2 × 10-4-1 × 10-3 mbar and the plasma absorbed power of 30-160 W. The measured cold electron temperature and density varies in the range of ∼1.5-11.8 eV and 5.6 × 1016 m-3-6 × 1017 m-3, respectively, within the source volume. The electron population has distinct hot and cold plasma temperature. The hot electron temperature changes from ∼20 to 70 eV within the above absorbed power range. The LP and OES measurements witnessed the density jumps from under-dense (∼7.3 × 1016 m-3) to over-dense (∼2.9 × 1017 m-3) for the change in absorbed power from 50 W to 80 W. This density jump is accompanied by the sideband generation around the cavity resonant mode (including the launched MW) frequencies which range from 238 kHz to 873 kHz and is recognized as ion waves from the dispersion relation. The ion temperature, estimated from these observed low frequency instabilities, changes from 0.095 to 1.25 eV. The influences of these instabilities on beam emittance growth are of paramount importance in future studies.",Pure sinusoidal photo-modulation using an acousto-optic modulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599569,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"We use an arbitrary waveform generator to generate a clean sinusoidal modulation from the otherwise nonlinear acousto-optic modulator (AOM).

We introduce a high-resolution angle-resolved-LPFM technique that is capable of visualizing full two-dimensional in-plane piezoresponse vector fields. The LPFM signal is analyzed for each pixel with respect to the sample-probe orientation angle with the aid of an image registration technique, and the corresponding local in-plane piezoresponse vector is deduced from the amplitude and phase of the trigonometric curve fitting.

Our knowledge of their composition relies mainly on thermodynamic modeling and assumptions based on Cassini Radar and VIMS (Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) data. Several thermodynamic models have been used to calculate the composition of these lakes, and their results on even the major lake components (methane, ethane, propane, and nitrogen) exhibit large discrepancies. Recent Cassini radar observations revealed an echo from the lake's bottom. A low loss factor of attenuation is needed within the lakes to interpret these observations, and it has been suggested that the lakes are dominated by methane. Cassini VIMS data obtained on the North Pole lakes at three-year intervals showed no detectable surface level change, which is consistent with ethane being their primary constituent. This additional discrepancy between thermodynamic models and Cassini data strongly shows the need for experimental measurements under realistic Titan conditions in order to better constrain the thermodynamic models. We designed and built a cryogenic experimental platform allowing the simulation of Titan's lakes. This facility, named Titan Lakes Simulation System (TiLSS), produces liquid hydrocarbons in equilibrium with a gas phase mimicking Titan's atmosphere. Samples of the condensed liquid are injected directly into a gas chromatograph allowing the direct measurement of its chemical components and their abundances. To test the overall operation of the system, a gas mixture of methane and ethane was condensed under 1.5 bar of nitrogen and analyzed. Results from this proof of concept test are in good agreement with experimental studies previously published.","Definition of design guidelines, construction, and performance of an ultra-stable scanning tunneling microscope for spectroscopic imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599565,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"Spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy is a powerful technique to study quantum materials, with the ability to provide information about the local electronic structure with subatomic resolution.

In this article, we report on the design and fabrication of an ultra-stable scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for spectroscopic-imaging measurements that operates in ultra-high vacuum and at low temperatures (4 K). We start from existing designs with sapphire as the main material and improve the stiffness further by performing finite element analysis calculations for the main components of the microscope to guide design choices on the geometry of the parts. With this strategy, we construct a STM head with measured lowest resonant frequencies above f0 = 13 kHz for the coarse approach mechanism, a value three times higher than what has been previously reported and in good agreement with the calculations.

It measures the electrical transport counterpart of the transverse magnetic AC-susceptibility. The technique was developed in a conventional four-probe configuration in which a small DC current flows through the sample and a small transverse AC-field perturbates the equilibrium position of the sample magnetization. Lock-in detection, in-phase with the AC-perturbation, is used to measure the voltage signal between the two inner electrodes of the four-probe station. We successfully demonstrated that this signal is proportional to the product of the first derivative of sample resistance with respect to the equilibrium position of the magnetization times the second derivative of the energy with respect to the equilibrium position of the magnetization. These dependences add new features to the technique investigated here that were not captured by the investigations previously reported on the same subject. To show the effective use of the technique, we discuss its application in measuring magnetic properties of thin magnetic films in the non-saturated regime."

It is difficult to implement the EMD based signal processing algorithm in real time because it is totally a data-driven process which comprises numerous sifting operations. In this paper, the EMD algorithm has been implemented in the visual software environment. The EMD implementation encompasses two types of interpolation methods: piecewise linear interpolation (PLI) and cubic spline interpolation (CSI). The cubic spline tridiagonal matrix has been solved by using the Thomas algorithm for real time processing. The total time complexity functions for both the implemented PLI and CSI based EMD methods have been computed. For the signal filtering, the partial reconstruction algorithm has been adopted. The baseline correction and noise filtering applications have been presented using an EMD based visual software. The real time practicability and the efficiency of this method have been validated through ultrasonic NDT experimentation for improvement in the time domain resolution of the ultrasonic A-scan raw data. The practical results show that in the noisy environment, it is possible to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for the visualization and identification of ultrasonic pulse-echo signals in real time.","Near-infrared optical investigations of snow, ice, and water layers on diffuse reflecting surfaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599544,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"While most experiments on water or ice utilize rather complex, elaborate, and expensive apparatus in order to obtain reliable optical data, here we present a simple and affordable setup that enables us to perform near-infrared measurements on water, ice, and snow on top of rough diffuse reflecting surfaces such as concrete, stone, pavement, or asphalt. By using the properties of diffuse scattering instead of specular reflection, we are able to determine the imaginary part of the refraction index of water without using any liquid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that the snow spectra can be well described by newly developed two-dimensional ray tracing simulations.",Note: A disk-shaft shaped high-speed rotary ultrasonic motor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599543,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"We report a novel high-speed rotary ultrasonic motor, which works at the out-of-plane vibration mode (B11 mode). This motor contains one tapered rotor and one metal disk-shaft shaped stator. The stator's vibration mode B11 is excited by two pairs of piezoelectric ceramics attached to the bottom face of the disk. Through the traveling wave propagation at the contact faces, the shaft located at the center of the metal disk can effectively drive the rotor pressed onto it to rapidly rotate. One prototype motor with the appearance size of Φ 29 mm × 8 mm and a mass of 13 g is fabricated, and the experimental results show that it can rotate at a relatively high speed of up to 7000 rpm at the driving voltage of 350 Vp-p. The steady speed of the motor is 5000 rpm, and the maximum output torque is about 0.5 mN m. With merits of high speed revolution, a simple structure and a compact size, this motor is highly promising for many applications, such as precise instruments and miniaturized industrial robots.",Compressed sensing based sub-Nyquist sampling of multiple sinusoids with dual rate channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599542,The Review of scientific instruments,2019 01 15,"In this paper, we propose a reconstruction approach for a multiple-sinusoidal signal. The signal reconstruction requires a small number of samples and is based on a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme with dual rate channels. In the proposed sampling scheme, the samples are grouped into multiple cosets. To obtain enough different cosets to reconstruct a signal, the sampling rates of channels are required to be relative coprime. For each coset, the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula is employed to construct the relation between the sub-Nyquist samples and the original signal, which is used to construct the measurement matrix. Since the multiple-sinusoidal signal is sparse in the frequency domain, compressed sensing theory can be adopted to reconstruct the signal. Simulation results are reported to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Electrostatic rogue waves in double pair plasmas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599541,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"A nonlinear Schrödinger equation is derived to investigate the modulational instability of ion-acoustic (IA) waves (IAWs) in a double pair plasma system containing adiabatic positive and negative ion fluids along with super-thermal electrons and positrons.

The analysis of three key financial asset and denoised returns, gold, the Great British Pound/US dollar spot exchange rate, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, reveals that over four equivalent subperiods, from 1996 to 2015, the compass rose pattern changes. This finding provides an opportunity to establish how noise affects financial time series. We conclude that the compass rose pattern is unlikely the product of an underlying nonlinear structure, since there is evidence of nonlinearity in all time periods, even those where the compass rose pattern is not evident. Therefore, the compass rose patterns, seen in the denoised data, suggest that the presence of noise masks the underlying dynamics of the asset returns."

To find an effective resource allocation strategy, we take the infectiousness of each infected node into consideration. By studying the interplay between the resource allocation and epidemic spreading, we find that the spreading dynamics of epidemic is affected by the preferential resource allocation. There are double phase transitions of the fraction of infected nodes, which are different from the classical epidemic model. More importantly, we find that the preferential resource allocation has double-edged sword effects on the disease spreading. When there is a small transmission rate, the infected fraction at the steady state decreases with the increment of degree of resource allocation preference, which indicates that resources of the healthy nodes should be allocated preferentially to the high infectious nodes to constrain the disease spreading. Moreover, when there is a large transmission rate, the fraction of infected nodes at the steady state increases with the increment of the degree of the preference, but the resource allocation is determined by the stage of epidemic spreading. Namely, in the early stage of the disease spreading, resources should be allocated preferentially to the high infectious nodes similar to the case of a small transmission rate. While after the early stage, resources should be allocated to the low infectious nodes. Based on the findings, we propose a simple resource allocation strategy that can adaptively change with the current fraction of infected nodes and the disease can be suppressed to the most extent under the proposed strategy.",Measuring Lyapunov exponents of large chaotic systems with global coupling by time series analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599527,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Despite the prominent importance of the Lyapunov exponents for characterizing chaos, it still remains a challenge to measure them for large experimental systems, mainly because of the lack of recurrences in time series analysis. Here, we develop a method to overcome this difficulty, valid for highly symmetric systems such as systems with global coupling, for which the dimensionality of recurrence analysis can be reduced drastically. We test our method numerically with two globally coupled systems, namely, logistic maps and limit-cycle oscillators with global coupling. The evaluated exponent values are successfully compared with the true ones obtained by the standard numerical method. We also describe a few techniques to improve the accuracy of the proposed method.",Reconstructing signed networks via Ising dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599526,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Revealing unknown network structure from observed data is a fundamental inverse problem in network science. Current reconstruction approaches were mainly proposed to infer the unsigned networks. However, many social relationships, such as friends and foes, can be represented as signed social networks that contain positive and negative links. To the best of our knowledge, the method of reconstructing signed networks has not yet been developed. To this purpose, we develop a statistical inference approach to fully reconstruct the signed network structure (positive links, negative links, and nonexistent links) based on the Ising dynamics. By the theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can transfer the problem of maximum likelihood estimation into the problem of solving linear systems of equations, where the solution of the linear system of equations uncovers the neighbors and the signs of links of each node. The experimental results on both synthetic and empirical networks validate the reliability and efficiency of our method. Our study moves the first step toward reconstructing signed networks.",Three-species competition with non-deterministic outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599525,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Theoretical and experimental research studies have shown that ecosystems governed by non-transitive competition networks tend to maintain high levels of biodiversity. The theoretical body of work, however, has mainly focused on competition networks in which the outcomes of competition events are predetermined and hence deterministic, and where all species are identical up to their competitive relationships, an assumption that may limit the applicability of theoretical results to real-life situations. In this paper, we aim to probe the robustness of the link between biodiversity and non-transitive competition by introducing a three-dimensional winning probability parameter space, making the outcomes of competition events in a three-species in silico ecosystem uncertain. While two degenerate points in this parameter space have been the subject of previous studies, we investigate the remaining settings, which equip the species with distinct competitive abilities. We find that the impact of this modification depends on the spatial dimension of the system. When the system is well mixed, it collapses to monoculture, as is also the case in the non-transitive deterministic setting. In one dimension, chaotic patterns emerge, which tend to maintain biodiversity, and a power law relates the time that species manage to coexist to the degree of uncertainty regarding competition event outcomes. In two dimensions, the formation of spiral wave patterns ensures that biodiversity is maintained for moderate degrees of uncertainty, while considerable deviations from the non-transitive deterministic setting have strong negative effects on species coexistence. It can hence be concluded that non-transitive competition can still produce coexistence when the assumption of deterministic competition is abandoned. When the system collapses to monoculture, one observes a ""survival of the strongest"" law, as the species that has the highest probability of defeating its competitors has the best odds to become the sole survivor.",Occasional uncoupling overcomes measure desynchronization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599524,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Owing to the absence of the phase space attractors in the Hamiltonian dynamical systems, the concept of the identical synchronization between the dissipative systems is inapplicable to the Hamiltonian systems for which, thus, one defines a related generalized phenomenon known as the measure synchronization. A coupled pair of Hamiltonian systems-the full coupled system also being Hamiltonian-can possibly be in two types of measure synchronized states: quasiperiodic and chaotic. In this paper, we take representative systems belonging to each such class of the coupled systems and highlight that, as the coupling strengths are varied, there may exist intervals in the ranges of the coupling parameters at which the systems are measure desynchronized. Subsequently, we illustrate that as a coupled system evolves in time, occasionally switching off the coupling when the system is in the measure desynchronized state can bring the system back in measure synchrony. Furthermore, for the case of the occasional uncoupling being employed periodically and the corresponding time-period being small, we analytically find the values of the on-fraction of the time-period during which measure synchronization is effected on the corresponding desynchronized state.",Using global modeling to unveil hidden couplings in small network motifs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599523,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"One of the main tasks in network theory is to infer relations among interacting elements. We propose global modeling as a tool to detect links between nodes and their nature. Various situations using small network motifs are investigated under the assumption that the variable to be measured at each node provides full observability when isolated. Such a choice ensures no intrinsic difficulties for getting a global model in the coupled situation. As a first step toward unveiling the coupling function in larger network motifs, we consider three different scenarios involving Rössler systems diffusively coupled, in a couple or embedded in a network, or parametrically forced. We show that the global modeling is able to determine not only the existence of an interaction but also its functional form, to retrieve the dynamics of the whole system, and to extract the equations governing the single node dynamics as if it was isolated.",Provoking predetermined aperiodic patterns in human brainwaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599521,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 04 23,"In the present work, electroencephalographic recordings of healthy human participants were performed to study the entrainment of brainwaves using a variety of stimuli. First, the periodic entrainment of the brainwaves was studied using two different stimuli in the form of periodic auditory and visual signals. The entrainment with the periodic visual stimulation was consistently observed, whereas the auditory entrainment was inconclusive. Hence, a photic (visual) stimulus, where two frequencies were presented to the subject simultaneously, was used to further explore the bifrequency entrainment of human brainwaves. Subsequently, the evolution of brainwaves as a result of an aperiodic stimulation was explored, wherein an entrainment to the predetermined aperiodic pattern was observed. These results suggest that the aperiodic entrainment could be used as a tool for guided modification of brainwaves. This could find possible applications in processes such as epilepsy suppression and biofeedback.",Synchronization of heterogeneous oscillator populations in response to weak and strong coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599520,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Synchronous behavior of a population of chemical oscillators is analyzed in the presence of both weak and strong coupling. In each case, we derive upper bounds on the critical coupling strength which are valid for arbitrary populations of nonlinear, heterogeneous oscillators. For weak perturbations, infinitesimal phase response curves are used to characterize the response to coupling, and graph theoretical techniques are used to predict synchronization. In the strongly perturbed case, we observe a phase dependent perturbation threshold required to elicit an immediate spike and use this behavior for our analytical predictions. Resulting upper bounds on the critical coupling strength agree well with our experimental observations and numerical simulations. Furthermore, important system parameters which determine synchronization are different in the weak and strong coupling regimes. Our results point to new strategies by which limit cycle oscillators can be studied when the applied perturbations become strong enough to immediately reset the phase.",Optimal disintegration strategy in multiplex networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599519,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 01 10,"Network disintegration comprises the problem of identifying the critical nodes or edges whose removal will lead to a network collapse.

Experiments show that the disintegration effect of our strategy is clearly superior to those of typical disintegration strategies.

The cross-correlation function analysis has been used as a method to determine the coupling delay and synchronization quality between two uni-directionally coupled chaotic VCSELs. We show that the injection strength significantly influences the additional delayed-time, and the injection strength analysis eventually substantiates the existence of additional delayed-time between the coupled lasers in experiments. The experimental results are in accordance with the numerical results. Additionally, we numerically study the effect of laser's internal parameter mismatches on additional delayed-time and synchronization quality between the lasers."

Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus and is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in hemodialysis (HD) dependent patients. A majority of patients with CHC could remain asymptomatic and are still undiagnosed. Early detection of CHC and linkage of infected patients to care for evaluation and treatment is the standard of care as emphasized by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease- Infectious Disease Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) practice guidelines. Historically, the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected CKD patients, including those on dialysis and in the peri-transplant setting, was a challenge. However, the evolution of various liver assessment tools, HCV tests, therapies and treatment strategies in the recent years has catalyzed a paradigm change in this area. This review provides an update on evaluating methodology, diagnostic tests and the various assessment tools for liver fibrosis pertaining to the CKD/HD patient infected with HCV.",Proline-rich protein gene PdPRP regulates secondary wall formation in poplar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599461,Journal of plant physiology,2019 02 15,"Proline-rich protein (PRP) is a plant cell wall associated protein. Its distinct patterns of regulation and localization studied in a number of plants indicate that it may play important roles in growth and development. However, the mechanism of how these genes control secondary cell wall development in tree species is largely unknown. Here, we report that a Populus deltoides (Marsh.) proline-rich protein gene PdPRP was preferentially expressed in immature/mature phloem and immature xylem in P. deltoides. PdPRP overexpression increased poplar plant height and diameter as well as the radial width of the phloem and xylem regions, facilitated secondary wall deposition, and induced expression of genes related to microfibril angle (MFA) and secondary wall biosynthesis. Downregulation of PdPRP retarded poplar growth, decreased the radial width of the secondary phloem and secondary xylem regions, reduced secondary wall thickening in fibers and vessels, and decreased the expression of genes related to MFA and secondary wall biosynthesis. These results suggest that PdPRP might positively regulate secondary cell wall formation by promoting secondary wall thickening and expansion in poplar. PdPRP-overexpressing poplar had a lower MFA, indicating that PdPRP may be useful for improving wood stiffness and properties in plants. Together, our results demonstrate that PdPRP is a proline-rich protein associated with cell wall development, playing a critical role in regulating secondary cell wall formation in poplar."

Vestibulo-ocular dysfunction has been reported in athletes post-concussion. There is a lack of research on vestibulo-ocular function in sporting adolescents, and the influence of previous concussions on the vestibular system in this population.

Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated by neutrophils, cause severe damage to gastric mucosa. Patchouli alcohol (PA) has been reported to have effective anti-oxidative and anti-H. pylori activities, and we investigated its effects on H. pylori-induced neutrophil recruitment and activation in this research. In neutrophil recruitment experiment, H. pylori was injected into rat air pouch to explore the effects of PA (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) on acute inflammatory response. The results revealed that PA significantly reduced the weight of exudate and the number of neutrophils in the air pouch. Meanwhile, remarkable decrements in TNF-α and IL-8 levels in exudates were observed. In neutrophil activation experiment, rat neutrophils were isolated and activated by using 50 μg/mL H. pylori water-soluble surface protein with or without the treatment of PA (5, 10 or 20 μmol/L). Results indicated that PA not only significantly inhibited the production of ROS, but also reduced the gene and protein expressions of p22/p47-phoxes, and the binding of p22/p47-phoxes. Furthermore, the influence of PA on the neutrophil activation genes of H. pylori (h-nap and sabA) was investigated, and the results showed that expressions of h-nap and sabA were remarkably decreased after PA treatment. In conclusion, PA reduced the recruitment and activation of neutrophils induced by H. pylori, as shown by its inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor generation, p22/p47-phoxes function and H. pylori neutrophil activation-related gene expression.",Glycyrrhizic acid suppresses inflammation and reduces the increased glucose levels induced by the combination of Porphyromonas gulae and ligature placement in diabetic model mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599445,International immunopharmacology,2019 02 16,"Diabetic patients are at an increased risk of developing severe and progressive periodontitis. Periodontal disease also increases the severity of diabetes by enhancing insulin resistance. Therefore, the regulation of periodontal inflammation in diabetic patients may contribute to the control of both diseases. Glycyrrhizic acid exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). HMGB1, one of the ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), is a damage-associated molecular pattern and induces inflammatory cytokine production. In the present study, we examined the effects of glycyrrhizic acid on ligature- and Porphyromonas gulae infection-induced periodontitis as well as the involvement of the HMGB1-RAGE axis in diabetic model mice. The molars of diabetic model mice, established by feeding HFD32 to KK/TaJcl mice, were subjected to silk thread ligation and P. gulae was then intraorally applied in the presence or absence of glycyrrhizic acid given topically. The topical application of glycyrrhizic acid suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases in interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α at the mRNA level in the gingiva and at the protein level in serum. Furthermore, glycyrrhizic acid suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases in serum amyloid A (SAA) in serum and fasting blood glucose levels. It also suppressed ligature/P. gulae-induced increases of HMGB1 and RAGE at the mRNA level in the gingiva and at the protein level in serum. A mouse anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibody inhibited increases in serum glucose levels. In conclusion, topical treatments with glycyrrhizic acid may suppress periodontal and systemic inflammation and reduce blood glucose levels through the HMGB1-RAGE axis in diabetic mice.","PG490-88, a derivative of triptolide, suppresses ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung damage by maintaining tight junction barriers and targeting multiple signaling pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599444,International immunopharmacology,2019 02 16,"Previous studies demonstrated that triptolide (PG490) has many anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. However, little is known about the effect of PG490-88 (a water-soluble derivative of triptolide) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute lung injury. We assessed the effects of PG490-88 on I/R-induced acute lung injury in rats and on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in a line of murine epithelial cells. Isolated perfused rat lungs were subjected to 40 min of ischemia, followed by 60 min of reperfusion to induce I/R injury. Induction of I/R led to lung edema, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, histological evidence of lung inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased levels of TNF-α and CINC-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. PG490-88 significantly suppressed all of these responses. Additionally, induction of I/R reduced the expression of claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1, and increased apoptosis in lung tissue. PG490-88 also significantly suppressed these effects. I/R reduced the levels of IκB-α and MKP-1, and increased the levels of nuclear NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase in lung tissue, and PG490-88 suppressed these effects. In vitro studies using mouse lung alveolar epithelial cells indicated that H/R increased the levels of phosphorylated p65 and MIP-2, but decreased the level of IκB-α. PG490-88 also suppressed these effects. In I/R damaged lungs, PG490-88 suppresses the inflammatory response, disruption of tight junction structure, and apoptosis. PG490-88 has the potential as a prophylactic agent to prevent I/R-induced lung injury.",Forensic parameters of 15 autosomal STRs (Identifiler™ kit) in three Mayan groups and one Mestizo population from Guatemala.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599443,"Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 03 15,"The population of Guatemala includes Mestizos (admixed) and different Mayan groups (Native Americans), which have been poorly studied in regards to short tandem repeat (STR) loci used for human identification (HID) purposes. Therefore, 483 unrelated Guatemalan volunteers from one Mestizo and three Mayan populations (Poqomchi, Ixil, and Achi) were analyzed with an AmpFlSTR Identifiler™ kit. Allele frequencies and forensic parameters were obtained for 15 autosomal STRs in these populations. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by locus and equilibrium linkage between pair of loci were demonstrated by exact tests in all the studied populations. Larger genetic differentiation probably due to genetic drift effects was observed among the studied Guatemalan Mayan groups than the neighboring Mexican Mayas. In brief, our results validate to use the Identifiler™ kit for HID in three non-previously studied Mayan groups, and one Mestizo population from Guatemala.","Relationship between Alzheimer's disease-associated SNPs within the CLU gene, local DNA methylation and episodic verbal memory in healthy and schizophrenia subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599442,Psychiatry research,2019 05 08,"Genetic variation may impact on local DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, information about allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) within disease-related loci has been proposed to be useful for the interpretation of GWAS results. To explore mechanisms that may underlie associations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia risk CLU gene and verbal memory, one of the most affected cognitive domains in both conditions, we studied DNA methylation in a region between AD-associated SNPs rs9331888 and rs9331896 in 72 healthy individuals and 73 schizophrenia patients. Using single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing we assessed the haplotype-dependent ASM in this region. We then investigated whether its methylation could influence episodic verbal memory measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in these two cohorts. The region showed a complex methylation pattern, which was similar in healthy and schizophrenia individuals and unrelated to haplotypes. The pattern predicted memory scores in controls. The results suggest that epigenetic modifications within the CLU locus may play a role in memory variation, independent of ASM.",What are the specificities of social cognition in schizophrenia? A cluster-analytic study comparing schizophrenia with the general population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599441,Psychiatry research,2019 05 08,"While social cognition (SC) is widely recognized as being impaired in schizophrenia, little is known about the potential heterogeneity in individuals' functioning. Using a wide range of SC measures and a cluster-analytic approach, we compared SC profiles in the general population and in people with schizophrenia. A total of 131 healthy controls and 101 participants with schizophrenia were included. Groups were compared on sociodemographic, neurocognition, anxiety and depressive mood variables. Three profiles were identified in healthy controls: one with good SC abilities (Homogeneous SC group) and two with specific weaknesses in complex Facial Emotion Recognition (Low FER group) or Affective Theory of Mind (Low AToM group). However, these patterns were not found in participants with schizophrenia, who were characterized rather by levels of SC functioning (i.e., Low, Medium and High SC groups). Importantly, while the High SC group (47.9% of the sample) exhibited normal performances, the two others were underpinned by different pathological processes (i.e., alexithymia for Medium SC group or neurocognition dysfunctioning for Low SC group). These results have important implications for future research as well as for clinical practice regarding assessment methodology and therapeutic interventions.",Sensory processing sensitivity and its association with seasonal affective disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599439,Psychiatry research,2019 05 08,"It has been hypothesized that an increased sensitivity to the surroundings, can leave some individuals vulnerable to experience the environmental stress of winter more overwhelming, thus leading to a greater risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). However, the association between trait Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) and SAD is not known. We therefore aimed to investigate: 1)cross-seasonal group differences in trait SPS, in 31 individuals with SAD compared to 30 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls, and 2)the association between trait SPS in remitted phase (summer) and depression severity in symptomatic phase (winter) in individuals with SAD. All participants completed the Highly Sensitive Person Scale, as a measure of SPS, and the Major Depression Inventory in summer and in winter, using a longitudinal and seasonally counterbalanced design. In both remitted and symptomatic phase, individuals with SAD exhibited higher trait SPS compared to healthy controls, which for individuals with SAD was heightened during depression in winter. Notably, when averaged across season, about 25% of the individuals with SAD display high-sensitivity whereas this is only the case for 5% of the healthy controls. In addition, higher trait SPS in summer was associated with more severe SAD symptoms in winter. Our findings suggest that those with SAD are more likely to score high on SPS and that high SPS may be a vulnerability marker related to more severe SAD symptomatology.","The role of depression, personality, and future time perspective in internet addiction in adolescents and emerging adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599437,Psychiatry research,2019 05 08,"With the increase in the popularity of the Internet, more and more of its users are becoming addicted to it. Special focus in this study is placed on adolescents and emerging adults who constitute the largest number of users in Poland. The participants in the study were 718 individuals aged 12 to 30 (M = 17.57, SD = 3.63). There were two groups: 390 adolescents (aged 12-17 years, M = 14.71 years, SD = 0.99; 192 females) and 328 emerging adults (aged 18-30 years, M = 20.96 years, SD = 2.54; 197 females). The respondents completed: the Polish versions of Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the IPIP-BFM-20 questionnaire measuring the Big Five, and the Future Time Perspective Questionnaire. The results showed that depression had the highest predictive power for IA. Personality traits were related to Internet addiction. In both groups, conscientiousness and agreeableness had negative contribution to Internet addiction. In the group of adolescents extraversion was a positive predictor of IA, whereas in emerging adults intellect was a negative predictor of IA. FTP long and FTP goals were predictors of IA in the group of emerging adults.",Understanding and preventing situations of abuse in health care - Navigation work in a Swedish palliative care setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599436,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 02 15,"In their everyday work, health professionals find themselves in situations that they perceive to be abusive to patients. Such situations can trigger feelings of shame and guilt, making efforts to address the problem among colleagues a challenge. This article analyzes how health professionals conceptualize abusive situations, and how they develop collective learning and explore preventive strategies. It is based on an interactive research collaboration with a hospice and palliative care clinic in Sweden during 2016-2017. The empirical material consists of group discussions and participant observations collected during interactive drama workshops for all clinic staff. Based on three types of challenges in the material, identified through thematic analysis, we establish the concept of navigation work to show how health professionals prevent or find ways out of challenging and potentially abusive situations. First, the navigation of care landscapes shows how staff navigate the different territories of the home and the ward, reflecting how spatial settings construct the scope of care and what professionals consider to be potentially abusive situations. Second, the negotiation of collective navigations addresses the professionals' shared efforts to protect patients through the use of physical and relational boundaries, or mediating disrupted relationships. Third, the navigation of tensions in care highlights professionals' strategies in the confined action space between coercing and neglecting patients who oppose necessary care procedures. Theoretically, the concept of navigation work draws upon work on care in practice, and sheds light on the particular kind of work care professionals do, and reflect on doing, in order to navigate the challenges of potentially abusive situations. By providing a perspective and shared vocabulary, the concept may also elicit ways in which this work can be verbalized, shared, and developed in clinical practice."

As a result, 1461 proteins were identified, 93 of them were found to be differentially expressed (>1.5-fold), including 52 up-regulated proteins and 41 down-regulated proteins during sperm capacitation. 88 out of 93 proteins were annotated and classified. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most of the differently expressed proteins (DEPs) were involved in the Biological Process of transport, cytoskeleton organization, sexual reproduction, and spermatogenesis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that DEPs were mainly involved in the pathways of metabolic pathways, PPAR signaling pathway, and oxidative phosphorylation. Western blot (WB) assay confirmed the expressional variation of VAMP4 and APOC3 proteins.

The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for such seasonal variation are not entirely known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the changes in the proteome of cryopreserved bull (Bos taurus) semen supernatant throughout the year. The quality of cryopreserved semen collected from the same Limousin bulls during spring, summer, autumn and winter (n = 5 in each group) was assessed by measuring sperm motility parameters using the CASA system and sperm viability and the level of sperm reactive oxygen species using flow cytometry. Two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis analysis coupled with the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to detect seasonal changes in the proteome of cryopreserved bull semen supernatant. We found seasonal variability in the percentage of sperm motility (P < 0.05), which was the highest in autumn and winter and the lowest in spring and summer. There was an effect of season on sperm viability (P < 0.05), with the highest percentage of dead sperm recorded in summer. There was no effect of season on sperm levels of oxidation. Proteomic analysis identified 23 protein spots, representing 10 proteins that changed during the year (P < 0.05). Albumin, clusterin, spermadhesin 1 and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase precursor were most abundant during winter, which presumably reflected correct lipid composition and morphology of spermatozoa, as well as involvement in protection against premature capacitation. Moreover, osteopontin and nucleobindin 1 could also be connected to increased semen quality in this season. C-C motif chemokine 2 precursor, epididymal-specific lipocalin-5, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and seminal ribonuclease were most abundant during summer and probably reflected disturbances during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. In summary, our study has shown that cryopreserved bull semen quality parameters were higher in winter than in summer. The identification of proteins connected to the variability of semen quality during the year have provided new insight into understanding the mechanisms underlying the seasonality of cattle breeding.",Research on a learning rate with energy index in deep learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599419,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,2019 03 19,"The stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD) is the main optimization solution in deep learning. The performance of SGD depends critically on how learning rates are tuned over time. In this paper, we propose a novel energy index based optimization method (EIOM) to automatically adjust the learning rate in the backpropagation. Since a frequently occurring feature is more important than a rarely occurring feature, we update the features to different extents according to their frequencies. We first define an energy neuron model and then design an energy index to describe the frequency of a feature. The learning rate is taken as a hyperparameter function according to the energy index. To empirically evaluate the EIOM, we investigate different optimizers with three popular machine learning models: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural network. The experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed EIOM compared with that of other optimization algorithms.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel benzo- and tetrahydrobenzo-[h]quinoline derivatives as potential DNA-intercalating antitumor agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599418,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 26,"A new series of benzo- and tetrahydro benzo-[h]quinoline bearing a flexible (dimethylamino)ethylcarboxamide side chain was designed and synthesized as DNA-intercalating antitumor agents.

In general, saturated quinolines (tetrahydrobenzo[h]quinolines) exhibited more cytotoxicity compared to their corresponding unsaturated quinolines (benzo[h]quinolines). Compound 6e showed significant cytotoxicity against all four human cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 1.86 to 3.91 μM.

Among the Ru(II) complexes, 1 excellently inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HepG2 cell. Importantly, 1 was mainly distributed in the cell mitochondria and markedly induced the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly attributing to DNA damage induced by the Ru(II) complexes. Synthetic Ru(II) complexes can suppress the growth of tumor cells in zebrafish xenograft model with low toxicity at effective concentrations.

This is particularly true in the coastal tropics, where numerous actors and institutions intersect to shape environmental governance. Here, we investigate stakeholder preferences for an array of options regarding the sustainable development and conservation of mangrove forests. These include: payments for ecosystem services (PES), ecotourism, selling non-timber forest products, bio-charcoal production, and forest restoration financed via corporate social responsibility (CSR). Empirical studies from two socio-ecological settings in Thailand reveal the preferences of government agencies, corporations, municipal and village heads, and several community associations (fishers, senior citizens, housewives, environmentalists, salt-flat workers, oil palm plantation owners). Interviews and participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) elicited preferences based on the likelihood of achieving favourable environmental, economic, and social outcomes. Findings reveal (1) PES was favoured - although motivations were not driven solely by the prospect of financial gain, but by the land tenure security, collaborations, and long-term ecological benefits that were perceived to occur as a result; (2) PES for local services (water quality) were preferred over global services (climate change mitigation); (3) criteria related to wellbeing, livelihoods, and environmental stewardship are influenced by broad cultural and political ideologies, rather than site-specific characteristics; and (4) clear tensions both between private and public actors, and between national and local actors. Our study highlights the importance of involving all informed stakeholders in the decision-making process in order to understand the complex reasons driving environmental management preferences, and to gain greater acceptance of biodiversity conservation and natural resource management actions. We also call for greater transparency in MCDA studies by presenting more of the qualitative data used to subjectively construct the quantitative criteria.",Macro-TGA steam-assisted gasification of lignocellulosic wastes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599415,Journal of environmental management,2019 01 26,"The kinetics of the steam-assisted gasification for three different agro-industrial solid wastes (sawdust, olive and plum pits) was studied by macro thermo-gravimetric analysis (macro-TGA) at different heating rates (5, 10 and 15 K/min). The progressive CO release was moreover monitored to fully identify each step of the global gasification process. A single-step kinetics modelling was applied by using the Coats-Redfern method, with both a first order model for pyrolysis and a Ginstling - Brounstein 3D-diffusion model for the gasification stages, respectively. A comparison between macro-TGA and previous TGA results for the same bio-wastes was performed. Results indicated that the reaction proceeds in three well-defined and subsequent stages, involving water evaporation [298-473 K], biomass de-volatilization [473-648 K] with the highest production of CO, and char gasification as final step. Reaction rate parameters of the Arrhenius equation were determined for both the pyrolysis and gasification steps.","Bio-guided search of active indole alkaloids from Tabernaemontana catharinensis: Antitumour activity, toxicity in silico and molecular modelling studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599414,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 03 30,"Active plant metabolites have been used as prototype drugs.

As a result, six sub-fractions were obtained, which were identified as containing 16-epi-affinine, 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, affinisine, voachalotine, coronaridine hydroxyindoline and ibogamine, respectively. The affinisine-containing sub-fraction showed selective toxicity against A375, with an IC50 of 11.73 µg mL-1, and no cytotoxicity against normal cells (Vero). From the in silico toxicity test results, all indole alkaloid compounds had a low toxicity risk. The molecular docking data provided structural models and binding affinities of the plant's indole alkaloids and topoisomerase I. In summary, this bio-guided search revealed that the indole alkaloids from T. catharinensis display selective cytotoxicity in A375 tumour cells and toxicity in silico. Particularly, affinisine might be a chemotherapeutic for A375 melanoma cells.","Synthesis, molecular properties prediction and biological evaluation of indole-vinyl sulfone derivatives as novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors targeting the colchicine binding site.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599412,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 03 30,"Twenty-two novel indole-vinyl sulfone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as tubulin polymerization inhibitors. The physicochemical and drug-likeness properties of all target compounds were predicted by Osiris calculations. All compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities, among them, compound 7f exhibited the most potent activity against a panel of cancer cell lines, which was 2-7 folds more potent than our previously reported compound 4. Especially, 7f displayed about 8-fold improvement of selective index as compared with compound 4, indicating that 7f might have lower toxicity. Besides, 7f inhibited the microtubule polymerization by binding to the colchicine site of tubulin. Further investigations showed that compound 7f effectively disrupted microtubule network, caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis in K562 cells. Moreover, 7f reduced the cell migration and disrupted capillary-like tube formation in HUVEC cells. Importantly, the in vivo anti-tumor activity of 7f was validated in H22 liver cancer xenograft mouse model without apparent toxicity, suggesting that 7f is a promising anti-tubulin agent for cancer therapy.",Synthesis of benzothiazole derivatives as a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599411,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 03 30,"Diabetes is one of the pre-dominant metabolic disorders all over the world. It is the prime reason of mortality and morbidity due to hyperglycemia which is link with numerus obstacles. Delaying absorption and digestion of carbohydrate has great therapeutic impact for governing postprandial hyperglycemia. Consequently, alpha glucosidase is one of the potential therapeutic approaches that reduce absorption of glucose and delay carbohydrate digestion hence maintaining blood glucose level. In this regard we have synthesized benzothiazole based oxadiazole in search of potent anti-diabetic agent as α-glucosidase Inhibitors. Benzothiazole based oxadiazole derivatives 1-23 have been synthesized, characterized by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, and MS and evaluated for α-glucosidase Inhibition. All analogs exhibited a varying degree of α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging in between 0.5 ± 0.01-30.90 ± 0.70 μM when compared with the standard acarbose (IC50 = 866.30 ± 3.20 μM).

In this work, a multifunctional nanoplatform comprising MoS2 nanosheets decorated with copper sulfide (CuS) and further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is reported. The resultant material has a particle size of approximately 115 nm, and can be loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) to a loading capacity of 162.3 mg DOX per g of carrier. Drug release is triggered by two stimuli (near infrared (NIR) irradiation and pH), and the carrier is shown to have excellent colloidal stability. The presence of both MoS2 and CuS leads to very high photothermal conversion efficiency (higher than with MoS2 alone). In vitro experiments revealed that the blank CuS-MoS2-SH-PEG carrier is biocompatible, but that the synergistic application of chemo-photothermal therapy (in the form of CuS-MoS2-SH-PEG loaded with DOX and NIR irradiation) led to greater cell death than either chemotherapy (CuS-MoS2-SH-PEG(DOX) but no NIR) or photothermal therapy (CuS-MoS2-SH-PEG with NIR). A cellular uptake study demonstrated that the nanoplatform can efficiently enter tumor cells, and that uptake is enhanced when NIR is applied. Overall, the functionalized MoS2 material developed in this work exhibits great potential as an efficient system for dual responsive drug delivery and synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. The route employed in our work thus provides a strategy to enhance photothermal efficacy for transition metal dichalcogenide drug delivery systems.",The light enhanced removal of Bisphenol A from wastewater using cotton waste derived carbon microtubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599398,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"The development of high performance, sustainable and inexpensive catalyst for environmental applications is a highly innovative and promising approach to meet the increasing demands from society on water treatment and pollution remediation. Carbon microtube (CMT) synthesized from cotton waste was successfully developed by direct pyrolysis of cotton bundle in argon atmosphere in different carbonization temperature (900, 1100, 1300 and 1500 °C). Carbon microtubes have been used for removal of Bisphenol A (BPA) in wastewater and showed the optimum performance for CMT11 and CMT 13. The mechanism involved in this efficient water treatment was ascribed to the strong π-π interaction and hydrogen bonds between CMT and BPA. Given the repeatability, high removal performance and cost effectiveness of the cotton based carbon microtubes when compared to other well-known catalysts such as carbon nanotubes, the carbon microtubes demonstrated great potential as low-cost, sustainable and effective catalyst for wastewater treatment.",Morphological transformation of self-assemblies by tuning hydrophobic segment of small amphiphiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599397,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"With increasing surge in the development of supramolecular self-assemblies, it is crucial to predict the influence of amphiphilic segment in dictating the morphology of self-aggregates.

This oral fluid is proposed to be one of the most important host factors, serving as a special medium for monitoring aspects of microorganisms, diet and host susceptibility involved in the caries process. Extensive salivary proteomic and peptidomic studies have resulted in considerable advances in the field of biomarkers discovery for dental caries. These salivary biomarkers may be exploited for the prediction, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of dental caries, many of which could also provide the potential templates for bioactive peptides used for the biomimetic management of dental caries, rather than repairing caries lesions with artificial materials. A comprehensive understanding of the biological function of salivary proteins as well as their derived biomimetic peptides with promising potential against dental caries has been long awaited. This review overviewed a collection of current literature and addressed the majority of different functions of salivary proteins and peptides with their potential as functional biomarkers for caries risk assessment and clinical prospects for the anti-caries application.",Novel metabolic disturbances in marginal vitamin B6-deficient rat heart.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599394,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 03 15,"Vitamin B6 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although plasma biomarkers have been proposed, no studies have yet directly profiled heart tissue, and the mechanisms have to be fully defined. Thus, in order to provide better insight into vitamin B6-deficient effects on cardiac functions, we sought to identify the metabolic profile in heart tissue consequent to change in dietary vitamin B6 levels by applying metabolomics. Heart tissues of rats fed a basal diet containing a marginal vitamin B6-deficient, vitamin B6-recommended or vitamin B6-supplemented level were analyzed by metabolomics analysis. Among over 500 detected metabolites, imidazole metabolites including carnosine, anserine, homocarnosine and histamine exhibited the highest decrease upon vitamin B6 deficiency (>-45%, P<.01), along with their precursors β-alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 1-methylhistidine. Ornithine was the only metabolite exhibiting an increased level in the vitamin B6-deficient group. Vitamin B6 deficiency significantly attenuated the activity of heart tissue glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), although there was undetectable activity of aspartate decarboxylase (ADC), suggesting that the involvement of vitamin B6 in imidazole metabolite synthesis occurs partly through GABA production by regulating GAD rather than through a straightforward β-alanine production pathway via ADC in the heart. Notably, vitamin B6 deficiency significantly attenuated citric acid cycle metabolite levels, suggesting cardiac energy metabolism impairment. This study provides a new link between vitamin B6 and cardiac functions, in which marginal vitamin B6 deficiency impairs imidazole and energy metabolism in heart. This newly revealed cardiac metabolic profile may reveal novel molecular targets or foodstuffs for CVD prevention.","Low body esteem and dietary restraint among 7-year old children: The role of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and belief in the rewards of thinness and muscularity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599392,Eating behaviors,2019 05 07,"Body image concerns and dietary restraint have been shown to emerge among young children (aged 5 to 8 years). However, to date, little is known regarding the way in which individual characteristics and endorsement of sociocultural appearance ideals are associated with these concerns and behaviors in this age group. The aim of the current study was to examine perceived rewards of thinness and muscularity as a mediator of the relationships between personality traits (perfectionism and self-esteem), and body esteem and dietary restraint among 7-year-old children. Participants were 261 children, Mage (SD) = 7.46 (0.32), assessed during interview on a range of scales measuring variables of interest. Findings revealed that, with the addition of direct pathways leading to dietary restraint, the model was a good fit to the data. Furthermore, multi-group analyses revealed no gender differences. These results highlight the role of children's individual personality characteristics as well as the degree to which they uphold thin and muscular appearance ideals in body image and eating concerns in 7 year olds. Additional efforts should be made to engage this age group with prevention resources and to target personality characteristics as well as beliefs in the rewards of appearance ideals.",New life for an old drug: In vitro and in vivo effects of the anthelmintic drug niclosamide against Toxoplasma gondii RH strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599391,International journal for parasitology. Drugs and drug resistance,2019 03 30,"Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis and causes serious public health problems. However, the current treatment drugs have many limitations, such as serious side effects. Niclosamide is a salicylanilide drug commonly used to treat worm infections. Herein, the effectiveness of niclosamide for the treatment of T. gondii infection was demonstrated. This study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activities of niclosamide against T. gondii and to explore its mechanism of action. The in vitro cytotoxicity of niclosamide on human foreskin fibroblast cells was evaluated by MTT test. Niclosamide displayed low host toxicity and its 50% inhibitory concentration was 8.3 μg/mL. The in vitro anti-proliferation and anti-invasion effects of niclosamide on T. gondii were determined by quantitative PCR and Giemsa staining. Niclosamide also inhibited T. gondii tachyzoite proliferation, with a 50% effective concentration of 45.3 ng/mL, and reduced the invasion of cells by tachyzoites (17.8% for the parasite control versus 1.9% for the niclosamide group treated with 100 ng/mL). A model was established by infecting BALB/c mice with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii and used to determine the in vivo effects of niclosamide on acute infection. The mice infected with tachyzoites and treated with 160, 200 or 240 mg/kg·bw niclosamide for 7 days exhibited 20%, 40% and 50% survival, respectively. In addition, niclosamide reduced the parasite burden in the blood and tissues of acutely infected mice, and niclosamide induced decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in extracellular tachyzoites, as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and a multilabel reader. These findings indicated that the mechanism of action of niclosamide might be associated with T. gondii mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results support the efficacy of niclosamide as a potential compound for the treatment of T. gondii infection.",Transient temperature fluctuations severely decrease P. falciparum susceptibility to artemisinin in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599390,International journal for parasitology. Drugs and drug resistance,2019 03 30,"Clinical studies suggest that outcomes for hospitalised malaria patients can be improved by managed hypothermia during treatment. We examined the impact of short pulses of low temperature on ring-stage susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin in vitro. The usually artemisinin-sensitive clone 3D7 exhibited substantially reduced ring-stage susceptibility to a 4-h pulse of 700 nM dihydro-artemisinin administered during a 5-h pulse of low temperature down to 17 °C. Parasite growth through the subsequent asexual cycle was not affected by the temperature pulse. Chloroquine and pyronaridine susceptibility, in a standard 48-h test, was not affected by brief exposures to low temperature. Fever-like temperature pulses up to 40 °C were also accompanied by enhanced ring-stage survival of 700 nM artemisinin pulses, but parasite growth was generally attenuated at this temperature. We discuss these findings in relation to the possible activation of parasite stress responses, including the unfolded protein response, by hypo- or hyper-thermic conditions.

Overall, a change in anomeric configuration at the reducing end and/or anomeric substitution (methylation) changed the conformational space of the terminal CH2OH group significantly. Conformational analysis of the free monosaccharides matched literature results very well. Dihedral angle histograms weighted against published Karplus equations yielded excellent matches of experimental J-values in some cases but significant deviations in other. The anomeric hemiacetal configuration appeared to have a significant remote influence on the conformational space of the α-1,6-glycosidic linkage. Rigid glycosidic φ-conformations (g+) combined with mostly st-conformations for glycosidic ψ-angles from computations matched experimental nuclear Overhauser enhancements in all cases. While the investigated Glcp-α-1,6-Glcp linkages were nearly identical in φ/ψ-conformation, differences were apparent in the Galp-α-1,6-Galp linkage of stachyose. Of twenty-one crystal structures, a total of fourteen had ligand conformations corresponding to the most abundant or second-most abundant solution geometry determined in this study."

The ABGS developed at low light intensity (142 ± 10 μmol m-2·s-1) exhibited excellent settling ability (SVI30 of 30.9 mL/g), COD and TN removal efficiencies (97.6% and 60.4%, respectively). High light intensity (316 ± 12 μmol m-2·s-1) accelerated granular biomass growth (5.3 g/L) and enhanced the TP removal efficiency (83.7%). Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) analysis revealed that low light intensity induced more large weight distribution protein production (9-12 kDa and 50-150 kDa), predominantly tryptophan and aromatic proteins. Furthermore, N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) with a side chain ≤ C10 were commonly shared in the ABGS, and the ABGS developed at low light intensity had a higher C6- and 3OC8-HSL content, which effectively promoted the biofilm formation. The add-back studies showed that the AHLs facilitated the regulation of EPS synthesis. Statistical analysis indicated that the AHLs content had a close correlation with the EPS production, the 50th percentile of the particle size distribution and microbial community assembly, suggesting that AHLs-mediated quorum sensing have an important ecological role in EPS expression and algal-bacterial granulation. Overall, this study describes the ABGS development at different light intensities and the mechanisms of ABGS formation treating synthetic domestic wastewater.",Kriging methods with auxiliary nighttime lights data to detect potentially toxic metals concentrations in soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599355,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"The spatial distribution of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) has been shown to be related to anthropogenic activities. Several auxiliary variables, such as those related to remote sensing data (e.g. digital elevation models, land use, and enhanced vegetation index) and soil properties (e.g. pH, soil type and cation exchange capacity), have been used to predict the spatial distribution of soil PTMs. However, these variables are mostly focused on natural processes or a single aspect of anthropogenic activities and cannot reflect the effects of integrated anthropogenic activities. Nighttime lights (NTL) images, a representative variable of integrated anthropogenic activities, may have the potential to reflect PTMs distribution. To uncover this relationship and determine the effects on evaluation precision, the NTL was employed as an auxiliary variable to map the distribution of PTMs in the United Kingdom. In this study, areas with a digital number (DN) ≥ 50 and an area > 30 km2 were extracted from NTL images to represent regions of high-frequency anthropogenic activities. Subsequently, the distance between the sampling points and the nearest extracted area was calculated. Barium, lead, zinc, copper, and nickel concentrations exhibited the highest correlation with this distance. Their concentrations were mapped using distance as an auxiliary variable through three different kriging methods, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), cokriging (CK), and regression kriging (RK). The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method. Regardless of the elements, CK and RK always exhibited lower mean absolute error and root mean square error, in contrast to OK. This indicates that using the NTL as the auxiliary variable indeed enhanced the prediction accuracy for the relevant PTMs. Additionally, RK showed superior results in most cases. Hence, we recommend RK for prediction of PTMs when using the NTL as the auxiliary variable.",Ammonia induces Treg/Th1 imbalance with triggered NF-κB pathway leading to chicken respiratory inflammation response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599354,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"Ammonia (NH3) is a severe air pollutant and a component of haze (PM2.5).

In this study, chicken tracheas were used as a model to investigate toxic effects and genetic changes induced by NH3 exposure, as evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and bioinformatic analyses. The transcript analysis illustrated that NH3 exposure caused immune disorders, which play key roles in regulating inflammatory responses from NH3 exposure. Therefore, we carried out Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and Western Blot analyses to detect the immune response genes; Treg/Th1, Th2 and Th17 secretions were found that led to inflammatory responses. Next, we also detected the NF-κB pathway and downstream genes, accompanied by cytochromes P450 (CYPs), antioxidative genes, and heat shock proteins (HSPs). Our results are consistent with transcriptome detection, indicating that ammonia has a negative effect on immune responses and causes inflammatory injury of the trachea. This study provided baseline information for exploration of the molecular mechanism of NH3-PM2.5 induced respiratory diseases.",Surface colour: An overlooked aspect in the study of cyanobacterial biofilm formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599353,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"Cyanobacteria can grow as biofilms, communities that colonize surfaces and that play a fundamental role in the ecology of many diverse habitats and in the conversion of industrial production to green platforms. Although biofilm growth is known to be significantly affected by several characteristics, the effect of colour surface is an overlooked aspect that has not yet been investigated. In this study, we describe the effect of colour hues (white, red, blue and black) on the growth of cyanobacterial biofilms on air-exposed substrates. We measured growth, architecture, pigment production and levels of ATP and reactive oxygen species in cyanobacterial biofilms formed on different coloured substrates. The study findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the colour of a surface affects biofilm formation at the air-solid interface (with more biomass accumulating on white and red substrates than on blue and black substrates) and also alters the biofilm architecture. In addition, the roles of chromatic adaptation, phototrophic cells and reactive oxygen species as intermediates between colour sensing and biofilm response are discussed. Our results support the importance of colour as a new factor that favours surface colonization by cyanobacteria and its contribution to biofilm formation.",Modelling environmental antibiotic-resistance gene abundance: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599352,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"The successful treatment of infectious diseases heavily relies on the therapeutic usage of antibiotics. However, the high use of antibiotics in humans and animals leads to increasing pressure on bacterial populations in favour of resistant phenotypes. Antibiotics reach the environment from a variety of emission sources and are being detected at relatively low concentrations. Given the possibility of selective pressure to occur at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the ecological impact of environmental antibiotic levels on microbial communities and resistance levels is vastly unknown. Quantification of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) and of antibiotic concentrations is becoming commonplace. Yet, these two parameters are often assessed separately and in a specific spatiotemporal context, thus missing the opportunity to investigate how antibiotics and ARGs relate. Furthermore, antibiotic (multi)resistance has been receiving ever growing attention from researchers, policy-makers, businesses and civil society. Our aim was to collect the limited data on antibiotic concentrations and ARG abundance currently available to explore if a relationship could be defined in surface waters, sediments and wastewaters. A metric of antibiotic selective pressure, i.e. the sum of concentrations corrected for microbial inhibition potency, was used to correlate the presence of antibiotics in the environment to total relative abundance of ARG while controlling for basic sources of non-independent variability, such as country, year, study, sample and antibiotic class. The results of this meta-analysis show a significant statistical effect of antibiotic pressure and type of environmental compartment on the increase of ARG abundance even at very low levels. If global environmental antibiotic pollution continues, ARG abundance is expected to continue as well. Moreover, our analysis emphasizes the importance of integrating existing information particularly when attempting to describe complex relationships with limited mechanistic understanding.",Music festivals and drugs: Wastewater analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599351,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"Drug consumption in individual cities, regions, and at various music events and festivals across the EU has generally been monitored via questionnaires, patients' medical data, and police reports. However, an overview of drug consumption obtained from these methods can be negatively affected by various subjective factors. We aimed to investigate an association between levels of target drugs in wastewater, music genres, and festival courses. The occurrence of illicit drugs, their metabolites, and psychoactive compounds was investigated in the influent of six wastewater treatment plants in the Czech and Slovak Republic during seven large-scale music festivals from different music genres: metal, rock, pop, country and folk, ethnic, multi-genre, dance, and trance. The total number of participants included >130,000 active festival attendees. The association between music genre and illicit drug and/or psychoactive pharmaceutical consumptions is discussed on the basis of the results obtained through wastewater analyses. The observed trend was similar to worldwide published data with a specific local phenomenon of methamphetamine prevalence that did not significantly change between music events. Increased specific loads of cocaine (measured as its metabolite benzoylecgonine) and Ecstasy, along with some cannabis, were mainly observed during pop/rock and dance music festivals. However, there was no significant increase observed in the specific loads of all monitored psychoactive pharmaceuticals. This study demonstrates that the abuse of some illicit drugs is closely associated with specific music preferences.",Divergent changes in cropping patterns and their effects on grain production under different agro-ecosystems over high latitudes in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599350,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"Drastic rice paddy expansion and rapid upland crop loss have occurred over high latitudes in China, which would affect national food security. Different agro-ecosystems (i.e., state farms guided by the central government for agriculture and private farms guided by individual farmers for agriculture) could lead to different agricultural land use patterns; but this topic has not been investigated, which has limited our understanding of the dynamics of cropping patterns (i.e., rice paddies and upland crops) under different agro-ecosystems and their effect on total grain production. Thus, this study examined these issues over high latitudes in China. The results showed that: the developed methodology for determining cropping patterns presented high accuracy (over 90%). Based on the cropping pattern data, first, a satellite evidence of substantial increase in rice paddies with the loss of upland crops was found, and the large-scale conversion from upland crops to rice paddies has become the principal land use changes during the period of 2000-2015. Second, the new phenomenon was observed with rice paddies in state farms expanding at faster rates (at proportions of 12.98%-70.11%) than those in private farms (4.86%-30.48%). Third, the conversion of upland crops into rice paddies contributed 10.69% of the net increase in grain, which played a significant role in ensuring food security. The study provided new evidence of different changes in cropping patterns under different agro-ecosystems, thereby affecting rice cropping pattern and total grain production. This information is important for understanding and guiding the response to food sustainability and environmental issues.",Net primary productivity dynamics and associated hydrological driving factors in the floodplain wetland of China's largest freshwater lake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599349,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"Wetlands are thought to be the most unique ecosystem in the world which plays an important role in water and material circulation. However, investigation of ecosystem dynamics in those lake floodplain wetlands that suffering rapid and significant short-term water level fluctuation is quite a challenge. In this study, the short- and long-term characteristics of vegetation NPP (net primary productivity) and their driving mechanism were investigated in the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland, an important international wetland that listed in the Global Eco-region by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Attempts were achieved through validating the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model based on observed biomasses of different vegetation types and reconstructed continuous high spatiotemporal resolution (30 m and 16 days) of NDVI data during 2000-2015 according to the fused Landsat and MODIS data. Major result indicates that the intra-annual variation of NPP of most vegetation types shows two peaks in a year due to combined effects of vegetation growth rhythm and seasonal exposure of the lake floodplain. Annual NPP of the lake floodplain ranges in 360.09-735.94 gC/m2 and shows an increasing trend during the study period. The change of NPP in space indicates that the distribution elevation of the major vegetation types decreased and evoluted toward the center lake floodplain. Different from the terrestrial ecosystem, inundation duration is the dominant factor that controls NPP dynamics in the lake floodplain, while the influences of other meteorological factors are much weakened. Recent decline of lake water level was the major reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of annual and seasonal vegetation NPP in the lake floodplain.",Assessment of human indoor exposure to PAHs during the heating and non-heating season: Role of window films as passive air samplers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599348,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 27,"The study of indoor organic film on planar surfaces has been shown to be important to assess the transport and fate of organic pollutants in indoor environments. Limited research showed the relationship between equilibrium status of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the growth days for indoor window films. To accomplish this goal, indoor window film samples were collected in relation to film growth days in Northeast China. PAHs were frequently detected in window films collected during heating season (H-season), with concentrations significantly higher than that of non-heating season (NH-season). Accumulation characteristics of PAH suggested that PAH concentrations (ng/m2 film) were growing near-linearly with time. Partitioning status for PAHs between gas and window films under different accumulation stage from 1 to 11 weeks was investigated during the two seasons. The equilibrium status of PAHs in the films suggested that the octanol-air partition coefficient (logKOA) of the targeted PAHs should be approximately <12 in order to reached the equilibrium stage within 11 weeks of growth. For all the growth days, the proportion of samples that reached equilibrium status for PAHs in the indoor window film samples were further calculated. The total air concentration of the target PAHs were predicted, giving median values of 900 and 240 ng/m3 in H-season and NH-season, respectively. Human health risk posed by PAHs was calculated in this research showing greater risks found for H-season than NH-season. The estimated incremental lifetime cancer risks were considered as safe with values lower than the WHO recommended guideline.",Watershed diffuse pollution dynamics and response to land development assessment with riverine sediments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599347,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Sediment cores can reflect diffuse pollution history due to the accumulation of pollutants over time, therefore, the quantitative relationship between the sedimentation flux of pollutants and diffuse loads can identify the historical change. Sediment cores were collected from two river reaches in a small agricultural watershed (143 km2), and the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were determined. The sediments were dated using 210Pb isotope radioactivity and the TN and TP sedimentation flux was calculated with Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) and Constant Initial Concentration (CIC) models. Watershed loss loads were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the same temporal period. As the similar natural condition in the post-depositional period of sediments, a linear regression model was used to analyze the relationship between TN and TP sedimentation flux and the hindcast model data. The TP sedimentation flux showed a clear positive relationship with its simulated load (R2 = 0.600 and 0.664) using the CRS model, and better reflected long-term diffuse pollution loss dynamics than nitrogen. The impacts of land use change on diffuse pollution loading were identified with the combination of sedimentation flux from different reaches and watershed modeling. During the expansion of paddy land in the lower reach, the difference of TP sedimentation flux between upper and lower reaches narrowed, while gap of TN sedimentation flux increased. Base on the lateral correlations of two sections, the sediment concentration of TP was more reliable for the long term diffuse pollution assessment under land development."

The device is based on ammonia formation from ammonium ion by means of NaOH addition to the vitreous humor sample and its detection with a pH chemical indicator in the gas phase above the vitreous humor sample. From the gas phase, ammonia diffuses through a polymeric membrane and it is trapped and detected with a droplet of pH indicator thymol blue. The color change of the droplet is measured using a smartphone camera. Under optimal conditions, the device showed a limit of detection of 0.2mM, with between days precision of ≤ 15% expressed as relative standard deviation, and an accuracy between days from 88.3% to 114.5%. This homemade gas diffusion analytical device was successfully used for the determination of ammonia in vitreous humor samples from forensic autopsies. The results obtained with the proposed method, although for a limited number, showed a close correlation with the data obtained with an instrumental analysis based on capillary electrophoresis. Moreover a significant correlation was also found between the results of the present method and the time elapsed since death by a simple evaluation of the color intensity. In conclusion, this preliminary study showed that the proposed device, after adequate validation, could be a promising tool for a presumptive estimation of the time since death directly at the crime scene.",DNA recovery from gelatin fingerprint lifters by direct proteolytic digestion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599334,Forensic science international,2019 02 22,"Fingerprints are a valuable source for DNA profiling in forensic investigations. In practice, the fingerprints are routinely visualized first by powder staining and then often transferred to tapes or gelatin lifters for storage or examination. If at all, fingerprints are usually sampled for DNA in a second step. To target the DNA sampling in an optimal way, it is essential to know how much of the DNA in the sample remains in place and how much is transferred to the lifter. In the present study we addressed this question analyzing 16 pairs of thumb prints and revealed that more than 80% of the DNA from a fingerprint is transferred to the gelatin lifter. Therefore, subsequent DNA sampling of the stored gelatin lifters appears more promising than recovery of the residual DNA from the original fingerprint. Furthermore, as a proof of principle, we developed a protocol for the direct extraction of DNA from gelatin fingerprint lifters by proteolytic digestion of the gelatin matrix followed by organic extraction. We show that DNA recovery from gelatin lifters by this direct extraction protocol is more efficient compared to swabbing the lifter followed by standard magnetic bead extraction of swabs. However, given the more elaborate protocol for direct extraction, we would still recommend the swab technique as the method of choice for forensic routine work.","How to recognise the traces left on a crime scene by a 3D-printed Liberator? Part 2. Elements of ammunition, marks on the weapons and polymer fragments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599333,Forensic science international,2019 02 15,"The Liberator is a firearm that can be manufactured from its blueprints by the means of a 3D-printer. This handgun is composed of nineteen pieces: eighteen made of printed polymer and one metallic nail. This study focuses on the physical traces which can be found and exploited from a forensic point of view after the discharging of such types of pistols. Two main aspects have been investigated: (1) whether it can be inferred that a 3D-printed handgun was used when investigating a scene; (2) when presuming the use of a 3D-printed Liberator on a scene. Six Liberators were manufactured, assembled and discharged. The discharge occurred under controlled conditions to allow the collection of ballistics data and traces produced by the shooting. Elements of ammunition - cartridge cases and projectiles - that were fired during an experimental campaign appeared to carry polymeric materials (flakes, melted polymer or both). Besides, we observed that the fired ammunition elements lacked traditional marks left by the metal pieces of a conventional firearm. Indeed, the projectiles did not carry rifling marks and the cartridge cases were found torn or swollen. Fragments or larger pieces of polymer were found, mostly on the ground, near the location of the discharge, up to nine metres away. The impression of the cartridge case head stamp was also found on a part of the Liberator called the ""hammer body"". This study showed that the discharge of a 3D-printed Liberator is expected to produce traces that can be transferred onto and recovered from the printed firearm, the cartridge case, the projectile, the target, and the environment of the discharge. These traces are different from those left by conventional firearms. When found on investigation scenes, some of these traces can inform on the use of a 3D-printed handgun and contribute to the reconstruction of a shooting event involving such a weapon. This study suggests that the approach adopted when investigating a scene must be adapted in terms of traceology when the use of such firearm is suspected.",Concurrent validity of the GAITRite electronic walkway and the 10-m walk test for measurement of walking speed after stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599332,Gait & posture,2019 04 23,"Walking speed is used to assess functional status, predict recovery, prescribe exercise, and track functional progress after stroke.

Magnetic biopolymer (CABs-MO) was synthesized by the entrapment of nanocrystalline MnO2 in the polymeric microcapsules of calcium alginate (CABs). Batch experiments were conducted under constant pH (6.5), temperature (25OC), different initial concentrations (30-300 mg L-1) and contact times (0-48 h) to study the adsorption isotherms and removal kinetics of pristine (CABs) and hybrid biopolymer (CABs-MO) for the removal of As and Cd. The pseudo-equilibrium process was mathematically well explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetic (R2 ≥ 0.99) and Langmuir isotherm model (R2 ≥ 0.99) with the highest monolayer sorption capacity of 63.6 mg g-1 for Cd on CABs-MO. The As removal rate was maximum up to 6.5 mg g-1 after 12 h of contact period in a single contaminant system than in the mixed contaminant (As + Cd) system (0.8 mg g-1), though the effect was non-significant for Cd (p < 0.05; t-test). The performance of the 10 mM HCl as a regenerating agent was superior (for As in comparison to Cd, p < 0.05; t-test) compared to distilled water (DW) through three to five regeneration cycles. Therefore, the obtained results clearly validate the feasibility of CABs-MO as a potential promising adsorbent for removing metal contaminants from the wastewater. Further research is required to study the decontamination of emerging contaminants with such novel composite beads characterized by varied physico-chemical properties.",Ethanol production from sugarcane bagasse: Use of different fermentation strategies to enhance an environmental-friendly process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599329,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using sugarcane bagasse as substrate was developed using batch and fed-batch mode. Acid, alkali, hydrothermal and hydrogen peroxide pretreatments to the sugarcane bagasse were tested. Experiments were carried out to optimize the enzyme load of cellulases and β-glucosidase. Four strains, two of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and two of Kluyveromyces marxianus yeast species were evaluate using SSF to produce ethanol. A kinetic study in bioreactor was carried out to optimize the SSF. The batch process was optimized using 1.0 g/L of inoculum, 15.0 FPU/g cellulose of cellulases and 6.0% of initial cellulose reaching 92.0% of theoretical ethanol yield after 18 h using the bagasse pretreate by acid-alkali and S. cerevisiae PE-2. The fed-batch process with enzyme load three times lower than that was used in batch process, obtained 88% of theoretical ethanol yield in 40 h.

Environmental innovation in public participation in China and Malaysia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599327,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Much of the environmental policy literature tends to focus on democratic contexts where environmental innovation is a product of pluralistic interactions among state and non-state actors. By bringing the (authoritarian) politics into the analysis, this article seeks to discover the processes leading to environmental innovation under nondemocratic conditions. We utilise case studies in China and then-nondemocratic Malaysia, both grappling with the twin imperatives of rapid development and social control, where the governments initiated environmental innovations to expand space for public participation and monitoring against noxious plants. We adapt the conceptual framework of ""environmental innovation strategies"" to illustrate the mechanisms underpinning innovative practices that address environmental issues by going beyond pre-existing public regulatory provisions. We highlight aspects distinguishing the interactive processes under authoritarianism. First, the drivers of environmental innovation are contingent on the government's role and concerns over social control and state legitimacy. Second, due to limits over political space, environmental nongovernmental organisations (ENGOs) act as issue entrepreneurs-instead of policy entrepreneurs-who turn conditions into problems deserving government attention and solution, as they engage in conflictual interactions with state authorities. Third, such innovations can strengthen nondemocratic governance while not fully plugging the gaps in existing environmental regulations. This contributes to illuminating the behaviours of state-based environmental innovators under illiberal political regimes, potentially offering lessons to activists on how to stimulate further innovations in such contexts."

Trehalose (Tr), a novel autophagy activator, has been shown to exert cytoprotective effect in numerous pathological processes. However, it is yet to be established whether Tr affords protection against Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Here, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of Tr on Cd-induced hepatic injury in rats. First, Cd-elevated serum hepatic enzymes and liver pathological changes were significantly ameliorated by Tr treatment. Also, Tr remarkably improved Cd-mediated oxidative stress and antioxidant status in serum, indicating its anti-oxidant action for the whole body. Cd-stimulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and subsequent elevated expression of Nrf2-downstream targets in rat liver were significantly inhibited by Tr treatment. Simultaneously, Cd-elevated protein levels of hepatic antioxidant enzymes were markedly downregulated by administration with Tr. Moreover, Cd-induced autophagy inhibition in liver tissues was noticeably restored by Tr, evidenced by immunohistochemical analysis and immunoblot assays. Additionally, Tr treatment significantly mitigated Cd-induced apoptosis in hepatic tissues via inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, these observations demonstrate that Tr treatment alleviates Cd-induced liver injury by blocking Nrf2 pathway, restoring autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis.",Genetic influences on white matter and metabolism abnormal change in Alzheimer's disease: Meta-analysis for neuroimaging research on presenilin 1 mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599314,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 01 29,"Mutations in the presenilin1 (PSEN1) cause familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), providing a special opportunity to study pre-symptomatic individuals who would be predicted to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the future. However, whether presenilin1 (PSEN1) genotype and neuroimaging markers is a harbinger of AD remains controversial. We aimed to explore the association of PSEN1 genotype with neuroimaging markers of AD: white matter integrity, cerebral amyloid deposition and brain metabolism. We reviewed studies of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), amyloid deposition and cerebral metabolism in patients with AD and control, in order to address the relative change of white matter microstructural associated with PSEN1 genotype. We performed a systematic meta-analysis and review of 11 cross-sectional studies identiﬁed in several database from 2008 to 2018 (n = 165). The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) value was calculated to estimate the association between PSEN1 and white matter change and brain metabolism. PSEN1 mutation carrier status was associated with mean diffusivity (MD) change (pooled SMD: 2.29; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.53; p < 0.001) and increased cerebral amyloid positron emission tomography tracer (pooled SMD: 3.78, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.53, p = 0.007). PSEN1 was not associated with white matter metabolism change (p = 0.069). PSEN1 was associated with mean diffusivity (MD) increase in DTI markers and decreased brain metabolism.

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent in vitro reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid-liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how in vitro reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.",Oxidative stress in ryegrass growing under different air pollution levels and its likely effects on pollen allergenicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599310,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"In the present work, for the first time in the literature, the relationship between the degree of air pollution, the physiological state of the plants and the allergenic capacity of the pollen they produce has been studied. The physiological state of Lolium perenne plants growing in two cities with a high degree of traffic, but with different levels of air pollution, Madrid and Ciudad Real, have been explored. The photosynthetic efficiency of the plants through the emission of fluorescence of PSII, the degree of oxidative stress (enzymatic activities related to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle), the redox state (reduced and oxidized forms of ascorbate and glutathione) and the concentration of malondialdehyde have been evaluated. During the development period of the plants, Madrid had higher levels of NO2 and SO2 than Ciudad Real. The greater degree of air pollution suffered by Madrid plants was reflected on a lower photosynthetic efficiency and a greater degree of oxidative stress. In addition, NADPH oxidase activity and H2O2 levels in pollen from Madrid were significantly higher, suggesting a likely higher allergenic capacity of this pollen associated to a higher air pollution.",Effect of post-silking drought stress on the expression profiles of genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism during leaf senescence in maize (Zea mays L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599307,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Drought stress during reproductive growth stages greatly affects the growth and productivity of maize plants. To better understand the metabolic regulation during post-silking drought (PD) stress, an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was performed at the late stage of leaf senescence in maize. Physiological measurements showed that PD stress reduced both leaf carbon and nitrogen levels. A total of 4013 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found based on RNA-Seq analysis, 115 of which were identified to be involved in photosynthesis and in the metabolism of sucrose, starch, and amino acids. Among these DEGs, 14 genes involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated. The genes coding for sucrose and pectin synthesis were up-regulated under PD stress. The two genes of asparagine synthetase (ZmAS3 and ZmAS4), which are responsible for nitrogen remobilization in leaves, were also significantly induced by the drought treatment. The expression profiles of these genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism suggests their regulatory roles during drought-induced leaf senescence.",24-Epibrassinolide application in plants: An implication for improving drought stress tolerance in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599306,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Drought stress is one of most dramatic abiotic stresses, reduces crop yield significantly. Application of hormones proved as an effective drought stress ameliorating approach. 24-Epibrassinolide (EBL), an active by-product from brassinolide biosynthesis increases drought stress tolerance in plants significantly. EBL application enhances plant growth and development under drought stress by acting as signalling compound in different physiological processes. This article discussed potential role of 24-epibrassinolide application and drought tolerance in plants. Briefly, EBL sustains or improves plant growth and yield by enhancing carbon assimilation rate, maintaining a balance between ROS and antioxidants and also plays important role in solute accumulation and water relations. Furthermore, we also compared different EBL application methods and concluded that seed priming and foliar application are more productive as compared with root application method. In conclusion, EBL is very impressive phyto-hormone, which can ameliorate drought stress induced detrimental effects in plants.","Changes in grapevine DNA methylation and polyphenols content induced by solar ultraviolet-B radiation, water deficit and abscisic acid spray treatments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599305,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Environment and crop management shape plant's phenotype. Argentinean high-altitude vineyards are characterized by elevated solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) and water deficit (D) that enhance enological quality for red winemaking. These signals promote phenolics accumulation in leaves and berries, being the responses mediated by abscisic acid (ABA). DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and may affect grapevine growth, development and acclimation, since methylation patterns are mitotically heritable. Berry skins low molecular weight polyphenols (LMWP) were characterized in field grown Vitis vinifera L. cv. Malbec plants exposed to contrasting UV-B, D, and ABA treatments during one season. The next season early fruit shoots were epigenetically (methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism; MSAP) and biochemically (LMWP) characterized. Unstable epigenetic patterns and/or stochastic stress-induced methylation changes were observed. UV-B and D were the treatments that induced greater number of DNA methylation changes respect to Control; and UV-B promoted global hypermethylation of MSAP epiloci. Sequenced MSAP fragments associated with UV-B and ABA showed similarities with transcriptional regulators and ubiquitin ligases proteins activated by light. UV-B was associated with flavonols accumulation in berries and with hydroxycinnamic acids in the next season fruit shoots, suggesting that DNA methylation could regulate the LMWP accumulation and participate in acclimation mechanisms.",Splenic hematoma may present as large bowel obstruction: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599304,International journal of surgery case reports,2019 02 11,"Large bowel obstruction (LBO) warrants prompt evaluation and management.

This deterioration results not only from changes in the optical system but also from the functional degradation of the central visual cortex. Although numerous studies have explored the mechanisms of age-related influences on vision, they have failed to acknowledge the significance of neuronal correlation in dysfunction of the visual cortex. Previous research has focused on the functional degradation of individual neurons, with age-induced changes in correlation between neurons still unknown. In the present study, using electrophysiological techniques, we investigated the age-related changes in neuronal correlation in the macaque V1 area and the underlying mechanisms of those changes. Our results showed that aging led to an increase in the correlation of neurons and changed the noise-signal correlation structure, which may impact population coding efficiency. Furthermore, we found that the age-induced decline in the inhibitory circuitry accounted for the alteration in neuronal correlation.",Targeting carbon nanotubes based on IGF-1R for photothermal therapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer guided by optical imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599289,Biomaterials,2019 01 19,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. The existing therapeutic regimen in the clinic for advanced inoperable carcinomas are far from satisfactory, thus it is urgent to seek more effective anticancer strategies. In the pursuit of novel, more effective interventions, photothermal therapy (PTT) based on nanomaterials has attracted increased attention. Recent advances in related fields have catalyzed the generation of novel nanoprobes, such as organic dyes, metal nanoparticles. However, organic dyes are poorly stable and easy to quench while metal nanoparticles with potential metal toxicity are difficult to degrade, both of which have low light-to-heat conversion efficiency, broad spectrum of anti-tumor effects, and lack of tumor targeting specificity. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can remedy the above inadequacies. Herein, we report our water-soluble, bio-stable and low-toxicity SWNTs with excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. Specific modifications can enable visualization of the aggregate characteristics of SWNTs at the macroscopic or microscopic level in tumors. The dye-conjugated SWNTs bound with targeting antibodies that can induce them specifically targeting to pancreatic tumors for purposes of performing dyes imaging-guided cytotoxic PTT. PTT using this method achieves precise and excellent curative effects with minimal adverse effects, thus providing a promising strategy for anticancer therapy.","Dimensional structure, psychometric properties, and sex invariance of a Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) translation of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) in Malaysian Malay adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599288,Body image,2019 04 08,"The 34-item Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) is a widely-used measure of multidimensional body image. Here, we examined the psychometric properties of a Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) translation of the MBSRQ-AS. A sample of 629 Malaysian Malays (women n = 315) completed the MBSRQ-AS, as well as measures of body appreciation, psychological well-being, perceptions of appearance ideals, and internalisation of appearance ideals. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the MBSRQ-AS items reduced to four dimensions, although one factor had less-than-adequate internal consistency. Omitting this factor resulted in a 23-item 3-factor solution, which we tested for fit using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) alongside the parent 5-factor model. CFA indicated that both models had good fit on some indices, but less-than-ideal fit on other indices, with the 3-factor model showing comparatively better fit. Multi-group CFA indicated that it was not possible to achieve scalar invariance across sex, but internal consistency coefficients were adequate. Evidence of construct validity, as assessed through correlations between MBSRQ-AS scores and additional measures, was mixed.

In BDM, the adsorption, enzymatic degradation and membrane separation demonstrated a synergism effect on pollutant removal. At first, the fabrication methods of BDM were investigated, and the mixed filtration for laccases and CNTs showed a better performance than the stepwise filtration. Furthermore, the operation parameters of BDM, including CNTs and laccase loading amounts, dye concentration, agitation speed and transmembrane pressure (TMP), were studied. Suitable CNTs and laccase amounts could reduce filtration resistance and increase catalysis efficiency, while moderate TMP and agitation speed were in favor of boosting the BDM structure for catalysis and permeability. Optimized operation parameters (CNT loading amount = 20 g m-2, laccase loading amount = 74.6 g m-2, agitation speed = 100 rpm, and TMP = 1.0 bar) sustained a high removal rate, and the flux was over 120 L m-2 h-1, even for 7 operation cycle' tests. BDM exhibited an excellent dye removal rate, stable flux and great antifouling capacity, on the ground that adsorption saturation and foulant may be alleviated ""online and in-situ"" by the enzymatic degradation. Afterwards, the bionic layer on BDM, after absorption saturation and catalyst deactivation, could be eliminated rapidly by carrying out a simple backwash cleaning operation, then a new one could be fabricated immediately. Therefore, BDM is a good candidate for functional membrane materials in future water treatment.","Sunlight driven photolytic ozonation as an advanced oxidation process in the oxidation of bezafibrate, cotinine and iopamidol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599282,Water research,2019 02 03,"This study investigates the efficacy of the system O3/sunlight radiation compared to dark ozonation when treating pharmaceuticals compounds of different reactivity, namely bezafibrate, cotinine, and iopamidol. Results show the beneficial effects of simulated sunlight radiation (300-800 nm) when treating ozone recalcitrant compounds such as cotinine and iopamidol. The system O3/sunlight radiation increased mineralization extent in all cases if compared to dark ozonation. Transformation products identified in individual runs suggest that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main route of bezafibrate ozonation. Hydroxylation seems to be the preferential path in cotinine abatement while H abstraction from alcoholic moieties is suggested in the case of iopamidol. Toxicity of intermediates was approximately evaluated by QSAR methodologies and experimentally through Daphnia Magna survival after 24 h. As a rule of thumb, initial intermediates generated are even more toxic than parent compounds, however, after 120 min of treatment, toxicity significantly decreased.

Results showed that whey mono-digestion was feasible at mesophilic conditions, while at thermophilic conditions frequent acidification incidents were recorded. The limited buffer capacity of the influent feedstock was responsible for the unstable anaerobic digestion process. The co-digestion of cheese whey with cattle manure maintained the pH levels higher than 7.0, and therefore, stable methane production rates were achieved without any significant accumulation of volatile fatty acids. An additional enhancement of the methane productivity was achieved by in-situ H2 dispersion. Microbial community composition was investigated using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and results were correlated with process parameters. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the dominant archaea during the whole experiment at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions."

Group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors (mGlu1/5 subtypes) are believed to be critical in this event. We thus in this study investigated changes in mGlu1/5 receptor expression and function in the rat mPFC in response to conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by amphetamine. Repeated amphetamine administration (2.5 mg/kg, once daily on alternate days for 10 days) induced reliable CPP. In the mPFC, surface expression of mGlu5 receptors was elevated in rats after amphetamine conditioning. mGlu5 receptors were also increased at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites in amphetamine-conditioned rats. Expression of mGlu1 receptors was stable in surface and synaptic compartments, while it was elevated in the extrasynaptic location. In mPFC neurons, the mGlu1/5 agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide signaling pathway was upregulated in its efficacy following amphetamine conditioning. The mGlu1/5 agonist-stimulated Src kinase phosphorylation was also augmented in rats treated with amphetamine. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of mPFC mGlu1/5 receptors to amphetamine-induced CPP. Amphetamine conditioning results in the upregulation of mGlu1/5 receptor expression at subcellular and/or subsynaptic levels and mGlu1/5-mediated postreceptor signaling in mPFC neurons.","Enhanced Central Neural Gain Compensates Acoustic Trauma-induced Cochlear Impairment, but Unlikely Correlates with Tinnitus and Hyperacusis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599268,Neuroscience,2019 06 07,"For successful future therapeutic strategies for tinnitus and hyperacusis, a subcategorization of both conditions on the basis of differentiated neural correlates would be of invaluable advantage. In the present study, we used our refined operant conditioning animal model to divide equally noise-exposed rats into groups with either tinnitus or hyperacusis, with neither condition, or with both conditions co-occurring simultaneously. Using click stimulus and noise burst-evoked Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions, no hearing threshold difference was observed between any of the groups. However, animals with neither tinnitus nor hyperacusis responded to noise trauma with shortened ABR wave I and IV latencies and elevated central neuronal gain (increased ABR wave IV/I amplitude ratio), which was previously assumed in most of the literature to be a neural correlate for tinnitus. In contrast, animals with tinnitus had reduced neural response gain and delayed ABR wave I and IV latencies, while animals with hyperacusis showed none of these changes. Preliminary studies, aimed at establishing comparable non-invasive objective tools for identifying tinnitus in humans and animals, confirmed reduced central gain and delayed response latency in human and animals. Moreover, the first ever resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) analyses comparing humans and rats with and without tinnitus showed reduced rs-fMRI activities in the auditory cortex in both patients and animals with tinnitus. These findings encourage further efforts to establish non-invasive diagnostic tools that can be used in humans and animals alike and give hope for differentiated classification of tinnitus and hyperacusis.",Identification of the Genome-wide Expression Patterns of Long Non-coding RNAs and mRNAs in Mice with Streptozotocin-induced Diabetic Neuropathic Pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599267,Neuroscience,2019 05 15,"Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP), an early symptom of diabetic neuropathy, involves complex mechanisms. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of various human diseases. Here, we investigated the genome-wide expression patterns of lncRNAs and genes in the spinal dorsal horn of mice with streptozotocin-induced DNP. Microarray analysis identified 1481 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 1096 DE mRNAs in DNP mice. Functional analysis showed that transforming growth factor-beta receptor binding was the most significant molecular function and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling was the most significant pathway of DE mRNAs. Calcium ion transport was the second most significant biological process of DE lncRNAs. Finally, we found 289 neighboring and 57 overlapping lncRNA-mRNA pairs, including ENSMUST00000150952-Mbp and AK081017-Usp15, which may be involved in DNP pathogenesis. Microarray data were validated through quantitative PCR of selected lncRNAs and mRNAs. These results suggest that aberrant expression of lncRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of DNP.",Region-Specific Differences in Morphometric Features and Synaptic Colocalization of Astrocytes During Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599266,Neuroscience,2019 05 15,"It is well established that astrocytes play pivotal roles in neuronal synapse formation and maturation as well as in the modulation of synaptic transmission. Despite their general importance for brain function, relatively little is known about the maturation of astrocytes during normal postnatal development, especially during adolescence, and how that maturation may influence astroglial-synaptic contact. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHipp) are critical for executive function, memory, and their effective integration. Further, both regions undergo significant functional changes during adolescence and early adulthood that are believed to mediate these functions. However, it is unclear the extent to which astrocytes change during these late developmental periods, nor is it clear whether their association with functional synapses shifts as adolescent and young adult maturation proceeds. Here we utilize an astrocyte-specific viral labeling approach paired with high-resolution single-cell astrocyte imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction to determine whether mPFC and dHipp astrocytes have temporally distinct maturation trajectories. mPFC astrocytes, in particular, continue to mature well into emerging adulthood (postnatal day 70). Moreover, this ongoing maturation is accompanied by a substantial increase in colocalization of astrocytes with the postsynaptic neuronal marker, PSD-95. Taken together, these data provide novel insight into region-specific astrocyte-synapse interactions in late CNS development and into adulthood, thus raising implications for the mechanism of post-adolescent development of the mPFC.",High-fat Diet and Physical Exercise Differentially Modulate Adult Neurogenesis in the Mouse Hypothalamus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599265,Neuroscience,2019 05 15,"The hypothalamus has emerged as a novel neurogenic niche in the adult brain during the past decade. However, little is known about its regulation and the role hypothalamic neurogenesis might play in body weight and appetite control. High-fat diet (HFD) has been demonstrated to induce an inflammatory response and to alter neurogenesis in the hypothalamus and functional outcome measures, e.g. body weight. Such modulation poses similarities to what is known from adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is highly responsive to lifestyle factors, such as nutrition or physical exercise. With the rising question of a principle of neurogenic stimulation by lifestyle in the adult brain as a physiological regulatory mechanism of central and peripheral functions, exercise is interventionally applied in obesity and metabolic syndrome conditions, promoting weight loss and improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. To investigate the potential pro-neurogenic cellular processes underlying such beneficial peripheral outcomes, we exposed adult female mice to HFD together with physical exercise and evaluated neurogenesis and inflammatory markers in the arcuate nucleus (ArcN) of the hypothalamus. We found that HFD increased neurogenesis, whereas physical exercise stimulated cell proliferation. HFD also increased the amount of microglia, which was counteracted by physical exercise. Physiologically, exercise increased food and fat intake but reduced HFD-induced body weight gain. These findings support the hypothesis that hypothalamic neurogenesis may represent a counter-regulatory mechanism in response to environmental or physiological insults to maintain energy balance.",Abnormal auditory mismatch fields in adults with autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599264,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 30,"The auditory mismatch field (MMF) is a pre-attentive processing component, reflecting neural discrimination and inhibitory processing.

To better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory language discrimination of vowel stimuli in individuals with ASD, magnetoencephalography was used to measure MMFs during an auditory oddball paradigm with vowel stimuli (/a/ and /u/) in adults with ASD.

The MMF was delayed in adults with ASD (188.90 ± 5.8 ms) as compared to the TD participants (173.08 ± 4.31 ms, p < 0.05). Replicating previous findings in children, the earlier M100 component to single stimulus tokens was also delayed in adults with ASD (108.59 ± 4.1 ms) compared to the TD participants (94.60 ± 3.0 ms, p < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between delayed M100 latency and MMF latency. Furthermore, whereas TD participants showed a leftward lateralization of MMF amplitude, participants with ASD showed an opposite (rightward) lateralization. Findings suggest that adults with ASD have hemispherically- and temporally- abnormal auditory discrimination processing in addition to and distinct from abnormal neurophysiological mechanisms in earlier cortical responses.",Significant increasing of DISC2 long non-coding RNA expression as a potential biomarker in bipolar disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599263,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder that is often misdiagnosed with ineffective treatment. It has strong genetic component but unknown pathophysiology. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently recognized as one of the important genetic factors and are considered as one of the regulatory mechanisms of nervous system. Given that lncRNAs may be diagnostic biomarkers for BD, we aimed to quantify the levels of DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA transcripts. The levels of DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA were tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 50 BD and 50 controls by real-time PCR. In addition, we performed ROC curve analysis as well as correlation analysis between the gene expression and some clinical features of BD cases. Computational analysis of miRNAs binding sites and CpG Islands on DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA was performed as well. Signiﬁcant down-regulation of DISC1 and up-regulation of DISC2 were observed in BD cases compared with controls. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA were 0.76 and 0.68 respectively. There was no signiﬁcant correlation between the levels of mRNA expression in PBMCs of BD patients and clinical features. These data demonstrated that DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA expression was potentially associated with an increased risk of bipolar disorder and might involve several molecular mechanisms. Our results revealed that the transcript levels of DISC1 and DISC2 lncRNA could be considered as a good putative biomarker for individuals with bipolar disorder.",Neurofilament changes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid after acute ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599262,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 30,"Neurofilament light (NFL) is a well-validated biomarker for neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels have been shown after stroke, as well as in patients with a broad range of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Neurofilament heavy (NFH) belongs to the same family of structural proteins but it is less extensively studied. The potential of phosphorylated NFH (pNFH) as a stroke biomarker and for the prediction of clinical outcome is unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine the temporal pattern of NFL and pNFH concentrations in serum and CSF after acute ischemic stroke.",Loss of RIP3 initiates annihilation of high-fat diet initialized nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis: A mechanism involving Toll-like receptor 4 and oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599260,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent and complex disease that confers a high risk of severe liver disorders. Although such public and clinical health importance, very few effective therapies are presently available for NAFLD. Here, we showed that receptor-interacting kinase-3 (RIP3) was up-regulated in liver of mouse with hepatic steatosis induced by high fat diet (HFD). After 16 weeks on a HFD, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, hepatic steatosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress were significantly alleviated in liver of mice with the loss of RIP3. We provided mechanistic evidence that RIP3 knockdown attenuated hepatic dyslipidemia through preventing the expression of lipogenesis-associated genes. Furthermore, in the absence of RIP3, the transcription factor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway activated by HFD was blocked, accompanied with the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. We also found that RIP3 knockdown-induced activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf-2/HO-1) led to the inhibition of oxidative stress. The detrimental effects of RIP3 on hepatic steatosis and related pathologies were confirmed in palmitate (PAL)-treated mouse liver cells. Of note, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or PAL-activated TLR-4 resulted in the up-regulation of RIP3 that was accompanied by the elevated inflammation and lipid deposition, and these effects were reversed in TLR-4 knockdown cells. Furthermore, promoting Nrf-2 pathway activation effectively reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and RIP3 expression in PAL-stimulated cells, consequently leading to the suppression of cellular inflammation and lipid accumulation. In contrast, blocking Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling abrogated RIP3 knockdown-reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory response and lipid deposition in PAL-stimulated cells. Taken together, the present study helped to elucidate how HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was regulated by RIP3, via the TLR-4/NF-κB and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathways.",Rhodosporidium toruloides sir2-like genes remodelled the mitochondrial network to improve the phenotypes of ageing cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599259,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"It is known that mitochondria are associated with the ageing process, and the eukaryotic sir2 family of genes significantly affects cellular lifespan. The mammalian sir2 family affects mitochondrial function by regulating targets in different pathways, including oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial biosynthesis. This study reports that Rt-sirtuin2 and Rt-sirtuin4 genes transfections significantly impacted the lifespan of Rhodosporidium toruloides, and they can significantly improve cellular responses to H2O2 treatment, which induces cell senescence, and restore mitochondrial function. The Rt-sirtuin2 and Rt-sirtuin4 genes increase the expression of the mitochondria-associated proteins Mfn1, Mfn2, and Drp1 and the autophagy-associated proteins LC3-II, LC3-I, Beclin-1 and Parkin and reconstitute mitochondrial networks. Overall, the phenotypic reversal of senescent cells is achieved by regulating mitochondrial viability and mitochondrial autophagy. In vivo experiments with animals also confirmed the improvement of various ageing indexes by the Rt-sirtuin2 and Rt-sirtuin4 genes. Strategies for remodelling mitochondria and improving mitochondrial quality and function can reverse the state of human cells from an ageing phenotype to an active metabolic phenotype. The R. toruloides Sir2 genes can be used to prevent and treat diseases of ageing or mitochondrial dysfunction."

Despite being a relatively benign type of tumor, PXA often has an aggressive clinical course. The more malignant form of PXA is now known as anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (A-PXA) and is categorized as a grade III tumor. Clinical and genetic factors associated with malignant transformation remain unclear. In particular, typical genetic expression patterns in PXA and A-PXA remain unidentified.",Predictors of Nasoseptal Flap Use After Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Pituitary Mass Resection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599246,World neurosurgery,2019 02 17,The pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF) is the widely accepted reconstructive technique of choice for repair of larger skull base defects after endoscopic endonasal approaches. There is a dearth of literature examining the decision-making process regarding flap harvest. The objective of this study is to evaluate preoperative characteristics that predict the use of NSF reconstruction after endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of pituitary tumors.,Antimicrobial efficacy and mechanism of action of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers against opportunistic pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599243,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 09,"The aim of this study was to investigate a range of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer generations against Gram-positive and Gram-negative skin pathogens and to determine any differences in antimicrobial potency for different generations, characterising how differences in physicochemical properties influence antimicrobial efficacy. A range of tests were carried out, including viable count assays to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each dendrimer, membrane integrity studies and an inner membrane permeabilisation assay. This is supported by scanning electron microscopy imaging of the interactions observed between dendrimers and bacteria. The results of this study indicate that the antimicrobial efficacy of native PAMAM dendrimers is dependent on generation, concentration and terminal functionalities, for example, the concentration at 50% growth inhibition (MIC50) (µg/mL), against Staphylococcus aureus was between 26.77 for the G2-PAMAM-NH2 dendrimer and 2.881 for the G5-PAMAM-NH2 dendrimer. There was a strong correlation between membrane disruption and the determined biocidal activity, making it a key contributing mechanism of action. This study demonstrates that selection of the type of PAMAM dendrimer is important as their inherent antimicrobial efficacy varies according to their individual physicochemical properties. This understanding may pave the way for the development of enhanced dendrimer-based antimicrobial formulations and drug-delivery systems.",In silico studies and evaluation of antiparasitic role of a novel pyruvate phosphate dikinase inhibitor in Leishmania donovani infected macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599242,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 09,"The present work deals with the identification and characterization of a novel inhibitor Z220582104, specific to pyruvate phosphate dikinase, for leishmanicidal activities against free promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. We have used structure-based drug designing approaches and performed homology modelling, virtual screening and molecular dynamics studies. Primary mouse macrophages and macrophage cell line J774A1 were infected with promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. Both promastigotes and infected macrophages were subjected to treatment with the varying concentrations of Z220582104 or miltefosine for assessment of leishmanicidal activity. The novel inhibitor Z220582104 demonstrated growth inhibitory potential and reduced the viability of the free promastigotes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Z220582104 was also effective against the intracellular form of the parasites and reduced the number of amastigotes in macrophages and also lowered the parasite index, compared with the untreated infected macrophages. Although less effective compared with the miltefosine, Z220582104 is well tolerated by the dividing cells and normal human lymphocytes and monocytes with no adverse effects on the growth kinetics or viability. Our in silico and in vitro studies suggested that Leishmania donovani pyruvate phosphate dikinase could be a potential new drug target.",The dosing and monitoring of vancomycin: what is the best way forward?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599240,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 09,"We have evaluated the literature to review optimal dosing and monitoring of intravenous vancomycin in adults, in response to evolving understanding of targets associated with efficacy and toxicity. The area under the total concentration-time curve (0-24 h) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC24/MIC) is the most commonly accepted index to guide vancomycin dosing for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections, with a value of 400 h a widely recommended target for efficacy. Upper limits of AUC24 exposure of around 700 (mg/L).h have been proposed, based on the hypothesis that higher exposures of vancomycin are associated with an unacceptable risk of nephrotoxicity. If AUC24/MIC targets are used, sources of variability in the assessment of both AUC24 and MIC need to be considered. Current consensus guidelines recommend measuring trough vancomycin concentrations during intermittent dosing as a surrogate for the AUC24. Trough concentrations are a misleading surrogate for AUC24 and a poor end-point in themselves. AUC24 estimation using log-linear pharmacokinetic methods based on two plasma concentrations, or Bayesian methods are superior. Alternatively, a single concentration measured during continuous infusion allows simple AUC24 estimation and dose-adjustment. All of these methods have logistical challenges which must be overcome if they are to be adopted successfully.",Numerical investigations of bone remodelling around the mouse mandibular molar primordia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599239,Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,2019 06 13,"The formation of the alveolar bone, which houses the dental primordia, and later the roots of tooth, may serve as a model to approach general questions of alveolar bone formation. In this respect, this study aimed to investigate the potential interactions between the alveolar bone formation and tooth eruption by using finite element (FE) methods, and to figure out whether the expanding tooth systems induce shear stresses that lead to alveolar bone formation. 3D geometric surface models were generated from the 3D histological data of the heads of mice (C57 Bl/6J) ranging from stages embryonic (E) to postnatal (P) stages E15 to P20 using the reconstruction software 3-Matic. Bone, dentin, enamel and dental follicle around the primordia were generated and converted into 3D FE models. Models were imported into the FE software package MSC.Marc/Mentat. As material parameters of embryonic dentine, pulp, enamel, dental follicle, and bony structures basically are unknown, these were varied from 1% to 100% of the corresponding known material parameters for humans and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Surface loads were applied to the outside surface of dental follicle ranging from 0.1 to 5.0N/mm2. The validity of the model was analysed by comparing the activity pattern of the alveolar bone as determined in the histological study with the loading pattern from the numerical analysis. The results show that when varying the surface loads, the distribution of shear stresses remained same, and while varying the material properties of the hard tissues, the location of highest shear stresses remained stable. Comparison of the histologically determined growth regions with the distribution of shear stresses computed in the numerical model showed a very close agreement. The results provide a strong proof to support Blechschmidt's hypothesis that the bone in general is created under the influence of shear forces.","Anatomic conditions for bypass surgery between rostral (T7-T9) and caudal (L2, L4, S1) ventral roots to treat paralysis after spinal cord injury.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599238,Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft,2019 06 13,"Severe spinal cord injuries cause permanent neurological deficits and are still considered as inaccessible to efficient therapy. Injured spinal cord axons are unable to spontaneously regenerate. Re-establishing functional activity especially in the lower limbs by reinnervation of the caudal infra-lesional territories might represent an effective therapeutic strategy. Numerous surgical neurotizations have been developed to bridge the spinal cord lesion site and connect the intact supra-lesional portions of the spinal cord to peripheral nerves (spinal nerves, intercostal nerves) and muscles. The major disadvantage of these techniques is the increased hypersensitivity, spasticity and pathologic pain in the spinal cord injured patients, which occur due to the vigorous sprouting of injured afferent sensory fibers after reconstructive surgery. Using micro-surgical instruments and an operation microscope we performed detailed anatomical preparation of the vertebral canal and its content in five human cadavers. Our observations allow us to put forward the possibility to develop a more precise surgical approach, the so called ""ventral root bypass"" that avoids lesion of the dorsal roots and eliminates sensitivity complications. The proposed kind of neurotization has been neither used, nor put forward. The general opinion is that radix ventralis and radix dorsalis unite to form the spinal nerve inside the dural sac. This assumption is not accurate, because both radices leave the dural sac separately. This neglected anatomical feature allows a reliable intravertebral exposure of the dura-mater ensheathed ventral roots and their damage-preventing end-to-side neurorrhaphy by interpositional nerve grafts.",Long non-coding RNA SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer growth through repressing SAP30L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599235,Gene,2019 02 15,"Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in initiation and progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer. LncRNA SAP30L-AS1 is previously identified in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we further investigated the expression of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of action of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer. The expression of SAP30L-AS1 is found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cell line, respectively. Increased expression of SAP30L-AS1 is associated with greater Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor over survival of prostate cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and inhibits prostate cancer apoptosis. SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer proliferation and induces prostate cancer apoptosis. Furthermore, SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that SAP30L-AS1 physically binds to the promoter of SAP30L and represses SAP30L expression. The expression of SAP30L is negatively associated with that of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues. Rescue assays demonstrated that overexpression of SAP30L attenuated the roles of SAP30L-AS1 in promoting prostate cancer proliferation and inhibiting prostate cancer apoptosis. In conclusion, SAP30L-AS1 is upregulated and has oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via repressing SAP30L. Our data suggest that SAP30L-AS1 may be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.",MiR-199b represses porcine muscle satellite cells proliferation by targeting JAG1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599234,Gene,2019 02 21,"Pig is a useful medical model for humans due to its similarity in size and physiology. Skeletal muscle plays an essential role in body movement. However, the skeletal muscle injuries are common. Skeletal muscle function maintenance largely depends on preserving the regenerative capacity of muscle. Muscle satellite cells proliferation plays an essential role in postnatal muscle growth and regeneration. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms associated with muscle satellite cells proliferation is essential for devising the alternative treatments for muscle injury. Previous studies showed JAG1-Notch1 signaling pathway and miRNAs regulate the skeletal muscle development. JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway regulates the transcription of certain types of miRNAs which further affects target gene expression. However, the specific relationship between JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway and miRNAs during muscle development has not been established. We found overexpression of intracellular domain of the Notch1 protein (N1ICD) in porcine muscle satellite cells (PSCs) decreased miR-199b level. We demonstrated that miR-199b inhibits PSCs proliferation using the overexpression and inhibition of miR-199b experiment. We also found JAG1, the miR-199b target gene, promotes PSCs proliferation through activating the Notch1 signal pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-199b forms a feedback loop with the JAG1-Notch1 signal pathway to maintain the PSCs niche homeostasis. Our results of miRNAs and genes work collaboratively in regulating PSCs proliferation expand our understanding in PSCs proliferation mechanism. Furthermore, this finding indicates miR-199b is a potential therapeutic target for muscle atrophy.",Effective co-encapsulation of doxorubicin and irinotecan for synergistic therapy using liposomes prepared with triethylammonium sucrose octasulfate as drug trapping agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599233,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 23,"The combination regimen of irinotecan (IRI) and doxorubicin (DOX) for cancer treatment has been frequently exploited in clinical studies, but face challenges in design of efficacious combination drug delivery systems. Here we demonstrate a novel nanoliposome constructed by triethylammonium sucrose octasulfate gradient loading method for co-delivering the two therapeutic agents. In vitro cytotoxicity of IRI, DOX and their combinations against breast cancer cells (4T-1), non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549) and colon cancer cells (HT-29) was evaluated to screen optimal synergistic ratio of the two drugs. The co-delivery nanocarrier maintained the synergistic ratio in vivo, and increased tumor distribution of both drugs (≈2.18-fold vs single drug-loaded formulations). IRI/DOX co-loaded liposomes, with exceedingly high drug-to-phospholipid ratio of 0.61: 1 (molar ratio), exhibit potent antitumor efficacy in the 4T-1 mammary carcinoma xenograft, compared to the mixture of single drug-loaded liposomes (P < 0.001). This co-encapsulated and co-delivered nanoliposome technology offers a promising strategy for cancer treatment."

In addition to the well-known drugs (second-generation antipsychotics, levothyroxine, dopaminergic agents, etc.) for augmentation, investigations suggest that several nutraceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs may be effective and safe as adjunct therapeutic agents to conventional ADs. To identify such active ingredients we first performed a systematic literature search using PubMed and then conducted both backward and forward citation searches. For the PubMed search, we used the following combinations of keywords: 1) ""adjunctive"" + ""therapy"" + ""antidepressant""; 2) ""add-on"" + ""therapy"" + ""antidepressant""; 3) ""supplementation"" + ""therapy"" + ""antidepressant"". As a result of those efforts, we found more than 20 agents (e.g. S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine; folate; ω-3 fatty acids; curcumin; N-acetylcysteine; saffron; 5-hydroxytryptophan; NSAIDs) that are supposedly effective in the augmentation of standard AD treatment. We discussed the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of those agents, as well as the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy as stand-alone and adjunct treatments for MDD.",The antinociceptive effects and molecular mechanisms of ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 at the supraspinal level in acute pain in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599218,Brain research bulletin,2019 02 16,"Ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 is the active N-terminal hepta-peptide of ghrelin as an agonist at the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1α. The biological functions of ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 have not been well investigated. Therefore in this study, we were interested in exploring the effects and molecular mechanisms of ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 in pain modulation at the supraspinal level using the tail withdrawal test in mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 (0.002, 0.02, 0.2 and 2 nmol/kg) induced a dose- and time-related antinociceptive effect. This antinociceptive effect was fully antagonized by co-injection with the GHS-R1α antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6, indicating that this effect induced by ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 was mediated through the activation of GHS-R1α. Interestingly, naloxone, β-funaltrexamine, naloxonazine, and naltrindole, but not nor-binaltorphimine, could also antagonize the antinociceptive effect markedly, suggesting that OPRM (primary μ1 subtype) and OPRD were involved in the antinociceptive response induced by ghrelin(1-7)-NH2. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR and Western blot results indicated that both mRNA and protein levels of PENK and OPRD were up-regulated significantly. Using the fluorescence labeling method, our results showed that ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 (i.c.v.) was mainly distributed at the dorsal 3rd ventricle and hippocampus where there are regions with high expressions of ghrelin, GHS-R1α and ORs. All these results indicated that ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 initially activated the GHS-R1α, then activated the OPRM, as well as increased the release of endogenous PENK to activate of OPRD to produce antinociception. These results contributed to understanding the mechanisms of antinociception induced by ghrelin(1-7)-NH2. Furthermore, ghrelin(1-7)-NH2 as the active fragment of ghrelin may be a promising peptide for developing new analgesic drugs.",Natural compounds acting at P2 receptors alleviate peripheral neuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599217,Brain research bulletin,2019 01 06,"Neuropathic pain is generally resistant to currently available treatments, and it is often a consequence of nerve injury due to surgery, diabetes or infection. Myocardial ischemic nociceptive signaling increases the sympathoexcitatory reflex to aggravate myocardial injury. Elucidation of the pathogenetic factors might provide a target for optimal treatment. Abundant evidence in the literature suggests that P2X and P2Y receptors play important roles in signal transmission. Traditional Chinese medicines, such as emodin, puerarin and resveratrol, antagonize nociceptive transmission mediated by purinergic 2 (P2) receptors in primary afferent neurons.

In this study, total IgE and mast cell tryptase were measured in a series of forensic autopsy cases including non-allergic cardiac deaths (14 cases with minimal or no coronary atherosclerosis, 14 cases with significant coronary artery atherosclerosis without acute coronary thrombosis, and 14 cases with significant coronary artery atherosclerosis and acute coronary thrombosis or myocardial infarction) and non-allergic non-cardiac deaths (21 cases with death due to hanging and 21 cases with death due to intracranial gunshot wounds), in order to correlate laboratory results with morphological findings and compare them to conclusions reported in the clinical setting. In cardiac death cases, postmortem serum total IgE levels were increased in 7 out of 42 cases and mast cell tryptase levels were increased in 3 out of 42 cases. In non-cardiac death cases, postmortem serum total IgE levels were not increased in 39 out of 42 cases and mast cell tryptase levels were not increased in any of these cases. These preliminary findings seem to indicate that a portion of coronary deaths characterized by coronary artery atherosclerosis of various severities are also characterized by increased total IgE and mast cell tryptase levels, thus corroborating the data previously reported in both clinical and forensic literature on this topic as well as the necessity of combining morphological investigations focusing on the heart and coronary arteries with biochemical analyses.",Flapless closure of oro-antral communication with PRF membrane and composite of PRF and collagen - a technical note.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599215,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2019 02 01,"The incidence of oro-antral communication during removal of maxillary posterior teeth, especially the molars is quite common in general dental practice.

Many studies have examined risk communication, but the focus has been on professional and patient perspectives. Less information is available on risk communication in interactions. This study aimed to examine genetic counselors' (GCs) risks communication in multicultural genetic counseling sessions with women of advanced maternal age (AMA). Six GCs (2-20 years' experience) conducted AMA sessions in English (women's second language). The sessions were video and voice recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using conversation analysis (CA). CA examines discourse as a topic, i.e. describing the turns, its functions and how these functions are accomplished. Analysis revealed that the GCs presented the risk of having a baby with a chromosome abnormality in several ways and that they invite the women to reflect on the risk information. This discussion was found to be a five step process and showed that the women responded to the invitation to reflect rather than the risk information itself by providing additional information. The counselors in the majority of the sessions responded to this additional information the women provided. It therefore seems that the way in which risks are presented are less important than the meaning of the risks for the women. The research showed the power of interactional research such as CA methodology to gain new insights into old problems. Importantly, the study revealed some on the nuances of risk communication in genetic counseling and has implications for practice.",IER family proteins are regulators of protein phosphatase PP2A and modulate the phosphorylation status of CDC25A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599213,Cellular signalling,2019 01 26,"Proteins encoded by immediate-early response (IER) family genes, IER2, IER5, and IER5L, share homology at their N-terminal regions. IER5 binds to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and enhances dephosphorylation of PP2A target proteins such as heat shock factor HSF1. Here, we show the expression of IER family genes and the target protein-specific function of IER proteins. The IER homology regions of IER2 and IER5L are required for the interaction with PP2A. Expression of IER2 and IER5L in cells leads to reduced phosphorylation of HSF1 and derepression of its transcriptional activity. Although IER5 and IER5L enhance dephosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase, IER2 fails to do so. IER2, IER5, and IER5L all bind to the cell cycle regulator CDC25A and convert it to the hypophosphorylated form, which causes dissociation from 14-3-3 regulatory protein. IER5 differentially regulates CDC25A levels in cells under normal and thermal stress conditions. These results suggest that IER proteins are target protein-specific regulators of PP2A activity and modulate cell proliferation through CDC25A activity."

Recombinant riceXIP (rePriceXIP) was secreted into the supernatant and purified to homogeneity with the use of Ni-affinity resin. The molecular mass of rePriceXIP was approximately 44.0 kDa. RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40 °C for 30 min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40 nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2 nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive. Analysis of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the Kq values for TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 exceeded 2.0 × 1010 L mol-1•s-1, implying that static quenching occurred. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that rePriceXIP bound to xylanase, thereby changing the secondary structure and reducing the catalytic activity of xylanase. Lower levels of hydrolytes are released from beechwood xylan by xylanases in the presence of rePriceXIP.",Contrasting patterns of coding and flanking region evolution in mammalian keratin associated protein-1 genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599197,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 05 31,"Mammalian genomes contain a number of duplicated genes, and sequence identity between these duplicates can be maintained by purifying selection. However, between-duplicate recombination can also maintain sequence identity between copies, resulting in a pattern known as concerted evolution where within-genome repeats are more similar to each other than to orthologous repeats in related species. Here we investigated the tandemly-repeated keratin-associated protein 1 (KAP1) gene family, KRTAP1, which encodes proteins that are important components of hair and wool in mammals. Comparison of eutherian mammal KRTAP1 gene repeats within and between species shows a strong pattern of concerted evolution. However, in striking contrast to the coding regions of these genes, we find that the flanking regions have a divergent pattern of evolution. This contrast in evolutionary pattern transitions abruptly near the start and stop codons of the KRTAP1 genes. We reveal that this difference in evolutionary patterns is not explained by conventional purifying selection, nor is it likely a consequence of codon adaptation or reverse transcription of KRTAP1-n mRNA. Instead, the evidence suggests that these contrasting patterns result from short-tract gene conversion events that are biased to the KRTAP1 coding region by selection and/or differential sequence divergence. This work demonstrates the power that gene conversion has to finely shape the evolution of repetitive genes, and provides another distinctive pattern of contrasting evolutionary outcomes that results from gene conversion. A greater emphasis on exploring the evolution of multi-gene eukaryotic families will reveal how common different contrasting evolutionary patterns are in gene duplicates.",Novel Anastomotic Technique for Uterine Transplant Using Utero-ovarian Veins for Venous Drainage and Internal Iliac Arteries for Perfusion in Two Laparoscopically Harvested Uteri.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599196,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 05 12,"To evaluate 2 cases of uterine transplant surgery that used utero-ovarian veins as outflow channels, internal iliac arteries for perfusion, and the organ harvest surgery performed laparoscopically.",Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to study gene regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599195,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 03 08,"Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool to study gene regulation.

Impaired skatole metabolism, results in skatole accumulation, which give rise to off flavor of the meat. Several metabolites of skatole has been identified, however the role of these metabolites in the inhibition of the skatole metabolizing enzymes are not documented. Using microsomes from pigs and fish, we determined the ability of several skatole metabolites to inhibit CYP1 A, CYP2A19 and CYP2E1 dependent activity. Our results show that 2-aminoacetophenone is an inhibitor of porcine CYP2A19 and CYP2E1 activity, but not the piscine orthologues. In conclusion, there is species specific differences in the inhibition of CYP1 A and CYP2A19 dependent metabolism of probe substrates. This is relevant to the evaluation of different model systems and to the reduction of off flavor of meat.","The UV filter benzophenone 3, alters early follicular assembly in rat whole ovary cultures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599193,Toxicology letters,2019 01 24,"Our goal was to study the effect of BP3 (benzophenone 3) in the follicular assembly and the potential involvement of Foxl2 pathway using whole ovary cultures.

Nest breakdown, follicular assembly and the expression of several regulators of these processes (p27, Foxl2, Sox9, Bmp2, Cyp19 and Fst) were evaluated. In vitro exposure to BP3 (5.8 nM) decreased the population of total oocytes, the number of nests per ovary and early primary follicles population. In addition, BP3 (5.8 nM) induced overexpression of Foxl2 mRNA levels through ESR2 but increased Fst mRNA levels independently from ESR2 or Foxl2. We also observed that the number of p27-positive oocytes was decreased after BP3 (5.8 nM). On the other hand, exposure to BP3-276 increased total oocytes, the number of nests per ovary and decreased primary follicles. In addition, BP3-276 induced no changes of Foxl2 mRNA levels through ESR2 but increased Fst mRNA levels independently from ESR2 or Foxl2.

HPC activity during imagination may be modulated by mnemonic load, given its role in working memory for complex materials, and/or by the semantic relatedness (i.e. congruency) between items and their context. MPFC activation may track with congruency or mnemonic load, given the role of ventral mPFC in schema processing and the dorsal mPFC in working memory for social information. Sixteen healthy adults (M age = 22.3) underwent an event construction task, wherein participants were provided with a context and item words and imagined an event, forming as many inter-item associations as possible among the items. The stimuli varied by set size and by normatively-defined congruence (normative congruency) to explore their effects on HPC and mPFC activity and functional connectivity. We observed HPC connectivity during event construction in general, whereas dorsal mPFC connectivity occurred during imagining only at higher set sizes. Moreover, anterior hippocampal activity correlated positively with increasing coherence between items during imagining, suggesting that the anterior HPC is sensitive to the relational demands of constructing a novel event. Parahippocampal, hippocampal, temporal pole, and mPFC activity tracked only with individual differences in subjective ratings of congruency of imagined events, which may contribute to construction by retrieving existing schema-related information. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the factors that modulate HPC and mPFC activity when constructing mental simulations.",Neurofeedback learning for mental practice rather than repetitive practice improves neural pattern consistency and functional network efficiency in the subsequent mental motor execution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599191,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"During brain modulation, repeated mental practice may not always result in efficient learning. Particularly, the effectiveness of mental motor practice depends on how well one induces neural activity in a desired state consistently across mental trials, which calls for feedbacks to adjust one's performance. We hypothesized that even a brief experience of neurofeedback learning enhances trial-by-trial neural pattern consistency during subsequent mental motor execution and that this experience would change recruitment of functional connectivity in the motor imagery and default mode networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with two sessions of mental motor practice before and after a neurofeedback training session, in which participants conducted four types of first-person mental motor execution tasks (walking forward, turning left, turning right, and touching a tree). During the neurofeedback training session, in which participants conducted a virtual navigation game, 10 experimental participants received real-time fMRI neuro-feedbacks, while 10 control participants simply repeated the same mental task according to given cues without feedbacks. The experimental group showed significantly higher effects of neuro-feedback training on trial-by-trial consistencies and classification accuracies of activated neural patterns than the control group. Task-performing global node strength and network efficiency were increased in the motor imagery network but decreased in the default mode network only in the experimental group. These results demonstrate that even a brief experience of feedback learning is more effective than simple practice repetitions without evaluation, which was reflected in increased neural pattern consistency and task-dependent functional connectivity during a mental motor execution task.",Toxico-pathological effects of meglumine antimoniate on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599190,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 03 11,"Leishmaniasis is one of the most important parasitic diseases after malaria.

This investigation examines the effects of meglumine antimoniate (MA) on the survival rate, angiogenesis and cellular apoptosis in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were treated with varying doses of MA (100-800 μg/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 h and the survival rate was studied by colorimetric assay, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, migration (scratch) assay and tube formation assay. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) studies indicated that the most important genes involved in presenting angiogenesis included VEGF and its receptors (Kdr and Flt-1), NP1 and Hif-1α genes including the anti-apoptotic gene of Bcl2, were significantly reduced compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the most leading genes involved in the phenomenon of apoptosis were P53, Bax, Bak, Apaf-1 and caspases 3, 8 and 9, which were significantly up regulated compared to the control group (p < 0.05)."

They possess important adaptation capacities that range from their transition towards reactive astrocytes to their ability to undergo reprogramming, thereby revealing their potential to retain latent features of neural progenitor cells. We propose that the mechanisms underlying reactive astrogliosis or astrocyte reprogramming provide an opportunity for initiating neuronal regeneration, a process that is notably reduced in the mammalian nervous system throughout evolution. Conversely, this plasticity may also affect normal astrocytic functions resulting in pathologies ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders to neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. We postulate that epigenetic mechanisms linking extrinsic cues and intrinsic transcriptional programs are key factors to maintain astrocyte identity and function, and critically, to control the balance of regenerative and degenerative activity. Here, we will review the main evidences supporting this concept. We propose that unravelling the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms underlying the acquisition of astrocyte identity and plasticity, as well as understanding how these processes are modulated by the local microenvironment under specific threatening or pathological conditions, may pave the way to new therapeutic avenues for several neurological disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors of astrocytic lineage.",Evidence of multiple point mutations in Theileria annulata cytochrome b gene incriminated in buparvaquone treatment failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599177,Acta tropica,2019 04 09,"Drug resistance is one of the emerging and re-emerging epidemics affecting both veterinary and public health sectors.

However, recently there has been widespread reports of development of resistance of Theileria annulata to buparvaquone. To investigate the situation in Sudan where bovine tropical theileriosis is endemic, fifty blood samples from T. annulata-positive cattle. were used for DNA extraction, PCR and cytochrome b gene nucleotide sequencing. Analysis of the two buparvaquone binding site regions Q01 (130-148) and Q02 (244-266), revealed three non- synonymous mutations at codon 146; alanine (GCT) to threonine (ACT) within the Q01 region across all 50 isolates and the other mutation at codon 129; serine (AGC) to glycine (GGC) in 18 isolates which is very close to the Q01 binding site. However, we documented another mutation at position 227; valine (GTG) to methionine (ATG) close to the close to the Q02 binding site, in three isolates with mutation at codon 129.

The present study investigated orthohantavirus infection in an assemblage of wild Sigmodontinae rodents of the Paraná Delta, Argentina, and providing new evidence of host-switching events. Rodents belonging to the species Oxymycterus rufus (n = 187), Akodon azarae (n = 82), Oligoryzomys flavescens (n = 80), Oligoryzomys nigripes (n = 47), Scapteromys aquaticus (n = 38), Deltamys kempi (n = 7) and Holochilus brasiliensis (n = 2) were captured at 4 sampling sites during 20 trapping sessions. Blood samples were analyzed by IgG ELISA and livers by a nested reverse transcription PCR for the diagnosis of orthohantavirus infection. The amplified products of the S and M orthohantavirus genomes were sequenced and analyzed to determine similarities with species of the Orthohantavirus genus. The species of the Oligoryzomys positive to the virus were confirmed by amplifying and sequencing the complete cyt b gene. Of the 443 serum samples analyzed by IgG ELISA, A. azarae presented the highest host-specific prevalence value (10/82, 12.2%) followed by Ol. nigripes (4/47, 8.5%) and Ox. rufus (1/187, 0.5%). All the sero-positive Ol. nigripes (n = 4) were positive to the amplification of the S and M segments of the Lechiguanas genotype (98% nucleotide identity for both segments). This is surprising given that Ol. nigripes has been previously associated with Juquitiba genotype, not Lechiguanas. The latter is generally associated with Ol. flavescens, which in our study were all sero-negative. In addition, the association Ox. rufus - Pergamino genotype found here is, to our knowledge, novel and another potential evidence of host-switching considering that Pergamino has been originally associated with A. azarae. These findings contribute to the building evidence that contradicts the one-genotype-one-reservoir species premise in the association between rodent reservoirs and orthohantaviruses, and supports the hypothesis that the community structure of sympatric host species may contribute to orthohantavirus dynamics.",Expression and purification of truncated recombinant B8/1 protein of Echinococcus granulosus for diagnosis of hydatid infection in human.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599175,Acta tropica,2019 04 09,"Hydatidosis is one of the most important diseases common between animals and human beings. Caused by Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm, the disease has a global epidemic. The serological diagnostic tests that are now utilized to confirm the imaging approaches have some drawbacks such as low sensitivity and cross-reaction with the serum of the patients infected with other parasites. The application of recombinant and synthetic antigens has proven improvement in the functionality of serological diagnostic tests. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the expression and purification of truncated recombinant B8/1 (trB8/1) antigen and its application in ELISA for diagnosis of hydatid infection in human. The tEgB8/1 was colonized in the expression vector pET28b (+) and expressed in different strains of E. coli. This protein was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography. The antigenicity of the protein was evaluated by Western blotting and ELISA. In the test, 50 positive serum samples from hydatid infected patients, 50 samples from healthy people, and 30 serum samples from patients with other parasitic diseases were used to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of this antigen. The measured sensitivity and specificity of this antigen were identified to be 75.75% and 96.38% respectively. The P value of <0.0001 by using ROC curve, confirmed that this antigen is able to differentiate between healthy and hydatid-infected individuals. Considering the excellent specificity of this antigen and in order to enhance the sensitivity, it is recommended to use a combination of this antigen with other antigens (e.g., EgB8/2-8/5).",An E. coli-produced single-chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting hepatitis B virus surface protein potently inhibited virion secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599174,Antiviral research,2019 01 28,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelopes as well as empty subviral particles carry in their lipid membranes the small (S), middle (M), and large (L) surface proteins, collectively known as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Due to their common S domain all three proteins share a surface-exposed hydrophilic antigenic loop (AGL) with a complex disulfide bridge-dependent structure. The AGL is critical for HBV infectivity and virion secretion, and thus represents a major target for neutralizing antibodies. Previously, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting a conformational epitope in the AGL, IgG12, exhibited 1000-fold higher neutralizing activity than hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). Here we designed a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) homolog of IgG12, G12-scFv, which could be efficiently produced in soluble form in the cytoplasm of E. coli SHuffle cells. Independent in vitro assays verified specific binding of G12-scFv to a conformational S epitope shared with IgG12. Despite 20-fold lower affinity, G12-scFv but not an irrelevant scFv potently neutralized HBV infection of susceptible hepatoma cells (IC50 = 1.8 nM). Strikingly, low concentrations of G12-scFv blocked virion secretion from HBV producing cells (IC50 = 1.25 nM) without disturbing intracellular viral replication, whereas extracellular HBsAg was reduced only at >100-fold higher though still nontoxic concentration. The inhibitory effects correlated with S binding specificity and presumably also G12-scFv internalization into cells. Together these data suggest G12-scFv as a highly specific yet easily accessible novel tool for basic, diagnostic, and possibly future therapeutic applications.",In vivo combination of human anti-envelope glycoprotein E2 and -Claudin-1 monoclonal antibodies for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599173,Antiviral research,2019 04 16,"Despite the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major cause for liver disease and cancer worldwide. Entry inhibitors block virus host cell entry and, therefore, prevent establishment of chronic infection and liver disease. Due to their unique mechanism of action, entry inhibitors provide an attractive antiviral strategy in organ transplantation. In this study, we developed an innovative approach in preventing HCV infection using a synergistic combination of a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (HMAb) targeting the HCV E2 protein and a host-targeting anti-claudin 1 (CLDN1) humanized monoclonal antibody. An in vivo proof-of-concept study in human liver-chimeric FRG-NOD mice proved the efficacy of the combination therapy at preventing infection by an HCV genotype 1b infectious serum. While administration of individual antibodies at lower doses only showed a delay in HCV infection, the combination therapy was highly protective. Furthermore, the combination proved to be effective in preventing infection of primary human hepatocytes by neutralization-resistant HCV escape variants selected during liver transplantation, suggesting that a combination therapy is suited for the neutralization of difficult-to-treat variants. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the combination of two HMAbs targeting different steps of virus entry improves treatment efficacy while simultaneously reducing treatment duration and costs. Our approach not only provides a clinical perspective to employ HMAb combination therapies to prevent graft re-infection and its associated liver disease but may also help to alleviate the urgent demand for organ transplants by allowing the transplantation of organs from HCV-positive donors.",Gap junctions in liver disease: Implications for pathogenesis and therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599172,Journal of hepatology,2019 03 19,"In the normal liver, cells interact closely through gap junctions.

Thus, dysfunction of gap junctions affects a wide variety of liver processes, such as differentiation, cell death, inflammation and fibrosis. In fact, dysfunctional gap junctions have been implicated, for more than a decade, in cholestatic disease, hepatic cancer and cirrhosis. Additionally, in recent years there is an increasing body of evidence that these channels are also involved in other relevant and prevalent liver pathological processes, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, acute liver injury and portal hypertension. In parallel to these new clinical implications the available data include controversial observations. Thus, a comprehensive overview is required to better understand the functional complexity of these pores. This paper will review the most recent knowledge concerning gap junction dysfunction, with a special focus on the role of these channels in the pathogenesis of relevant clinical entities and on potential therapeutic targets that are amenable to modification by drugs.",Diosmin Nanocrystal-Loaded Wafers for Treatment of Diabetic Ulcer: In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599171,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 26,"This work aimed at loading of diosmin nanocrystals into alginate-based wafers for treatment of highly exuding diabetic ulcer in rats using topical route of administration. For this purpose, different formulation variables and preparation techniques to enhance the flexibility and adhesion properties of the prepared sodium alginate (SA) wafers were carried out. The prepared wafers were characterized regarding hydration capacity, bioadhesion, scanning electron microscope, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Efficacy of treating diabetic ulcer was studied using diabetic-induced rat model using streptozotocin. Results obtained showed that using SA:gelatin with 1.5%/1.5% w/w gave acceptable wafers with a sustained release of diosmin over 8 h. A complete re-epithelialization, well-organized dermal layers, well-formed granulation tissue, and mature collagen bundles were observed in treated rats. It was concluded that combination of gelatin with SA provided an excellent wafer as a promising medicated wound dressing holding diosmin nanocrystals while maintaining its stability.",Application of a Best Practice Approach Using Resonant Mass Measurement for Biotherapeutic Product Characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599170,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 26,"Characterizing and quantifying subvisible particles in protein drug products is critical to ensuring product quality. A variety of analytical methods are used to detect and make meaningful measurements of subvisible particles. Resonant mass measurement (RMM) is a novel technology that characterizes the subvisible particle content of samples on a particle-by-particle basis. The technology presents great promise in the study of therapeutic protein products. As an emerging tool in the biopharmaceutical field, the best practices and limitations of RMM for protein products have not been well established. One key challenge of particle analysis is producing robust and reliable data, with high precision and accuracy, for particle characterization. In this study, we develop a set of possible best practices for RMM using a model protein system. We test the effects of these practices on the repeatability and reproducibility of particle measurements. Additionally, we present the data collected under a rigorously controlled set of operating conditions at 3 collaborating sites as well as a summary of the resulting optimal practices. In employing these practices, we successfully obtained improved relative standard deviation values and achieved high reproducibility and repeatability in both sizing and concentration measurement results over a broad range of sample volumes.",Immunogenicity of Protein Pharmaceuticals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599169,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 26,"Protein therapeutics have drastically changed the landscape of treatment for many diseases by providing a regimen that is highly specific and lacks many off-target toxicities.

In this study, we reported the synthesis of [λ‑carrageenan‑calcium phosphate] and [sodium alginate‑calcium phosphate] modified with dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride and diallylamin co-polymer, which could be used as effective adsorbents of anionic dyes. Evidence of chemical modification was proved through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) band shifting, peaks broadening in X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and the change in thermal event (TGA). The sorption process was studied using acid blue 25 as representative anionic dye. The adsorbed quantity reached, at equilibrium, 446 mg/g and 195 mg/g using cationized [sodium alginate‑calcium phosphate] and cationized [λ‑carrageenan‑calcium phosphate], respectively. However, it does not exceed 3.4 mg/g in the case of the unmodified [sodium alginate‑calcium phosphate]. The sorption of acid blue 25 using cationized hybrid materials complied well with the pseudo-second-order suggesting a chemi-sorption. Freundlich isotherm described well the adsorption mechanism of the three studied adsorbents. In summary, the high sorption capacities of the cationized hybrid materials obtained in this study suggest their use as effective adsorbents of acid dyes from wastewaters.","Characterisation comparison of polysaccharides from Dioscorea opposita Thunb. growing in sandy soil, loessial soil and continuous cropping.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599157,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"This study compared the characterisations of polysaccharides from Chinese yam (Dioscorea opposita Thunb.) growing in sandy soil (SSCY), loessial soil (LSCY) and second-year continuous cropping (CCCY). SSCY contained the highest total polysaccharides (36.55%) and 80.19% glucose, CCCY from sandy soil obtained 24.55% polysaccharides with 43.66% glucose, whereas LSCY contained 27.54% total polysaccharides and 7.94% glucose. The results indicated that Dioscorea opposita from sandy soil may obtain higher level of glucose. CCCY increased the galacturonic acids in yams from 7.03% to 26.19%, which may have been caused by the decrease in soil pH due to continuous cropping. The starches of SSCY and CCCY from sandy soil belongs to C-type, whereas the starch of LSCY from loessial soil has the A-type pattern. The results suggested that the two types of soil and continuous cropping change the compounds and contents of yams, which provide valuable evidences for cropping management and allelopathy effects.",Mitochondrial function and abnormalities implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599156,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 07,"Mitochondria are the powerhouse that generate over 90% of the ATP produced in cells. In addition to its role in energy production, the mitochondrion also plays a major role in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, programmed cell death (apoptosis), generation of and protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS), immune response, regulation of intracellular calcium ion levels and even maintenance of gut microbiota. With its essential role in bio-energetic as well as non-energetic biological processes, it is not surprising that proper cellular, tissue and organ function is dependent upon proper mitochondrial function. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be directly linked to a variety of medical disorders, particularly neuromuscular disorders and increasing evidence has linked mitochondrial dysfunction to neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Rett Syndrome (RS) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Over the last 40 years there has been a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of ASD and, more recently, an increasing body of evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in ASD development. In this review, the latest evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the pathogenesis of autism will be presented. This review will also summarize the results of several recent `approaches used for improving mitochondrial function that may lead to new therapeutic approaches to managing and/or treating ASD.",Submerged plus maze: A novel test for studying anxiety-like behaviour in fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599155,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 19,"The elevated plus maze is a prominent and well-documented test for studying anxiety in rodents. Fish are becoming more prevalent in studies of anxiety, yet the elevated plus maze has not been adapted and validated for fish. In the present study, we created an aquatic version of the elevated plus maze called the 'submerged plus maze,' which is shaped like a plus symbol with four arms alternating between black and transparent walls. We used convict cichlid fish (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) and administered diazepam to validate the apparatus for studying anxiety-like behaviour. After diazepam exposure, fish spent more time in and entered more open arms than after vehicle exposure, consistent with the effect of benzodiazepines on rodents in the elevated plus maze. The submerged plus maze maintains construct validity for testing anxiety in convict cichlid fish.","Pumpkin is ""yucky""!: A prospective study of overt and covert restriction in the development of young children's food preferences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599153,Appetite,2019 03 17,"The aim of the study was to investigate maternal feeding strategies as prospective predictors of young children's food preferences. Participants were 106 mother - child dyads with data collected when children were aged 4 (Time 1) and then again at 6 years old (Time 2). Mothers completed an initial questionnaire at Time 1 which contained measures of restrictive and covert feeding strategies. Children were interviewed concerning their food preferences and had their height and weight measured at Time 1 and again two years later (Time 2). Longitudinal regression results showed that Time 1 parental restrictive feeding predicted decreased child-reported preferences for fruit and vegetables and increased preferences for salty food and sweets at Time 2. Conversely, Time 1 parental covert control predicted greater child-reported preferences for fruit and vegetables over time. The results provide longitudinal evidence of the negative impact of restrictive feeding, and of the positive impact of covert control, on the development of young children's food preferences.","Pathways between maternal depression, the family environment, and child BMI z scores.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599152,Appetite,2019 02 12,"Modifiable aspects of the family environment that contribute to overweight in younger children have been identified, including parental feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and parenting practices related to eating and household routines.

The current study examined parental feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and eating and household routines as potential mediators between maternal depressive symptoms and child weight at age six. The study also tested for differential effects of early versus concurrent maternal depressive symptoms.",Multi-modal regulation of C. elegans hermaphrodite spermatogenesis by the GLD-1-FOG-2 complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599151,Developmental biology,2019 04 15,"Proper germ cell sex determination in Caenorhabditis nematodes requires a network of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their target mRNAs. In some species, changes in this network enabled limited XX spermatogenesis, and thus self-fertility. In C. elegans, one of these selfing species, the global sex-determining gene tra-2 is regulated in germ cells by a conserved RBP, GLD-1, via the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of its transcript. A C. elegans-specific GLD-1 cofactor, FOG-2, is also required for hermaphrodite sperm fate, but how it modifies GLD-1 function is unknown. Germline feminization in gld-1 and fog-2 null mutants has been interpreted as due to cell-autonomous elevation of TRA-2 translation. Consistent with the proposed role of FOG-2 in translational control, the abundance of nearly all GLD-1 target mRNAs (including tra-2) is unchanged in fog-2 mutants. Epitope tagging reveals abundant TRA-2 expression in somatic tissues, but an undetectably low level in wild-type germ cells. Loss of gld-1 function elevates germline TRA-2 expression to detectable levels, but loss of fog-2 function does not. A simple quantitative model of tra-2 activity constrained by these results can successfully sort genotypes into normal or feminized groups. Surprisingly, fog-2 and gld-1 activity enable the sperm fate even when GLD-1 cannot bind to the tra-2 3' UTR. This suggests the GLD-1-FOG-2 complex regulates uncharacterized sites within tra-2, or other mRNA targets. Finally, we quantify the RNA-binding capacities of dominant missense alleles of GLD-1 that act genetically as ""hyper-repressors"" of tra-2 activity. These variants bind RNA more weakly in vitro than does wild-type GLD-1. These results indicate that gld-1 and fog-2 regulate germline sex via multiple interactions, and that our understanding of the control and evolution of germ cell sex determination in the C. elegans hermaphrodite is far from complete.",Brain renin-angiotensin system blockade with orally active aminopeptidase A inhibitor prevents cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599150,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 02 02,"Brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) hyperactivity has been implicated in sympathetic hyperactivity and progressive left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin III, generated by aminopeptidase A (APA), is one of the main effector peptides of the brain RAS in the control of cardiac function. We hypothesized that orally administered firibastat (previously named RB150), an APA inhibitor prodrug, would attenuate heart failure (HF) development after MI in mice, by blocking brain RAS hyperactivity. Two days after MI, adult male CD1 mice were randomized to three groups, for four to eight weeks of oral treatment with vehicle (MI + vehicle), firibastat (150 mg/kg; MI + firibastat) or the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (1 mg/kg; MI + enalapril) as a positive control. From one to four weeks post-MI, brain APA hyperactivity occurred, contributing to brain RAS hyperactivity. Firibastat treatment normalized brain APA hyperactivity, with a return to the control values measured in sham group two weeks after MI. Four and six weeks after MI, MI + firibastat mice had a significant lower LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-systolic diameter and volume, and a higher LV ejection fraction than MI + vehicle mice. Moreover, the mRNA levels of biomarkers of HF (Myh7, Bnp and Anf) were significantly lower following firibastat treatment. For a similar infarct size, the peri-infarct area of MI + firibastat mice displayed lower levels of mRNA for Ctgf and collagen types I and III (markers of fibrosis) than MI + vehicle mice. Thus, chronic oral firibastat administration after MI in mice prevents cardiac dysfunction by normalizing brain APA hyperactivity, and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.",Perfusion alters free zinc levels in the rodent brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599147,Journal of neuroscience methods,2019 02 06,"Fixation of brain tissue is a common practice which allows preservation of tissue and aids in preventing structural and chemical abnormalities. However, fixation procedures may disrupt the levels of biometals such as zinc when compared to tissue that is fresh-frozen. Thus, we sought to determine if any differences in free-zinc levels exist between perfused and fresh-frozen tissue. Zinc is an essential biometal critical for cellular communication and memory and exists in both bound and free forms; the latter playing critical roles in synaptic communication. New method: C57BL/6 J mice were divided into two water types: those given lab water and those given water supplemented with 10 ppm zinc carbonate.

As proteostasis is fundamental for cellular and organismal health, cells have developed a complex network to restore proteostasis impaired by stress. Many components of this network - including ubiquitination, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation, autophagy, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) - are activated in the post-ischemic brain, and play a crucial role in cell survival and recovery of neurologic function. Importantly, recent studies have shown that ischemia-induced activation of these proteostasis-related pathways in the aged brain is impaired, indicating an aging-related decline in the self-healing capacity of the brain. This impaired capacity is a significant factor for consideration in the field of brain ischemia because the vast majority of cardiac arrest and stroke patients are elderly. In this review, we focus on the effects of aging on these critical proteostasis-related pathways in the brain, and discuss their implications in translational brain ischemia research."

However, the mechanism by which Rho GTPase activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24) regulates cell invasion and migration of lung cancer has not been fully explained. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, ARHGAP24 expression in lung cancer tissues and cell lines was measured by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Transwell or wound healing analysis was performed to detect the cell migration and invasion of ARHGAP24 modulated A549 and NCI-H1975 cells with β-catenin inhibitor XAV-939 (10 µM) treatment, and the expression of MMP9, VEGF, and β-catenin protein was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS Our results showed that ARHGAP24 expression was downregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. pLVX-Puro-ARHGAP24 transfection in A549 cells significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration, along with increased E-cadherin and decreased MMP9, VEGF, Vimentin, and β-catenin protein expression. pLKO.1-ARHGAP24-shRNA transfection in NCI-H1975 cells significantly promoted cell invasion and migration, accompanied with decreased E-cadherin and increased MMP9, VEGF, and β-catenin protein expression. Moreover, NCI-H1975 cells with XAV-939 treatment showed decreased cell invasion and migration when compared with pLKO.1-ARHGAP24-shRNA transfection. ARHGAP24 silencing promoted the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in NCI-H1975 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that ARHGAP24 silencing promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion through activating β-catenin signaling.",Semi-Nondestructive Certification of Crocodilian Leather by LC-MS Detection of Collagen Marker Peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599131,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Leather produced from crocodile, alligator, and caiman skin is widely used in the fashion industry. Crocodilian leather is generally more expensive than mammalian leather, and the value greatly differs even between the crocodilian species. However, inappropriate labeling of the animal source on leather products sometimes arises from accidental or fraudulent substitution, which is difficult to unambiguously detect by existing methods. In the present study, animal source identification of crocodilian leather was carried out using type I collagen-derived marker peptides generated after dechroming, heat denaturation, and trypsin digestion. Definitive discrimination between the three crocodilian species and also a related species, lizard, was achieved based on the detection patterns of selected six marker peptides, determined by LC-MS. Furthermore, powdering of the leather samples enabled a reduction in the sample amount required and allowed the elimination of the dechroming step. Approximately 100 μg of powder was taken from commercial leather watch straps by filing, resulting in only slight damage to the undersides of the straps. The animal sources of the crocodilian products and also a crocodile-embossed calf product were successfully identified using a combination of the crocodilian marker peptides and previously established mammalian marker peptides. This semi-nondestructive species identification method is not only useful for certification of leather products but also for monitoring of international trade of leather and skin.",Investigating the Role of Ligand Electronics on Stabilizing Electrocatalytically Relevant Low-Valent Co(I) Intermediates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599130,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 20,"Cobalt complexes have shown great promise as electrocatalysts in applications ranging from hydrogen evolution to C-H functionalization. However, the use of such complexes often requires polydentate, bulky ligands to stabilize the catalytically active Co(I) oxidation state from deleterious disproportionation reactions to enable the desired reactivity. Herein, we describe the use of bidentate electronically asymmetric ligands as an alternative approach to stabilizing transient Co(I) species. Using disproportionation rates of electrochemically generated Co(I) complexes as a model for stability, we measured the relative stability of complexes prepared with a series of N, N-bidentate ligands. While the stability of Co(I)Cl complexes demonstrates a correlation with experimentally measured thermodynamic properties, consistent with an outer-sphere electron transfer process, the set of ligated Co(I)Br complexes evaluated was found to be preferentially stabilized by electronically asymmetric ligands, demonstrating an alternative disproportionation mechanism. These results allow a greater understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the disproportionation of organometallic complexes and have allowed the identification of cobalt complexes that show promise for the development of novel electrocatalytic reactions.",Decreased heart rate recovery may predict a high SYNTAX score in patients with stable coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599115,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,2019 06 13,"An impaired heart rate recovery (HRR) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality. However, the diagnostic ability of HRR for the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been clearly elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between HRR and the SYNTAX (SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery) score in patients with stable CAD (SCAD). A total of 406 patients with an abnormal treadmill exercise test and ≥50% coronary stenosis on coronary angiography were included. The HRR was calculated by subtracting the HR in the first minute of the recovery period from the maximum HR during exercise. The SYNTAX score ≥23 was accepted as high. Correlation of HRR with SYNTAX score and independent predictors of high SYNTAX score were determined. A high SYNTAX score was present in 172 (42%) patients. Mean HRR was lower in patients with a high SYNTAX score (9.8 ± 4.5 vs. 21.3 ± 9, p < 0.001). The SYNTAX score was negatively correlated with HRR (r: -0.580, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, peripheral arterial disease (OR: 13.3; 95% CI: 3.120-34.520; p < 0.001), decreased HRR (OR: 0.780; 95% CI: 0.674-0.902; p = 0.001), peak systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.054; 95% CI: 1.023-1.087; p = 0.001), and peak HR (OR: 0.950; 95% CI: 0.923-0.977; p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of a high SYNTAX score. Our results showed that HRR is significantly correlated with the SYNTAX score, and a decreased HRR is an independent predictor of a high SYNTAX score in patients with SCAD.","Authentication of frozen Chilean blue mussel (Mytilus chilensis) commercialized in the town of Osorno, southern Chile, using PCR-RFLP analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599114,"Recent patents on food, nutrition & agriculture",2019 01 01,"DNA-based technologies are reliable authentication methods for food products, enabling the detection of fraud, non-intentional substitution and control of mislabeling.

Disruption of regulatory mechanisms in spermatogenesis can lead to male infertility, various diseases of male reproductive system, or even cancer. The spermatogenic impairment in infertile men can be associated with different etiologies, and the exact molecular mechanisms are yet to be determined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of non-protein coding RNAs, about 22 nucleotides long, with an essential role in post-transcriptional regulation. miRNAs have been recognized as important regulators of various biological processes, including spermatogenesis. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature on the role of miRNAs in spermatogenesis, male infertility and reproductive cancers, and to evaluate their potential in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of disease. Experimental evidence shows that aberrant expression of miRNAs affects spermatogenesis at multiple stages and in different cell types, most often resulting in infertility. In more severe cases, dysregulation of miRNAs leads to cancer. miRNAs have enormous potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as therapeutic targets in male infertility and reproductive system diseases. However, to exploit this potential fully, we need a better understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of spermatogenesis, including the characterization of yet unidentified miRNAs and related regulatory mechanisms.",Military-related experiences and late-life depressive symptomatology among Japanese-American world war II veterans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599089,Aging & mental health,2019 02 07,To examine military service-related variables and late-life depressive symptomatology among older Japanese-American males.,Teicoplanin Reprogrammed with the N-Acyl-Glucosamine Pharmacophore at the Penultimate Residue of Aglycone Acquires Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Activities Effectively Killing Gram-Positive and -Negative Pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599088,ACS infectious diseases,2019 03 08,"Lipoglycopeptide antibiotics, for example, teicoplanin (Tei) and A40926, are more potent than vancomycin against Gram-positive (Gram-(+)) drug-resistant pathogens, for example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To extend their therapeutic effectiveness on vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), the biosynthetic pathway of the N-acyl glucosamine (Glc) pharmacophore at residue 4 (r4) of teicoplanin pseudoaglycone redirection to residue 6 (r6) was attempted. On the basis of crystal structures, two regioselective biocatalysts Orf2*T (a triple-mutation mutant S98A/V121A/F193Y) and Orf11*S (a single-mutation mutant W163A) were engineered, allowing them to act on GlcNAc at r6. New analogs thereby made show marked antimicrobial activity against MRSA and VRSA by 2-3 orders of magnitude better than teicoplanin and vancomycin. The lipid side chain of the Tei-analogs armed with a terminal mono- or diguanidino group extends the antimicrobial specificity from Gram-(+) to Gram-negative (Gram-(-)), comparable to that of kanamycin. In addition to low cytotoxicity and high safety, the Tei analogs exhibit new modes of action as a result of resensitization of VRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii. The redirection of the biosynthetic pathway for the N-acyl-Glc pharmacophore from r4 to r6 bodes well for large-scale production of selected r6,Tei congeners in an environmentally friendly synthetic biology approach.","The Role of Nerve Growth Factor in Maintaining Proliferative Capacity, Colony-Forming Efficiency, and the Limbal Stem Cell Phenotype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599086,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 01 30,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) has demonstrated great benefit in the treatment of neurotrophic corneal ulcers. There is evidence for multiple modes of action in promoting corneal healing, but only indirect evidence exists for NGF's effects on limbal stem cells (LSCs). Understanding the role of NGF in LSC biology will improve our understanding of paracrine regulation of the limbal niche and the design of stem cell-based therapies for conditions such as LSC deficiency. In this article, we studied the regulation of NGF signaling components during LSC differentiation and the role of NGF in LSC proliferation and maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. LSC differentiation was induced by prolonged (40 day) culture which resulted in a significant increase in cell size, decrease in colony-forming efficiency and expression of putative LSC markers. A protein microarray measuring expression of 248 signaling proteins indicated the low affinity NGF receptor p75NTR to be the most downregulated protein upon differentiation. Further confirmation by Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that NGF and p75NTR are expressed in early LSC cultures and downregulated upon differentiation. LSC cultures grown in the presence of anti-NGF antibody showed decreased colony-forming efficiency, DNA replication and expression of putative LSC markers ABCG2 and C/EBPδ. Supplementation of LSC culture medium with NGF extended the life span of LSC cultures in vitro and increased the expression of putative LSC markers ΔNp63α and ABCG2. Taken together, our data indicate that NGF signaling is a key promoter of LSC proliferation, colony-forming efficiency, and a maintainer of the LSC phenotype.

This work details those improvements and their effect on results. One hundred eighty IMRT plans analyzed previously were collected and new gamma criteria were applied and compared to the original results. The results were used to obtain an estimate for the number of plans that would require additional dose volume histogram (DVH)-based analysis and therefore predicted workload increase. For 2 months and 133 plans, the established criteria were continued while the new criteria were applied and tracked in parallel. Because the number of marginal or failing plans far exceeded the predicted levels, a number of calculational elements were investigated: IMRT modeling parameters, calculation grid size, and couch top modeling. After improvements to these elements, the new criteria were clinically implemented and the frequency of passing, questionable, and failing plans measured for the subsequent 15 months and 674 plans. The retrospective analysis of selected IMRT QA results demonstrated that 75% of plans should pass, while 19% of IMRT QA plans would need DVH-based analysis and an additional 6% would fail. However, after applying the tighter criteria for 2 months, the distribution of plans was significantly different from prediction with questionable or failing plans reaching 47%. After investigating and improving several elements of the IMRT calculation processes, the frequency of questionable plans was reduced to 11% and that of failing plans to less than 1%. Tighter IMRT QA tolerances revealed the need to improve several elements of our plan calculations. As a consequence, the accuracy of our plans have improved, and the frequency of finding marginal or failing IMRT QA results, remains within our practical ability to respond.",Iron Homeostasis Determines Fate of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Via Glycerophospholipids-Epigenetic Circuit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599084,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 03 28,"Iron homeostasis is crucial for a variety of biological processes, but the biological role of iron homeostasis in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether iron homeostasis is involved in maintaining the pluripotency of human PSCs (hPSCs). We found that the intracellular depletion of iron leads to a rapid downregulation of NANOG and a dramatic decrease in the self-renewal of hPSCs as well as spontaneous and nonspecific differentiation. Moreover, long-term depletion of iron can result in the remarkable cell death of hPSCs via apoptosis and necrosis pathways. Additionally, we found that the depletion of iron increased the activity of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LP-PLA2) and the production of lysophosphatidylcholine, thereby suppressing NANOG expression by enhancer of zeste homolog 2-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27. Consistently, LP-PLA2 inhibition abrogated iron depletion-induced loss of pluripotency and differentiation. Altogether, the findings of our study demonstrates that iron homeostasis, acting through glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, is essential for the pluripotency and survival of hPSCs.

Indeed, while mESCs deprived of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 24 hours revert to their naive pluripotent state after subsequent LIF readdition, cells deprived of LIF for 48 hours are no longer efficient in reverting, upon LIF addition, and undergo irreversible differentiation. We investigated undisclosed bioenergetic profiles of early mESC-derived committed cells versus their undifferentiated states in order to reveal specific bioenergetic changes associated with mESC plasticity. Multiparametric bioenergetic analysis revealed that pluripotent (+LIF) and reversibly committed cells (-LIF24h) are energetically flexible, depending on both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. They exhibit high mitochondrial respiration in the presence of the main energetic substrates and can also rely on glycolysis in the presence of OXPHOS inhibitor. Inhibition of the glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration does not change drastically the expression of pluripotency genes, which remain well expressed. In addition, cells treated with these inhibitors keep their capacity to differentiate efficiently upon embryoid bodies formation. Transition from metabolically active mESCs to irreversibly committed cells is associated with a clear change in mitochondrial network morphology, to an increase of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced from glycolysis and a decline of ATP turnover and of the mitochondrial activity without change in the mitochondrial mass. Our study pointed that plasticity window of mESCs is associated with the bivalent energetic metabolism and potency to shift to glycolysis or OXPHOS on demand. LIF removal provokes glycolytic metabolic orientation and consecutive loss of the LIF-dependent reversion of cells to the pluripotent state.

The T9SS secretes a number of potent virulence factors, including the highly hydrolytic proteases called gingipains, across the outer membrane in P. gingivalis. To understand the entire machinery of T9SS, an exhaustive search for T9SS-related genes in P. gingivalis using the mariner family transposon (Tn) and Tn-seq analysis was performed. Seven hundred and two Tn insertion sites in Tn mutants with no colony pigmentation that is associated with Lys-gingipain (Kgp) defectiveness were determined, and it was found that the Tn was inserted in the kgp gene and 54 T9SS-related candidate genes. Thirty-three out of the 54 genes were already known as T9SS-related genes. Furthermore, deletion mutant analysis of the remaining 21 genes revealed that they were not related to the T9SS. The 33 T9SS-related genes include a gene for PGN_0297, which was found to be associated with the T9SS components PorK and PorN. A PGN_0297 gene deletion mutant was constructed, and it was found that the mutant showed no colony pigmentation, hemagglutination or gingipain activities, indicating that PGN_0297 was an essential component of the T9SS. The 33 genes did not include the six genes (gppX, omp17, porY, rfa, sigP and wzx) that were also reported as T9SS-related genes. gppX deletion and insertion mutants were constructed, and it was found that they did not show deficiency in the T9SS.",LncRNA MAFG-AS1 facilitates the migration and invasion of NSCLC cell via sponging miR-339-5p from MMP15.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599080,Cell biology international,2019 03 20,"Non-small-cell carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common cancer along with high mortality rate worldwide. In the present study, our data showed that lncRNA MAF BZIP Transcription Factor G Antisense RNA 1 (MAFG-AS1) was over-expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MAFG-AS1 promoted the migration, invasion and enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cell. In addition, miR-339-5p was predicted to be a target of MAFG-AS1 and the level of miR-339-5p was down-regulated in NSCLC. Over-expression of MAFG-AS1 significantly decreased the level of miR-339-5p in NSCLC cell. Moreover, the matrix metalloproteinase 15 (MMP15) was identified to be a target of miR-339-5p. The level of MMP15 was negatively regulated by miR-339-5p whereas positively controlled by MAFG-AS1. In addition, up-regulation of miR-339-5p neutralized the promoting impact of MAFG-AS1 on the migration, invasion and EMT of NSCLC cell. Finally, the xenograft model suggested that MAFG-AS1 promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cell in vivo. Altogether, we proved that MAFG-AS1-miR-339-5p-MMP15 axis might be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with NSCLC."

To date, the impact of senescence on the cytoskeleton is poorly understood. This study evaluated the cytoskeleton in two independent cellular models of kidney epithelium senescence. Our work identified multiple senescence-related alterations that impact microtubules and filamentous actin during interphase. Both filamentous systems reorganized profoundly when cells became senescent. As such, microtubule stability increased during senescence, making these filaments more resistant to disassembly in the cold or by nocodazole. Microtubule stabilization was accompanied by enhanced α-tubulin acetylation on lysine 40 and the depletion of HDAC6, the major deacetylase for α-tubulin lysine 40. Rho-associated kinase Rock1 is an upstream regulator that modulates key properties of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. Our research shows that Rock1 concentrations were reduced significantly in senescent cells, and we revealed a mechanistic link between microtubule stabilization and Rock1 depletion. Thus, Rock1 overexpression partially restored the cold sensitivity of microtubules in cells undergoing senescence. Additional components relevant to microtubules were affected by senescence. Specifically, we uncovered the senescence-related loss of the microtubule nucleating protein γ-tubulin and aberrant formation of γ-tubulin foci. Concomitant with the alterations of microtubule and actin filaments, senescent cells displayed functional changes. In particular, cell migration was impaired significantly in senescent cells. Taken together, our study identified new senescence-associated deficiencies of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, provided insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms and demonstrated functional consequences that are important to the physiology and function of renal epithelial cells.",Transcriptional repression of the ectodomain sheddase ADAM10 by TBX2 and potential implication for Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599067,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 06 03,"The ADAM10-mediated cleavage of transmembrane proteins regulates cellular processes such as proliferation or migration.

Phylogenetically, they are split into two classes (I and II). By analyzing the entire subclass I odorant receptors sequences, we identified two class I-specific and highly conserved motifs. These are predicted to face each other at the extra-cellular portion of the transmembrane domain, forming a vestibular site at the entrance to the orthosteric-binding cavity. Molecular dynamics simulation combined with site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro functional assays confirm the functional role of this vestibular site in ligand-driven activation. Mutations at this part of the receptor differentially affect the receptor response to four agonists. Since this vestibular site is involved in ligand recognition, it could serve ligand design that targets specifically this sub-genome of mammalian odorant receptors.",Multiple endocannabinoid-mediated mechanisms in the regulation of energy homeostasis in brain and peripheral tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599065,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 03 29,"The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is widely expressed in many central and peripheral tissues, and is involved in a plethora of physiological processes. Among these, activity of the eCB system promotes energy intake and storage, which, however, under pathophysiological conditions, can favour the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. It is proposed that eCB signalling is evolutionary beneficial for survival under periods of scarce food resources. Remarkably, eCB signalling is increased both in hunger and in overnutrition conditions, such as obesity and type-2 diabetes. This apparent paradox suggests a role of the eCB system both at initiation and at clinical endpoint of obesity. This review will focus on recent findings about the role of the eCB system controlling whole-body metabolism in mice that are genetically modified selectively in different cell types. The current data in fact support the notion that eCB signalling is not only engaged in the development but also in the maintenance of obesity, whereby specific cell types in central and peripheral tissues are key sites in regulating the entire body's energy homeostasis.",Impairment of CFTR activity in cultured epithelial cells upregulates the expression and activity of LDH resulting in lactic acid hypersecretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599064,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 04 26,"Mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR chloride channel produce cystic fibrosis (CF). CF patients are more susceptible to bacterial infections in lungs. The most accepted hypothesis sustains that a reduction in the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume favor infections. Alternatively, it was postulated that a reduced HCO3- transport through CFTR leads to a decreased ASL pH, favoring bacterial colonization. The issue is controversial, since recent data from cultured primary cells and CF children showed normal pH values in the ASL. We have reported previously a decreased mitochondrial Complex I (mCx-I) activity in cultured cells with impaired CFTR activity. Thus, we hypothesized that the reduced mCx-I activity could lead to increased lactic acid production (Warburg-like effect) and reduced extracellular pH (pHe). In agreement with this idea, we report here that cells with impaired CFTR function (intestinal Caco-2/pRS26, transfected with an shRNA-CFTR, and lung IB3-1 CF cells) have a decreased pHe. These cells showed increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, LDH-A expression, and lactate secretion. Similar effects were reproduced in control cells stimulated with recombinant IL-1β. The c-Src and JNK inhibitors PP2 and SP600125 were able to increase the pHe, although the differences between control and CFTR-impaired cells were not fully compensated. Noteworthy, the LDH inhibitor oxamate completely restored the pHe of the intestinal Caco-2/pRS26 cells and have a significant effect in lung IB3-1 cells; therefore, an increased lactic acid secretion seems to be the key factor that determine a reduced pHe in these epithelial cells.",Comparison of anti-inflammatory effects of rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (RIVAL-AF study): multicenter randomized study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599063,Heart and vessels,2019 06 10,"Some experimental studies have shown that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the interval changes in inflammatory markers in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who receive DOACs remain unknown. Between July 2013 and April 2014, a total of 187 AF patients randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (n = 91) or dabigatran (n = 96) were assessed for eligibility. The levels of the following inflammatory markers were serially evaluated: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, pentraxin-3, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM).

Finally, 117 patients (rivaroxaban: n = 55, dabigatran: n = 62) were included in the analysis at 12 months. Although the interval changes in sTM levels tended to be greater in the dabigatran group [0.3 (0-0.7) vs. 0.5 (0-1.0) FU/ml, p = 0.061], there were no significant differences in the interval changes in any inflammatory marker between 2 groups.

We investigated plasma nesfatin-1 levels in 302 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. Of the 302 study patients, CAD was present in 172 (57%), of whom 67 had 1-vessel, 49 had 2-vessel, and 56 had 3-vessel disease. Compared with 130 patients without CAD, 172 with CAD had higher plasma nesfatin-1 levels (median 0.21 vs. 0.17 ng/mL, P < 0.01). A stepwise increase in nesfatin-1 levels was found depending on the number of > 50% stenotic coronary vessels: 0.17 in CAD(-), 0.20 in 1-vessel, 0.21 in 2-vessel, and 0.22 ng/mL in 3-vessel disease (P < 0.05).

The odds ratio for CAD was 1.71 (95% CI 1.01-2.91) for high nesfatin-1 level of > 0.19 ng/mL (P < 0.05). Thus, plasma nesfatin-1 levels were found to be high in patients with CAD and were associated with CAD independent of atherosclerotic risk factors, suggesting that high nesfatin-1 levels in patients with CAD may play a role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis.",Mid-term outcomes of concomitant left atrial appendage closure and catheter ablation for non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a multicenter registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599061,Heart and vessels,2019 04 17,"To investigate the safety and midterm outcome of concomitant left atrial appendage (LAA) closure and catheter ablation (CA) as a one-stage hybrid procedure for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in a multicenter registry.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent predictor for IST on 9-month OCT was irregular protrusion (odds ratio = 8.952, p = 0.037) on post-PCI OCT, not CYP2C19 loss-of-function polymorphisms. An adequate anti-thrombotic effect with an acceptable incidence of IST was observed irrespective of CYP2C19 loss-of-function polymorphisms. Our data suggests that adjusted-dose prasugrel and aspirin is a feasible treatment option in Japanese patients treated with EESs in elective PCI."

Caenorhabditis elegans is a great model to analyze the determinants of cell fate stability because of its invariant lineage. We present a tractable cell fate challenge system that uses the induction of fate-specifying transcription factors. We show that wild-type differentiated animals are highly resistant to fate challenge. Removal of heterochromatin marks showed marked differences: the absence of histone 3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9) has no effect on fate stability, whereas Polycomb homolog mes-2 mutants lacking H3K27 methylation terminally arrest larval development upon fate challenge. Unexpectedly, the arrest correlated with widespread cell proliferation rather than transdifferentiation. Using a candidate RNAi larval arrest-rescue screen, we show that the LIN-12Notch pathway is essential for hyperplasia induction. Moreover, Notch signaling appears downstream of food-sensing pathways, as dauers and first larval stage diapause animals are resistant to fate challenge. Our results demonstrate an equilibrium between proliferation and differentiation regulated by Polycomb and Notch signaling in the soma during the nematode life cycle.",Re-annotation of eight Drosophila genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599046,Life science alliance,2019 01 08,"The sequenced genomes of the Drosophila phylogeny are a central resource for comparative work supporting the understanding of the Drosophila melanogaster non-mammalian model system. These have also facilitated evolutionary studies on the selected and random differences that distinguish the thousands of extant species of Drosophila. However, full utility has been hampered by uneven genome annotation. We have generated a large expression profile dataset for nine species of Drosophila and trained a transcriptome assembly approach on D. melanogaster that best matched the extensively curated annotation. We then applied this to the other species to add more than 10000 transcript models per species. We also developed new orthologs to facilitate cross-species comparisons. We validated the new annotation of the distantly related Drosophila grimshawi with an extensive collection of newly sequenced cDNAs. This re-annotation will facilitate understanding both the core commonalities and the species differences in this important group of model organisms, and suggests a strategy for annotating the many forthcoming genomes covering the tree of life.",Medical Plants and Nutraceuticals for Amyloid-β Fibrillation Inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599045,Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports,2019 01 08,"Plaque formation due to amyloid-β oligomerization and fibrillation is a key issue for its deposition in the brains of dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients.

Furthermore, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) mono-infections in established periodontal lesions, or introducing its lipopolysachharide (LPS), as demonstrated in in vivo studies, show hallmark pathology inclusive of extracellular amyloid plaques and phospho-tau bound neurofibrillary tangles with AD-like phenotype. Other studies have shown that if periodontitis remains untreated in human AD patients, cognitive decline ensues. This is a bi-directional relationship meaning that the converse is also true; treating periodontal disease in AD patients improves memory. Bacterial cultures and established oral biofilms generate vast numbers of microvesicles and P. gingivalis outer membrane vesicles encase key virulence factors (LPS, gingipains, capsule, fimbriae) as though they are complete destructive ""microbullets"" when shed in the host. This provides P. gingivalis additional arsenal to manipulate its entry into disparate organs, hijack phagocytosis, destroy tissues, and affect complement related genes while transducing the onset of proinflammatory signaling cascades. The resulting inflammatory mediators may be the cause of disease defining lesions and cognitive decline typical of clinical AD.",Pediatric Transthoracic Cardiac Vector Flow Imaging - A Preliminary Pictorial Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599042,Ultrasound international open,2019 01 08,"Purpose Conventional pediatric echocardiography is crucial for diagnosing congenital heart disease (CHD), but the technique is impaired by angle dependency.

Typically, an incidental focal finding on US or a focal indeterminate lesion diagnosed on CT, MRI or PET/CT is referred for US-guided biopsy for final diagnosis. The introduction of microbubble US contrast agents has overcome some of the limitations of standard US in diagnosing FLLs by displaying the microvasculature together with the US morphology, which has increased both the sensitivity and the specificity. The combination of CEUS and intervention is facilitated by newer US equipment providing split-screen mode, which displays the CEUS mode alongside the standard US mode simultaneously on a single monitor. The puncture line is displayed in both modes as well as on the monitor. The interventional device (i. e., biopsy needle) is typically best visualized in the standard US mode, while the characteristic tissue pattern in an FLL is typically best visualized in CEUS mode. There are 3 main categories in which CEUS has an impact on US-guided biopsy of FLLs: • CEUS improves the visualization of FLLs • CEUS improves the quality of the biopsy specimen from an FLL • CEUS reduces the need for US-guided biopsy of an FLL In the two first categories, CEUS is utilized simultaneously with US-guided biopsy to ensure correct needle targeting. In the last category, US-guided biopsy of the FLL becomes superfluous as a result of the CEUS examination.","European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) Policy Document Development Strategy - Clinical Practice Guidelines, Position Statements and Technological Reviews.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599040,Ultrasound international open,2019 01 08,"This document summarizes principles and methodology to guide the creation of Clinical Practice Guidelines, Position Statements und Technological Reviews of the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB).

However, it is still unclear how the auditory cortical changes accompany the subcortical neural changes. The present study aimed to find the neural plastic changes in the cortical and subcortical auditory system following adult-onset single-sided deafness (SSD) using Mn-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). B57BL/6 mice (postnatal 8-week-old) were divided into three groups: the SSD-4-week group (postnatal 12-week-old, n = 11), the SSD-8-week group (postnatal 16-week-old, n = 11), and a normal-hearing control group (postnatal 8-week-old, n = 9). The left cochlea was ablated in the SSD groups. White Gaussian noise was delivered for 24 h before MEMRI acquisition. T1-weighted MRI data were analyzed from the cochlear nucleus (CN), superior olivary complex (SOC), lateral lemniscus (LL), inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MG), and auditory cortex (AC). The differences in relative Mn2+-enhanced signal intensities (Mn2+SI) and laterality were analyzed between the groups. Four weeks after the SSD procedure, the ipsilateral side of the SSD showed significantly lower Mn2+SI in the CN than the control group. On the other hand, the contralateral side of the SSD demonstrated significantly lower Mn2+SI in the SOC, LL, and IC. These decreased Mn2+SI values were partially recovered at 8 weeks after the SSD procedure. The interaural Mn2+SI differences representing the interaural dominance were highest in CN and then became less prominently higher in the auditory neural system. The SSD-8-week group still showed interaural differences in the CN, LL, and IC. In contrast, the MG and AC did not show any significant intergroup or interaural differences in Mn2+SI. In conclusion, subcortical auditory neural activities were decreased after SSD, and the interaural differences were diluted in the higher auditory nervous system. These findings were attenuated with time. Subcortical auditory neural changes after SSD may contribute to the change in tinnitus severity and the outcomes of cochlear implantation in SSD patients.",Associations between Aquaglyceroporin Gene Polymorphisms and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598999,BioMed research international,2019 04 12,AQP7 and AQP9 represent glycerol channel in adipose tissue and liver and have been associated with metabolic diseases.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the anticancer activities of GTN and molecular signaling pathways associated with cell death in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line. GTN inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V-FITC and PI staining, and apoptotic morphology was observed by microscopy. Reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and enhanced caspases activities were found in GTN-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. GTN significantly altered apoptosis-related protein expressions, including Noxa, PUMA, Bax, Bim, Bad, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and DIABLO, which was related to the gene expression levels. Mitochondrial calcium released to the cytosol and ER stress related proteins increased, which correlated with increases in ER stress gene expression levels. GTN induced hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals in MDA-MB-231 cells associated with cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, which was induced by phosphorylation and ATM gene expression. Moreover, GTN had synergistic effects when combined with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, and additive effect with methotrexate through caspases enzyme-acceleration. In conclusion, goniothalamin-induced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis occurred via intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, along with ER stress.

Therefore, sleep is not a mere passive state, but it is a highly organized interaction of neural networks and neurotransmitters of the CNS which maintain active neurobehavioral state. However, in insomnia normal physiological function is disturbed which results in several comorbidities such as depression, cardiovascular disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, breathing difficulties, chronic pain, and gastrointestinal problems which affect the quality of life. Diagnosis of insomnia requires a comprehensive assessment of patient's medical history, physical examination, and sleeping pattern using various screen tools. There are several options available for the treatment of insomnia such as non-pharmacological and pharmacological that increase our understanding of the involvement of neurophysiological, neurobehavioral, neurochemical, neurocognitive, and neuroendocrine factors associated with insomnia. The pharmacological agents that are currently in use for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepines (BZDs), non-BZD hypnotics, and ramelteon as well as antidepressants such as doxepin. However, due to adverse events and addiction potential, use of BZDs is obsolete. Among non-BZD, zolpidem is the highly prescribed drug for the treatment of insomnia, globally. This review article focuses on prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of insomnia in patients with hypertension and diabetes. In addition, it also discusses the role of zolpidem in comparison to BZDs in the management of insomnia.","Herbal medicines: Saudi population knowledge, attitude, and practice at a glance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598925,Journal of family medicine and primary care,2019 01 08,"Herbal medicines are widely used in many countries in preventing and treating health disorders.

Two techniques of aortic occlusion are utilized with this technique: transthoracic aortic clamp (TTC) and endoaortic balloon occlusion (EAO). Both possibilities present peculiar advantages and limitations whose current evidence is based on few observational studies. We performed an analysis with the primary objective to evaluate outcomes and the incidence of major complications of these two techniques.,The Cardioband transcatheter annular reduction system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598887,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 01 08,"Surgical implantation of a complete or incomplete ring to reduce the mitral valve annulus and improve leaflet coaptation is the foundation of valve repair for degenerative and functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The Cardioband system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) is a catheter-delivered annular reduction system that mimics the surgical approach. Sequential anchors are used to secure the Cardioband implant from trigone to trigone. The Cardioband implant is contracted under transesophageal guidance until valvular regurgitation is reduced. In the initial clinical experience, the Cardioband system was safely deployed in patients with clinically significant functional mitral regurgitation (MR) and yielded durable MR reduction, improved quality of life, and improved exercise capacity. The early and still-evolving Cardioband experience for tricuspid regurgitation is also promising. The ongoing pivotal ACTIVE Trial is designed to demonstrate the superiority of the Cardioband system to guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with clinically significant functional MR (FMR) using a composite endpoint of mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, quality of life, and exercise capacity.",Transcatheter mitral valve chord repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598886,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 01 08,"The field of mitral valve disease diagnosis and management is rapidly evolving. New understanding of pathophysiology and improvements in the adoption of sophisticated multimodality imaging modalities have led to early diagnosis and to more complex treatment. The most common cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the western world is in the primary alteration of the valve, which leads to degenerative leaflet prolapse due to chordal elongation or rupture and annular dilatation. Untreated, significant MR has a negative impact prognosis, leading to reduction of survival. In the setting of degenerative MR, surgical repair currently represents the standard of care. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe MR in the Valve Center of Excellence, in which successful repair reaches more than 95% and surgical mortality less than 1%, symbolizes the direction for the next years. Transcatheter mitral valve repair with different devices, more recently the chordal replacement ones, is providing good outcomes and became a therapeutic option in high-risk patients with degenerative MR. In the future, more advances are expected from further development of interventional techniques, careful evaluation and better patient selection. This review will focus on long-term surgical outcomes of mitral valve repair with artificial chordae and on the emerging transcatheter chordal repair devices as therapeutic options for degenerative MR patients.",Complexities of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) and why it is not transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598885,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 01 08,"Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is currently being investigated as a procedural alternative to surgical mitral valve repair or replacement (SMVR). Early data from first-in-man trials with current devices suggest that TMVR is technically feasible but carries a high mortality. This is substantially different from the early success transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has seen and is related to complexities of the mitral valve anatomy, differences in pathology that require mitral valve replacement as well as the impact that mitral valve replacement has on physiology and cardiac function, irrespective of the modality by which the mitral valve is replaced. Importantly, in the case of TAVR, a less invasive method is offered to accomplish the same as the traditional surgical intervention. On the other hand, valve replacement is not the recommended treatment option for the majority of mitral valve disease, and in fact is avoided whenever possible during surgery given the shortened life expectancy and increased morbidity with mitral valve replacement. Another distinction between TAVR and TMVR is the etiology and natural progression of the underlying disease and driving factors for intervention that are vastly different between aortic and mitral valve disease. The primary aortic disease treated has been aortic stenosis, which has several etiologic factors that cause a similar physiologic dysfunction and risk. Aortic valve replacement leads to improved survival and quality of life. The primary mitral valve disease targeted is regurgitation, which occurs as a primary valve defect and as a secondary consequence of ventricular dysfunction. Primary mitral regurgitation is treated by valve repair with excellent long-term outcomes. Secondary regurgitation has poor long-term outcomes with current commonly used repair techniques and limited data exists showing that correction of the regurgitation improves survival. Adoption of TMVR will require overcoming the anatomic challenges as well as generating data that supports improved survival and/or quality of life.",Novel mitral valve technologies-transcatheter mitral valve implantation: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598884,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 01 08,"Valvular heart disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world; in industrialized nations, mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular lesion.

Cerebrovascular complications of infections include vasculitis, mycotic aneurysms, and thrombophlebitis. Infectious vasculitis of the CNS may cause cerebral hemorrhage, infarction or ischemia. Ruptured aneurysms may endanger the patient's life. Infectious thrombophlebitis may cause intracranial pressure to increase and lead to cerebral hemorrhage. These cerebrovascular complications are associated with a poor prognosis and often cause irreversible neurological deficits. Cerebrovascular events secondary to infection are not easily distinguishable from the more common cerebral infarct and non-infectious vasculitis. In addition, the clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular complications of infections are non-specific and highly variable. Therefore, early imaging, antibiotics, and anticoagulation may be lifesaving the patient's life and prevent disability.

This process, which was initially described in fibroblasts, is now recognized to occur in stem cells. It has been well characterized in cell lines, but there is currently very limited data available on human senescence in vivo. We recently reported that the expression of transposable elements (TE), including endogenous retroviruses, was up-regulated along with inflammatory genes in human senescent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo. The mechanism of regulation of TE expression is not completely understood, but changes in DNA methylation and chromatin modifications are known to alter their expression. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for TE up-regulation after senescence of HSPCs, we employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in paired senescent and active human HSPCs in vivo from healthy subjects. We found that the senescent HSPCs exhibited hypomethylated regions in the genome, which were enriched for TEs. This is the first report characterizing the methylome of senescent human HSPCs.","Design and Benchtop Validation of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis with High-Torque, Low-Impedance Actuators.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598854,IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation : ICRA : [proceedings]. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2019 05 01,"This paper describes the design of a powered knee- and-ankle transfemoral prosthetic leg, which implements high torque density actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The low reduction of the transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles implemented in emerging robotic prosthetic legs. Such benefits include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, and greater potential for power regeneration. Benchtop validation experiments were conducted to verify some of these benefits. Backdrive and free-swinging knee tests confirm that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (~3 Nm). Bandwidth tests reveal that the actuator is capable of achieving frequencies required for walking and running. Lastly, open-loop impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufficiently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback."
