This study retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of growth after RTx using the pediatric-to-pediatric allocation strategy and some factors that may affect it. From March 2012 to August 2016, 8 en bloc and 38 single pediatric RTxs were performed at our center using organs from small pediatric deceased donors (weight < 15 kg). Growth before and after RTx was analyzed according to the height-for-age z-score at RTx, the 3-year follow-up, and adulthood and compared between the procedures. The chi-square test and multiple linear regression analysis were used for statistical analyses. Overall, 79.2% of children were diagnosed with chronic nephritis before RTx; 14.6% of cases were due to congenital urinary tract malformation, and 6.3% of cases were due to unknown causes. All grafts and patients survived postoperatively. The mean estimated GFRs were 92.7 ± 28.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 , 100.9 ± 32.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 , and 110.1 ± 34.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 1, 2, and 3 years' postoperatively, respectively. The children's postoperative growth and development, particularly during the first year postoperatively, improved but were negatively correlated with age and the height-for-age z-score before RTx. The growth of children after RTx was moderate and accelerated during prepubescence. The rate of post-RTx growth during the first year postoperatively was unrelated to the recipient's sex or duration of dialysis (P > 0.05) but was negatively correlated with age at RTx (r = -0.349, P = 0.043).

The completed labeling of these analytes can be finished rapidly only within 5 min at the room temperature (25°C) to form 4-(carbazole-9-yl)-benzyl chloroformate labeled fluorescence derivatives. These labeled derivatives expressed strong fluorescence property with the maximum excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 380 nm, respectively. The labeled derivatives were analyzed using a reversed-phase Eclipse SB-C18 column within 10 min with satisfactory shapes. Excellent linearity (R2  > 0.995) for all analytes was achieved with the limits of detection and the limits of quantitation in the range of 0.25-0.35 and 0.70-1.10 μg/L, respectively.

In this study, we conducted the developmental expression patterns and competitive binding assay as well as knock-down assay by RNA interference both in vitro and in vivo to reveal the function of NlugCSP10 from the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), a major pest in rice plants. The results showed that NlugCSP10 messenger RNA was significantly higher in males than in females and correlated to gender, development and wing forms. The fluorescence binding assays revealed that NlugCSP10 exhibited the highest binding affinity with cis-3-hexenyl acetate, eicosane, and (+)-β-pinene. Behavioral assay revealed that eicosane displayed attractant activity, while cis-3-hexenyl acetate, similar to (+)-β-pinene significantly repelled N. lugens adults. Silencing of NlugCSP10, which is responsible for cis-3-hexenyl acetate binding, significantly disrupted cis-3-hexenyl acetate communication. Overall, findings of the present study showed that NlugCSP10 could selectively interrelate with numerous volatiles emitted from host plants and these ligands could be designated to develop slow-release mediators that attract/repel N. lugens and subsequently improve the exploration of plans to control this insect pest.",Upregulation of long noncoding RNA TUG1 by EGR1 promotes adenomyotic epithelial cell migration and invasion through recruiting EZH2 and suppressing TIMP2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593723,Molecular reproduction and development,2019 06 13,"Emerging studies showed that lncRNA taurine upregulated 1 (TUG1) plays important roles in diverse biological processes. However, there is no previously published research reporting the regulatory role of lncRNAs in the progression of adenomyosis. In the present study, we found that TUG1 is upregulated in human adenomyosis, and the overexpression of TUG1 is associated with the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1). Functionally, the knockdown of TUG1 inhibited adenomyotic epithelial cell migration and invasion but not growth. The mechanistic experiments demonstrated that the function of TUG1 in adenomyotic epithelial cell invasion is, at least in part, through recruiting the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to the promoter of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) and negatively regulating its expression. Our study demonstrated that TUG1 promotes the migration and invasion of human adenomyotic epithelial cells, and EGR1/TUG1/EZH2/TIMP2 may be a potential therapeutic target for adenomyosis.","Rates and pathways of CH4 oxidation in ferruginous Lake Matano, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593722,Geobiology,2019 04 26,"This study evaluates rates and pathways of methane (CH4 ) oxidation and uptake using 14 C-based tracer experiments throughout the oxic and anoxic waters of ferruginous Lake Matano. Methane oxidation rates in Lake Matano are moderate (0.36 nmol L-1  day-1 to 117 μmol L-1  day-1 ) compared to other lakes, but are sufficiently high to preclude strong CH4 fluxes to the atmosphere. In addition to aerobic CH4 oxidation, which takes place in Lake Matano's oxic mixolimnion, we also detected CH4 oxidation in Lake Matano's anoxic ferruginous waters. Here, CH4 oxidation proceeds in the apparent absence of oxygen (O2 ) and instead appears to be coupled to some as yet uncertain combination of nitrate ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>NO</mml:mtext> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msubsup> </mml:math> ), nitrite ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>NO</mml:mtext> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msubsup> </mml:math> ), iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn), or sulfate ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>SO</mml:mtext> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow> <mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow> </mml:msubsup> </mml:math> ) reduction.

Liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode was utilized for the determination of phenolic composition qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings asserted a quite similar phenolic profile (14 phenols) depending on the various phenolic groups in all oils, while the concentration of total and individual phenolic compounds revealed significant differences between the samples statistically (p < 0.05). Among the individual phenolic classes in all samples, secoiridoids were the most prevailing group and their total content showed a clear significant decline as the olive fruits get ripened. Antioxidant potency values showed a clear diminution attitude during the maturation of the olives. The principal component analysis revealed that oils were discriminated from each other according to phenolic compounds and antioxidant potencies. Moreover, oils obtained from the unripe and medium-ripe fruits possessed a very good quality marked by their elevated phenolic levels.",Nonadiabatic scattering of NO off Au3 clusters: A simple and robust diabatic state manifold generation method for multiconfigurational wavefunctions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593705,Journal of computational chemistry,2019 01 09,"The presence of nonadiabatic effects during the interaction of small molecules with metals has been observed experimentally for the last decades. Specially remarkable are the effects found for NO/Au, where experiments have suggested the presence of very strong vibronic coupling during the molecular scattering. However, the accurate inclusion of the nonadiabatic effects in periodic boundary conditions (PBC) theoretical methods remain an unapproachable challenge. Here, aiming to give some theoretical insight to the strong vibronic coupling, we have adopted a pragmatic point of view, taking use of an auxiliary simplified system, NO/Au3 . We show the importance of nonadiabatic coupling, during the scattering of NO from a Au3 cluster, using a diabatic representation of 12 electronic states of the system, including a few charge-transfer states. Our diabatic representation is obtained by rotating the orbital and configuration interaction (CI) vectors of a restricted active space (RAS) wavefunction. We present a strategy for extracting the best effective manifold of states relevant to the system, below some prescribed energy, directly from the RAS CI vectors. This scheme is able to disentangle a large dense manifold of adiabatic states with strong coupling and crossings. This approach is also shown to work for multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). By performing quantum propagations, we observed an increase in vibrational redistribution with increasing initial vibrational or translational energies. We suggest that these nonadiabatic effects should also be present at smaller energies in larger clusters. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor attenuates chronic ischemia-induced prostatic hyperplasia in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593704,The Prostate,2019 02 07,"Many elderly men suffer from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

It exhibits many impacts such as antimicrobial, immunostimulating, antioxidants and hepatoprotective. Furthermore, BP has some useful therapeutic features in numerous pathological situations such as its impact to normalize wound healing. Based on previous literatures, the level of BP supplement in livestock and poultry ranged from 0.1 to 20 g/kg diet. This variation depends on the species, physiological status, age and purpose of addition; so far generally, it accepted to use the level with no side effects. It has been observed that BP enhanced growth performance, immunity responses and blood variables and had hypoglycaemic activity by reducing the lipid in the blood and carcass. Also, BP contains more nutrients, which stimulate faster differentiation and proliferation of the cells of immune system of birds. Therefore, the present review recommends that BP supplementation (up to 20 g/kg diet) had possible beneficial impacts, antioxidants and protective activities on most of the production, productive and health patterns of livestock.",Cerebral Artery Vasospasm Detection Using Transcranial Doppler Signal Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593699,Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,2018 12 29,"Silent cerebral artery vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage causes serious complications such as cerebral ischemia and death. A transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound system is a noninvasive device that can effectively detect cerebral artery vasospasm as soon as it sets in, even before and in the absence of clinical deterioration. Continuous or even daily TCD monitoring is challenging because of the operator expertise and certification required in the form of a trained sonographer and interpretive experience required in the form of an additionally trained and certified physician to perform these studies. This barrier exists because of a lack of automation for detection (without human intervention) of cerebral artery vasospasm using TCD ultrasound. To overcome this barrier, we present an algorithm that automates detection of cerebral artery vasospasm."

However, the evidence linking these two types of processes to behavioral choices in intertemporal decision-making remains elusive. As the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) have been associated with these two processes, we focused on these three regions. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a delayed discounting task (DDT) using a relatively large sample size, three independent samples. We evaluated how much information about a specific choice could be decoded from local patterns in each brain area using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). To investigate the relationship between the dlPFC and vmPFC/striatum regions, we performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. In Experiment I, we found that the vmPFC and dlPFC, but not the striatum, could determine choices in healthy participants. Furthermore, we found that the dlPFC showed significant functional connectivity with the vmPFC, but not the striatum, when making decisions. These results could be replicated in Experiment II with an independent sample of healthy participants. In Experiment III, the choice-decoding accuracy in the vmPFC and dlPFC was lower in patients with addiction (smokers and participants with Internet gaming disorder) than in healthy participants, and decoding accuracy in the dlPFC was related to impulsivity in addicts. Taken together, our findings may provide neural evidence supporting the hypothesis that value evaluation and self-control processes both guide the intertemporal choices, and might provide potential neural targets for the diagnosis and treatment of impulsivity-related brain disorders.",The future of system justification theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593682,The British journal of social psychology,2018 12 29,"In this article, we respond to commentaries by Friesen et al.

Finally, we end by proposing exciting new areas for future research, such as (1) distinguishing between subjective and objective consequences of system justification in a broader array of social and political contexts and (2) developing practical interventions to reduce system justification motivation and strengthen the motivation to improve upon the status quo.",A sandwich ELISA for detecting the hemagglutinin of avian influenza A (H10N8) virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593681,Journal of medical virology,2019 03 06,"Novel influenza A virus (H10N8) infected human with fatality in China during 2013-2014. It is important to detect such nonprevalent subtype influenza A virus in clinic and regular surveillance in the early stage for effective control and prevention from the potential pandemic. Unavailability of convenient rapid diagnosis for this subtype virus in resources-limited setting is an obstacle for timely recognizing human case. In the present study, a panel of mouse H10 specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was generated, two of which were used to develop a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the hemagglutinin of avian influenza A (H10N8) virus. ELISA results showed high sensitivity with the lowest detection limit of 0.5HAU/50 μL for live virus, which laid a foundation for clinic use as a promising diagnostic methodology.","MPEXS-DNA, a new GPU-based Monte Carlo simulator for track structures and radiation chemistry at subcellular scale.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593679,Medical physics,2019 03 13,"Track structure simulation codes can accurately reproduce the stochastic nature of particle-matter interactions in order to evaluate quantitatively radiation damage in biological cells such as DNA strand breaks and base damage.

Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed as new antimicrobial agents. Aureins are a family of AMPs that are isolated from Green and Golden Bell Frogs. These peptides have a favorable antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. We designed two peptides derived from natural Aurein enjoying alignment-based design method. After synthesis of the peptides, their secondary structure was checked by circular dichroism. Consequently, the antibacterial effects of these peptides were investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and bactericidal concentration. Eventually, the toxicity of these peptides was determined by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on normal human skin cells (Hu02 cell line). Natural Aurein1.2 was used as a natural control to compare the properties in all stages. The results indicated that these new peptides had medium-upward antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis (MIC of 8-64 μg/mL) and weak bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of 128-256 μg/mL). Also, MTT assays results showed that AureinN2 is less toxic than AureinN1 and Aurein1.2. Toxicity of AureinN2 for Hu02 cell lines was between 20 and 40% at the concentration of 8-500 μg/mL. In this study, we were able to improve antimicrobial activity of two synthetic derivatives of the Aurein family against Gram-negative bacteria by using machine-learning algorithm and other in silico methods.",Stochastic model based on preharvest peripheral CD34-positive cell count and collection efficiency predicting processed blood volume in peripheral hematopoietic stem cell apheresis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593675,Transfusion,2019 02 06,"Processed blood volume (PBV) required to obtain a predefined number of stem cells can be estimated from peripheral blood CD34+ cell concentration, body weight, and collection efficiency (CE).

Integration and modularity have been proposed to influence the trajectory of evolution, either acting as constraints or facilitators. Here, we examine trends in the integration and modularity of pectoral fin morphology in teleost fishes using geometric morphometrics. We compare the fin shapes of the highly diverse radiation of acanthomorph fishes to lower teleosts. Integration and modularity are measured using two-block partial least squares analysis and the covariance ratio coefficient between the radial bones and lepidotrichia of the pectoral fins. We show that the fins of acanthomorph fishes are more tightly integrated but also more morphologically diverse and faster evolving compared to nonacanthomorph fishes. The main pattern of shape covariation in nonacanthomorphs is concordant with the main trajectory of evolution between nonacanthomorphs and acanthomorphs. Our findings support a facilitating role for integration during the acanthomorph diversification. Potential functional consequences and developmental mechanisms of fin integration are discussed.","Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope inter- and intra-individual dietary reconstruction from the late 14th to early 18th century site of Alytus, Lithuania.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593657,American journal of physical anthropology,2019 01 10,"The Baltic region, particularly Lithuania, was a politically vibrant area of Eastern Europe during the medieval and early modern period.

Here, we investigate individual, collaborative and competitive visual search with visualization of search partners' gaze. Participants were instructed to search a grid of Gabor patches while being eye tracked. For collaboration and competition, searchers were shown in real time at which element the paired searcher was looking. To promote collaboration or competition, points were rewarded or deducted for correct or incorrect answers. Early in collaboration trials, searchers rarely fixated the same elements. Reaction times of couples were roughly halved compared with individual search, although error rates did not increase. This indicates searchers formed an efficient collaboration strategy. Overlap, the proportion of dwells that landed on hexagons that the other searcher had already looked at, was lower than expected from simulated overlap of two searchers who are blind to the behavior of their partner. The proportion of overlapping dwells correlated positively with ratings of the quality of collaboration. During competition, overlap increased earlier in time, indicating that competitors divided space less efficiently. Analysis of the entropy of the dwell locations and scan paths revealed that in the competition condition, a less fixed looking pattern was exhibited than in the collaborate and individual search conditions. We conclude that participants can efficiently search together when provided only with information about their partner's gaze position by dividing up the search space. Competing search exhibited more random gaze patterns, potentially reflecting increased interaction between searchers in this condition.","Concentrations of cadmium and lead, but not zinc, are higher in red fox tissues than in rodents-pollution gradient study in the Małopolska province (Poland).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593652,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 15,"The main purpose of our research was to assess the chronic exposure of red foxes to Cd, Pb and Zn.

Tissue concentrations of Pb and Cd in the red foxes significantly co-varied with concentrations of these elements in the soil, and differed between the tissues. We compared concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Zn in red foxes with two rodent species, Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus, trapped simultaneously in the same area. Concentrations of Pb and Cd appeared significantly higher in the red foxes than in the rodents, but the slopes of the relationship between metal concentrations in tissues and in soil were similar in all species.

This review aims to highlight the main criteria for assessing the prognosis of HCC that these different staging systems take into account, their strengths and limitations for use in modern clinical practice. Despite the limitations of the BCLC staging system, it remains the most validated and reliable system for prognostication. However, there is a need to update the BCLC staging system to include recent data on locoregional and systemic therapies for HCC, expanded criteria for transplantation, and systemic therapy for hepatitis C infection.",Ethical issues in human germline gene editing: a perspective from China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593648,Monash bioethics review,2019 05 24,"The ethical issues associated with germline gene modification and embryo research are some of the most contentious in current international science policy debates. In this paper, we argue that new genetic techniques, such as CRISPR, demonstrate that there is an urgent need for China to develop its own regulatory and ethical framework governing new developments in genetic and embryo research. While China has in place a regulatory framework, it needs to be strengthened to include better compliance oversight and explicit criteria for how different types of research should be reviewed by regulatory authorities. We also document a variety of opinions about the new technologies among the public, scholars, and policy makers. China needs to develop its own regulations in coordination with other countries; but it is unlikely that an international consensus will be achieved in this area, given the existing differences in regulations between countries. We should aim at harmonization, not necessarily complete consensus, and the perspective from China is vital when international norms are developed and harmonized.

The envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 in particular are able to tolerate a particularly high level of variation. They are under continual selection pressure from the host antibody response during chronic infection and can tolerate adaptive mutations, leading to great diversity in a single host. The diversity of E1/E2 in circulating viruses has hindered investigations of their function and development of a vaccine that will generate antibodies able to potently neutralize entry of genetically distinct strains.Here we describe methods used in our laboratory to overcome the limitations of investigating the properties of the envelope glycoproteins representing only small numbers of HCV variants.

Meanwhile, active enhancers and super-enhancers also produce transcripts termed enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) from their DNA elements. Although enhancers have been identified for more than 30 years, widespread transcription from enhancers are just discovered by genome-wide sequencing and considered as the key to understand longstanding questions in gene transcription. RNA-transcribed enhancers are marked by histone modifications such as H3K4m1/2 and H3K27Ac, and enriched with transcription regulatory factors such as LDTFs, P300, CBP, BRD4 and MED1. Those regulatory factors might constitute a Mega-Trans-like complex to potently activate enhancers. Compared to mRNAs, eRNAs are quite unstable and play roles at local. Functionally, it has been shown that eRNAs promote formation of enhancer-promoter loops. Several studies also demonstrated that eRNAs help the binding of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) or transition of paused RNAPII by de-association of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. Nevertheless, these proposed mechanisms are not universally accepted and still under controversy.

In this study, after subjecting the animals to 80% oxygen (O2) for 5-7 d, the retinal vessel density at postnatal day 12 (P12) was approximately 30% lower than that in the age-matched control, but this difference was not significant between the groups. Vessel abnormalities, such as vessel tortuosity, neovascular tufts, and the number of vessels protruding into the vitreous, peaked between P17 and P20. Despite the regression of many abnormalities, vessel density in the OIR group was 36% and 32% lower than that in the control animals at 6 weeks and 4 months, respectively. The visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were impaired in the OIR group when measured at 2, 3 and 4 months. Therefore, the rodent OIR model exhibited long-lasting reduction in retinal vessel density and visual impairments, similar to those observed in mild or moderate human ROP. This study suggests that the rodent OIR model can be used to explore possible interventions for mild and moderate human ROP.",Targeted disruption of tyrosinase causes melanin reduction in Carassius auratus cuvieri and its hybrid progeny.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593611,Science China. Life sciences,2018 12 29,"The white crucian carp (Carassius auratus cuvieri, WCC) not only is one of the most economically important fish in Asia, characterized by strong reproductive ability and rapid growth rates, but also represents a good germplasm to produce hybrid progenies with heterosis. Gene knockout technique provides a safe and acceptant way for fish breeding. Achieving gene knockout in WCC and its hybrid progeny will be of great importance for both genetic studies and hybridization breeding. Tyrosinase (TYR) is a key enzyme in melanin synthesis. Depletion of tyr in zebrafish and mice results in mosaic pigmentation or total albinism. Here, we successfully used CRISPR-Cas9 to target tyr in WCC and its hybrid progeny (WR) derived from the cross of WCC (♀) and red crucian carp (Carassius auratus red var., RCC, ♂). The level of TYR protein was significantly reduced in mutant WCC. Both the mutant WCC and the mutant WR showed different degrees of melanin reduction compared with the wild-type sibling control fish, resulting from different mutation efficiency ranging from 60% to 90%. In addition, the transcriptional expression profiles of a series of pivotal pigment synthesis genes, i.e. tyrp1, mitfa, mitfb, dct and sox10, were down-regulated in tyr-CRISPR WCC, which ultimately caused a reduction in melanin synthesis. These results demonstrated that tyr plays a key role in melanin synthesis in WCC and WR, and CRISPR-Cas9 is an effective tool for modifying the genome of economical fish. Furthermore, the tyr-CRISPR models could be valuable in understanding fundamental mechanisms of pigment formation in non-model fish.",Behavior of pre-mix formulation of imazethapyr and imazamox herbicides in two different soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593610,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 02 15,"Imidazolinone group herbicides are known for longer persistence in soil. Therefore, a laboratory study was performed to evaluate the persistence of pre-mix formulation of two imidazolinone herbicides-imazethapyr and imazamox in clay and sandy loam soils. Herbicide formulation was applied at 70 and 140 g a.i. ha-1 equivalent to recommended doses in legumes. For achieving efficient sample preparation, three methods namely ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD), and solid phase extraction (SPE) were optimized. MSPD gave better recoveries (85.22 to 96.00%) over SPE (80.10 to 84.78%) and UAE (56.44 to 66.20%). Residues were estimated using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) which is previously not reported in open literature. Dissipation followed first-order kinetics and half-life period of 23.5 to 43.3 days in clay loam and 19.6 to 39.8 days in sandy loam soil. The results revealed the persistent nature of pre-mix formulation of both herbicides as only 64.2 to 86.6% residues dissipated after 90 days of application in both soils.",Effect of watershed land use on tributaries' water quality in the east African Highland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593609,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 02 15,"A study was carried out on four tributaries of Gilgel Gibe Reservoir to identify water physicochemical characteristics in different land use categories (farmland, naturally vegetated land, and settlement). Water samples were collected from 12 sampling sites along four permanent streams flowing into Gilgel Gibe Reservoir. Data sets were evaluated using nonparametric statistical techniques. Dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS) spatially showed significant differences in the wet season and DO, temperature, and BOD5 varied significantly during the dry season. When excluding DO, electrical conductivity (EC), and TP during the wet and dry seasons, the remaining variables showed significant differences. During the wet season, concentrations of most water quality parameters were greatest in influents from agricultural land. Pollution and eutrophication risk is closely associated with drainage from agricultural land, requiring that emphasis and priorities be given to land use management and conservation.","Drivers of urban expansion over the past three decades: a comparative study of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593608,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 02 15,"Urban expansion is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. Understanding the driving forces of urban expansion is crucial for modeling the process of urban expansion as well as guiding urban planning and management. Here, we quantified and compared the effects of natural, socioeconomic, and neighboring factors on urban expansion and their temporal dynamics in three large cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration: Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang. We used remote sensing imagery from six epochs (circa 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) integrated with GIS techniques and analyzed using binary logistic regression. The relative importance of the three types of driving forces was further decomposed using variance partitioning. We found that the direction and/or magnitude of effects on the drivers of urban expansion varied with both epoch and city. Natural factors placed significant constraints at early stages of urban expansion, but this constraint relaxed over time. As precursor drivers of urbanization, socioeconomic factors significantly influenced urban growth in most epochs for each city. Non-urban lands near existing urban areas were more likely to be urbanized, due to easier access to existing transportation infrastructure and other facility resources. Furthermore, with urbanization, individual effects of drivers tended to be replaced by joint effects, especially for the neighboring factors. Similarities and differences in the individual and joint effects of drivers on urban expansion across cities and through time will provide valuable information for adaptive urban development strategies in the national capital region of China.","Randomised, phase 1, dose-finding study of MEDI4166, a PCSK9 antibody and GLP-1 analogue fusion molecule, in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593607,Diabetologia,2019 03 13,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes.

Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30 years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 °C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.",Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Considerations for Drugs Binding to Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593605,Pharmaceutical research,2019 02 02,"According to the free drug hypothesis only the unbound drug is available to act at physiological sites of action, and as such the importance of plasma protein binding primarily resides in its impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Of the major plasma proteins, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) represents an intriguing one primarily due to the high affinity, low capacity properties of this protein. In addition, there are marked species and age differences in protein expression, homology and drug binding affinity. As such, a thorough understanding of drug binding to AAG can help aid and improve the translation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from preclinical species to human as well as adults to neonates. This review provides a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the biochemistry of AAG; endogenous function, impact of disease, utility as a biomarker, and impact on PK/PD.

The stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) are critically important for carbon and nitrogen sequestration in dry alpine ecosystems of the AMNNR, which is a ""natural laboratory"" for assessing the carbon and nitrogen storage without human disturbance. We explored the stocks of SOC and TN in soils of different dry alpine ecosystems by sampling 23 sites across the AMNNR during 2013. The results showed that the SOC and TN stocks of AMNNR varied significantly with ecosystem types. The SOC stocks of 0-15 cm were highest in the alpine wet meadow (7.96 kg/m2), followed by alpine steppe (2.63 kg/m2). The stocks of SOC and TN in 0-5 and 5-10 cm soils of alpine wet meadow were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in the soils of other dry alpine ecosystems. In the whole AMNNR, total storage of SOC and TN were approximately 80.97 and 4.48 Tg, 34.25% of SOC and 24.01% of TN were stored in the alpine steppe, 21.51% of SOC and 26.01% of TN were stored in the alpine scrub, the largest ecosystem in the AMNNR.

FasL/Fas pathway is a key regulator of cell apoptosis. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of c-Myc on the FasL/Fas pathway in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury. Rats were objected to bilateral renal ischemia for 60 min and reperfused for 24 or 48 h. NRK-52E cells were treated with hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) or FasL. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the distribution of c-Myc. Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Ad-c-Myc and recombinant pcDAN 3.0 were used to overexpress c-Myc and c-FLIP, respectively. ChIP assay and luciferase assay were used to detect the binding of c-Myc to c-FLIP promoter. In I/R rats, c-Myc was increased significantly and mainly located in renal tubular epithelial cells; meanwhile, c-FLIP was decreased, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive staining cells were increased. Treatment of I/R rats with c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 significantly attenuated the decrease in c-FLIP, the increase in cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL-positive cells, Scr and BUN in I/R rats. In NRK-52E cells, hypoxia and reoxygen induced the increase in c-Myc and decrease in c-FLIP. ChIP and luciferase assay results indicated that c-Myc binds to the promoter region of c-FLIP gene. Overexpression of c-Myc markedly decreased c-FLIP. Overexpression of c-FLIP inhibited the increase in cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3 induced by FasL. Data indicated that c-Myc is increased in kidneys of I/R rats and negatively regulates the expression of c-FLIP, then enhanced FasL-induced cell apoptosis in I/R stress.","A prospective study of the incidence, associations and outcomes of ocular surface squamous neoplasia in the United Kingdom.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593587,"Eye (London, England)",2019 03 21,"To describe the incidence, associations and outcomes of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in the United Kingdom.",Massive Pulmonary Embolism as the Initial Presentation of Acromegaly: Is Acromegaly a Hypercoagulable Condition?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593586,The American journal of case reports,2019 03 26,"BACKGROUND The clinical presentation in acromegaly is usually insidious, with headaches or visual disturbances being the most common symptoms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS All data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. DESeq was run to test for differentially expressed KIF genes. Patients were divided into high- and low-expression groups according to the median expression values of each KIF genes. Survival data were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Comprehensive survival analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of the prognostic signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify associated gene ontology and KEGG pathways. RESULTS Bioinformatics analysis showed that all KIF genes were significantly enriched during DNA replication and the cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. Thirteen KIF genes were differentially expressed in cancer and adjacent tissues, and high levels of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A genes were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS). GSEA showed that BC patients with high expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were enriched in the cell cycle process, P53 regulation pathway and mismatch repair. Combinations of low expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were more highly correlated with favorable OS. Nomograms showed that the KIF4A risk score provided the maximum number of risk points (range 0-100), whereas other genes made a lower contribution. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that 13 KIF genes are differentially expressed in BC tumor tissues, and KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A are associated with prognostic factors in BC.",Research Competencies Assessment Instrument for Nurses: Preliminary Psychometric Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593584,Journal of nursing measurement,2018 12 29,"Clinician research competencies influence research use for evidence-based practice (EBP).

In leukemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable protein complex, AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC), that contains multiple transcription (co)factors. Among these AETFC components, HEB and E2A, two members of the ubiquitously expressed E proteins, directly interact with AML1-ETO, confer new DNA-binding capacity to AETFC, and are essential for leukemogenesis. However, the third E protein, E2-2, is specifically silenced in AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, suggesting E2-2 as a negative factor of leukemogenesis. Indeed, ectopic expression of E2-2 selectively inhibits the growth of AML1-ETO-expressing leukemic cells, and this inhibition requires the bHLH DNA-binding domain. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses reveal that, despite some overlap, the three E proteins differentially regulate many target genes. In particular, studies show that E2-2 both redistributes AETFC to, and activates, some genes associated with dendritic cell differentiation and represses MYC target genes. In AML patients, the expression of E2-2 is relatively lower in the t(8;21) subtype, and an E2-2 target gene, THPO, is identified as a potential predictor of relapse. In a mouse model of human t(8;21) leukemia, E2-2 suppression accelerates leukemogenesis. Taken together, these results reveal that, in contrast to HEB and E2A, which facilitate AML1-ETO-mediated leukemogenesis, E2-2 compromises the function of AETFC and negatively regulates leukemogenesis. The three E proteins thus define a heterogeneity of AETFC, which improves our understanding of the precise mechanism of leukemogenesis and assists development of diagnostic/therapeutic strategies.","Conotoxin κM-RIIIJ, a tool targeting asymmetric heteromeric Kv1 channels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593566,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 12,"The vast complexity of native heteromeric K+ channels is largely unexplored. Defining the composition and subunit arrangement of individual subunits in native heteromeric K+ channels and establishing their physiological roles is experimentally challenging. Here we systematically explored this ""zone of ignorance"" in molecular neuroscience. Venom components, such as peptide toxins, appear to have evolved to modulate physiologically relevant targets by discriminating among closely related native ion channel complexes. We provide proof-of-principle for this assertion by demonstrating that κM-conotoxin RIIIJ (κM-RIIIJ) from Conus radiatus precisely targets ""asymmetric"" Kv channels composed of three Kv1.2 subunits and one Kv1.1 or Kv1.6 subunit with 100-fold higher apparent affinity compared with homomeric Kv1.2 channels. Our study shows that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contain at least two major functional Kv1.2 channel complexes: a heteromer, for which κM-RIIIJ has high affinity, and a putative Kv1.2 homomer, toward which κM-RIIIJ is less potent. This conclusion was reached by (i) covalent linkage of members of the mammalian Shaker-related Kv1 family to Kv1.2 and systematic assessment of the potency of κM-RIIIJ block of heteromeric K+ channel-mediated currents in heterologous expression systems; (ii) molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric Kv1 channels providing insights into the molecular basis of κM-RIIIJ selectivity and potency toward its targets; and (iii) evaluation of calcium responses of a defined population of DRG neurons to κM-RIIIJ.

In microbial communities, like those found in soils or the mammalian gut, physical anisotropies produced by fluid flow and chemical gradients impact community structure and ecological dynamics, even in structurally isotropic environments. Although natural communities existing in physically unstructured environments are rare, the role of environmental structure in determining community dynamics and stability remains poorly studied. To address this gap, we used modified Lotka-Volterra simulations of competitive microbial communities to characterize the effects of surface structure on community dynamics. We find that environmental structure has profound effects on communities, in a manner dependent on the specific pattern of interactions between community members. For two mutually competing species, eventual extinction of one competitor is effectively guaranteed in isotropic environments. However, addition of environmental structure enables long-term coexistence of both species via local ""pinning"" of competition interfaces, even when one species has a significant competitive advantage. In contrast, while three species competing in an intransitive loop (as in a game of rock-paper-scissors) coexist stably in isotropic environments, structural anisotropy disrupts the spatial patterns on which coexistence depends, causing chaotic population fluctuations and subsequent extinction cascades. These results indicate that the stability of microbial communities strongly depends on the structural environment in which they reside. Therefore, a more complete ecological understanding, including effective manipulation and interventions in natural communities of interest, must account for the physical structure of the environment.",Linear variational principle for Riemann mappings and discrete conformality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593564,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 06,"We consider Riemann mappings from bounded Lipschitz domains in the plane to a triangle. We show that in this case the Riemann mapping has a linear variational principle: It is the minimizer of the Dirichlet energy over an appropriate affine space. By discretizing the variational principle in a natural way we obtain discrete conformal maps which can be computed by solving a sparse linear system. We show that these discrete conformal maps converge to the Riemann mapping in [Formula: see text], even for non-Delaunay triangulations. Additionally, for Delaunay triangulations the discrete conformal maps converge uniformly and are known to be bijective. As a consequence we show that the Riemann mapping between two bounded Lipschitz domains can be uniformly approximated by composing the discrete Riemann mappings between each Lipschitz domain and the triangle.",Dnase1l3 deletion causes aberrations in length and end-motif frequencies in plasma DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593563,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 08,"Circulating DNA in plasma consists of short DNA fragments. The biological processes generating such fragments are not well understood. DNASE1L3 is a secreted DNASE1-like nuclease capable of digesting DNA in chromatin, and its absence causes anti-DNA responses and autoimmunity in humans and mice. We found that the deletion of Dnase1l3 in mice resulted in aberrations in the fragmentation of plasma DNA. Such aberrations included an increase in short DNA molecules below 120 bp, which was positively correlated with anti-DNA antibody levels. We also observed an increase in long, multinucleosomal DNA molecules and decreased frequencies of the most common end motifs found in plasma DNA. These aberrations were independent of anti-DNA response, suggesting that they represented a primary effect of DNASE1L3 loss. Pregnant Dnase1l3

However, the observed shortening of circulating fetal DNA relative to maternal DNA was not affected by the deletion of Dnase1l3 Collectively, our findings demonstrate that DNASE1L3 plays a role in circulating plasma DNA homeostasis by enhancing fragmentation and influencing end-motif frequencies. These results support a distinct role of DNASE1L3 as a regulator of the physical form and availability of cell-free DNA and may have important implications for the mechanism whereby this enzyme prevents autoimmunity.",Data-driven quantitative modeling of bacterial active nematics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593562,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 13,"Active matter comprises individual units that convert energy into mechanical motion. In many examples, such as bacterial systems and biofilament assays, constituent units are elongated and can give rise to local nematic orientational order. Such ""active nematics"" systems have attracted much attention from both theorists and experimentalists. However, despite intense research efforts, data-driven quantitative modeling has not been achieved, a situation mainly due to the lack of systematic experimental data and to the large number of parameters of current models. Here, we introduce an active nematics system made of swarming filamentous bacteria. We simultaneously measure orientation and velocity fields and show that the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be quantitatively reproduced by a type of microscopic model for active suspensions whose important parameters are all estimated from comprehensive experimental data. This provides unprecedented access to key effective parameters and mechanisms governing active nematics. Our approach is applicable to different types of dense suspensions and shows a path toward more quantitative active matter research.",Constitutive Dicer1 phosphorylation accelerates metabolism and aging in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593561,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 15,"DICER1 gene alterations and decreased expression are associated with developmental disorders and diseases in humans. Oscillation of Dicer1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates its function during the oocyte-to-embryo transition in Caenorhabditis elegans Dicer1 is also phosphorylated upon FGF stimulation at conserved serines in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HEK293 cells. However, whether phosphorylation of Dicer1 has a role in mammalian development remains unknown. To investigate the consequence of constitutive phosphorylation, we generated phosphomimetic knock-in mouse models by replacing conserved serines 1712 and 1836 with aspartic acids individually or together.

 mice display highly penetrant postnatal lethality, and the few survivors display accelerated aging and infertility. Homozygous dual-phosphomimetic Dicer1 augments these defects, alters metabolism-associated miRNAs, and causes a hypermetabolic phenotype. Thus, constitutive phosphorylation of Dicer1 results in multiple pathologic processes in mice, indicating that phosphorylation tightly regulates Dicer1 function and activity in mammals."

Some pharmacokinetic parameters, such as clearance and volume of distribution, can be scaled allometrically from rodents, mammals, and nonhuman primates with good success. However, it is far more challenging to predict the oral pharmacokinetics of experimental drug candidates. In the present study, we used in situ estimates of intestinal permeability, obtained in silico and from rat, wild-type (WT), and humanized PepT1 (huPepT1) mice, to predict the systemic exposure of cefadroxil, an orally administered model compound, under a variety of conditions. Using the GastroPlus simulation software program (Simulations Plus, Lancaster, CA), we found that the Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration of cefadroxil were better predicted using intestinal permeability estimates (both segmental and jejunal) from huPepT1 than from WT mice, and that intestinal permeabilities based on in silico and rat estimates gave worse predictions. We also observed that accurate predictions were possible for cefadroxil during oral dose escalation (i.e., 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg cefadroxil), a drug-drug interaction study (i.e., 5 mg/kg oral cefadroxil plus 45 mg/kg oral cephalexin), and an oral multiple dose study [i.e., 500 mg (6.7 mg/kg) cefadroxil every 6 hours]. Finally, the greatest amount of cefadroxil was absorbed in duodenal and jejunal segments of the small intestine after a 5 mg/kg oral dose. Thus, by combining a humanized mouse model and in silico software, the present study offers a novel strategy for better translating preclinical pharmacokinetic data to oral drug exposure during first-in-human studies.",Hepatic Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide-Mediated Clearance in the Beagle Dog: Assessing In Vitro-In Vivo Relationships and Applying Cross-Species Empirical Scaling Factors to Improve Prediction of Human Clearance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593544,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 28,"In the present study, the beagle dog was evaluated as a preclinical model to investigate organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)-mediated hepatic clearance. In vitro studies were performed with nine OATP substrates in three lots of plated male dog hepatocytes ± OATP inhibitor cocktail to determine total uptake clearance (CLuptake) and total and unbound cell-to-medium concentration ratio (Kpuu). In vivo intrinsic hepatic clearances (CLint,H) were determined following intravenous drug administration (0.1 mg/kg) in male beagle dogs. The in vitro parameters were compared with those previously reported in plated human, monkey, and rat hepatocytes; the ability of cross-species scaling factors to improve prediction of human in vivo clearance was assessed. CLuptake in dog hepatocytes ranged from 9.4 to 135 µl/min/106 cells for fexofenadine and telmisartan, respectively. Active process contributed >75% to CLuptake for 5/9 drugs. Rosuvastatin and valsartan showed Kpuu > 10, whereas cerivastatin, pitavastatin, repaglinide, and telmisartan had Kpuu < 5. The extent of hepatocellular binding in dog was consistent with other preclinical species and humans. The bias (2.73-fold) obtained from comparison of predicted versus in vivo dog CLint,H was applied as an average empirical scaling factor (ESFav) for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation of human CLint,H The ESFav based on dog reduced underprediction of human CLint,H for the same data set (geometric mean fold error = 2.1), highlighting its utility as a preclinical model to investigate OATP-mediated uptake. The ESFav from all preclinical species resulted in comparable improvement of human clearance prediction, in contrast to drug-specific empirical scalars, rationalized by species differences in expression and/or relative contribution of particular transporters to drug hepatic uptake.",Regulation of Hepatic Long Noncoding RNAs by Pregnane X Receptor and Constitutive Androstane Receptor Agonists in Mouse Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593543,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 28,"Altered expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by environmental chemicals modulates the expression of xenobiotic biotransformation-related genes and may serve as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers of exposure. The pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2) is a critical xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of many drug-processing genes, and it has similar target-gene profiles and DNA-binding motifs with another xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor, namely, constitutive andronstrane receptor (CAR/Nr1i3). To test our hypothesis that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR in concert with protein-coding genes (PCGs) and to compare the PXR-targeted lncRNAs with CAR-targeted lncRNAs, RNA-Seq was performed from livers of adult male C57BL/6 mice treated with corn oil, the PXR agonist PCN, or the CAR agonist 1, 4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP). Among 125,680 known lncRNAs, 3843 were expressed in liver, and 193 were differentially regulated by PXR (among which 40% were also regulated by CAR). Most PXR- or CAR-regulated lncRNAs were mapped to the introns and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of PCGs, as well as intergenic regions. Combining the RNA-Seq data with a published PXR chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing; cytochrome P450 (P450; ChIP-Seq) data set, we identified 774 expressed lncRNAs with direct PXR-DNA binding sites, and 26.8% of differentially expressed lncRNAs had changes in PXR-DNA binding after PCN exposure. De novo motif analysis identified colocalization of PXR with liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), which regulates bile acid synthesis after PCN exposure. There was limited overlap of PXR binding with an epigenetic mark for transcriptional activation (histone-H3K4-di-methylation, H3K4me2) but no overlap with epigenetic marks for transcriptional silencing [H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation]. Among differentially expressed lncRNAs, 264 were in proximity of PCGs, and the lncRNA-PCG pairs displayed a high coregulatory pattern by PXR and CAR activation. This study was among the first to demonstrate that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR and CAR activation and that they may be important regulators of PCGs involved in xenobiotic metabolism.",Serum heart-type fatty acid-binding protein decreases and soluble isoform of suppression of tumorigenicity 2 increases significantly by long-term physical activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593542,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 05 25,"The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the influence of long-term physical activity on biomarkers for myocyte ischemia (heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, H-FABP), matrix remodelling/vascular stress (soluble isoform of suppression of tumorigenicity 2, sST2) and inflammation (soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, suPAR). In this prospective observational study 109 subjects were recruited, 98 completed the study. Subjects were asked to perform exercise within the calculated training pulse for 8 months. The performance gain was measured/quantified by bicycle stress tests at the beginning and end of the observation period. Twenty-seven subjects with a performance gain <2.9% were excluded. suPAR, H-FABP and sST2 were measured in serum at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 months by ELISA. We found a significant decrease in H-FABP (1.86 (0.86) to 1.29 (0.98) ng/mL; p<0.01) and a significant increase in sST2 levels (6126 (2759) to 6919 (3720) pg/mL; p=0.045) during the observation period of 8 months while there was no remarkable change in suPAR levels. We interpret the activity-induced decrease in H-FABP as sign of lower subclinical myocardial ischemia and better perfusion, probably due to a more economic metabolization and electrolyte balance. The increase in sST2 might reflect physiological sports-induced vascular stress. As H-FABP and sST2 play an important role in the pathomechanism of ischemic cardiomyopathy (iCMP) further studies should investigate the influence of regular physical activity on these biomarkers in a population of patients with iCMP.

Epidemiological data reveal both the reduction and the impairment of M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells, although the cellular link and actual mechanisms resulting in immune impairment/suppression need further characterization. M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells play a central role in development of protective immunity against TB, in which they participate in the activation of macrophages through the dendritic cell (DC)-T cell axis. Using an in vitro priming system for generating Ag-specific T cells, we explored if HIV-M. tuberculosis-infected (coinfected) human DCs can dysregulate the M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cell phenotype and functionality and subsequently mediate the failure to control M. tuberculosis infection in macrophages. After coculture with coinfected DCs, M. tuberculosis Ag-specific CD4 T cells lost their ability to enhance control of M. tuberculosis infection in infected macrophages. Coinfection of DCs reduced proliferation of M. tuberculosis Ag-specific CD4 T cells without affecting their viability, led to increased expression of coinhibitory factors CTLA-4, PD-1, and Blimp-1, and decreased expression of costimulatory molecules CD40L, CD28, and ICOS on the T cells. Expression of the regulatory T cell markers FOXP3 and CD25, together with the immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-β and IL-10, was also significantly increased by coinfection compared with M. tuberculosis single infection. Our data suggest a pattern in which HIV, through its effect on DCs, impairs the ability of M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells to maintain a latent TB within human macrophages, which could play an early role in the subsequent development of TB."

However, still lacking are better statistical models for ordinal phenotypes to improve the accuracy of the selection of candidate genotypes. For this reason, in this paper we explore the genomic based prediction performance of two popular machine learning methods: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) methods vs. the Bayesian threshold genomic best linear unbiased prediction (TGBLUP) model. We used the percentage of cases correctly classified (PCCC) as a metric to measure the prediction performance, and seven real data sets to evaluate the prediction accuracy, and found that the best predictions (in four out of the seven data sets) in terms of PCCC occurred under the TGLBUP model, while the worst occurred under the SVM method. Also, in general we found no statistical differences between using 1, 2 and 3 layers under the MLP models, which means that many times the conventional neuronal network model with only one layer is enough. However, although even that the TGBLUP model was better, we found that the predictions of MLP and SVM were very competitive with the advantage that the SVM was the most efficient in terms of the computational time required.",Post-transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme assimilation system (Has) fine-tunes extracellular heme sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593511,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that utilizes heme as a primary iron source within the host. Extracellular heme is sensed via a heme assimilation system (has) that encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor system. Herein, using has deletion mutants, quantitative PCR analyses, and immunoblotting, we show that the activation of the σ factor HasI requires heme release from the hemophore HasAp to the outer-membrane receptor HasR. Using RT-PCR and 5'-RACE, we observed that following transcriptional activation of the co-transcribed hasRAp, it is further processed into specific mRNAs varying in stability. We noted that the processing and variation in stability of the hasAp and hasR mRNAs in response to heme provide a mechanism for differential expression from co-transcribed genes. The multiple layers of post-transcriptional regulation of the ECF signaling cascade, including the previously reported post-transcriptional regulation of HasAp by the heme metabolites biliverdin IXβ and IXδ, allow fine-tuning of the cell-surface signaling system in response to extracellular heme levels. We hypothesize that the complex post-transcriptional regulation of the Has system provides P. aeruginosa an advantage in colonizing a variety of physiological niches in the host.",Zebrafish microRNA miR-210-5p inhibits primitive myelopoiesis by silencing foxj1b and slc3a2a mRNAs downstream of gata4/5/6 transcription factor genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593510,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Zebrafish gata4/5/6 genes encode transcription factors that lie on the apex of the regulatory hierarchy in primitive myelopoiesis. However, little is known about the roles of microRNAs in gata4/5/6-regulated processes. Performing RNA-Seq deep sequencing analysis of the expression changes of microRNAs in gata4/5/6-knockdown embryos, we identified miR-210-5p as a regulator of zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis. Knocking down gata4/5/6 (generating gata5/6 morphants) significantly increased miR-210-5p expression, whereas gata4/5/6 overexpression greatly reduced its expression. Consistent with inhibited primitive myelopoiesis in the gata5/6 morphants, miR-210-5p overexpression repressed primitive myelopoiesis, indicated by reduced numbers of granulocytes and macrophages. Moreover, knocking out miR-210 partially rescued the defective primitive myelopoiesis in zebrafish gata4/5/6-knockdown embryos. Furthermore, we show that the restrictive role of miR-210-5p in zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis is due to impaired differentiation of hemangioblast into myeloid progenitor cells. By comparing the set of genes with reduced expression levels in the gata5/6 morphants to the predicted target genes of miR-210-5p, we found that foxj1b and slc3a2a, encoding a forkhead box transcription factor and a solute carrier family 3 protein, respectively, are two direct downstream targets of miR-210-5p that mediate its inhibitory roles in zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis. In summary, our results reveal that miR-210-5p has an important role in the genetic network controlling zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis.",The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin is an NAD+ and NADP+ glycohydrolase with distinct enzymatic properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593509,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 06,"Upon host infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes the tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) into the cytosol of infected macrophages, leading to host cell death by necroptosis. TNT hydrolyzes NAD+ in the absence of any exogenous cofactor, thus classifying it as a β-NAD+ glycohydrolase. However, TNT lacks sequence similarity with other NAD+ hydrolyzing enzymes and lacks the essential motifs involved in NAD+ binding and hydrolysis by these enzymes. In this study, we used NMR to examine the enzymatic activity of TNT and found that TNT hydrolyzes NADP+ as fast as NAD+ but does not cleave the corresponding reduced dinucleotides. This activity of TNT was not inhibited by ADP-ribose or nicotinamide, indicating low affinity of TNT for these reaction products. A selection assay for nontoxic TNT variants in Escherichia coli identified four of six residues in the predicted NAD+-binding pocket and four glycine residues that form a cradle directly below the NAD+-binding site, a conserved feature in the TNT protein family. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues near the predicted NAD+-binding site revealed that Phe727, Arg757, and Arg780 are essential for NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT. These results identify the NAD+-binding site of TNT. Our findings also show that TNT is an NAD+ glycohydrolase with properties distinct from those of other bacterial glycohydrolases. Because many of these residues are conserved within the TNT family, our findings provide insights into understanding the function of the >300 TNT homologs.",A dynamic and screening-compatible nanoluciferase-based complementation assay enables profiling of individual GPCR-G protein interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593506,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 30,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are currently the target of more than 30% of the marketed medicines. However, there is an important medical need for ligands with improved pharmacological activities on validated drug targets. Moreover, most of these ligands remain poorly characterized, notably because of a lack of pharmacological tools. Thus, there is an important demand for innovative assays that can detect and drive the design of compounds with novel or improved pharmacological properties. In particular, a functional and screening-compatible GPCR-G protein interaction assay is still unavailable. Here, we report on a nanoluciferase-based complementation technique to detect ligands that promote a GPCR-G protein interaction. We demonstrate that our system can be used to profile compounds with regard to the G proteins they activate through a given GPCR. Furthermore, we established a proof of applicability of screening for distinct G proteins on dopamine receptor D2 whose differential coupling to Gαi/o family members has been extensively studied. In a D2-Gαi1versus D2-Gαo screening, we retrieved five agonists that are currently being used in antiparkinsonian medications. We determined that in this assay, piribedil and pergolide are full agonists for the recruitment of Gαi1 but are partial agonists for Gαo, that the agonist activity of ropinirole is biased in favor of Gαi1 recruitment, and that the agonist activity of apomorphine is biased for Gαo We propose that this newly developed assay could be used to develop molecules that selectively modulate a particular G protein pathway.",An internal ribosome entry site in the coding region of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 drives alternative translation start.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593505,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in a myriad of cellular pathways. Although most well-known for its phosphodiesterase activity removing stalled topoisomerase 2 from DNA, TDP2 has also been shown to interact with both survival and apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Moreover, it facilitates enterovirus replication and has been genetically linked to neurological disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease to dyslexia. To accurately evaluate TDP2 as a therapeutic target, we need to understand how TDP2 performs such a wide diversity of functions. Here, we use cancer cell lines modified with CRISPR/Cas9 or stably-expressed TDP2-targeted shRNA and transfection of various TDP2 mutants to show that its expression is regulated at the translational level via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that initiates translation at codon 54, the second in-frame methionine of the TDP2 coding sequence. We observed that this IRES drives expression of a shorter, N-terminally truncated isoform of TDP2, ΔN-TDP2, which omits a nuclear localization sequence. Additionally, we noted that ΔN-TDP2 retains phosphodiesterase activity and is protective against etoposide-induced cell death, but co-immunoprecipitates with fewer high-molecular-weight ubiquitinated peptide species, suggesting partial loss-of-function of TDP2's ubiquitin-association domain. In summary, our findings suggest the existence of an IRES in the 5' coding sequence of TDP2 that translationally regulates expression of an N-terminally truncated, cytoplasmic isoform of TDP2. These results shed light on the regulation of this multifunctional protein and may inform the design of therapies targeting TDP2 and associated pathways."

Although a variety of writers, readers, and erasers of epigenetic features are known, we have little information about the underlying regulatory systems controlling the establishment and maintenance of these features. Here, we have explored how natural genetic variation affects the epigenome in mice. Studying levels of H3K4me3, a histone modification at sites such as promoters, enhancers, and recombination hotspots, we found tissue-specific trans-regulation of H3K4me3 levels in four highly diverse cell types: male germ cells, embryonic stem cells, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes. To identify the genetic loci involved, we measured H3K4me3 levels in male germ cells in a mapping population of 59 BXD recombinant inbred lines. We found extensive trans-regulation of H3K4me3 peaks, including six major histone quantitative trait loci (QTL). These chromatin regulatory loci act dominantly to suppress H3K4me3, which at hotspots reduces the likelihood of subsequent DNA double-strand breaks. QTL locations do not correspond with genes encoding enzymes known to metabolize chromatin features. Instead their locations match clusters of zinc finger genes, making these possible candidates that explain the dominant suppression of H3K4me3. Collectively, these data describe an extensive, set of chromatin regulatory loci that control the epigenetic landscape.",Cell Specificity of Human Regulatory Annotations and Their Genetic Effects on Gene Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593493,Genetics,2019 04 21,"Epigenomic signatures from histone marks and transcription factor (TF)-binding sites have been used to annotate putative gene regulatory regions. However, a direct comparison of these diverse annotations is missing, and it is unclear how genetic variation within these annotations affects gene expression. Here, we compare five widely used annotations of active regulatory elements that represent high densities of one or more relevant epigenomic marks-""super"" and ""typical"" (nonsuper) enhancers, stretch enhancers, high-occupancy target (HOT) regions, and broad domains-across the four matched human cell types for which they are available. We observe that stretch and super enhancers cover cell type-specific enhancer ""chromatin states,"" whereas HOT regions and broad domains comprise more ubiquitous promoter states. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in stretch enhancers have significantly smaller effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. Strikingly, chromatin accessibility QTL in stretch enhancers have significantly larger effect sizes compared to those in HOT regions. These observations suggest that stretch enhancers could harbor genetically primed chromatin to enable changes in TF binding, possibly to drive cell type-specific responses to environmental stimuli. Our results suggest that current eQTL studies are relatively underpowered or could lack the appropriate environmental context to detect genetic effects in the most cell type-specific ""regulatory annotations,"" which likely contributes to infrequent colocalization of eQTL with genome-wide association study signals.",A Context-Dependent Role for the RNF146 Ubiquitin Ligase in Wingless/Wnt Signaling in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593492,Genetics,2019 06 06,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt signal transduction pathway triggers the development of colorectal cancer. The ADP-ribose polymerase Tankyrase (TNKS) mediates proteolysis of Axin-a negative regulator of Wnt signaling-and provides a promising therapeutic target for Wnt-driven diseases. Proteolysis of TNKS substrates is mediated through their ubiquitination by the poly-ADP-ribose (pADPr)-dependent RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146/Iduna. Like TNKS, RNF146 promotes Axin proteolysis and Wnt pathway activation in some cultured cell lines, but in contrast with TNKS, RNF146 is dispensable for Axin degradation in colorectal carcinoma cells. Thus, the contexts in which RNF146 is essential for TNKS-mediated Axin destabilization and Wnt signaling remain uncertain. Herein, we tested the requirement for RNF146 in TNKS-mediated Axin proteolysis and Wnt pathway activation in a range of in vivo settings. Using null mutants in Drosophila, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Rnf146 and Tnks function in the same proteolysis pathway in vivo Furthermore, like Tnks, Drosophila Rnf146 promotes Wingless signaling in multiple developmental contexts by buffering Axin levels to ensure they remain below the threshold at which Wingless signaling is inhibited. However, in contrast with Tnks, Rnf146 is dispensable for Wingless target gene activation and the Wingless-dependent control of intestinal stem cell proliferation in the adult midgut during homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that the requirement for Rnf146 in Tnks-mediated Axin proteolysis and Wingless pathway activation is dependent on physiological context, and suggest that, in some cell types, functionally redundant pADPr-dependent E3 ligases or other compensatory mechanisms promote the Tnks-dependent proteolysis of Axin in both mammalian and Drosophila cells.",Two Antagonistic Hippo Signaling Circuits Set the Division Plane at the Medial Position in the Ciliate Tetrahymena.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593491,Genetics,2019 03 28,"In a single cell, ciliates maintain a complex pattern of cortical organelles that are arranged along the anteroposterior and circumferential axes. The underlying molecular mechanisms of intracellular pattern formation in ciliates are largely unknown. Ciliates divide by tandem duplication, a process that remodels the parental cell into two daughters aligned head-to-tail. In the elo1-1 mutant of Tetrahymena thermophila, the segmentation boundary/division plane forms too close to the posterior end of the parental cell, producing a large anterior and a small posterior daughter cell, respectively. We show that ELO1 encodes a Lats/NDR kinase that marks the posterior segment of the cell cortex, where the division plane does not form in the wild-type. Elo1 acts independently of CdaI, a Hippo/Mst kinase that marks the anterior half of the parental cell, and whose loss shifts the division plane anteriorly. We propose that, in Tetrahymena, two antagonistic Hippo circuits focus the segmentation boundary/division plane at the equatorial position, by excluding divisional morphogenesis from the cortical areas that are too close to cell ends.",Integration of Growth and Cell Size via the TOR Pathway and the Dot6 Transcription Factor in Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593490,Genetics,2019 03 28,"In most species, size homeostasis appears to be exerted in late G1 phase as cells commit to division, called Start in yeast and the Restriction Point in metazoans. This size threshold couples cell growth to division, and, thereby, establishes long-term size homeostasis. Our former investigations have shown that hundreds of genes markedly altered cell size under homeostatic growth conditions in the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans, but surprisingly only few of these overlapped with size control genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Here, we investigated one of the divergent potent size regulators in C. albicans, the Myb-like HTH transcription factor Dot6. Our data demonstrated that Dot6 is a negative regulator of Start, and also acts as a transcriptional activator of ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) genes. Genetic epistasis uncovered that Dot6 interacted with the master transcriptional regulator of the G1 machinery, SBF complex, but not with the Ribi and cell size regulators Sch9, Sfp1, and p38/Hog1. Dot6 was required for carbon-source modulation of cell size, and it is regulated at the level of nuclear localization by the TOR pathway. Our findings support a model where Dot6 acts as a hub that integrates growth cues directly via the TOR pathway to control the commitment to mitotic division at G1.",Demystifying the Benefits and Harms of Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation in Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593489,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2019 02 24,"Patients with CKD represent a vulnerable population where the risks of atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke, and bleeding are all heightened.

Without randomized, controlled trial data, the role of anticoagulation in patients with CKD with atrial fibrillation remains unclear and our practice is informed by a growing body of imperfect literature such as observational and pharmacokinetic studies. This article aims to present a contemporary literature review of the benefits versus harms of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation for patients with CKD stages 3, 4, 5, and 5 on dialysis.

One form of facilitation, physician-assisted suicide, has been extensively debated in the existing literature. In this article, we set out to explore the legal and forensic ramifications of non-physician-assisted suicide, which we refer to as facilitated suicide. We first conducted a review of all fifty states' legislation regarding facilitated suicide: forty-four states prohibit it by statute, and three states prohibit it through common law. Thirteen states specifically outlaw verbal facilitation of suicide. We then surveyed the case law to identify legal precedent to the Commonwealth v. Carter verdict. Final Exit Network, Inc. v.

In 1846, New York State tried William Freeman for slaying several members of the Van Nest family at their home near Auburn, New York. Mr. Freeman had been obsessed with false imprisonment for horse theft. His defense attorney, former governor William Seward, sought an insanity verdict, citing reaction to racist maltreatment as the cause. Though Mr. Freeman was impaired, a jury found him competent to stand trial. The competency adjudication created confusion in the trial court about the admissibility of medical testimony on criminal responsibility, resulting in exclusion of key psychiatric findings. Meanwhile, the interracial killings caused a sensation in the press, which vilified the defendant. Again, the defense argued that maltreatment created mental illness. A second jury convicted Mr. Freeman and the judge sentenced him to death. Seward filed a Writ of Error, and the New York State Supreme Court reversed the conviction, clarifying competency versus criminal responsibility and proclaiming the M'Naghten Rule as the standard in New York. A century later, attorneys cited Mr. Freeman's dynamics to explain and mitigate the violent actions of some African-Americans.

Over the years, many medical licensure boards have asked physician medical licensure applicants with Doctor of Medicine (MD) degrees intrusive questions about whether they have any psychiatric history. This has discouraged many who need psychiatric treatment from seeking it because of fear of the questions. Gradually, court decisions and the United States Department of Justice have established that such questions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The 2014 Louisiana Supreme Court Settlement Agreement set definite limits on law licensure mental health questions, followed by a least one licensing body revising its physician licensure questions to be consistent with ADA standards. In this article we examine the current medical licensure questions from each state and the District of Columbia about the mental health of applicants and discuss their validity under ADA standards. Our original investigation of these questions found that the majority still ask questions that are unlikely to meet ADA standards. The judicial and Department of Justice developments, however, may compel them to abandon these questions. If not, legal action will enforce ADA compliance.

Building on systemic approaches by Gutheil et al. and Ciccone and Clements, Candilis and Martinez, for example, have argued that a robust professional ethic requires moving beyond the strict role theory of the adversarial system to consider broader approaches that integrate multiple perspectives: the ultimate goal is protection of vulnerable people and ideas. In this commentary, we suggest that the current system for involuntary treatment does not protect the vulnerable people it ought to serve, failing the neglected goal of social justice."

Although researchers in surveillance studies have shown considerable reductions in VKDB following intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis, ongoing barriers to the universal uptake of vitamin K prophylaxis remain. Reviewing the history of newborn vitamin K provides an opportunity for a greater understanding of the current barriers to uptake that we face. Although at times difficult, improving this understanding may allow us to address contentious issues related to parental and health professional beliefs and values as well as improve overall communication.

Previous studies have recorded high accumulation of soluble sugars and starch within these tumors. Using interdisciplinary approaches, we found that the sugar accumulation within tumors coincided with the differential expression of plant sugars will eventually be exported transporters and the proton/sucrose symporter Sucrose Transporter1 To accumulate plant sugars, the fungus deploys its own set of sugar transporters, generating a sugar gradient within the fungal cytosol, recorded by expressing a cytosolic glucose (Glc) Förster resonance energy transfer sensor.

Growing infected plants under dark conditions led to decreased plant sugar levels and loss of the fungal tip Glc gradient, supporting a tight link between fungal sugar acquisition and host supplies. Finally, the fungal infection causes a strong imbalance in plant sugar distribution, ultimately impacting seed set and yield.",In-hospital Neonatal Falls: An Unintended Consequence of Efforts to Improve Breastfeeding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593451,Pediatrics,2019 01 02,"In-hospital neonatal falls are increasingly recognized as a postpartum safety risk, with maternal fatigue contributing to these events. Recommendations to support rooming-in may increase success with breastfeeding; however, this practice may also be associated with maternal fatigue. We report a cluster of in-hospital neonatal falls associated with a hospital program to improve breastfeeding, which included rooming-in practices. Metrics related to breastfeeding were prospectively collected by chart audit or patient survey while ongoing efforts to improve breastfeeding occurred (September 2015-August 2017). Falls were identified through the hospital adverse event reporting system from January 2011 to February 2018. Medical records were reviewed to determine factors associated with the falls, including time of event, pain medication administration, hours of life at fall, method of delivery, or other notable factors that may have contributed to the fall event. Three fall events occurred within 1 year of commencing improvement efforts as process and outcome metrics associated with breastfeeding improved. All events were associated with mothers falling asleep while feeding their infant, and all occurred between midnight and 6 am Falls occurred from 38.0 to 75.7 hours after birth. No sedating pain medications were administered within 4 hours of any event. In 2 of 3 cases, mothers experienced notable ongoing social stressors. Rooming-in was the most significant change involved in our health care delivery during the programmatic effort to improve breastfeeding. Monitoring for in-hospital neonatal falls may be needed during projects aimed at improving breastfeeding, particularly if rooming-in practices are involved.",Developmental Outcomes in Duarte Galactosemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593450,Pediatrics,2019 01 02,": media-1vid110.1542/5849572227001PEDS-VA_2018-2516Video Abstract OBJECTIVES: For decades, infants with Duarte galactosemia (DG) have been identified by newborn screening (NBS), but whether they should be treated with dietary restrictions of galactose has remained unknown.

However, the molecular mechanism underlining this function remains obscure. Endoglin (Eng), a type III receptor for the TGF-β superfamily, has been shown to selectively mark long-term HSCs; however, its necessity in adult HSCs is unknown due to embryonic lethality. Using conditional deletion of Eng combined with serial transplantation, we show that this TGF-β receptor is critical to maintain the HSC pool. Transplantation of Eng-deleted whole bone marrow or purified HSCs into lethally irradiated mice results in a profound engraftment defect in tertiary and quaternary recipients. Cell cycle analysis of primary grafts revealed decreased frequency of HSCs in G0, suggesting that lack of Eng impairs reentry of HSCs to quiescence. Using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) to evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in individual HSCs, we find that Eng is required within the Lin-Sca+Kit+-CD48- CD150+ fraction for canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling, as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and the p38 MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, respectively. These findings support an essential role for Eng in positively modulating TGF-β signaling to ensure maintenance of HSC quiescence.",The association between seatbelt use and trauma outcomes: Does body mass index matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593443,The American journal of emergency medicine,2018 12 29,National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that seat belt use results in a significant decrease in MVC mortality.

Postpartum OCD can occur alone or in combination with other psychiatric disorders such as mood and anxiety disorders. Putative etiological mechanisms involve consideration of genetic factors, alterations in the serotonin system secondary to changes in levels of gonadal hormones, rise in oxytocin, hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis hyperactivity, and neuroinflammation. Sleep deprivation arising from a host of diverse factors is common after delivery in women with postpartum OCD. The author suggests that sleep deprivation may play a critical role in the etiology of postpartum OCD.

Further, it is known that there is a high frequency of co-occurrence of DTC and breast cancer. Although the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these phenomena are not entirely clear, 2 hypotheses are proposed here. First, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the placenta may be involved, since hCG has a similar function to stimulate the thyroid as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the latter of which is known to play a role in causing DTC and may promote breast cancer through the secretion of thyroid hormones (THs). Second, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is stimulated by suckling in the puerperal period, induces the secretion of not only TSH and thus indirectly THs, but also prolactin (PRL), which can accelerate the development of breast cancer. These hypotheses also explain the pregnancy-associated transient increase in breast cancer risk, while inhibition of estrogen by PRL may have a long-term preventive effect on breast cancer. Pregnancy-associated hyperthyroidism may also account for female preponderance of thyroid disease in general as well as tumors in organs that the thyroid hormone targets such as cardiac myxoma and diffuse-type gastric carcinoma.","Nodular rheumatoid arthritis (RA): A distinct disease subtype, initiated by cadmium inhalation inducing pulmonary nodule formation and subsequent RA-associated autoantibody generation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593421,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Nodular rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have raised rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) levels, and are more likely to smoke than RA patients without nodules. Subcutaneous and pulmonary rheumatoid nodules (granulomas) frequently co-exist. Pulmonary rheumatoid nodules develop prior to RA development and have the immunological machinery to generate RF and ACPAs. Pulmonary granulomas have been observed in animal models exposed to cadmium (Cd) inhalation. Cigarette smoke increases pulmonary Cd exposure. It has been suggested that dust and cigarette smoke co-exposure increases localised pulmonary Cd adsorption. We hypothesise that subcutaneous nodular RA represents a distinct disease subtype induced by pulmonary rheumatoid nodule formation and the generation of high levels of RA associated autoantibodies initiated by Cd inhalation via cigarette smoke. Cohorts of RA patients attending rheumatology clinics in Cornwall, UK (total n = 504) were studied to determine the prevalence of nodular RA, with matched analysis (age, gender and social class) to compare urinary Cd, RF and ACPA levels stratifying for nodular disease and smoking. In cohort 1 45/303 (14.9%) of the RA patients under regular follow up had nodular disease. Of the RA smokers, 30/155 (19%) were nodular and of the RA non-smokers 15/148 (10%) were nodular. Smoking was significantly associated with nodular RA, odds ratio (OR) = 2.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-4.88, p = 0.008. Raised urinary Cd levels were significantly associated with nodular RA in non-dust exposed individuals, OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.08-4.73), p = 0.03 compared to dust exposed individuals, OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.35-1.76), p = 0.557, despite fewer pack years (py) at diagnosis (16 vs 20 py).

Until recently, the predominant research thrust to uncover the cause of this condition has been the search for a major nuclear mutation. Although a small percentage of cases do demonstrate such a DNA fault, recent effort has come to emphasize problems in the biochemistry of its sufferers. In particular, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF) has become the center of concern in many laboratories. A deficiency in this growth factor, leading to insufficient neuron myelination and defective synapse function, appears to result in brain dysconnectivity during the first year of postpartum life, and cause social malfunction in childhood years and beyond. At least three approaches have been reported by which this deficiency can be corrected in neonates before irreversible damage has been caused. The overall purpose of this report is to bring together related observations and to evolve a coherent, plausible explanation of the cause and prevention of autism.",Reverse phenotype transfer via fecal microbial transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593419,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a disbalance in the composition of intestinal microbiota. It is not clear whether such dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of a disease state. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor to a patient or diseased animal is a valuable tool for targeted modification of microbiome leading to therapeutic response. Positive effect has been shown in therapy of a number of gastrointestinal as well as non-gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, FMT has been successfully used to transfer the diseased phenotype form a donor with the disease to a healthy recipient. However, targeted modification of the microbiome before the onset of colitis has not been shown previously. Based on our preliminary results, we propose the hypothesis of so called reverse phenotype transfer in IBD. This term describes the phenomenon, in which the transplantation of gut microbiota from a donor more sensitive to IBD to a healthy recipient leads to resistance of the recipient to IBD and vice versa. Mice that received FMT from donors with severe colitis have shown improved colitis score compared with mice that received FMT from donors more resistant to development of colitis. Such reverse phenotype transfer has broad implications, especially in terms of preventive medicine. However, detailed mechanisms need to be elucidated to conclude the validity of the phenomenon.",The Sudden Infant Death Syndrome mechanism of death may be a non-septic hyper-dynamic shock.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593418,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) mechanisms of death remains obscured.

Prone sleeping is a major risk factor but provide no clues regarding the mechanism of death. The leading assumed mechanisms of death are either an acute respiratory crisis or arrhythmias but neither one is supported with evidence, hence both are eventually speculations. Postmortem findings do exist but are inconclusive to identify the mechanism of death. WHAT DOES THE PROPOSED HYPOTHESIS BASED ON?: 1. The stressors (suggested by the triple risk model) share a unified compensatory physiological response of decrease in systemic vascular resistant (SVR) to facilitate a compensatory increase in cardiac output (CO). 2. The cardiovascular/cardiorespiratory control of the vulnerable infant during a critical developmental period may be impaired. 3. A severe decrease in SVR is associated with hyper-dynamic state, high output failure and distributive shock.",β-PVDF based electrospun nanofibers - A promising material for developing cardiac patches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593417,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Necrosis in heart muscles can permanently hinder the natural healthy rhythm of heart pumping mechanism. The damaged muscular tissues are replaced by scar tissues and burdens the healthy muscles resulting in further attenuated functioning of heart. Since, human heart muscles cannot regenerate naturally or it has been thought so, pharmacological procedures such as using a heart assist device are followed to restore the lost function of heart. Stem cell engineering and cardiac patches offers promising prospects with their cutting edge research reports. Cardiac patches offers a viable solution as they can also function as an implant to assist in offering the mechanical support the damaged muscles were capable of. Designing cardiac patches to suit multiple functions is not only challenging but also perilous due to the target organ with which it will be interfaced. Sensor based, electrically active, miniaturized circuitry etc., poses a huge threat to the individual in whom the device/patch is implanted. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis on choosing β-PVDF based nanocomposites as the inimitable material for designing implantable cardiac patches. β-PVDF based nanocomposite materials is expected to exhibit piezoelectric effect and contribute to the adherence, proliferation and maturation of stem cells. Physico-chemical characterizations followed by in vitro cell line studies were performed in ought to confirm the same. The results revealed that the β-PVDF based nanocomposite material was mechanically stable and supportive in cardiomyocyte adherence and differentiation when compared to standard non piezoelectric scaffolds (control). Hence, an implantable β-PVDF based novel electrospun nanocomposite scaffold is hypothesized to be the hour of need in conjugation with stem cell engineering for repairing damaged heart muscles.",Pleiotropic functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of the rheumatoid arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593416,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease with an unclear etiology.

The well-known mechanism of DCA action is through stimulating Krebs cycle (stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase via inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). This prevents lactate formation (Warburg effect) depriving cancer cells of lactate-based benefits e.g. angiogenesis, chemoresistance and radioresistance. Here, we introduce novel evidence-based hypotheses to explain DCA-induced anticancer effects. On pharmacological and biochemical bases, we hypothesize that DCA is a structural antagonist of acetate competing with it for target enzymes and biological reactions. We hypothesize that DCA exerts its anticancer effects via depriving cancer of acetate benefits. We hypothesize also that acetate is an antidote of DCA capable of treating DCA toxicity. Many reports support our hypotheses. Acetate is vital for cancer cells (tumors depend on acetate) and DCA is structurally similar to acetate. DCA exerts opposite effects to acetate. Acetate caused a decrease in serum potassium, phosphorus and glucose, and an increase in serum lactate, citrate, free fatty acids and ketone bodies (serum acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels). Acetate decreased the proportion of active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase in perfused rat heart. DCA produced quite opposite effects. Intravenous infusion of acetate produced metabolic alkalemia while DCA caused minimal effects on acid-base status. Acetate is important for cancer cells metabolism and survival as elevated acetate can drive resistance to targeted cancer treatments. Acetate is required for epidermal growth factor receptor vIII mutation in lethal brain tumors. Experimentally, DCA inhibited acetate oxidation in hearts of normal rats and reversed inhibitory effects of acetate on the oxidation of glucose. During presence of DCA with no glucose in heart perfusions with [1-14C]acetate, DCA decreased the specific radioactivity of acetyl CoA and its product citrate. This proves our hypotheses that DCA is an antimetabolite that antagonizes acetate for vital reactions in cancer cells. Acetate may be used as an antidote to combat DCA toxicity."

However, here in this report, we elaborate the additional forces involved in the traumatic rupture of the sphincter pupillae muscle. During the anteroposterior compressive forces along the globe, the corneal deformation beyond certain limits leads to the development of sudden displacement forces within the anterior chamber. Aqueous within it which is incontinuous circulation with a posterior narrow pupillary aperture as its entrance, find the path of least resistance that is along the pupillary orifices leading to anexpulsive drive to displace the fluid through this small aperture. During this process, the horizontally oriented mechanical stretching forces appear to be the main cause ofpupillary sphincter tear.",Transfused trauma patients have better outcomes when transfused with blood components from young donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593399,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"The physiology of tissue healing and aging share common pathways. Both patient age and tissue healing are crucial factors predicting outcomes in trauma patients. The presented hypothesis focuses on the concept that transfused trauma patients have better outcomes when transfused with blood components from young donors. The age of the donor of a blood transfusion could affect recovery following a major traumatic insult and help avoid postinjury immune paralysis and its associated complications. The frequent transfusion of blood components to the severely injured trauma patient provides an opportunity for the recipient to benefit from the potentially favourable effect of blood originating from young donors. Different types of evidence support the presented hypothesis including work on soluble circulating factors, research on animal parabiontic models and epidemiological studies. Theories on the role of transfusion of cells, on bone marrow and on senolytics also represent grounds to elaborate pathways to test this hypothesis. The precise molecular mechanism underlying this hypothesis is uncertain. A beneficial effect on trauma patients following transfusion of blood could be due to a positive effect of blood donated from younger donors or instead to the lack of a negative effect possibly occurring when transfusing blood from older donors. Either way, identifying this mechanism would provide a powerful tool enhance long and short term recovery after trauma.","Was the Last Ice Age dusty climate instrumental in spreading of the three ""Celtic"" diseases (hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis and palmar fibromatosis)?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593397,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Cystic fibrosis, hereditary hemochromatosis and palmar fibromatosis are often described as ""Celtic"", based on their contemporary prevalence. The former two are among genetically defined disorders that seem to provide survival advantages to heterozygote individuals, while severe health problems happen in homozygote mutation carriers. Although palmar fibromatosis has no defined mutations, its prevalence has been linked to the prevalence of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I that expanded after the Last Ice Age, thus making th distribution of all three ""Celtic"" diseases dependent on the global climate from 40 to 8 Kya. During the Last Ice Age, the global climate was dry and dark due to dust-laden atmosphere (20-25 times more than today). It has been postulated that skin pigmentation was related to insolation, UV protection and skin synthesis of vitamin D, so when our ancestors moved to Eurasia, individuals with pale skin became advantageous. Deficiency of vitamin D has several health consequences and some of them have been proposed by other authors as important for the spreading of cystic fibrosis mutations: rickets/osteomalacia; susceptibility to diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis and salt induced arterial hypertension. The here proposed link is between vitamin D deficiency and the anaemia of chronic disease that might have facilitated spreading of the hemochromatosis mutation. It seems plausible that the risk of health problems in the offspring of close relatives might have resulted in social taboos of consanguinity in Eurasian protosocieties. Ancient steam bath rituals seem linked to lower incidences of cystic fibrosis in several European populations, thus suggesting health protection in an arid, dusty climate of the last glaciation, that made CFTR mutations in heterozygote carriers less advantageous.",Hypothesis: Folklore perpetuated expression of moon-associated bipolar disorders in anecdotally exaggerated werewolf guise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593396,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"We hypothesize that Moon-associated signals, recently linked to rapid cycling bipolar disorder, may have triggered extremely rare instances of extreme manic and aggressive behaviour that may be compatible with the folklore of the werewolf. Very limited literature on instances of clinical lycanthropy or violent/manic/madness behaviour in association with the Moon may be due to very rare lycanthropic psychosis and not knowing which signal(s) could determine Moon-mood associations. Mechanistically, lunar effects related to bipolar disorder, mood changes, and psychosis could involve either, or a combination, of the following: (i) some as of yet non-measurable signal or undefined geoelectric/geomagnetic receptor or higher sensitivity in some humans, (ii) Moonlight affecting sleep and/or circadian rhythm, (iii) perinatal imprinting of susceptibility, (iv) lunar-periodic growth, and subsequent consumption, of or exposure to psychotropic agents. Importantly, remarkable recent studies (2018) suggest that links between some Moon cycles and bipolar disorder are conceivable. Further observations suggest a role for periodic changes in lunar distances in combination with the Earth and Sun positions. Targeted research could use insight from astrophysicists. If causal links between Moon signals and mood were corroborated, sufferers may benefit from improved disease understanding. Herein, we systematically review the literature and synthesize the evidence for and against the hypothesis. The werewolf myth could become another instance of folklore popularizing biological variation worthy of investigation such as the book characters created by the psychiatrist Hoffmann in 1845 as a Christmas present for his son; namely, 'Struwelpeter' and 'Zappel-Philipp' (shock-headed Peter and fidgety-Philipp): Their conspicuous characteristics have since been linked to genetic uncombable hair syndrome and ADHD, respectively. Overall, rather than dismissing (seemingly) trivial and uncertain concepts as 'just folklore', scientists should grapple with the roots, causes, and significance of traditions and tales, including the werewolf legend.",Intramuscular injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum may decrease spastic muscle contracture for children with cerebral palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593395,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"In cerebral palsy (CP), the spastic motor type is most common, associated with a velocity-dependent increase in muscle stiffness that precedes the development of fixed muscle contracture - a permanent shortening of the muscle tendon unit even when relaxed. Intra-muscular injections of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) have become popular for the treatment of spastic muscle contractures but unfortunately its use has not resulted in long-term functional benefits and, paradoxically, has been associated with a persistent loss of contractile material. Recent biomechanical work has shown that the stiffness of the CP muscle increases in proportion to total collagen content within the perimysial extra-cellular matrix. Thus, rather than the use of tone-reducing agents, we hypothesize that the focal use of a selective collagenase, injected into spastic muscle at an appropriate dilution and concentration, may serve to reduce the extent of muscle contracture, improving clinical range of motion and perhaps sarcomere length.",Retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Some cases of RF represent a manifestation of the IgG4 related disease (IgG4-RD) that is associated to a dramatic response to steroid therapy. It is uncertain if RF́s treatment response differs according to its association with IgG4-RD. We hypothesize that RF́s treatment response to steroids depends on the association with IgG4-RD, thus, we collected and compared clinical data from 10 RF cases; 6 male, mean age 50.6 (±16.15 SD) years. Mean FU was 28 (±25.7 SD) months. According to IgG4 levels, patients were categorized as idiopathic RF (IRF n = 5) or RF-IgG4-RD (n = 5). Therapy response was categorized as complete, partial, stable disease, recurrence or non-response. Nine cases received initial therapy with prednisone; complete response was achieved in 4 RF-IgG4 RD. The remaining 5 cases (1 RF-IgG4RD and 4 IRF) underwent a 2nd line therapy; 4 prednisone + tamoxifen and 1 prednisone + azathioprine. Prednisone + tamoxifen combination achieved complete response in 1 case (RF-IgG4RD), partial response in 1 IRF; in 1 IRF case, disease remained stable and 1 did not respond. The prednisone + azathioprine treatment achieved complete response. At follow-up all patients remained stable and no recurrence was registered. These observations suggest and support the hypothesis that response to steroid monotherapy depends on the association of RF with IgG4, suggesting that IRF cases might benefit from initial combination therapies instead of steroid monotherapy.","Volatility and fluctuations in preferences for Red, Yellow and Blue colours are indicators of personality traits and biological status.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593392,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Response to colour is an outcome of complex interactions between retinal neurophysiology and light. This paper puts forward the hypothesis that the sequence of preferences for the three primary colours Red, Yellow and Blue could provide cues to the personality of an individual. The sequence of preferences will harbour hidden patterns or algorithms that are linked to personality traits. The fluctuations or volatility observed in these preferences carefully recorded over a large number of observations will throw up interesting patterns that can be linked to personality traits. The data from a number of subjects will be used to identify similarities in colour preference patterns that match with personality types that have been determined using standardised tools for identifying personality types. The protocols to be followed for testing the hypothesis have been detailed. Statistical analyses of the data sets are suggested. The subjects that will be studied will hopefully be a source of data that will lead to unveiling the complexities of various personality types and personality traits. It will not be out of place to assume that the data generated can be extrapolated to read the biological and physiological conditions also.",Diets with customary levels of fat from plant origin may reverse coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593389,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"The primary cause of death worldwide is heart disease and the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease. While coronary artery disease is treated with medications, it responds to lifestyle interventions. A low-fat plant-based diet was designed for reversing coronary artery disease and it is effective in reversing the disease. It has not been tested, however, as far as we know, whether diets with customary levels of fat can also reverse coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating to show that atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are reversed with diets containing customary levels of fat. It has been known that fats of plant origin decrease the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. It is also known that vegans who consume diets with customary levels of fat have the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease. But recent and more specific data show that atherosclerosis was decreased when nuts that are rich in fat were added to a Mediterranean diet while atherosclerosis was increased in the controls. Also, two clinical cases show that coronary artery disease was reversed by low-fat plant-based diets that were supplemented with fat-rich foods of plant origin. These data, then, provide evidence that coronary artery disease may be reversed with a diet containing customary levels of fat from plant sources. We hypothesize that coronary artery disease may be reversed by diets with customary levels of fat of plant origin that are low in saturated fat content. This hypothesis needs to be tested by comparing a traditional low-fat plant-based diet with a plant-based diet containing customary levels of fat of plant origin in their effectiveness to reverse coronary artery disease.",The importance of inhibition of a catabolic pathway of methotrexate metabolism in its efficacy for rheumatoid arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593388,Medical hypotheses,2019 05 06,"Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is the anchor drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is inexpensive, effective, and generally safe. When clinical response is inadequate, biological therapies are commonly used in combination with MTX. However, biological agents have safety concerns (i.e. infections, malignancy) and the addition of a biologic agent is expensive, making strategies to improve MTX efficacy important. Inhibition of pathways of folate metabolism involving purine metabolism by MTX, have been traditionally emphasized as important in MTX efficacy. However, inhibition MTX catabolism may also be important. MTX is irreversibly hydroxylated to form 7-hydroxy methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (AOX). Catabolism of MTX to 7-OH-MTX is the first metabolic process imposed on an oral dose of MTX and will alter subsequent interactions of MTX with other enzymes. 7-OH-MTX is less potent than MTX in the treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis. RA patients with a low capacity to catabolize MTX to 7-OH-MTX do better clinically than individuals who are rapid formers of 7-OH-MTX. Therefore, altering the catabolism of MTX may be an innovative way to improve MTX efficacy. Raloxifene is a FDA-approved therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for the reduction of invasive breast cancers but has no known activity in RA. Raloxifene is a potent inhibitor of human liver AOX. Postmenopausal women with RA frequently have low bone mineral density and would be candidates for raloxifene and MTX combination therapy. The effect of raloxifene on MTX metabolism has never been studied. Our hypothesis is that in postmenopausal women with RA and osteoporosis treated with MTX and raloxifene, the inhibition of AOX with resultant decreased formation of 7-OH MTX; will increase MTX levels and improve MTX efficacy. This hypothesis could be studied in an open-label, proof of concept clinical study in individuals before and after the addition of raloxifene. Red blood cell MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels and RA disease activity (DAS28) would be measured. In possible future studies, there are dietary substances, as supplements, (e.g. epigallocatechin gallate in green tea and resveratrol) which inhibit human liver AOX which could be evaluated."

The virus was distantly related to the well-known feline (feline panleukopenia virus) and canine (canine parvovirus type 2) parvoviruses, sharing low nucleotide identities in the capsid protein 2 (less than 43%). The virus was genetically similar (100% at the nucleotide level) to a newly identified canine protoparvovirus, genetically related to human bufaviruses. The feline bufavirus appeared as a common element of the feline virome, especially in juvenile cats, with an overall prevalence of 9.2%. The virus was more common in respiratory samples (9.5%-12.2%) than in enteric samples of cats (2.2%). The role of bufaviruses in the etiology of feline respiratory disease complex, either as a primary or a secondary agents, should be defined.",Muscovy duck reovirus p10.8 protein induces ER stress and apoptosis through the Bip/IRE1/XBP1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593373,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"In the present study, the mechanisms underlying Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) p10.8 protein-induced ER stress and apoptosis in DF-1 cells and Muscovy duckling hepatic tissues were explored. On the fifth day post-infection, an increase in the mRNA levels of binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) and X-box binding protein (XBP1), activation of XBP1/s, and an increase in percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in Muscovy duckling livers. The use of ER stress inducer Tunicamycin and ER stress inhibitor Tauroursodeoxycholic acid demonstrated that MDRV induces apoptosis via ER stress, leading to apoptosis. The use of Tunicamycin increased viral protein synthesis while Tauroursodeoxycholic acid reduced viral protein synthesis, suggesting that MDRV induces ER stress benefiting virus replication. The MDRV p10.8 is the major protein to induce ER stress and apoptosis. We found that p10.8 promotes the conversion of XBP1/u to XBP1/s and expands ER diameter, and increases the percentages of apoptotic cells in DF-1 and duckling liver tissues. To investigate the mechanism underlying the MDRV p10.8-induced ER stress and apoptosis, Western blot, siRNA, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed. We found that the MDRV p10.8 protein up-regulates Bip, p-IRE1, XBP1s, and cleaved-caspase 3. Co-IP results reveal that the MDRV p10.8 protein disassociates the Bip/IRE1 complex. Inhibition of IRE1 by 4-methyl umbelliferone 8-carbaldehyde (4u8c) dramatically reversed the MDRV p10.8-modulated increase in levels of XBP1s and cleaved-caspase 3. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA reversed the increased level of p10.8-modulated cleaved-caspase 3. The present study provides mechanistic insights into the MDRV p10.8 protein induces ER stress, resulting in apoptosis via the Bip/IRE1/XBP1 pathway in DF-1 cells and duckling livers.","Porcine deltacoronavirus induces TLR3, IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-β and PKR mRNA expression in infected Peyer's patches in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593372,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly identified swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes watery diarrhea in piglets and results in significant economic losses to the pig industry. Currently there are no effective treatments or vaccines for PDCoV. In particular, the pathogenesis of PDCoV infection is still largely unknown. In this study, we reported that inoculating conventional weaned piglets with 1 × 109 TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain by oral feeding could cause severe diarrhea. Virus RNA was detected in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation. In addition, microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed, and viral antigen also detected in the small intestines with PDCoV immunohistochemical staining. Importantly, PDCoV significantly induced mRNA expression of TLR3, IL-12, IFN-α, IFN-β, and PKR, the genes involved in modulation of the host immune responses, in infected Peyer's patches at 3 d.p.i., indicating that Peyer's patches play an important role in PDCoV immune responses in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that the observed gene expression profile might help explain immunological and pathological changes associated with PDCoV infection.","Detection, isolation, and in vitro characterization of porcine parainfluenza virus type 1 isolated from respiratory diagnostic specimens in swine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593371,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Porcine parainfluenza virus type 1 (PPIV-1) is a member of the genus Respirovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The PPIV-1 was initially detected in 2013 from slaughter pigs in Hong Kong, China although its role in respiratory disease has remained unknown without virus isolates for experimental inoculation in swine. The objective of this study was to determine the relative frequency of PPIV-1 detection in diagnostic samples collected from swine in the United States, describe the cell culture isolation of PPIV-1, and characterize PPIV-1 cell culture isolates in vitro. Among 842 porcine specimens submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory during 2016-2017, 43.3% were PPIV-1 positive by a real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR suggesting PPIV-1 may be common in swine. Two strains of PPIV-1 were successfully isolated in an LLC-MK2 cell line from a PPIV-1 RT-qPCR positive nasal swab (USA/MN25890NS/2016) and lung (USA/IA84915LG/2017). The PPIV-1 cytopathic effect was demonstrated in tissue culture and enveloped viral particles were observed by electron microscopy. The whole genome, F, and HN gene sequences of both isolates share 98.2%, 98.5%, and 98.2% nucleotide homology, respectively, and phylogenetic analysis indicated they are closely related to other PPIV-1 strains detected in swine from the United States. Whole virus PPIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated for PPIV-1 detection in infected LLC-MK2 cells by indirect immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry assays. The virus isolates and monoclonal antibodies obtained in the present study can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of PPIV-1 and develop new diagnostic tests.",Generation of highly productive and mammalian nonpathogenic recombinant H9N2 avian influenza viruses by optimization of 3'end promoter and NS genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593370,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"We developed A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus-based reverse genetics system in which six internal genes of PR8 and attenuated hemagglutinin and intact neuraminidase genes of field avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been used for the generation of highly productive recombinant vaccine strains. The 6 + 2 recombinant vaccine strains can induce protective humoral immunity against intended field AIVs; however, the epitopes of B and T cells encoded by internal genes may be important for heterosubtypic protection. Therefore, it is advantageous to use homologous internal genes of field AIVs for recombinant vaccine strains. However, the rescue of recombinant viruses having whole internal genes of field AIVs by the PR8-based reverse genetics system was unsuccessful in some cases. Although partial replacement of an internal gene has been successful for generation of highly productive and mammalian nonpathogenic recombinant viruses, complete replacement of internal genes may be more favorable. In this study, we successfully generated complete recombinant H9N2 AIVs possessing 8 genomes of H9N2 AIVs by optimal combinations of 3' end promoter sequences of polymerase genomes, and a NS genome. All the generated recombinant viruses showed highly productive and mammalian nonpathogenic traits but some of them showed much higher virus titers in embryonated chicken eggs. Additionally, we found the same mutations of NS1 gene determined pathogenicity of AIVs in chicken embryos as well as mammals. Thus, the 3' end promoter optimization, and highly productive and mammalian nonpathogenic internal genes may be useful to develop vaccines against AIVs.",The enhanced replication of an S-intact PEDV during coinfection with an S1 NTD-del PEDV in piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593369,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants having a large deletion in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of spike (S) protein were designated as S1 NTD-del PEDVs. They replicate well in experimentally infected pigs. However, on farms they often co-infect pigs with the PEDV containing an intact S protein (S-intact PEDV). We aimed to characterize viral replication and pathogenesis in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected simultaneously with the two types of PEDV using two recombinant PEDVs: icPC22A and its S1 NTD-del form icPC22A-S1Δ197. Additionally, viral replication was compared in Vero and IPEC-DQ cells at the presence of bovine mucin (BM), porcine gastric mucin (PGM), swine bile and bile acids during inoculation. In the pigs coinfected with icPC22A and icPC22A-S1Δ197, icPC22A replicated to a higher peak titer than its infection of pigs without the presence of icPC22A-S1Δ197. The severity of diarrhea and intestinal atrophy were similar between icPC22A and the coinfection groups, but were significantly higher than icPC22A-S1Δ197 group. In Vero and IPEC-DQ cells, certain concentrations of BM, PGM, bile and bile acids increased significantly the infectivity of icPC22A but had no or negative effects on icPC22A-S1Δ197. These results indicated that the replication of the S-intact PEDV was enhanced during coinfection in piglets. This observation may be explained partially by the fact that mucin, bile and bile acids in gastrointestinal tract had facilitating effects on the infection of S-intact PEDV, but no/inhibition effects on S1 NTD-del PEDV.",Limited shedding of an S-InDel strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in semen and questions regarding the infectivity of the detected virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593368,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"PEDV is mainly transmitted by the oro-fecal route although PEDV shedding in semen has already been shown for an S-non-InDel PEDV strain infection. The aim of this study was to determine if PEDV can be shed in semen from SPF (specific pathogens free) boars infected by a French S-InDel PEDV strain (PEDV/FR/001/2014) and in case of positive semen to determine the infectivity of that semen. Both infected boars had diarrhea after inoculation and shed virus in feces. PEDV genome was also detected by RT-qPCR in the sperm-rich fraction of semen (6.94 × 103 and 4.73 × 103 genomic copies/mL) from the two boars infected with the S-InDel PEDV strain but only once at 7DPI. In addition, PEDV RNA in Peyer's patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes was also present for the two inoculated boars. The PEDV positive semen (S-non-InDel and S-InDel) sampled during a previous trial and in this boar trial were inoculated to six SPF weaned pigs. The inoculated piglets did not seroconvert and did not shed virus throughout the duration of the study except for one pig at 18 DPI. But, PEDV could be detected in intestinal tissues such as duodenum, jejunum and jejunum Peyer's patches by RT-qPCR except for one pig. Even if PEDV genome has been detected in semen, experimental infection of piglets with positive semen failed to conclude to the infectivity of the detected PEDV.",Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Mycoplasma hyorhinis strains isolated from swine in Hungary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593367,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Mycoplasma hyorhinis is a common pathogen of swine causing mainly polyserositis and arthritis, but it has also been implicated as a cause of pneumonia. The economic losses due to M. hyorhinis infection could be reduced by antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics potentially used to combat M. hyorhinis in swine production. Thirty-eight Hungarian M. hyorhinis strains isolated between 2014 and 2017 were examined by microbroth dilution tests for fifteen antimicrobial agents. Low MIC values of tetracyclines (MIC50 0.078 μg/ml for doxycycline, ≤0.25 μg/ml for oxytetracycline) and pleuromutilins (MIC50 0.156 μg/ml for tiamulin, ≤0.039 μg/ml for valnemulin) were detected against all strains. Fluoroquinolones (MIC50 0.625 μg/ml), gentamicin (MIC50 1 μg/ml) and florfenicol (MIC50 2 μg/ml) inhibited the growth of Hungarian isolates at moderate MIC values. Most of the strains were inhibited by spectinomycin with low or moderate MIC values (MIC50 4 μg/ml) except one strain (>64 μg/ml). Numerous isolates showed decreased susceptibility to macrolides and lincomycin (MIC90 >64 for tylosin, tilmicosin, tulathromycin, gamithromycin, lincomycin, 8 μg/ml for tylvalosin). This study serves as evidence for the increasing resistance to macrolides and lincomycin in mycoplasmas, and also reports the occurrence of strains with extremely high MIC values to spectinomycin thus emphasizes the importance of the prudent use of antibiotics. Based on our results, tetracyclines and pleuromutilins are the most active compounds in vitro against the Hungarian M. hyorhinis strains.",Partial prediction of the duration and the clinical status of Staphylococcus aureus bovine intramammary infections based on the phenotypic and genotypic analysis of isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593366,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen causing bovine intramammary infections (IMIs) often leading to chronic clinical or subclinical mastitis. Predicting the outcome of S. aureus IMIs (duration and clinical vs subclinical) based on the characterization of isolates would help to make better case management decisions. For this purpose, 583 S. aureus isolates from series of quarter milk samples were characterized by genotypic tests (detection of virulence genes seg, tst, lukM), epidemiological typing (spa type) and by a phenotypic test (biofilm production). VNTR typing (variable number of tandem repeats) was used to establish persistence of the same S. aureus strain in each series of sequential isolates. This allowed to associate each strain to a clinical/subclinical status and to validate the duration of infection. We found differences in the distribution of spa types between the strains from clinical and subclinical cases. Prevalence of lukM was also higher in strains from clinical cases than in strains from subclinical cases. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was then used to determine factors influencing the duration of the infection. Considering a multivariable model of the logistic regression, time to elimination was shorter with the strains of the subclinical lactation series compared to the clinical series (series with at least one clinical case). Strains from the spa type t359 and t529 were less likely to persist compared to those of spa type t13410. In sum, strain characterization including determination of the spa type helps to predict duration of infection and the clinical or subclinical outcome of S. aureus IMIs.",Comparative pathogenicity of different subtypes of duck hepatitis A virus in Pekin ducklings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593365,Veterinary microbiology,2019 01 14,"Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) is a major pathogen of viral hepatitis in ducks, which is a fatal and contagious disease of young ducklings. Despite the identification of numerous DHAV strains (e.g. DHAV-3, DHAV-2, DHAV-1 and DHAV-1a), the pathogenic differences among the different subtypes have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to compare the pathogenic properties of three epidemic strains DHAV-3, DHAV-1, and DHAV-1a in mainland China, in a Pekin duckling infection model. We evaluated the pathogenicity of these different subtypes by investigating clinical signs, macroscopic and microscopic lesions, immunohistochemical examination, and viral RNA detection after experimental inoculation of Pekin ducklings with the three different DHAV strains. There was no significant difference in pathogenicity between DHAV-3 and DHAV-1. Pathogenicity of DHAV-1a differed significantly from that of classical duck hepatitis A (DHAV-3 or DHAV-1), in that there were no clinical signs of opisthotonos. More importantly, pancreatic bleeding or yellowing, and spleen swelling and bleeding were the predominant lesions in the DHAV-1a group, while liver and spleen lesions were the main signs in classical hepatitis (DHAV-1/3). Our findings indicate that there are differences in the pathogenicity of different subtypes of DHAV in ducklings, which may be useful for understanding the biological characteristics of the different subtypes of DHAV in ducks."

Rising two-year-old (R2, n = 22,130) and mixed-age (MA, n = 36,223) hinds from 87 and 71 herds, respectively, throughout New Zealand were pregnancy tested using ultrasound early in gestation (Scan-1) and 55-89 days later (Scan-2) to detect mid-term abortion. Sera from aborted and non-aborted hinds at Scan-2 were tested for BVDv and CvHV-1 using virus neutralisation tests. Available uteri from aborted hinds and from hinds not rearing a calf to weaning were tested by PCR for herpesvirus DNA. In herds with aborted hinds, 10.3% of 639 R2 and 17.2% of 302 MA hinds were sero-positive for BVDv and 18.6% of 613 R2 and 68.5% of 232 MA hinds were sero-positive for CvHV-1. There was no association between BVDv sero-status and abortion at animal level (R2 p = 0.36, MA p = 0.76) whereas CvHV-1 sero-positivity was negatively associated with abortion in MA hinds (p = 0.01) but not in R2 hinds (p = 0.36), MA). Eleven of 108 uteri from aborted R2 hinds but no MA hinds were positive for herpesvirus DNA. Vaginal samples from four R2 and one MA aborted hinds tested were negative for herpesvirus DNA. A Cervid Rhadinovirus type-2 (CRhV-2) was identified in seven PCR positive uteri samples. Findings suggest that BVDv and CvHV-1 may not be associated with abortion in R2 hinds, but association needs to be tested further in MA hinds. The role of CRhV-2 requires clarification.",Dietary selenium supplementation enhances antiviral immunity in chickens challenged with low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H9N2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593352,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"Selenium supplementation in poultry feeds has been known to have beneficial effects on the bird health and performance; however antiviral effects of selenium have remained largely unknown. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of supplementation of chicken diets with organic (Selenium Enriched Yeast; SEY) and inorganic selenium (Sodium Selenite; SS) on low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (H9N2) shedding in the cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples as well as examined the expression of immune related genes. Chickens were fed two doses (High- 0.30 mg/kg of feed; Low- 0.15 mg/kg of feed) of selenium supplementation for 2 weeks followed by low pathogenicity avian influenza virus challenge. Our results showed that the cloacal shedding of virus in all the selenium supplemented groups was significantly lower when compared to the non-supplemented control groups. In addition, the oropharyngeal shedding of virus in chickens fed with organic selenium supplementation was significantly lower than that in the chickens that received either inorganic selenium supplemented feed or controls. Furthermore, the expression of interferon stimulated genes (Viperin, OAS: 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase and MDA5: melanoma differentiation-associated gene) in the cecal tonsils was significantly elevated in the selenium treated groups when compared to controls. Additionally, a significantly higher transcription of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ genes in the cecal tonsils and spleens of chickens receiving SEY-L and SS-H supplemented feed was also observed at post virus challenge time points compared to untreated controls. The results of this study demonstrated that supplementation of chicken diets with selenium, can enhance antiviral defense and thus, may have a beneficial effect in controlling viral infections in poultry.",Rapid whole blood assay using flow cytometry for measuring phagocytic activity of chicken leukocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593351,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"Phagocytic activity of leukocytes in whole blood was assessed as a potential immune competence trait in chickens. A flow cytometry based whole blood phagocytosis (WBP) assay was set up and evaluated using blood from chickens homozygous for four different MHC haplotypes, B12, B15, B19 and B21. Fluorescent latex beads and two serotypes of fluorescently labelled heat-killed bacteria (Salmonella Infantis and Salmonella. Typhimurium) were evaluated as phagocytic targets. In addition, the opsonophagocytic potential (OPp) of individual sera from the birds was included in a phagocytosis assay using the HD11 chicken macrophage cell line. Results showed that both serotypes of bacteria but not the latex beads were effectively phagocytosed by leukocytes in the whole blood cultures. Differences were observed in the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and thrombocyte/lymphocytes, respectively between the different MHC lines. No significant differences on the OPp of serum was identified between MHC lines. In addition, for both phagocytic activity of leukocytes and OPp of serum large variations between individuals were observed within MHC haplotypes. No significant relationships were observed between the phagocytic activity of leukocytes and serum OPp or Salmonella-specific IgY levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that the WBP assay, using a no-lyse no-wash single staining method, is a rapid and convenient method to assess phagocytic functions of different leukocyte populations.",Frequency of bovine viral diarrhea virus detected in subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in persistently infected animals and health outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593350,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) cause acute and persistent infections. Acute infection results in generalized immunosuppression characterized by a decrease in circulating lymphocytes as a result of depletion of CD4+ and CD8 + T cell populations. Persistent infection with BVDV is the result of immune tolerance and is generally not associated with lymphocytopenia. The health outcome of persistently infected (PI) calves varies widely; some die of mucosal disease, some succumb to ill thrift and others appear normal and survive to adulthood. Detection of BVDV at the single lymphoid cell level is important to the study of subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during BVDV infections, however there are few methods available for the detection and quantification of BVDV at this level. To circumvent this difficulty, a novel flow cytometry-based PrimeFlow RNA assay using in-situ detection of BVDV was developed. This assay was used to evaluate differences in viral distribution within subpopulations of PBMC over time in PI calves carrying one of two different species of BVDV (type 1 and type 2). Calves were sampled at 3 different time points approximately one month apart. During the course of the study, a subset of the calves died from ill thrift. Mucosal disease was not indicated in any of the deaths. Using RNA probes specific for the BVDV Npro-Erns coding regions for each respective virus, BVDV RNA was detected in all PBMC of PI that appeared clinically healthy. Calves that succumbed to ill thrift were found to have no or little virus in T cells. The clearance of virus from T cells suggests a breakdown in immune tolerance in these calves. This is the first report of a pattern observed in the viral load in the T cell subpopulations and survival in PI calves.",Immunomodulatory and morphophysiological effects of Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. (Acari: Ixodidae) salivary gland extracts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593349,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. is popularly known as the ""brown dog tick"" since dogs are its preferential hosts, but the species has been reported to parasitize other mammals, including humans, with significant medical-veterinary importance since it transmits several important pathogenic agents during the feeding period. The tick saliva is a complex mixture that has several functions, including the capability to modulate the hemostatic, inflammatory and immunologic systems of the host, allowing pathogens to settle. Despite knowledge about the immunosuppressive action of tick saliva, little is known about the mechanisms involved in this process and the morphophysiological effects caused by exposure to the salivary gland extract, taking into consideration the different periods of the glandular cycle. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the in vitro effects of salivary gland extracts obtained from R. sanguineus s. l. females fed on host rabbits for two (SGE2 - Salivary Gland Extracts of 2 days) and four days (SGE4 - Salivary Gland Extracts of 4 days) on J774 cells (monocyte macrophage cell line) and verify the occurrence of morphological and immunomodulatory alterations in these cells when exposed to different concentrations of these extracts. The results showed that: (i) SGE2 and SGE4 at the concentration of 4 μg/mL presented cytotoxicity to the J774 cells exposed for 24 and 48 hours; (ii) SGE2 at the concentrations of 2 μg/mL(48-hour exposure) and 1 μg/mL (24-hour exposure) and SGE4 at the concentrations of 2 and 1 μg/mL (48-hour exposure) showed proinflammatory activity, confirmed by the increased secretion of NO and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-2), and the presence of morphological characteristics detected by microscopy; and (iii) SGE2 and SGE4 at the concentrations of 0.5 and 0.1 μg/mL had immunomodulatory activity, demonstrated by decreases in the secretion of NO and proinflammatory cytokines (IL2, IL-6 and TNF-α) and increase in the synthesis of IL-10, confirmed by the morphophysiological analysis. These unprecedented data are extremely relevant for future research to identify the processes involved in the ectoparasite-host relationship, as well to develop more efficient tick control strategies.",Delayed type hypersensitivity induced by intradermal inoculation of a Neospora caninum tachyzoite antigen in previously exposed cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593348,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"The aim of this study was to evaluate delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) induced by the intradermal inoculation of a Neospora caninum tachyzoite soluble lysate in cattle previously exposed with the protozoa. Four experimental groups were selected according to the prior exposure to N. caninum antigen. All cows were intradermally injected with a N. caninum tachyzoite soluble lysate and skinfold thickness growth at the inoculation sites was measured at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post inoculation (hpi). Additionally, specific antibodies and IFN-γ production were assessed. Cows experimentally infected with live N. caninum tachyzoites and cows naturally exposed to N. caninum developed skin reactions compatible with DTH between 24 and 96 hpi (p < 0.05). Moreover, cows inoculated with an experimental N. caninum vaccine and cows without evidence of exposure to N. caninum did not show a significant increase in skin thickness (p > 0.05). Furthermore, serological status of the animals was not modified due to the intradermal inoculation. The highest IFN-γ production was observed at 15 days after intradermal inoculation (p < 0.05). Therefore, these results suggest that cattle previously exposed to N. caninum develop a reaction compatible with DTH which could be useful as in vivo cell mediated immunity parameter for assessed bovine neosporosis.",CXCL10 production in equine monocytes is stimulated by interferon-gamma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593347,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine and has been extensively evaluated in people and mice. In horses, CXCL10 and its involvement in host immunity has rarely been analyzed due to the lack of specific antibodies. We generated a mAb specific for the equine chemokine CXCL10 using hybridoma technology. Antibody specificity was confirmed by intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing equine rCXCL10, while CHO cells expressing equine rCXCL9 were not detected. Native CXCL10 expression in PBMC from horses of different age groups was analyzed by flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation. CXCL10 expressing PBMC were characterized by triple staining of CXCL10 combined with cell-surface markers. Stimulation with IFN-γ for 5 h similarly induced CXCL10 production in cluster of differentiation (CD)14+CD16- MHCIIhigh monocytes of adult horses and weanlings. The newly generated mAb enables the quantitative intracellular analysis of CXCL10 by flow cytometry and provides a new valuable tool to improve the evaluation of inflammatory responses in horses.",An immune response-based approach to evaluate physiological stress in rehabilitating loggerhead sea turtle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593346,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"The sea turtles maintaining in rescue centres can cause physiological stress to the animals with subsequent effects, such as the imbalance of immune system components. It is therefore crucial to investigate how innate immune responses are influenced by stress within recovery centers with the aim to use them as primary tools for the evaluation of the rescued specimens' health status and for developing more effective conservative strategies. In this study we monitored for the first time different immune responses in hospitalized Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) (n = 88), comparing them with free-ranging animals (n = 11). The final scope was to identify sensitive tools based on immune responses parameters that rescue centers operators could use to verify the stress condition of hospitalized specimens. Blood samples were obtained from loggerhead sea turtles hospidalized for different periods (≤2 months; >2 months and ≤1 year; >1 year) in various Italian rescue centers. Free-ranging turtles were captured in the South of Spain during a shipboard survey with a minimal invasive technique. Samples were analyzed for different stress-associated parameters (white cells count, heterophils:lymphocytes (H:L) ratio, respiratory burst, total antioxidant status (TAS), lysozyme). Free-ranging specimens showed lower values for most of the measured parameters. The highest values of TAS, lysozyme activity, respiratory burst and leukocytes profile were detected during the first 2 months of hospitalization, that resulted as the most critical period for the rehabilitation of turtles. After more than 1 year, immune values were similar to the values of free-ranging, indicating an acclimatization to captivity and health conditions amelioration. Moreover, monocytes low levels and eosinophils significant decrease in hospitalized animals indicated the absence of chronic inflammations and reduction of parasitic load during rehabilitation. Statistical analysis pointed out that lysozyme activity and eosinophyls count represent valid methods to diagnose physiological stress and inflammation in hospitalized loggerhead sea turtles.",Evaluation of T regulatory lymphocytes and serum concentration of selected cytokines in dogs with perianal tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593345,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"The purpose of this study was to determine concentrations of IL-2, IL-10, TGF-β1 in serum and T regulatory cell (Treg) percentage in peripheral blood of dogs with perianal tumours. Investigations were conducted on 32 male dogs of mixed breed. The animals were divided into 4 experimental groups and control group. The groups were established depending on the tumour malignancy degree and the type of dominant hormones. All measurements of serum cytokine concentrations were conducted by the use of commercial diagnostic ELISA kits. Treg lymphocyte percentage was measured by flow cytometry. In both groups with benign tumours cytokine levels decreased during therapy, whilst in groups with malignant tumors, in spite of applying anti-tumour therapy, concentrations of cytokines in serum markedly increased. The mean percentage of Treg lymphocytes in dogs with benign tumours (group I and II) was significantly lower than the mean percentage of these cells in control group at all time points, but after applying of anti-hormonal therapy, the significant increase of Treg percentage was observed compared to baseline values. By contrast, in both groups with malignant tumours (group III and IV), the mean percentage of Treg lymphocytes was significantly higher at the beginning of the experiment comparing with the control group as well as both groups with benign tumours and this percentage increased during anti-tumour therapy. The results of this study suggest that monitoring changes in cytokine serum concentrations and Treg percentage in the bloodstream during anti-hormonal therapy may constitute a subsidiary marker in the monitoring of therapy effectiveness, in prognosis the outcome of a disease or in differentiating tumour degree of malignancy.",Ehrlichia ruminantium antigens and peptides induce cytotoxic T cell responses in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593344,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2019 01 17,"Since CD8+ T cells play an important role in resistance to infection with heartwater, effective vaccines against this disease will likely require identification of antigens that contain CD8+ T cell epitopes responsible for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. With the use of the fluorescent antigen-transfected target cell (FATT)-CTL assay, IFN-γ ELISPOT and flow cytometry, peptides that induce CTL, proliferation of CD8 + T cells and IFN-γ production were identified as possible target antigens for vaccine development. Of particular relevance was the finding that different peptides from different antigens were able to elicit varied cytotoxic activities by immune peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from heartwater immune tick-infected sheep. Several peptides derived from Erum0660, Erum2330, Erum2540, Erum2580 and Erum5000 induced CTL in immune sheep PBMC. Peptide Erum2540-6 was the only peptide that induced significant CTL, CD8+CD45RO+ and CD8+IFN-γ+ by PBMC from all three sheep, and Erum2540 and p2540-20 induced the highest % CTL response in all three outbred sheep. These results suggest that these epitopes may be of major importance in heartwater recombinant vaccine development."

Previously, we found a tumor-signature chimeric fusion RNA, PAX3-FOXO1 also present during muscle differentiation, raising the possibility of its physiological role. Here we demonstrated that the fusion is needed transiently for muscle lineage commitment. Interestingly, the fusion ortholog was not found in seven mouse muscle differentiation/regeneration systems, nor in other stem cell differentiation systems of another three mammal species. We noticed that Pax3 is expressed at a much lower level in human stem cells, and during muscle differentiation than in other mammals. Given the fact that the fusion and the parental Pax3 share common downstream targets, we reasoned that forming the fusion may be a mechanism for human cells to escape certain microRNA regulation on Pax3. By sequence comparison, we identified 16 candidate microRNAs that may specifically target the human PAX3 3'UTR. We used a luciferase reporter assay, examined the microRNAs expression, and conducted mutagenesis on the reporters, as well as a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing on the endogenous allele. Finally, we identified miR-495 as a microRNA that specifically targets human PAX3. Examining several other fusion RNAs revealed that the human-specificity is not limited to PAX3-FOXO1. Based on these observations, we conclude that PAX3-FOXO1 fusion RNA is absent in mouse, or other mammals we tested, the fusion RNA is a mechanism to escape microRNA, miR-495 regulation in humans, and that it is not the only human-specific fusion RNA.",3D structure of a Brucella melitensis porin: molecular modelling in lipid membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593262,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2018 12 29,"Brucella melitensis is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for brucellosis in mammals and humans. Its outer membrane proteins (Omp) control the diffusion of solutes through the membrane, and they consequently have a crucial role in the design of diagnostics and vaccines. Moreover, such proteins have recently revealed their potential for protein-based biomaterials. In the present contribution, the structure of the B. melitensis porin Omp2a is built using the RaptorX threading method. This is a 16-stranded β-barrel with an α-helix on the third loop folding inside the barrel and forming the constriction zone of the channel, a typical feature of general porins such as PhoE and OmpF. The preferential diffusion of cations over anions experimentally observed in anterior studies is evidenced by the presence of distinct clusters of charges in the extracellular loops and in the inner pore. Docking studies support the previously reported hypothesis of Omp2a ability to aid maltotetraose diffusion. The monomer model is then assembled into a homotrimer, stabilized by the L2 loop involved in most of the interface interactions. The stability of the trimer is evaluated in three bilayers: pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and a mixture of 1:1 of POPC/POPE. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the β-barrel-structural stability over time even though a breathing-like motion is observed. Compared to the pure bilayers, the POPC/POPE better preserves the integrity of the protein and its channel. Overall, this work demonstrates the relevancy of the Omp2a model and will help to design new therapeutic agents and bioinspired nanomaterials.",Comparing Usual Dietary Intakes Among Subgroups of Mothers in the Year Before Pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593261,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2019 05 28,"The quantity and quality of dietary intake among women of reproductive age has important public health implications for nutritional status during pregnancy.

Branched actin networks assembled within phagophore membranes are required for generating the autophagosome membrane shape and movement. The ARP2/3 complex and its regulators, such as JMY (junction mediating and regulatory protein, p53 cofactor), translocate to phagophore membranes to promote local actin filament formation during autophagy. Hu et al., recently showed that during autophagy LC3 recruits JMY to the phagophore and promotes its actin nucleation activity. They also characterized TTC5/STRAP (tetratricopeptide repeat domain 5) as a negative autophagy regulator via binding to JMY and antagonizing its activation. Moreover, an in vitro reconstitution system was developed to demonstrate that membrane-bound LC3 is sufficient to recruit JMY and stimulate JMY-mediated actin filament assembly.",Characterization of encapsulated cells within hyaluronic acid and alginate microcapsules produced via horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed crosslinking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593259,Journal of biomaterials science. Polymer edition,2019 03 01,"Hydrogel microcapsules having the ability to promote cell adhesion and proliferation are a useful tool for fabricating tissue in vitro. The present study explored the effects of two anionic polysaccharide hydrogel membranes which have an impact on the adhesiveness, morphology and growth of cells. Microcapsules were made by coating a cell-laden gelatin microparticle with a hydrogel membrane produced from modified hyaluronic acid or alginate possessing phenolic hydroxyl moieties (HA-Ph or Alg-Ph respectively) via a horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed crosslinking reaction. Some gelatin was retained within the microcapsules to support the attachment and growth of encapsulated cells. The morphological and functional characteristics of encapsulated HeLa and 10T1/2 cells were evaluated. The HA-Ph hydrogel, which exhibited greater retention of gelatin, showed a higher degree of cytocompatibility with respect to cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation compared with the Alg-Ph hydrogel membrane. These findings indicate that HA-Ph microcapsules synthesized around a temporary gelatin microparticles are a promising cell vehicle for tissue engineering applications.",Characterizing the structural variability of HIV-2 protease upon the binding of diverse ligands using a structural alphabet approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593258,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 02 01,"The HIV-2 protease (PR2) is an important target for designing new drugs against the HIV-2 infection. In this study, we explored the structural backbone variability of all available PR2 structures complexed with various inhibitors using a structural alphabet approach. 77% of PR2 positions are structurally variable, meaning they exhibit different local conformations in PR2 structures. This variability was observed all along the structure, particularly in the elbow and flap regions. A part of these backbone changes observed between the 18 PR2 is induced by intrinsic flexibility, and ligand binding putatively induces others occurring in the binding pocket. These latter changes could be important for PR2 adaptation to diverse ligands and are accompanied by changes outside the binding pocket. In addition, the study of the link between structural variability of the pocket and PR2-ligand interactions allowed us to localize pocket regions important for ligand binding and catalytic function, regions important for ligand recognition that adjust their backbone in response to ligand binding and regions important for the pocket opening and closing that have large intrinsic flexibility. Finally, we suggested that differences in ligand effectiveness for PR2 could be partially explained by different backbone deformations induced by these ligands. To conclude, this study is the first characterization of the PR2 structural variability considering ligand diversity. It provides information about the recognition of PR2 to various ligands and its mechanisms to adapt its local conformation to bound ligands that could help understand the resistance of PR2 to its inhibitors, a major antiretroviral class.

This maturation process involves a large set of accessory proteins as well as ribonucleases, responsible for removal of the external and internal transcribed spacers from the pre-rRNA. Early-diverging eukaryotes belonging to the Kinetoplastida class display several unique characteristics, in particular in terms of RNA synthesis and maturation. These peculiarities include the rRNA biogenesis and the extensive fragmentation of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA. The role of specific endo- and exonucleases in the maturation of the unusual rRNA precursor of trypanosomatids remains largely unknown. One of the nucleases involved in rRNA processing is Rrp44, an exosome associated ribonuclease in yeast, which is involved in several metabolic RNA pathways. Here, we investigated the function of Trypanosoma brucei RRP44 orthologue (TbRRP44) in rRNA processing. Our results revealed that TbRRP44 depletion causes unusual polysome profile and accumulation of the complete LSU rRNA precursor, in addition to 5.8S maturation impairment. We also determined the crystal structure of TbRRP44 endonucleolytic domain. Structural comparison with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rrp44 revealed differences in the catalytic site and substitutions of surface residues, which could provide molecular bases for the lack of interaction of RRP44 with the exosome complex in T. brucei.","Synthesis and in vitro anti-epileptic activities of novel [1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593254,Journal of Asian natural products research,2018 12 29,"In this investigation, eight novel 2,5-disubstituted [1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one and eight novel 2,5-disubstituted [1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine amine derivatives were synthesized based on the novel marine natural product Essramycin.

The results showed that as NaCl concentration increased, Na⁺ content of root, stem, leaf and flower increased significantly, and that of the aerial parts was in a higher level than in the root. Regarding the K⁺ content, it decreased in the root but increased in stem, leaf and flower. Some changes were detected in the Ca²⁺ content, but not significant on the whole. The value of K⁺/Na⁺ and Ca²⁺/Na⁺ reduced as a result of increasing NaCl concentrations. The content of essential oil increased under medium salt treatment (50 mmol·L⁻¹ NaCl). However, the synthesis and accumulation of essential oil was inhibited by the serious salt treatment (100 mmol·L⁻¹ NaCl). Over 98% of the essential oil components were terpenes, in which pulegone and menthone were the most two abundant compounds. Varieties of essential oil components did not change significantly under salt stress but their relative proportions did. The transformation of pulegone to menthone was enhanced and the value of pulegone/menthone based on their relative contents decreased with NaCl concentration increasing. Consequently, menthone ranked the most abundant compound by replacing pulegone.

Depression level and family fitness were quantified with self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve (APGAR) test. The relationship and correlation of SDS value and APGAR score was analyzed.Family fitness for all COPD inpatients was grossly well, among which 93 patients (34.87%) experienced medium-to-severe family unfitness. Further analysis shows that better fitness correlated with less depression and worse fitness correlated with more depression. Depression levels were significantly different in patients under family fitness. Inpatients were grossly in light depression, among which 186 (69.66%) patients exhibited depression symptoms. Family fitness was significantly different among patients with different levels of depression. Correlation analysis showed that depression level was negatively correlated with family fitness.Depression in patients is significantly correlated with family fitness. The condition of patients can be improved by active family fitness and patients' interactions with family members.

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between indications for nutrition support team therapy and the nutritional status of patients hospitalized in local major hospitals.Patients who were referred to a nutrition support team from January to December 2016 were enrolled. Patients were classified into 4 age groups, and the weight categories were determined using body mass index (BMI). Four of 6 indications were used for referral to a nutrition support team. The required calories were estimated, and the nutritional status was classified into malnutrition or eutrophia, based on the estimation.The proportion of elderly patients (37.0%) was higher than that of younger ones (28.3%). Patients with higher BMI had a relatively lower proportion of malnutrition. Patients receiving enteral nutrition had greater risk of malnutrition (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71-5.24). Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (aOR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.30-0.47) and treated in the intensive care unit (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54-0.91) had lower risk of malnutrition. Patients with >3 indications for nutrition support team therapy had a lower risk of malnutrition than those with only 1 indication (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.37-0.77).Parenteral nutrition was the most common indication for referral to nutrition support team therapy; however, enteral nutrition had the poorest nutritional status.

Nodules with US features that did not satisfy the criteria for any risk category in the 2015 ATA guidelines were defined as ""unspecified"" nodules. These thyroid nodules were retrospectively assessed using the Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System proposed by Kwak (Kwak-TIRADS) and the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS).There were 70 ""unspecified"" nodules (2.7%, 70/2614), and 18.6% (13/70) of these nodules were malignant. The percentages of nodules with Kwak-TIRADS grades 4a, 4b and 4c were 53.3%, 40.0%, and 6.7%, respectively.

Currently there are no standards regarding when prosthesis should be implanted, and which access is connected with minimal rates of complications. We present our experience of primary prosthesis implantations in boys treated in our department.From 2000 to 2014, primary implantation of the testicular prosthesis was performed in 290 boys. The early and late post-operative complications and long-term therapeutic results were analyzed, considering age at the time of implantation, the time between the initial operation and implantation of the prosthesis, and the surgical approach.Best results were observed in 267 patients and bad outcome in 23 patients. Prosthesis implantation in young boys operated within the first three years of life or during the first year after primary surgery was connected with statistically fewer complications (P = .002 and P < .05, respectively). Supra-scrotal access was connected with the lowest rate of complications (P = .01).Long-term therapeutic results in boys with testicular prostheses were good in the majority of cases. Implantation of the first prosthesis should be performed early between 1 and 3 years of life in boys with lack of the testis. Implantation of a prosthesis should also be performed within 1 year after removing of testis or during orchiectomy.

However, it is unclear whether methylation of the STING promoter affects STING transcription and response to antiviral therapy. The present study determined the methylation status of the STING promoter in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).This study included 198 participants, of which 159 participants had CHB and 39 were healthy controls (HCs). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the methylation status of the STING promoter. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine STING mRNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.The methylation frequency of the STING promoter was significantly higher and STING mRNA level was lower in the patients with CHB than in the HCs. Presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was independently correlated with an increased risk of STING promoter methylation. Virological response frequency was higher in the patients with CHB receiving entecavir (ETV) than in those receiving adefovir (ADV). In the ETV group, the virological response frequency was evidently lower in the patients with CHB having methylated STING promoters than in those having unmethylated STING promoters. However, there was no significant difference in the virological response frequency between ADV-treated patients having methylated and unmethylated STING promoters.These results indicate that the hypermethylation of the STING promoter and thus the transcriptional repression of STING weaken the effect of STING in inhibiting HBV replication and decreases the effectiveness of antiviral therapy."

Accordingly, the events that occur during the progression of adenoma to carcinoma have been characterized and include activation of the Wnt-pathway. Further, gastric adenoma (GA) is a premalignant lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). In this paper, we focused our interesting on Wnt signaling path function in the pathogenesis of GAC.We compared the differences between low grade adenoma (LGA), high grade adenoma (HGA), GACs and corresponding normal gastric tissue (NGT). Specific indexes include the pathological characteristics of gastric neoplasia, Helicobacter pylori infection, β-catenin mutation status, and methylation status of Wnt antagonist genes.There was significant difference of β-catenin expression in patient with NGT, LGA, HGA, and GAC, the results respectively were 4.2%, 41.7%, 83.3%, and 91.7%. Only 1 GACs was detected exon 3 of β-catenin mutation. Wnt antagonist genes mRNA expression levels, such as APC, sFRP-1, Wif-1, and Dkk-1, were significantly reduced in GAC. Promoter methylation levels of the 4 genes were significantly elevated in GAC and HGA compared to NGT and LGA. However, there was no significant difference between HGAs and GACs. The β-catenin abnormal expression was correlated with hypermethylation of these 4 genes. Multiple gene concurrent methylation phenomenon was increased from NGTs to GACs; the amount of methylation genes in GACs and HGAs was more than NGTs and LGAs. The more methylation of the above-mentioned genes, the more severity of local inflammation. The infection rate of H pylori was significantly higher in patient with HGA (66.7%, 16/24) and GAC (58.5%, 14/24) than in LGAs (16.7%,4/24) (PHGA-LGA = .024, PGAC-LGA = .032). In addition, the present of H pylori also correlated with the β-catenin abnormal expression and the hypermethylation status of Wnt antagonist genes (P < .001). But other parameters in adenoma cases had no significantly related with infection of H pylori.Hypermethylation of Wnt antagonist genes may have a tight relationship with gastric tumorigenesis. And these genes may increase the incidence of GAC. Additionally, H pylori may have promotion function in GA formation.",The clinical outcome of recurrent sacral chordoma with further surgical treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593146,Medicine,2019 01 15,"To analyze the clinical results and related factors of further surgical treatment for recurrent sacral chordomas.Chordomas are rare primary malignant tumors with a high recurrence rate. The treatment of recurrent tumors is difficult and controversial. Contamination by previous operations and disturbed local anatomical structures may increase the risk of reoperation. Most previous studies have focused on the primary tumor; there are very few reports on the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of recurrent sacral chordomas.Thirty-four patients with recurrent sacral chordomas from 1979 to 2014 were included in this study. The patients comprised 25 men and 9 women with an average age of 50.7 (24-75) years. The average time until recurrence was 19.4 (4-51) months postoperatively, and 85.3% of the recurrent tumors were located in bone. The patients had an average of 1.2 (1-3) recurrences before further operations were performed in our hospital. The mean maximum tumor diameter was 8.1 (4.6-12.0) cm. Thirty-one patients underwent further tumor resection in our hospital. The postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and survival results were followed and analyzed.The mean follow-up after surgical treatment of recurrence was 49.6 (12-144) months. Nine patients (37.5%) developed recurrence again after an average of 26.7 months. The 3-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 69.4% and 63.1%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the tumor level within the sacrum (P = .001) and the surgical margin (P = .001) were significant recurrence-related factors. Four patients (16.7%) developed lung metastasis. Eighteen patients were alive at last follow-up. The 5-year and 10-year survival rate after surgical treatment of recurrence was 67.3% and 53.9%, respectively.Most recurrent tumors are located in bone, and a safe osteotomy margin is important. The surgical margin is the only controllable factor of further tumor recurrence. Some patients with recurrence achieve long survival and obtain a clinical benefit from repeated operations if complete resection is achieved.",Risk factors for child maltreatment by the utilization of medical service and socioeconomic environment in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593145,Medicine,2019 01 15,"Child maltreatment is complicated by cultural, welfare, and socioeconomic factors. However, the relationship between child maltreatment and socioeconomic factors has not been completely understood. We investigated risk factors for child abuse and neglect in Taiwan.The data in our study was obtained from Taiwan National Statistics at county level from 2004 to 2015. We included 4 areas (eastern, western, southern, northern) involving 20 cities and counties. The trends of child maltreatment rate based on different years and different areas were surveyed. In addition, panel data analysis was used to analyze the links between child maltreatment rate and socioeconomic factors.An increasing trend of child maltreatment rate in Taiwan was observed. During the past decade, child maltreatment rate increased from 14.5 in 2004 to 23.4 cases per 10000 children in 2014. The peak, which was 43 cases per 10000 children, occurred in 2012. Significant geographical differences were observed, and the highest child maltreatment rate was seen in eastern Taiwan. Panel data analysis revealed a lag effect of the unemployment rate on child maltreatment rate at the county level: the child maltreatment rate increased by 7 percent, while the prior unemployment rate increased by one percent. In addition, the medical personnel density was related to the child maltreatment rate within the county.Previous unemployment rate had a lag impact on child maltreatment occurrence. Unemployment rate has not only a direct impact on the economy but also sequential effects on child maltreatment.",Etiologic impact on difference on clinical outcomes of patients with heart failure after cardiac resynchronization therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593144,Medicine,2019 01 15,To compare long-term clinical outcomes between patients with heart failure due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and those due to ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

The pathogenesis of TB is still unclear; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that host genetic factors may play important roles in susceptibility to TB, and different gene polymorphisms in different ethnic and genetic backgrounds may lead to different effects. In view of the above theories, our research group used bioinformatics to screen for 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs1045481, rs1045491, rs2740349, rs10719, rs642321, rs3744741, rs7813, rs3742330, rs3757, rs14035, rs720012, and rs4961280, which are derived from 6 main genes (i.e., GEMIN4, DICER1, DROSHA, DGCR8, AGO2, and RAN) acting in the microRNA-machinery pathway. We then analyzed the correlations between TB patients of Uygur in Xinjiang China and the above SNPs using a case-control study. The results showed that the genotypic distributions of rs720012 (from gene DGCR8) and rs4961280 (from gene AGO2) were not in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < .05), so they were deleted. Subjects carrying the rs3742330 AG/GG genotype, rs1045481 GA genotype, rs1045491 CT genotype, and rs7813 AG genotype, respectively, had an increased risk of TB than individuals carrying rs3742330 AA genotype, rs1045481 GG/AA genotype, rs1045491 CC/TT genotype, and rs7813 AA/GG genotype between different groups. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis found that rs3744741 and rs2740349 from gene GEMIN4 had a regulatory effect, while rs3742330 from gene DICER1 had a reverse regulatory effect. Finally, according to the results of Linkage Disequilibrium between SNPs, the haplotype analysis showed that the haplotype of GCTAC from gene GEMIN4 had statistical differences when compared with active and inactive TB. The current experimental results provide a direction for our future research, and the research team will conduct more in-depth studies on the correlation between miRNA and TB.",Myiasis-induced sepsis: a rare case report of Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica and Ignatzschineria indica bacteremia in the continental United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593131,Medicine,2019 01 25,"The presentation of sepsis and bacteremia in cutaneous and cavitary myiasis is uncommon.

Totally, 467 fetuses in at-risk pregnancies were collected from Meizhou people's hospital from January 2014 to December 2017. Genomic DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood of the couples and villus, amniotic fluid or cord blood of the fetuses. DNA-based diagnosis was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow-through hybridization technique. Follow-up visits were done half a year after the fetuses were born. Around 467 fetus at-risk pregnancies were performed prenatal diagnosis. We detected 88 CVS samples, 375 amniocentesis fluid samples and, 4 cord blood samples. The 356 fetuses in α-thalassemia families consisted of 69 (19.38%) with Bart's hydrops syndrome, 20 (5.62%) fetuses with Hb H disease, and 184 (51.68%) fetuses with heterozygote. And the 111 fetuses in β-thalassemia families consisted of 31 (27.93%) thalassemia major, 51 (45.95%) fetuses with heterozygote. There are 13 fetuses with α+β-thalassemia, including 2 cases with severe β-thalassemia. DNA-based testing prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia was found to be highly reliable. Our findings provide key information for clinical genetic counseling of prenatal diagnosis for major thalassemia in Hakka pregnant women. Our work plays an important role in the prevention and control of thalassemia in Hakka population.

This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of micronutrients in UC patients and investigate their association with disease activity.This cross-sectional study was conducted on UC patients visiting the Department of Gastroenterology at 3 different teaching hospitals between January 2016 and January 2017. UC activity was measured based on Truelove and Witts' severity index and guidelines for colonoscopy. A healthy gender- and age-matched group was also selected. Serum levels of zinc, copper, selenium, ceruloplasmin, albumin, and total protein were compared between the 2 groups of UC patients and healthy subjects using independent-samples t test. Also, the association between serum levels of micronutrients and UC activity was assessed by using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient tests. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 21, considering P ≤.05 as the statistical significance level.Overall, 112 (54 male and 58 female) individuals with the mean age of 34.6 years were studied in the 2 groups of UC patients (n = 56) and healthy subjects (n = 56). The 2 groups were homogeneous in terms of age, gender, marital status, place of residence, and educational level (P >.05).

In this article, the authors presented staged reconstructive treatment for extensive irregular cicatricial alopecia with the goal to achieve better and reliable results. A retrospective review of staged reconstructive treatment performed in 16 patients with extensive irregular cicatricial alopecia after burn was conducted. In stage 1, final flaps were designed at 1st. Tissue expanders were placed into the subgaleal plane and serially inflated with normal saline. In stage 2, scarring tissues were excised and the expanded hair-bearing flaps were advanced to the defect. Hair grafts were harvested from excessive hair-bearing scalps excised from the flaps and replanted. For patients with less satisfactory results, stage 3 was performed by hair transplantation. Cicatricial area, follicular unit density, survival rate of hair grafts, and patients' satisfaction were measured before and after each stage. Thirteen patients received 3-stage treatment, and 3 received 2-stage treatment. Significant improvements in aesthetics and patient satisfaction were achieved in all the patients.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, epidemiological characteristics, and risk factors of migraine in Han Chinese from Fujian Province, China.A cross-sectional epidemiological survey study was conducted to evaluate characteristics of migraine in Han Chinese. Demographic and clinical data were collected through a survey administered in face-to-face interviews by trained investigators, and a physical exam and symptom review were performed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess independent risk factors for migraine.A total of 7860 subjects aged 15 years and older were surveyed, of which 9.1% (n = 717) were diagnosed with migraine. Among these, a higher percentage was female (12.6%) than male (5.3%). Only 114 subjects (15.9%) were diagnosed as having migraine with aura, which was closely associated with family history of migraine. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the odds of migraine were significantly lower in subjects aged ≥50 years compared with those aged <30 years (odds ratio [OR] ranged from 0.40 to 0.64; P ≤.013) and was higher in females compared with males (OR = 2.89, P <.001).

The TG enzymatic activities considered in our discussion of human disease include deamidation of glutamine (Gln) residues, amine incorporation into Gln residues, and protein crosslinking. Except for TG7, which remains poorly studied, all individual TG members have been correlated with disparate human diseases that arise from either TG function or lack of function. Loss of TG function is associated with numerous orphan diseases that affect a relatively small number of individuals: loss of FXIIIa (transamidase-activated form) crosslinking leads to defects in blood coagulation in FXIII deficiency; loss of TG1 and TG5 cross linking leads to defects in epidermal cornification in lamellar ichthyosis and acral peeling skin syndrome, respectively; loss of TG3 crosslinking in hair-cuticle formation leads to uncombable hair syndrome; the predicted loss of TG6 crosslinking leads to spinocerebellar ataxia-35; and loss of the structural erythrocyte membrane protein, protein 4.2, leads to hereditary spherocytosis type 5. The enzymatic activity of TG2 is involved in the exacerbation of celiac disease and in at least 1 case of hemoglobinopathy, characterized by shortened erythrocyte lifespan. TGs are also autoantigens in a number of immune diseases, resulting in the production of autoantibodies against FXIIIa in acquired FXIII deficiency, TG2 in celiac disease, TG3 in dermatitis herpetiformis, TG4 in autoimmume polyglandular syndrome type 1, and TG6 in gluten axonal neuropathy and gluten ataxia. Much still remains to be learned and confirmed with respect to disease mechanisms, particularly with respect to TG-related immune diseases, in which development of isozyme-specific inhibitors may be useful for treatment.-Lorand, L., Iismaa, S.

The majority of these orofacial clefts are nonsyndromic. However, a general screening for syndromes and other organ anomalies should always be performed as their association with orofacial clefts cannot be overlooked. With the recent progress in the knowledge of cleft repair, the procedures to correct cleft lip and palate though complex, have been simplified to allow improvisation in outcome and to achieve even better finesse of surgical result. The procedural complications and the pursuit of having near perfect esthetics and functionality, make this deformity a recipient of multiple procedures. This ensures that the patient is under the care of the treating surgeon for long term and allows the surgeon to follow-up on the result, not only to provide care but also to intercept any deviation in the desired outcome. Postoperative care of cleft lip and palate surgery is largely underdiscussed and a set of fixed guidelines will help the treating surgeon to provide the most comprehensive care to the cleft patients. The authors review the practices followed at their hospitals-a high volume cleft and craniofacial care center, a tertiary care multispeciality teaching hospital, and a community teaching and training hospital. The commonly followed practices with suitable evidence in postoperative care of these patients are enlisted here.",Free Flap Head and Neck Reconstruction with an Emphasis on Postoperative Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593075,Facial plastic surgery : FPS,2019 04 18,"Microsurgical free tissue transfer represents the mainstay of care in both ablative locoregional management and the simultaneous reconstruction of a defect. Advances in microsurgical techniques have helped balance the restoration of both form and function-decreasing the significant morbidity once associated with large ablative, traumatic, or congenital defects-while providing immediate reconstruction enabling early aesthetic and functional rehabilitation. There are a multitude of perioperative measures and considerations that aim to maximize the success of free tissue transfer. These include nutritional support, tight glycemic control, acknowledgment of psychological and psychiatric factors, intraoperative surgical technique, and close postoperative monitoring of the patients' hemodynamic physiology. While the success rates of free tissue transfer in experienced hands are comparable to alternative options, the consequences of flap failure are catastrophic-with the potential for significant patient morbidity, prolonged hospital stay (and associated increased financial implications), and increasingly limited options for further reconstruction. Success is entirely dependent on a continuous arterial inflow and venous outflow until neovascularization occurs. Flap failure is multifactorial and represents a dynamic process from the potentially reversible failing flap to the necrotic irreversibly failed flap-necessitating debridement, prolonged wound care, and ultimately decisions concerned with future reconstruction. The overriding goal of free flap monitoring is therefore the detection of microvascular complications prior to permanent injury occurring-identifying and intervening within that critical period between the failing flap and the failed flap-maximizing the potential for salvage. With continued technique refinement, microvascular free flap reconstruction offers patients the chance for both reliable functional and aesthetic restoration in the face of significant ablative defects. The caveat to this optimism is the requirement for considered perioperative care and the optimization of those factors that may offer the difference between success and failure.",General Precautions and Safety Aspects of Facial Laser Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593074,Facial plastic surgery : FPS,2019 04 18,"The current overview of laser radiation therapy options and the legal aspects of the head and neck region provides insight into the available laser hardware, discusses the indications and treatment options and risks, as well as the necessary precautions to be taken when operating a laser device.

Despite having performed a perfect surgery, with the least amount of damage to the soft tissues and osteocartilaginous structures, minimal bleeding, and in terms of the surgical time, without adequate postoperative care our results can be affected considerably in the short and long run. Therefore, we must have very clear guidelines regarding postoperative care and the duties of our patients, which should be emphasized during the informed consent of the intervention. It is also essential to comment on the warning signs of postoperative complications, which need to be detected and treated in time to achieve the expected post-surgery results.

Here we simulated RI vision and investigated if object recognition in RI patients can be improved and maintained through training. Importantly, we asked if the trained object recognition can be generalized to a new task context, and to new viewpoints of the trained objects. For this purpose, we adopted two training tasks, a labelling task where participants had to choose the correct label out of other distracting labels for the presented object, and a reverse labelling task where participants had to choose the correct object out of other distracting objects to match the presented label. Our results showed that, despite of the task order, recognition performance was improved in both tasks and lasted at least for a week. The improved object recognition, however, can be transferred only from the labelling task to the reverse labelling task but not vice versa. Additionally, the trained object recognition can be transferred to new viewpoints of the trained objects only in the labelling task but not in the reverse labelling task.

In the present study we used an image-manipulation algorithm (the Eidolon Factory) based on a formal description of the visual field as a tool to investigate how peripheral stimuli appear in the presence of such limitations. Observers were asked to match central and peripheral stimuli, both configurations of superimposed geometric shapes and patches of natural images, in terms of the parameters controlling the amplitude of the perturbation (reach) and the cross-scale similarity of the perturbation (coherence). We found that observers systematically tended to report the peripheral stimuli as having shorter reach and higher coherence. This means that their matches both were less distorted and had sharper edges relative to the actual stimulus. Overall, the results indicate that the way we see objects in our peripheral visual field is complemented by our assumptions about the way the same objects would appear if they were viewed foveally.",Predictive remapping of visual features beyond saccadic targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593063,Journal of vision,2019 04 12,"Visual stability is thought to be mediated by predictive remapping of the relevant object information from its current, presaccadic location to its future, postsaccadic location on the retina. However, it is heavily debated whether and what feature information is predictively remapped during the presaccadic interval. Here we examined the spatial and featural properties of predictive remapping in a set of three psychophysical studies. We made use of an orientation-adaptation paradigm, in which we induced a tilt aftereffect by prolonged exposure to an oriented adaptor stimulus. Following this adaptation phase, a test stimulus was presented shortly before saccade onset. We found strong evidence for predictive remapping of the features of this test stimulus presented shortly before saccade onset, evidenced by a large tilt aftereffect elicited when the adaptor was positioned at the postsaccadic retinal location of the test stimulus. Conversely, the adaptation state itself, caused by the exposure to the adaptor stimulus, was not predictively remapped. Furthermore, we establish that predictive remapping also occurs for stimuli that are not saccade targets, pointing toward a forward remapping process operating across the whole visual field. Together, our findings suggest that predictive feature remapping of object information plays an important role in mediating visual stability."

This study aims to explore the influences of personal attitudes, facilities accessibility, and government stimulus on this discrepancy. Built on an integrated framework of Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Norm Activation Model (NAM), this study examines the relationship between intention and household waste sorting behaviour considering the psychological behavioural antecedents and circumstantial constraints among Chinese residents. Results from a questionnaire survey administered in China confirm the discrepancy, and show that the link between intention and behaviour on waste sorting is weakened after adding the influencing paths from the factors of facilities accessibility and government stimulus to waste sorting behaviour: however, the presence of these two factors directly promote waste sorting behaviour, but do not moderate the intention-behaviour relationship as their interaction items with behavioural intention are not significantly related to waste sorting behaviour. Furthermore, the personal norm is found to be the major factor influencing intentions of Chinese residents towards waste sorting while both subjective norms and perceived behavioural control were unexpectedly found to have no significant influence thereon. These findings are useful for promotion and planning of waste sorting by policy-makers to ease the waste disposal problem.",Properties of hydrochars derived from swine manure by CaO assisted hydrothermal carbonization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593003,Journal of environmental management,2019 01 26,"The hydrochars derived from swine manure were prepared by CaO assisted hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), and their properties were investigated for the first time. The results showed that the pH and yield of the hydrochar were largely increased by CaO addition. HTC of swine manure increased the phosphorus (P) content in the hydrochar, and appropriately 100% of P as apatite-P was enriched in the hydrochar by CaO assisted HTC. Additionally, the CaO addition during HTC improved the porosity of the hydrochar. The FTIR analysis revealed that substantial functional groups were present on the surface of the hydrochar, indicating the facilitated exchange between the hydrochar and hydrophilic soil when the hydrochar was used for soil amendment. This study demonstrated that CaO assisted HTC was a novel strategy to quickly convert swine manure to the promising soil amendment especially for acidic soils.",Regional fire scenarios in Spain: Linking landscape dynamics and fire regime for wildfire risk management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593002,Journal of environmental management,2019 01 26,"Fire scenarios are multiscale land-type planning units for a fire regime with different applications at national, regional, and local scales. The main aim of this research is to implement a methodology integrating landscape dynamics and wildfire risk from a context-specific approach, to identify current fire scenarios at a regional scale in the Spanish Central Mountain Range. These homogeneous areas are linked to different stages of a territorial dynamics model called wildfire generations and related to land use diversity and land management trends. A place-based methodology has been developed to characterize fire scenarios using Geographic Information Systems and statistical analysis, resulting in analytical and diagnostic mapping that can be used as a decision support tool for spatial planning and wildfire risk management. Its implementation has led to the delimitation of 91 discrete geographic units in the Central Mountain Range, classified according to wildfire generations and land use-land cover criteria. In conclusion, the fire scenarios concept is a potential approach to manage uncertainty by moving from the operational level of fire suppression to the strategic level of integrated fire management.",Inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase attenuates psoriasis-like inflammation in mice through blockade of dendritic cell-Th17 inflammation axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593001,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 13,"Psoriasis is a debilitating autoimmune disease of the skin characterized by acanthosis and hyperkeratosis resulting from excessive growth of keratinocytes in the epidermis and inflammatory infiltrates in the dermis. Innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), perform a critical role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis by presenting inflammatory/costimulatory signals for differentiation of Th17 cells. Recent studies point to the involvement of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in inflammatory signaling cascade of DCs. However, it is yet to be determined whether SYK inhibition in DCs would lead to diminishment of psoriatic inflammation. Therefore, our study evaluated the effects of SYK inhibitor, R406 on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, expression of costimulatory/inflammatory molecules in DCs and their relationship with Th17/Treg cells. Our data show that R406 causes attenuation of IMQ-induced dermal inflammation as shown by reduction in ear/back skin thickness, acanthosis and myeloperoxidase activity. This was concurrent with reduction in inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in CD11c + DCs such as IL-6, IL-23, MHCII, and CD40. This favoured the suppression of Th17 cells and upregulation of Treg cells in R406-treated mice with psoriasis-like inflammation. Direct activation of TLR7 by IMQ in splenocytic cultures led to increased SYK expression in CD11c + DCs and release of IL-23/IL-6. IMQ-induced IL-6/IL-23 levels were significantly diminished by SYK inhibitor, R406 in splenocytic cultures. In essence, our study shows that SYK inhibition supresses psoriasis-like inflammation by modifying DC function in mice. Further, it implies that SYK inhibition could be a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment of psoriasis-like inflammation.",The late embryogenesis abundant gene family in tea plant (Camellia sinensis): Genome-wide characterization and expression analysis in response to cold and dehydration stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593000,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a large and highly diverse family of polypeptides that play important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. At present, LEA gene families have been identified and systematically characterized in many plant species. However, the LEA gene family in tea plant has not been revealed, and the biological functions of the members of this family remain unknown. In this study, 33 CsLEA genes were identified from tea plant via a genome-wide study, and they were clustered into seven groups according to analyses of their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures and protein conserved motifs. In addition, expression analysis revealed that the CsLEA genes were specifically expressed in one or more tissues and significantly induced under cold and dehydration stresses, implying that CsLEA genes play important roles in tea plant growth, development and response to cold and dehydration stresses. Furthermore, a potential transcriptional regulatory network, including DREB/CBF, MYB, bZIP, bHLH, BPC and other transcription factors, is directly associated with the expression of CsLEA genes, which may be ubiquitous and important in the above mentioned processes. This study could help to increase our understanding of CsLEA proteins and their contributions to stress tolerance in tea plant.",The genetics and biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in fragrant rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592999,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for the majority of the world's population. Rice fragrance, aroma, or scent is not just a cooking quality, but also an eating quality of rice. Rice fragrance is a trait that is widely desired among rice consumers. Consequently, rice producers are sorting for rice cultivars with strong fragrance. High demand for fragrant rice cultivars has prompted rice breeders and researchers to investigate the genetics and the ways to improve fragrance in rice. It has been established by many researches that fgr gene on the chromosome 8 of rice controls its fragrance. As with other plants, rice contains BADH but because rice does not accumulate GB, a catalyst for BADH coding, BADH1 on chromosome 4 of rice and BADH2 on chromosome 8 of rice have been widely reported to be responsible for encoding BADH. badh2, a recessive allele of BADH2 has been confirmed to be responsible for fragrance in rice. badh2 and its alleles have been associated with the accumulation and synthesis of 2AP. Proline, ornithine, glutamate, methylglyoxal, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have all been identified as the precursors for the synthesis and accumulation of 2AP. By reviewing and summarising the main results of various researchers, we have been able to elucidate how various genes and metabolites influence 2AP accumulation in fragrant rice. It is our hope that this paper will be beneficial to researchers, who are working on the improvement of rice fragrance.",Urban-rural variation in the socioeconomic determinants of opioid overdose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592998,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 25,"Prescription opioid overdose (POD) and heroin overdose (HOD) rates have quadrupled since 1999.

Prior work has linked reduced interhemispheric executive control network (ECN) coupling with poor executive function, shorter time to relapse, and greater substance use. Lower structural connectivity between a key ECN hub, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the dorsal striatum (DS) also contributes to less efficient cognitive control recruitment, and reduced intrahemispheric connectivity between these regions has been associated with smoking relapse. Therefore, sex differences were probed by evaluating interhemispheric ECN and intrahemispheric DLPFC-DS connectivity. To assess the potential sex by nicotine interaction, a pilot sample of non-smokers was evaluated following acute nicotine and placebo administration.",Distribution of radionuclides in moss-lichen cover and needles on the same grounds of landscape-climatic zones of Siberia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592996,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 01 31,"The radiation status of the landscape and climatic zones of Siberia at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries is characterized using bioindicators/biomonitors: lichens, mosses, and needles, according to the results obtained at the sites of their joint growth. The maximal activity of 137Cs in these components is observed in the forest-tundra landscaped zone, polluted during the period of nuclear tests from the nuclear test site ""Novaya Zemlya"" and also due to slow migration of these elements to the soil under the arctic conditions. In the southern territories the specific activity of radiocesium in the moss-lichen cover and needles of conifers corresponds to the regional background, in the forest-tundra zone it sometimes exceeds it, but in general does not pose a threat to human health. Determined differences in the contents of radioactive elements in lichens and mosses that grow together on sites in different landscape zones of Siberia statistically not significant within one or two standard deviations, and recorded only in the range of 3ϭ at the level of significance 0.05. Specificity of radionuclide distribution in lichens, mosses and needles (differences for epigeals and epiphytic lichens; different species selected at one site, annual and perennial needles, etc.) made it possible to identify the causes of variations in their activities in different zones, along with landscape features of these zones. In the needles of conifers potassium concentration exceeds the content in lichens, at lower levels of thorium and 137Cs.

The aim of this study was to perform an analytical validation of automated assays of the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and uric acid as antioxidant biomarkers and of the advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant biomarkers in saliva samples of sheep, and to evaluate their possible changes after stress induced by shearing. All assays produced acceptable results in the analytical validation, from which it can be concluded that oxidative stress biomarkers such as FRAP, CUPRAC, TEAC, uric acid and AOPP and H2O2 can be measured in sheep saliva. In addition, acute stress due to shearing could produce an oxidative stress response in sheep and subsequently increase antioxidants in order to protect cells from damage."

However, after reaching the damaged tissue, DDSs should present a trigger release of the encaged therapeutics. Among all methodologies for a controlled release system, the use of light in NIR window (650-900 nm) shows the most appropriate characteristics for biological applications (e.g. biocompatibility with tissues). This review is focused on NIR responsive approaches for DDSs intermediated by a photosensitizer (PS) using nanoparticles (NP) that possess oxidation sensitive segments. After excited by light, the PS generates singlet oxygen species which interact with a sensitive segment, causing bond cleavage or hydrophobicity change in NP followed by the release of entrapped therapeutics. The most relevant sensitive segments addressed in this work are: olefin (lipid, vinyl ether, vinyl disulfide, and aminoacrylate), thioketal, selenium and hydrophobicity changeable polymers (tellurium, poly(propylene sulfide), imidazole and nitroimidazole). The chemical structure of the sensitive segment, the available strategies for nanoparticle formation and DDSs in vitro and in vivo studies are also critically discussed. These NIR responsive DDSs have enormous potential as a tool for a controlled spatial-temporal drug release with capacity to overcome the drawbacks of the others specificity target DDSs (such as pH, temperature and ROS).

Standard PCR primers targeting numerous SNP locations were initially designed in silico, modified to be RNase H2-compatible, and then optimized by laboratory testing. Optimization often required repeated cycling through variations in primer design, assay conditions, reagent concentrations and selection of alternative SNP targets. The final rhPCR assay uses 28 independent rhPCR reactions to target 14 DNA bases that can distinguish 15 possible lineages and sub-lineages of SH. On evaluation, the assay correctly identified the 12 lineages and sub-lineages represented in a panel of 75 diverse SH strains. Non-specific amplicons were observed in 160 (15.2%) of the 1050 reactions, but due to their low intensity did not compromise assay performance. Furthermore, in silico analysis of 500 closed genomes from 103 Salmonella serovars and laboratory rhPCR testing of five prevalent Salmonella serovars including SH indicated the assay can identify Salmonella isolates as SH, since only SH isolates generated amplicons from all 14 target SNPs. The genotyping results can be fully correlated with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in silico. This fast and economical assay, which can identify SH isolates and classify them into related or unrelated lineages and sub-lineages, has potential applications in outbreak identification, source attribution and microbial source tracking.",Molecular features associated with the adaptive evolution of Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) in Chile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592977,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 04,"Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an Orthomyxovirus challenging salmon production, with a particular impact in Chile. During 2007-2010 a devastating and of unexpected consequences epizootic event almost destroyed a blooming industry in the country. The event was caused by an aggressive variant with a distinctive deletion in Segment 6, one of the eight genomic segments of the virus. After the outburst, although the infective viral variant seemed to have disappeared, a non-infective variant, not previously reported, was discovered and is characterized by a complete, non-deleted coding segment 6, which has prevailed in the fish population until now. This variant, known as HPR0, appears to be the ancestor strain of ISAV from which novel infective variants are generated. Additional variations in segment 5 have also been associated with the virulence observed in the field, an analysis of the differences in these two protein coding segments has been performed. It appears to us that a combinatorial effect exists between the features displayed by segments 5 and 6 which modulate the intensity of viral outbursts.

Specifically, because neuroinflammation is a driver of secondary injury after TBI, we hypothesized that both glial activation and inflammatory signaling are associated with acute CBF and, by extension, with long-term cognitive outcome after rmTBI. To test this hypothesis, cortical CBF was non-invasively measured in anesthetized mice 4 h after 3 repetitive closed head injuries spaced once-daily, at which time brains were collected. Right hemispheres were fixed for immunohistochemical staining for glial activation markers Iba1 and GFAP while left hemispheres were used to quantify Iba1 and GFAP expression via Western blot as well as 32 cytokines and 21 phospho-proteins in the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB pathways using a Luminex multiplexed immunoassay. N = 8/7 injured/sham C57/black-6 adult male mice were studied. Within the injured group, CBF inversely correlated with Iba1 expression (R = -0.86, p < .01). Further, partial least squares regression analysis revealed significant correlations between CBF and expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including RANTES and IL-17. Finally, within the injured group, phosphorylation of specific signals in the MAPK and NF-κB intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., p38 MAPK and NF-κB) were significantly positively correlated with Iba1. In total, our data indicate that acute cerebral blood flow after rmTBI is a biomarker of underlying neuroinflammatory pathology.",Diving responses elicited by nasopharyngeal irrigation mimic seizure-associated central apneic episodes in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592975,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 16,"The spread of epileptic seizure activity to brainstem respiratory and autonomic regions can elicit episodes of obstructive apnea and of central apnea with significant oxygen desaturation and bradycardia. Previously, we argued that central apneic events were not consequences of respiratory or autonomic activity failure, but rather an active brainstem behavior equivalent to the diving response resulting from seizure spread. To test the similarities of spontaneous seizure-associated central apneic episodes to evoked diving responses, we used nasopharyngeal irrigation with either cold water or mist for 10 or 60 s to elicit the diving response in urethane-anesthetized animals with or without kainic acid-induced seizure activity. Diving responses included larger cardiovascular changes during mist stimuli than during water stimuli. Apneic responses lasted longer than 10 s in response to 10 s stimuli or about 40 s in response to 60 s stimuli, and outlasted bradycardia. Repeated 10 s mist applications led to an uncoupling of the apneic episodes (which always occurred) from the bradycardia (which became less pronounced with repetition). These uncoupled events matched the features of observed spontaneous seizure-associated central apneic episodes. The duration of spontaneous central apneic episodes correlated with their frequency, i.e. longer events occurred when there were more events. Based on our ability to replicate the properties of seizure-associated central apneic events with evoked diving responses during seizure activity, we conclude that seizure-associated central apnea and the diving response share a common neural basis and may reflect an attempt by brainstem networks to protect core physiology during seizure activity.",Astrocytic mobilization of glutathione peroxidase-1 contributes to the protective potential against cocaine kindling behaviors in mice via activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592974,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 01 14,"Compelling evidence indicates that oxidative stress contributes to cocaine neurotoxicity. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of the glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in cocaine-induced kindling (convulsive) behaviors in mice. Cocaine-induced convulsive behaviors significantly increased GPx-1, p-IkB, and p-JAK2/STAT3 expression, and oxidative burdens in the hippocampus of mice. There was no significant difference in cocaine-induced p-IkB expression between non-transgenic (non-TG) and GPx-1 overexpressing transgenic (GPx-1 TG) mice, but significant differences were observed in cocaine-induced p-JAK2/STAT3 expression and oxidative stress between non-TG and GPx-1 TG mice. Cocaine-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-labeled astrocytic level was significantly higher in the hippocampus of GPx-1 TG mice. Triple-labeling immunocytochemistry indicated that GPx-1-, p-STAT3-, and GFAP-immunoreactivities were co-localized in the same cells. AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor, but not pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate, an NFκB inhibitor, significantly counteracted GPx-1-mediated protective potentials (i.e., anticonvulsant-, antioxidant-, antiapoptotic-effects). Genetic overexpression of GPx-1 significantly attenuated proliferation of Iba-1-labeled microglia induced by cocaine in mice. However, AG490 or astrocytic inhibition (by GFAP antisense oligonucleotide and α-aminoadipate) significantly increased Iba-1-labeled microglial activity and M1 phenotype microglial mRNA levels, reflecting that proinflammatory potentials were mediated by AG490 or astrocytic inhibition. This microglial activation was less pronounced in GPx-1 TG than in non-TG mice. Furthermore, either AG490 or astrocytic inhibition significantly counteracted GPx-1-mediated protective potentials. Therefore, our results suggest that astrocytic modulation between GPx-1 and JAK2/STAT3 might be one of the underlying mechanisms for protecting against convulsive neurotoxicity induced by cocaine.",Can the Toll-like receptors 4 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells help assess the effectiveness of immunosuppression and the chance of a future good renal transplant function?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592973,Transplant immunology,2019 03 27,A small percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) circulating during the kidney transplantation (KT) period remain in the blood long after transplantation.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that neural responses in higher-order visual cortex are shaped by object categories, task context, and spatiotemporal regularities. Beyond these properties, visual processing in the ventral pathway has been shown to be tightly linked to perceptual awareness, while the evidence regarding dorsal visual processing and awareness is mixed. Most previous studies targeting the dorsal pathway have used dichotomous ""visible versus invisible"" experimental designs and interocular suppression paradigms to modulate stimulus visibility. In this fMRI study, we sought to investigate category-selective processing of faces and tools in the ventral and dorsal visual streams as a function of parametric stimulus degradation by noise. Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics provide strong evidence for a linear relationship between category-selective processing and stimulus information in both visual pathways. Overall, multivariate category decoding accuracies turned out to be lower in the dorsal pathway. We discuss our results within the context of the emerging notion of highly interconnected visual streams, and provide an outlook on how future studies may help to further refine our understanding of the functional role of the dorsal pathway in visual object processing.",Sildenafil treatment of vascular dementia in aged rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592970,Neurochemistry international,2019 06 16,"and purpose: In this study, we employed a multiple microinfarction (MMI) based vascular dementia (VaD) model in aged rats and tested the therapeutic effects of Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, on cognitive decline, white matter damage, autophagy and inflammatory response associated with VaD."

Monitoring the health of the wild population depends upon reference intervals that are context specific; hence we developed reference intervals from fresh samples, as opposed to frozen, from wild monk seals. This study builds on the number of parameters from previous efforts by using samples collected between 2004 and 2015 from wild monk seals. Blood samples were analyzed by a single veterinary diagnostic laboratory within 24 hr of collection from apparently healthy, wild seals during research activities. Reference intervals were determined based on the analytical steps outlined by the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology. These comprehensive hematology and serum chemistry reference intervals enable more consistent and systematic interpretation of results, which will guide individual and population-level health assessment and decision-making research and recovery activities.",DISSEMINATED OSSEOUS METAPLASIA OF THE VENTRAL SCALES OF A GRAY-BANDED KINGSNAKE ( LAMPROPELTIS ALTERNA).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592934,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"A 22-yr-old, female gray-banded kingsnake ( Lampropeltis alterna) was examined for stomatitis and hard ventral scales. On examination, the ventral scales palpated as rigid and brittle. A blood sample yielded marked hypovitaminosis D (11 nmol/L). Radiographs revealed a generalized bone radiopacity outlining the ventral scales; scale biopsies were obtained for histologic examination and presented linear, superficial, and midzonal foci of well-differentiated dermal bone and bone marrow. The stomatitis was successfully treated, but the general condition of the snake declined, and it was euthanized. The most significant finding in the postmortem examination was abnormally pale kidneys. Histologic examination revealed diffuse renal gout and diffuse osseous metaplasia in the dermis of all of the ventral scales. Generalized osseous metaplasia of the ventral scales in snakes has not, to our knowledge, been reported; the cause in this report was not identified, but given the extensiveness of the lesion, it is likely that the cause was multifactorial.",FERLAVIRUS-RELATED DEATHS IN A COLLECTION OF VIPERID SNAKES.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592933,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Between June and October 2013, 26 snakes of six viperid species kept in two adjoining rooms died ( n = 16) or were euthanized on medical (1) or welfare grounds (9). Two were from the main zoo collection, but the other 24 had been imported and quarantined for a minimum of 6 mo. Four of those that died and the single snake euthanized on medical grounds showed minor signs of respiratory disease prior to death, and five were weak, lethargic, and/or poor feeders. Frequent postmortem findings among all snakes were poor body condition (18) and respiratory disease (13). Seventeen cases were examined histologically, and pneumonia, sometimes with air sacculitis and/or tracheitis, was present in 15 individuals. Lung samples from 24 snakes were ferlavirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive, and one of the two snakes for which only liver was available was also positive. The negative liver sample was from a snake that died of sepsis following anesthesia for surgical removal of a spindle cell sarcoma. Correlation with antemortem PCR testing of glottal and cloacal swabs in five cases was poor (sensitivity = 40%). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ferlaviruses on the tissues of 13 PCR-positive cases showed positive labeling in 7 only. Tissues samples from 22 ferlavirus PCR-positive snakes were examined for Chlamydia species by PCR, and 9 were positive, although DNA sequencing only confirmed two of three tested as Chlamydia pneumoniae. Immunohistochemistry for Chlamydia pneumoniae of seven cases (two Chlamydiales PCR positive, one of which was sequenced as C. pneumoniae, plus five negative) confirmed the Chlamydia PCR results. These two Chlamydiales PCR and IHC positive snakes were ferlavirus PCR positive, but IHC negative suggesting that, even though a ferlavirus was the predominant cause of the outbreak, in a few cases death may have been due to chlamydiosis with ferlavirus present, but not acting as the primary pathogen.",TRANSMISSION OF PTERYGODERMATITES NYCTICEBI IN A COLONY OF GOELDI'S MONKEYS ( CALLIMICO GOELDII) AND EVALUATION OF TREATMENT AND CONTROL.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592931,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Over a 2-yr period, four Goeldi's monkeys ( Callimico goeldii) died in a private zoo due to infections with the spirurid nematode Pterygodermatites nycticebi. Therapeutic measures with different anthelmintics were not successful. Due to the severe consequences caused by these infections, different actions were initiated, including sanitation measures and controlling of potential intermediate hosts (coprophagous arthropods). To identify possible intermediate hosts, arthropod species detected in the enclosure-parasite-free German cockroaches ( Blattella germanica), European earwigs ( Forficula auricularia), and rough woodlice ( Porcellio scaber)-were experimentally fed with feces of monkeys with patent P. nycticebi infections, resulting in established infections with third-stage larvae (L3) in roaches and earwigs. Furthermore, spiruroid L3 were detectable in 43% of the roaches and 30% of earwigs caught at the zoo. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of eggs, larval, and adult stages resulted in identical results, confirming the establishment of the parasite's life cycle in the zoo. This is the first documentation of the vector capacity of the European earwigs for P. nycticebi. As a measure of sanitation, a large part of the enclosure was emptied and cleaned. The Goeldi's monkeys were quarantined and treated with levamisole (7.5 mg/kg sc twice in intervals of 2 wk). Repeated coprologic examinations by zinc chloride flotation were undertaken. After the levamisole therapy, eggs were not found in the feces for 3 mo. However, shortly after resettling the monkeys into the sanitized enclosure, reshedding of small amounts of spirurid eggs was observed, whereupon deworming with levamisole was prescribed several times per year. The sanitation measures and the elimination of the intermediate hosts in a natural enclosure are presented as an example of the long-term controlling of the parasites.",COMPARISON OF TRANSCUTANEOUS ULTRASOUND AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY SIZE AND EVALUATION OF ADRENAL GLAND SIZE USING ULTRASOUND IN A COLONY OF CALLIMICOS ( CALLIMICO GOELDII).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592929,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Both kidney and adrenal gland disease have been identified in callimicos ( Callimico goeldii).

The wave forms were analyzed in all leads at 50 mm/sec and at 10 mm = 1 mV to determine PR, QRS, ST, and QT durations and P, net QRS complex, and T amplitudes. The polarity of each wave form was tabulated in all leads. The mean electrical axis for the frontal plane, calculated using leads II and III, was mostly negative in two species (-43 ± 28.0° in golden and -92 ± 10.0° in silver pheasant). The P wave was predominantly positive in most of the leads. The pattern of wave forms of the QRS complexes were different (Rs, QS, rS, R, RS, QR, qR). The T wave was almost positive in leads I, II, III, and aVF. The heart rates of the birds were mean (± SD) of 320 ± 36 beats/min (golden) and 314 ± 31 beats/min (silver). Description of normal electrocardiogram parameters will facilitate a better understanding of electrocardiogram changes of unhealthy birds.","EFFECTS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL ETORPHINE DOSE ON PULMONARY ARTERY PRESSURE AND CARDIAC OUTPUT IN IMMOBILIZED, BOMA-HABITUATED WHITE RHINOCEROS ( CERATOTHERIUM SIMUM): A PRELIMINARY STUDY.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592907,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"The effects of etorphine on the pulmonary vascular system of white rhinoceros ( Ceratotherium simum) have not been described and could play a role in the severe hypoxemia that develops after immobilization with etorphine-based drug combinations. Characterization of these effects requires measurement of pulmonary vascular pressures and cardiac output (CO). To refine a technique for pulmonary arterial catheterization, five boma-habituated white rhinoceros (three females and two males weighing 1,012-1,572 kg) were immobilized by remote injection with etorphine plus azaperone followed by butorphanol. This afforded the opportunity to perform a pilot study and acquire preliminary measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and CO before and after supplemental etorphine given intravenously. Ultrasonographic guidance was used to insert a sheath introducer into a linguofacial branch of a jugular vein. A 160-cm-long pulmonary artery catheter with a balloon and thermistor was then passed through the introducer and positioned with its tip in the pulmonary artery. It was not long enough to permit wedging for measurement of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Mean PAP was 35 mm Hg (minimum, maximum 32, 47 mm Hg) and increased ( P = 0.031) by 83% (28, 106%) after supplemental etorphine. Thermodilution CO was 120 L/min (92, 145 L/min) and increased 27% (3, 43%) ( P = 0.031). Heart rate was 100 (88, 112) beats/min and increased 20% (4, 45%) ( P = 0.031), whereas arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 35 mm Hg (30, 94 mm Hg) and decreased 47% (20, 72%) ( P = 0.031). The cardiovascular observations could result from etorphine-induced generalized sympathetic outflow, as has been reported in horses. Further studies of etorphine in isolation are needed to test this suggestion and to discern how the changes in pulmonary vascular pressures and blood flow might relate to hypoxemia in etorphine-immobilized white rhinoceros.","SERUM BIOCHEMISTRY VALUES AND SELECT SEROLOGIC SCREENING OF BROWN HYENAS ( PARAHYAENA BRUNNEA) FROM THE NAMIB DESERT, NAMIBIA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592906,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Blood from 30 free-ranging brown hyenas ( Parahyaena brunnea) was collected for biochemical analysis and select serologic screening in Namibia from 1997 to 2010. Age was found to have an influence on several biochemical parameters that may be related to growth, a developing immune system, and differences in diet. Seasonal differences in diet of coastal brown hyenas also had an overall significant effect on lipemia values, and differences in stress due to varying capture methods could be associated with an increase in glucose and creatinine kinase. Comparisons among hyena species from published data were inconclusive, as some samples may have been derived from captive populations and individuals. Sera were tested for antibodies against 18 pathogens. Antibodies were not detected for most pathogens, but the proportion of sera containing antibodies against canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) and canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) was 65% and 84%, respectively. There was no effect of sex, age, year of sampling, or contact with domestic dogs, indicating that CAV-1 or CAV-2 may be enzootic. The prevalence of antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV) was 43%, and older brown hyenas were 6.9 times more likely to have been exposed to CDV, adjusting for year of sampling and degree of estimated contact with domestic dogs, suggesting epizootic outbreaks. This study is the first to present biochemical reference intervals for wild brown hyenas and provides an indication of disease exposure in this species.",FIRST MOLECULAR DETECTION OF ANAPLASMA PHAGOCYTOPHILUM IN DROMEDARIES ( CAMELUS DROMEDARIUS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592905,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects a wide variety of wild and domestic animals and causes an emerging zoonotic tick-borne disease. There are no available data regarding the presence of A. phagocytophilum in camels ( Camelus dromedarius). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of A. pagocytophilum in Iranian camels. Whole blood of 207 camels from five geographical regions of Iran was tested for A. phagocytophilum using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, and specific nested PCR based on 16S rRNA. The overall prevalence of infection in tested animals was 34.2% (71/207). Sex was not identified as a risk factor for A. phagocytophilum infection, but analysis revealed significant differences in age and region. In conclusion, Iranian camels can be potential reservoirs for A. phagocytophilum, and Iran must be considered an enzootic area for this infection as indicated by the high subclinical infection rate in camels.",UROLITH PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS IN ASIAN SMALL-CLAWED OTTERS ( AONYX CINEREUS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592904,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Uroliths (urinary stones) are routinely found in both domestic and exotic animals kept under human care. In zoos, Asian small-clawed otters (ASCOs, Aonyx cinereus) have been identified as being particularly prone to this disease. Risk factors are thought to be nutritional; however, recommendations contradict each other, depending on which physiological model was used. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of uroliths in ASCOs under human care and to evaluate which feeding patterns and nutrients may be linked to their occurrence. Questionnaires were sent to zoos holding ASCOs in North America (AZA), Europe (EAZA), and Japan and Southeast Asia (Asia) asking about diets and medical histories of all ASCOs alive or dead within the last 10 yr. A risk-factor style binary logistic regression was conducted on these data. A total of 94 questionnaires were received; however, only 56 were usable (15.6% return rate), representing 161 otter cases. AZA had the significantly highest incidence of kidney stones (62.8%), followed by EAZA (12.9%) and Asia (9.4%). Age and calcium were risk factors, whereas crude protein and sodium were protective. Therefore, calcium may need to be controlled within their diet. A diet high in fish and crustaceans may be beneficial and is consistent with wild ASCO diets. The feline model may be the best choice out of other models; however, many factors cannot be compared with ASCO, such as urinary pH.",SEASONAL VARIATION OF SERUM 25-HYDROXY-VITAMIN D IN TWO CAPTIVE EASTERN BLACK RHINOCEROS ( DICEROS BICORNIS MICHAELI) HOUSED IN A NORTH AMERICAN ZOO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592903,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,2019 05 20,"Black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis spp.) are critically endangered species, with less than 65 individual animals housed in captivity within Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited zoos within the United States, and an estimated 5,500 individual animals of all subspecies surviving in the wild. Previously published reference values for circulating vitamin D3 (25OHD3; 55.7 ± 34.2 ng/ml) were based upon samples from free-ranging black rhinoceros in Africa. Recent research in human medicine has highlighted the importance of subclinical vitamin D deficiency, with links to increased risks for developing various health conditions. Serum samples collected opportunistically from two captive Eastern black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis michaeli) housed with seasonal access outdoors in a North American zoo were tested for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels over a 3-yr period. A commercially prepared pelleted diet containing vitamin D3 was fed to both rhinos. This study correlates environmental ultraviolet (UV) index, dietary supplementation, and seasonal serum 25OHD levels to compare with known 25OHD3 levels in free-ranging African black rhinoceros. Results in these two individuals suggest that D. bicornis spp. are dependent upon sunlight or UVB for measurable circulating 25OHD, and that current vitamin D3 supplementation levels may have little effect for Diceros spp. in human care housed in northern latitudes.",Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Biomarkers and Their Interpretation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592902,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2019 05 15,"The pathology and impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from an abnormal inflammatory process resulting in tissue damage with ineffective repair in response to toxic inhalants (especially cigarette smoke). Identification of mechanisms provides the opportunity to develop new therapies and a personalized approach to management. The collection of multiple genetic and detailed biochemical data from small and large patient cohorts has led to an explosion of studies investigating biomarkers to achieve these aims. Despite widespread enthusiasm and many statistically significant associations, the interpretation of COPD biomarker results requires thought and leaves many questions unanswered. The present review assesses the importance of these associations, whether they represent cause or effect, reflect disease severity or activity, the complexity of the pathway to the final pathogenic and hence interventional step, and problems with interpreting cross-sectional studies without knowing individual disease trajectories. The complexity of biomarker specificity without sufficient clinical phenotype and endotype information contributes to problems of interpretation. A strategic change is needed to develop useful COPD biomarkers; this includes focusing on endotype biomarkers within specific clinical phenotypes, biomarkers in early COPD, exacerbation subtype biomarkers, and biomarkers to predict or measure drug effects.",Muscle sympathetic nerve activity and hemodynamic responses to venous distension: does sex play a role?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592900,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 03 06,"Peripheral venous distension mechanically stimulates type III/IV sensory fibers in veins and evokes pressor and sympathoexcitatory reflex responses in humans. As young women have reduced venous compliance and impaired sympathetic transduction, we tested the hypothesis that pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses to venous distension may be attenuated in women compared with men. Mean arterial pressure (photoplethysmography), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV; Modelflow), cardiac output (CO = HR × SV), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), femoral artery blood flow, and femoral artery conductance (Doppler ultrasound) were quantified in eight men (27 ± 4 yr) and nine women (28 ± 4 yr) before [control (CON)], during (INF), and immediately after (post-INF) a local infusion of saline [5% of the total forearm volume (30 ml/min); the infusion time was 2 ± 1 and 1 ± 1 min ( P = 0.0001) for men and women, respectively] through a retrograde catheter inserted into an antecubital vein, to which venous drainage and arterial supply had been occluded. Mean arterial pressure increased during and after infusion in both groups (vs. the CON group, P < 0.05), but women showed a smaller pressor response in the post-INF period (Δ+7.2 ± 2.0 vs. Δ+18.3 ± 3.9 mmHg in men, P = 0.019). MSNA increased and femoral artery conductance decreased similarly in both groups (vs. the CON group, P < 0.05) at post-INF. Although HR changes were similar, increases in SV (Δ+20.4 ± 8.6 vs. Δ+2.6 ± 2.7 ml, P = 0.05) and CO (Δ+0.84 ± 0.17 vs. Δ+0.34 ± 0.10 l/min, P = 0.024) were greater in men compared with women. Therefore, venous distension evokes a smaller pressor response in young women due to attenuated cardiac adjustments rather than reduced venous compliance or sympathetic transduction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that the pressor response to venous distension was attenuated in young women compared with age-matched men. This was due to attenuated cardiac adjustments rather than reduced venous compliance, sympathetic activation, or impaired transduction and vascular control. Collectively, these findings suggest that an attenuated venous distension reflex could be involved in orthostatic intolerance in young women.",Differentiating compensatory mechanisms associated with low tolerance to central hypovolemia in women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592899,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 02 27,"Women generally display lower tolerance to acute central hypovolemia than men. The measurement of compensatory reserve (CRM) is a novel metric that provides information about the sum total of all mechanisms that together work to compensate for the relative blood volume deficit. Hemodynamic decompensation occurs with depletion of the CRM (i.e., 0% CRM). In the present study, we hypothesized that the lower tolerance to progressive central hypovolemia reported in women can be explained by a faster reduction rate in CRM compared with men rather than sex differences in absolute integrated compensatory responses. Continuous, noninvasive measures of CRM were collected from 208 healthy volunteers (107 men and 85 women) who underwent progressive stepwise central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure to the point of presyncope. Comparisons revealed shorter ( P < 0.01) times in female participants compared with male participants to reach 30% and 0% CRM. Similarly, the lower body negative pressure level, represented by the cumulative stress index, was less at 30% and 0% CRM in women compared with men ( P < 0.01). Changes in hemodynamic responses and frequency-domain data (oscillations in cerebral blood flow velocity and mean arterial blood pressure) were similar between men and women at 0% CRM ( P > 0.05). We conclude that compensatory responses to central hypovolemia in women were similar to men but were depleted at a faster rate compared with men. The earlier depletion of the compensatory reserve in women appears to be influenced by failure to maintain adequate cerebral oxygen delivery. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We compared hemodynamic and metabolic responses in men and women to experimentally controlled reductions in central blood volume at physiologically equivalent levels of compensatory reserve. We corroborated previous findings that females have lower tolerance to central hypovolemia than males but demonstrated for the first time that compensatory responses are similar. Our findings suggest lower tolerance to central hypovolemia in women results from reaching critical cerebral delivery of oxygen faster than men."

However, an important factor that remains outside the field of view of researchers is the ethnicity of the patient, which is an important element in the development of a personalized approach in the treatment and prevention of diseases. In connection with this, the purpose of this study was to study the changes in the lipid peroxidation-antioxidant defense processes in adolescent Mongoloids with exogenously constitutional obesity complicated by fatty hepatosis. 18 adolescent boys with fatty hepatosis were examined on the background of exogenous-constitutional obesity of the first degree; 38 adolescent boys with exogenously constitutional obesity without changes in the liver and 37 practically healthy adolescents (control group). All subjects surveyed for ethnicity belonged to the Mongoloids. Spectrophotometric and fluorometric methods were used in the research. The results of the study indicated a high intensity of lipid peroxidation reactions in Mongoloid boys with obesity and fatty hepatosis relative to control values: an increase in blood plasma content of compounds with unsaturated double bonds (p<0.001), diene conjugates (p=0.0012), ketodienes and conjugated trienes (p<0.0001), in the absence of significant differences in the level of TBA-active products.

The pronounced insufficiency of fatsoluble vitamins - α-tocopherol and retinol in patients of the main group was also noted in comparison with patients without morphological changes in the liver. Thus, in teenage Mongoloids with exogenously constitutional obesity and fatty hepatosis, it is possible to recommend antioxidant drugs in addition to basic metabolic therapy.",[Effects of quercetin on protective capacity in rats fed a high-fructose diet].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592885,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 04 18,"The purpose of the study was to determine effects of quercetin on protective capacity parameters in the experiment on rats fed a high fructose diet.

Consumption of the high-fructose diet led to changes in some parameters: diminution of AOA in blood plasma, decrease of AOA and MDA level, unsedimentable activity of lysosomal enzymes, increase of the UDP-GT activity in liver. The inclusion of quercetin in the diet did not affect the studied parameters, except for a more pronounced decrease of the unsedimentable activity of lysosomal enzymes in rat liver.

Currently there is no science-based regulation of radiation doses that would allow you to preserve the nutritional value of products, including antioxidant activity. Apples are the most accessible and widely distributed representative of fruit products in the consumer market of the country, characterized by a high content of antioxidants. The experimental material was investigated by a retrospective method. To confirm the fact of irradiation/non-irradiation, control samples of apples of different pomologic varieties (""Pink Lady"", ""Granny Smith"", ""Golden Delicess"", ""Gloster"") were identified on the consumer market using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The results of the study confirm that antioxidant content is due to the pomological belonging to a particular class and structure of the fruit (pulp or juice without pulp). The antioxidant activity (AOA) of freshly squeezed (untreated) juices, in contrast to the AOA of apples have lower rates and is lower for pomological variety ""Pink lady"" by 13.8%, for grade ""Granny Smith"" - by 22.0%, for the variety ""Golden delicious"" by 22.6% for class ""Gloucester"" by 23.0%, respectively. Studies have been conducted on the effect of various doses of ionizing radiation on antioxidant activity of fresh apples by potentiometric method using the K3[Fe(CN6)]/K4[Fe(CN6)] mediator system. Test samples of fresh apples were treated with ionizing radiation using a linear accelerator of electrons in doses from 1 to 12 kGy. AOA of experimental samples of fresh apples of pomological variety ""Pink Lady"" after irradiation with a dose of 12 kGy decreased by 4.5 fold compared with unirradiated samples, in apple varieties ""Granny Smith"" - by 2.9 fold, ""Golden delishes"" and ""Gloucester"" - by 3.1 fold, respectively. With an increase in irradiation dose of more than 3 kGy, the most intense decrease in antioxidant content occurs. A high correlation coefficient between the dose of irradiation and the content of antioxidants in the experimental samples of fresh apples of different pomologic varieties has been established - from 0.94 to 0.99. The obtained experimental data allow us to propose a limitation of the radiation dose to 3 kGy in order to preserve the antioxidant potential of fresh apples.",[Infant feeding in the rural area of Chuvash Republic and Nizhny Novgorod Region].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592881,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 04 18,"The nature of feeding in the first year of life affects the health of the child in all subsequent periods of life.

The study was carried out on the basis of three children's clinics in the Chuvash Republic and the Nizhny Novgorod region by random sampling using an anonymous questionnaire of women who had children aged 1 to 2 years living in the rural areas of the Chuvash Republic and the Nizhny Novgorod Region (140 and 60 women, respectively). According to our data, the absolute majority of women surveyed (96%) wished to feed their babies for at least 1 year. All infants (100%) after birth were attached to the chest, in the first 30 minutes - 62%, in later terms - 38%. Feeding the artificial formulas before the first application to the breast was used in nutrition of 26% of newborns. Exclusive breastfeeding for less than 4 months received 23% of babies, 4-6 months - 69%, 7 months - 8% of babies. The main reason for transferring infants to mixed and artificial feeding was hypogalactia. At the age of up to 6 months for mixed feeding 49% of babies were transferred, for artificial feeding - 16%. In most cases (69%), when signs of hypogalactia appeared no weighting was carried out, an independent transfer of the child to another type of feeding was observed in the same majority (65%) of cases. The choice of the mixture was carried out by the parents independently in 65% of cases, in other cases - on the recommendation of the pediatrician. In general, in most cases (66%), adapted mixtures were used in feeding the infants, cow milk (22%), goat milk (6%), and sour milk drinks (6%) were used from unadapted products.

The development of enteral mixtures produced on the basis of meat raw materials will allow leveling the problem of annoyance with the same product taste and extending an assortment of the supplied products for enteral nutrition. As a result of the experiments on the model and natural objects, the technology was developed for beef-based canned food intended for enteral nutrition of people in the post-operative period as well as in the conditions associated with appetite loss, mandibulofacial injuries, burning injury, chewing and swallowing impairments. The multi-component recipe modules balanced by fatty acid and amino acid composition, enriched with the vitamins and minerals were theoretically substantiated and realized. The minimal score was 0.99 unit fractions, coefficient of utility (0.83 unit fractions), coefficient of comparable redundancy 7.20 g/100 g protein. The obtained values of the balance criteria allow making a conclusion about approximation of the values to the physiologically necessary ratio. The correction of the fatty acid composition of the mixture models was carried out in order to increase the unsaturated fatty acid content by combination of meat fat with vegetable oils. The actual ratio of the fatty acid (SFA:MUFA:PUFA) in the product was 16.1:54.7:29.2, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA was 4:1. When designing the vitamin and mineral composition, the intensity of the thermal effect was taken into account. As a result, the doses for addition of vitamins were established with regard to their destruction during the technological process. Based on the performed research, the technology was developed for meat-containing canned food, adapted to the real conditions of the enterprises engaged in production of meat products for child nutrition. The product can be used as a basis or additional source of nutrition during the necessary period of nutritive support of patients.",[Using of specialized food for the workers with skin occupational eczema of perlite production].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592879,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 04 18,"The research was conducted with participation of the perlite production workers with professional eczema (165 people in the main group and 152 from the control group without skin pathology).

The dietary intake, including consumption of various types of liquid foods and beverages, was evaluated by the method of 24-hour recall in 280 athletes of high qualification (candidates for masters and masters of sports) of both gender of various sports during the training period. It has been established that the main drink of rehydration was drinking bottled water. Bottled water was consumed on average by 86% of athletes. It was consumed by 95-96% of sportsmen from the group of single combats and power kinds, whereas in other groups the share of water consumers was less - 67-79%. In second place in terms of percentage of consuming was tea. Consumption of sports drinks was observed only during training by athletes from the group of cyclic sports (31%) and single combat (11%). Calculating the per capita fluid intake of athletes who had 2 workouts a day showed that athletes from the martial arts group consumed the largest volumes of fluid in the mode of both training sessions as compared to representatives of other sports. Athletes of other sports consumed on average less liquid in the 2nd training mode compared to the 1st one. The total fluid intake during two training sessions was maximum in the group of martial arts and was minimum in the group of complex coordination sports. It should be specially noted a small proportion of athletes who consumed specialized sports drinks - only 17% of athletes and more than half of them - cyclical sportsmen. Consumption of liquid food outside training has been observed in 76% of athletes. The mean volume of consumed liquid products varied by the user from 382 and 437 ml in complex coordination and game sports up to 504-553 ml in other sports. The daily fluid intake was maximum (2326 ml) in athletes engaged in martial arts, minimum (1009 ml) - in athletes of complex coordination sports.",[Features of actual nutrition of the adult population in Republic of Buryatia in modern conditions].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592877,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 04 18,"Evaluation of the actual nutrition of the population of individual regions allows the development of targeted practical measures to improve nutrition, the structure of food consumption and appropriate recommendations to ensure optimal development and health status of a person. In order to study the nutrition of the adult population of the Republic of Buryatia, a retrospective analysis of the feeding structure data was conducted according to the data of the territorial department of the Federal State Statistics Service for the Republic of Buryatia, and the results obtained in the course of the questionnaire survey of 426 people (chosen by selective method with observance of representativeness) were analyzed. The data are presented obtained on the results of comparison with physiological needs in energy and nutrients for men and women in the most employable age of 30-39 years, having the third group of labor intensity. The structure of the food indicates its irrationality, which was confirmed by an increase in the consumption of food products with high content of saturated fats and added sugars, a decrease in the consumption of biologically valuable food products with high food density. In the product mix of the adult population of the republic, both among men and women, there was a lack of consumption of products from aquatic bioresources, vegetables, dairy products and eggs. At the same time, the consumption of bakery, flour-grinding products and potatoes in aggregate amounted to 120% of the recommended level. According to the results of the observation, 91.6% of the interviewed did not take into account the distribution of caloric intake by meals, in 50.8% the highest calorie intake was for dinner. Actual nutrition included elements that are risk factors for the development of endocrine pathology, disorders of the hormonal system and other metabolic diseases. There was a high level of energy intake for a number of years, which averaged 2891±43.6 kcal in men, 2407±38.4 in women, due to excess of fat and carbohydrates with a protein content of 82.4-87.3% of the recommended level. As a result, the problem of healthy nutrition, bringing the diet in line with the real physiological needs of a person requires serious systemic decisions in terms of organizing, systematizing and standardizing nutrition."

Dietary intake assessment was investigated using method of 24-hour recall. The analyzed sample consisted of 11 850 people. The criterion for not inclusion was people working in harmful working conditions and engaged in heavy physical labor. In each of the four age groups (12-17, 18-30, 31-45, 46-60 years), there were at least 150 subjects surveyed for each gender. It has been established that in all districts of Russia the level of consumption of total fats (33.2-38.8% of the energy value of the diet) was exceeded.

Optimal calcium intake in the childhood determines risk reduction of density loss and osteoporosis in the adulthood. This research explored contribution of different food sources, as well as eating occasions on calcium dietary intake among preschool and school children (4-13 years old). Mean daily Calcium intake and dairy products consumption depending on family income have been analyzed. Dietary intake was evaluated by 24-hour recall method. National food composition data tables have been used to estimate mean nutrient intake. Dairy products were classified in accordance with local food grouping system. Percent of children consuming products - sources of calcium, amount per consumer, contribution of eating occasions to Calcium intake, foods consumed at breakfast as well as Calcium intake and dairy products consumption depending on household income has been analysed. Nationally representative sample of preschool and school age children, Russia National Nutritional Survey, was conducted in all regions of Russia in 2013 by state Federal Statistics Service - Rosstat. Sample size was 22 771 children split in four age groups: 4-6 y.o. (n=7303), 7-8 y.o. (n=4391), 9-10 y.o. (n=4691) and 11-13 y.o. (n=6386). The study confirmed the indications in the domestic and foreign literature that calcium intake was insufficient in children aged 4-13 years. Data showed age related particularities in consumption of products-sources of Calcium: percent of children consuming milk and milk-based beverages, milk porridges, cottage cheese declined rapidly in older age groups in comparison to preschoolers. A slight increase of cheese consumption was shown in older age groups. Breakfast is an important eating occasion that provides a significant proportion (23-28%) into calcium daily intake in children. Habit of skipping breakfast puts calcium daily intake at risk as it is not compensated throughout the day at other eating occasions. Our results indicate lower daily Calcium intake in breakfast skippers (11-14% of children) compared with kids of the same age who had breakfast at the day of survey. Sweetened tea and coffee consumption increased in older age groups and contrary, a milk and milk based beverages consumption droped in school age. We found lower Calcium intake and lower accessibility to variety of Calcium food sources in low socio-economic class of the children population, where milk seems to be the main product from milk and dairy food group. The findings can assist in developing food-based recommendations for optimal intake of calcium in children's daily diet. Consumption of dairy products is required to meet adequate intake and to low down prevalence of inadequate intake. There is room for improvement of dairy product consumption in terms of variety and number of serving a day especially, for children in older age groups. More attention to be dedicated to breakfast as it is an important eating occasion that contributes significantly to calcium daily intake. Study findings call for intervention programs aiming to correct the inadequacies of calcium intake in schoolchildren's diets, including nutrition education for families and support for accessibility of the products rich in calcium by low socio-economic population groups; for example, by inclusion of milk and dairy products into the school feeding programs.","[Assessment of the sufficiency of Moscow population with folic acid, depending on the combined effect of polymorphism of MTHFR and FTO genes].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592864,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 04 18,"The results of assessing the sufficiency of folic acid of the residents of the Moscow region have been presented depending on rs1801133 MTHFR gene polymorphism and rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism.

Poor working conditions and occupational hazards play an important role in inducing metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. The objective of joint studies conducted by two Healthy Nutrition Centers located in the cities of Yekaterinburg and Moscow was to assess the diet and nutritional status of workers at two industrial enterprises of the Sverdlovsk Region. The total of 347 unrefined copper production workers (Plant 1) and 267 iron ore miners (Plant 2) were included in the study (the average age was 45.7±0.4 and 50.4±0.6 years, respectively). The study design envisaged a study of actual nutrition by a frequency method, anthropometric indices, total body composition by bio-impedancemetry, and nutritional status biomarkers using biochemical blood indices. The workers' diet was characterized by a high energy value (more than 2,500 kcal/day) with an excess of total and saturated fats (40.7-41.0 and 15.2-15.3% by the calorie content) as well as mono- and disaccharides (19.0-21.0% by the calorie content). Vitamins C and A consumption of the iron ore miners was 78% (p<0.01) and 27% (p<0.05) lower than that of the unrefined copper production workers, respectively. High (>1.0) waist to hip ratios were estimated in 28.5% of the workers. Obesity (BMI>25.0 kg/m2) was established in 36-42% of our subjects and the fat mass excess - in 81% of them. High serum concentrations of low-density lipoproteins were measured in 28 and 35% of the workers of both plants, respectively. The metabolic syndrome was identified in 27.0% of Plant 1 workers and in 44.2% of Plant 2 miners, whereas cardiovascular diseases were diagnosed in 25.9 and 56.5% of the workers, respectively.

In total 360 rats were used in the experiment (180 females and 180 males). Rats of the 1st control group received a diet with optimal (75% of the standard semisyntethic diet content) dosage of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and mineral substances, Fe3+ and Mg2+, the rats of the 2nd and the 3rd control group - diets with marginal (30% for males and 28% for females) and submarginal (19% for males and 18% for females) doses of essential micronutrients. Animals of the 1-3th experimental groups received Cd2+ on the background of optimal, marginal and submarginal providing of essential micronutrients. The hematological, biochemical and morphological parameters and the antioxidant status of rats have been studied. The obtained results allowed to identify patterns of cadmium toxic effect strengthen on the background of essential nutrients reducing (in the row from optimal to submarginal). These changes showed erythrocyte and platelet blood profiles, and a set of indicators of the antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation of blood and liver. Thus, the activity of erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes - glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in rats of the 1st experimental group were on average by 23% higher than in animals of the 1st control group, the rats of the 2nd and the 3rd experimental groups by 62 and 67% higher, respectively. The content of lipid peroxidation products in blood and liver of male and female rats showed a similar trend: an increase by 5% in the 1st experimental group by 9 and 25% in the 2nd and 3rd experimental groups respectively. Thus, the modification of the diets' vitamin-mineral composition may be used as a model of adaptive potential reduction in rats in the toxicological research of objects with unknown toxicity, in particular novel food products."

Although some of these disorders can be effectively treated with an antibody that inhibits complement C5, the high plasma concentration of C5 requires a huge dosage and frequent intravenous administration. Moreover, a conventional anti-C5 antibody can cause C5 to accumulate in plasma by reducing C5 clearance when C5 forms an immune complex (IC) with the antibody, which can be salvaged from endosomal vesicles by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. In order to neutralize the increased C5, an even higher dosage of the antibody would be required. This antigen accumulation can be suppressed by giving the antibody a pH-dependent C5-binding property so that C5 is released from the antibody in the acidic endosome and then trafficked to the lysosome for degradation, while the C5-free antibody returns back to plasma. We recently demonstrated that a pH-dependent C5-binding antibody, SKY59, exhibited long-lasting neutralization of C5 in cynomolgus monkeys, showing potential for subcutaneous delivery or less frequent administration. Here we report the details of the antibody engineering involved in generating SKY59, from humanizing a rabbit antibody to improving the C5-binding property. Moreover, because the pH-dependent C5-binding antibodies that we first generated still accumulated C5, we hypothesized that the surface charges of the ICs partially contributed to a slow uptake rate of the C5-antibody ICs. This idea motivated us to engineer the surface charges of the antibody. Our surface-charge engineered antibody consequently exhibited a high capacity to sweep C5 and suppressed the C5 accumulation in vivo by accelerating the cycle of sweeping: uptake of ICs into cells, release of C5 from the antibody in endosomes, and salvage of the antigen-free antibody. Thus, our engineered anti-C5 antibody, SKY59, is expected to provide significant benefits for patients with complement-mediated disorders.",View specific generalisation effects in face recognition: Front and yaw comparison views are better than pitch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592761,PloS one,2019 05 20,"It can be difficult to recognise new instances of an unfamiliar face. Recognition errors in this particular situation appear to be viewpoint dependent with error rates increasing with the angular distance between the face views. Studies using front views for comparison have shown that recognising faces rotated in yaw can be difficult and that recognition of faces rotated in pitch is more challenging still. Here we investigate the extent to which viewpoint dependent face recognition depends on the comparison view. Participants were assigned to one of four different comparison view groups: front, ¾ yaw (right), ¾ pitch-up (above) or ¾ pitch-down (below). On each trial, participants matched their particular comparison view to a range of yaw or pitch rotated test views. Results showed that groups with a front or ¾ yaw comparison view had superior overall performance and more successful generalisation to a broader range of both pitch and yaw test views compared to groups with pitch-up or pitch-down comparison views, both of which had a very restricted generalisation range. Regression analyses revealed the importance of image similarity between views for generalisation, with a lesser role for 3D face depth. These findings are consistent with a view interpolation solution to view generalisation of face recognition, with front and ¾ yaw views being most informative.",Pre-stroke surgery is not beneficial to normotensive rats undergoing sixty minutes of transient focal cerebral ischemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592760,PloS one,2019 05 28,"Experimental stroke in rodents, via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), can be associated with a negative impact on wellbeing and mortality. In hypertensive rodents, pre-stroke craniotomy increased survival and decreased body weight loss post-MCAO. Here we determined the effect, in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats following 60 minutes MCAO, with or without pre-surgical craniotomy, on post-stroke outcomes in terms of weight loss, neurological deficit, lesion volume and functional outcomes. There was no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on indicators of wellbeing including survival rate (P = 0.32), body weight loss (P = 0.42) and neurological deficit (P = 0.75). We also assessed common outcome measures following experimental stroke and found no effect of pre-stroke craniotomy on lesion volume as measured by T2-weighted MRI (P = 0.846), or functional performance up to 28 days post-MCAO (staircase test, P = 0.32; adhesive sticker test, P = 0.49; cylinder test, P = 0.38). Thus, pre-stroke craniotomy did not improve animal welfare in terms of body weight loss and neurological deficit. However, it is important, given that a number of drug delivery studies utilise the craniotomy procedure, to note that there was no effect on lesion volume or functional outcome following experimental stroke.","The association of semaphorins 3C, 5A and 6D with liver fibrosis stage in chronic hepatitis C.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592759,PloS one,2019 06 05,"Semaphorins are a diverse family of immunoregulators recently recognized to play a major role in various phases of immune responses. Their role in chronic viral hepatitis C (CHC) and contribution to the progression of liver disease is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyse the association of secreted semaphorins with the severity of liver disease in patients with CHC. Serum concentrations of semaphorins were measured in 114 treatment-naive CHC patients and 36 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of SEMA3A, SEMA3C, SEMA5A, SEMA6B and SEMA6D were significantly increased in patients with CHC compared to controls. While serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly increased with fibrosis stage in both HCV-g1 and HCV-g3 infections, the concentration of SEMA5A inversely correlated with fibrosis stage in both HCV genotypes. ROC analysis showed that serum concentrations of SEMA3C (>4.0ng/mL, AUC 0.88) and SEMA6D (>4.5, AUC 0.82) had higher AUC than widely used APRI (AUC 0.71) and FIB-4 (AUC 0.74) scores. Serum concentrations of SEMA3C and SEMA6D significantly decreased after DAA and PEG IFN-α/ribavirin therapy, while the serum concentration of SEMA5A significantly increased after DAAs therapy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of SEMA3C and SEMA5A in hepatocytes, endothelial cells and lymphocytes of cirrhotic livers from CHC patients but not in controls. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that SEMA3C, SEMA5A and SEMA6D can be considered as markers of liver injury in CHC.",A high mortality rate associated with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ST79 and ST25 carrying OXA-23 in a Brazilian intensive care unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592758,PloS one,2019 05 28,"The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) strains has restricted the therapeutic options available to treat infections due to this pathogen. Understanding the prevalence of such infections and the underlying genetic mechanisms of resistance may help in the implementation of adequate measures to control and prevent acquisition of nosocomial infections, especially in an intensive care unit setting. This study describes the molecular characteristics and risk factors associated with OXA-23-producing A. baumannii infections. A case-control study was undertaken from September/2013 to April/2015. Acquisition of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii was found to be associated with the use of nasogastric tubes, haemodialysis, and the use of cephalosporins. These isolates were only susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, tigecycline, and colistin, and contained the ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream ofblaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51 genes. Twenty-six OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains belonged to the ST79 (CC79) clonal group,and patients infected or colonised by these isolates had a higher mortality rate (34.6%). In conclusion, this study showed a dissemination of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strains that was associated with several healthcare-related risk factors and high mortality rates among intensive care unit patients.",Early childhood obesity prevention efforts through a life course health development perspective: A scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592757,PloS one,2019 06 03,"The obesity rate in preschool children in the United States (US) is 13.9%, while even higher rates are associated with racial and ethnic minorities and children from low-income families.

PrEP uptake and adherence remain low and product preferences are unknown, especially among young African American MSM who are most at-risk. We conducted 26 qualitative interviews from 2014-2016 among young adult HIV-negative African American MSM regarding PrEP product preferences in Missouri. While the pill and injectable were most liked of all modalities, about a quarter preferred rectal products or patches. Most participants preferred a long-acting injectable (LAI) to daily oral pills due to better medication adherence and a dislike for taking pills. Many participants preferred daily oral pills to on-demand oral PrEP due to the inability to predict sex and the perception that insufficient time or medication would not achieve HIV protection with on-demand. A fear of needles and the perception that there would not be therapeutic levels for a long duration were concerns with injectable PrEP. Study findings highlight the need for a range of prevention options for African American MSM and can inform PrEP product development as well as dissemination and implementation efforts.",Healthy human serum N-glycan profiling reveals the influence of ethnic variation on the identified cancer-relevant glycan biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592755,PloS one,2019 05 21,"Most glycomics studies have focused on understanding disease mechanisms and proposing serum markers for various diseases, yet the influence of ethnic variation on the identified glyco-biomarker remains poorly addressed.

KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7."

First, word-context co-occurrence counts were collected using corpora of transcribed English child-directed speech. Then, an unsupervised k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to categorize words into lexical categories. The categorization outcome was regressed over three main distributional predictors computed for each word, including frequency, contextual diversity, and average conditional probability given all the co-occurring contexts. Results show that both contextual diversity and frequency have a positive effect while the average conditional probability has a negative effect. This indicates that words are easier to categorize in the face of uncertainty: categorization works best for words which are frequent, diverse, and hard to predict given the co-occurring contexts. This shows how, in order for the learner to see an opportunity to form a category, there needs to be a certain degree of uncertainty in the co-occurrence pattern.",Removal of heat-sensitive clustered damaged DNA sites is independent of double-strand break repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592737,PloS one,2019 05 21,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious lesions that can arise in cells after ionizing radiation or radiometric drug treatment. In addition to prompt DSBs, DSBs may also be produced during repair, evolving from a clustered DNA damaged site, which is composed of two or more distinct lesions that are located within two helical turns. A specific type of cluster damage is the heat-sensitive clustered site (HSCS), which transforms into DSBs upon treatment at elevated temperatures. The actual lesions or mechanisms that mediate the HSCS transformation into DSBs are unknown. However, there are two possibilities; either these lesions are transformed into DSBs due to DNA lesion instability, e.g., transfer of HSCS into single-strand breaks (SSBs), or they are formed due to local DNA structure instability, e.g., DNA melting, where two SSBs on opposite strands meet and transform into a DSB. The importance of these processes in living cells is not understood, but they significantly affect estimates of DSB repair capacity. In this study, we show that HSCS removal in human cells is not affected by defects in DSB repair or inhibition of DSB repair. Under conditions where rejoining of prompt DSBs was almost completely inhibited, heat-sensitive DSBs were successfully rejoined, without resulting in increased DSB levels, indicating that HSCS do not transfer into DSB in cells under physiological conditions. Furthermore, analysis by atomic force microscopy suggests that prolonged heating of chromosomal DNA can induce structural changes that facilitate transformation of HSCS into DSB. In conclusion, the HSCS do not generate additional DSBs at physiological temperatures in human cells, and the repair of HSCS is independent of DSB repair.",Standardization of perioperative care facilitates safe discharge by postoperative day five after pancreaticoduodenectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592736,PloS one,2019 05 21,Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a complex surgical procedure associated with high morbidity and prolonged length of stay.

We find that the extent of verb regularization is greater on Twitter, taken as a whole, than in English Fiction books. Regularization is also greater for tweets geotagged in the United States relative to American English books, but the opposite is true for tweets geotagged in the United Kingdom relative to British English books. We also find interesting regional variations in regularization across counties in the United States. However, once differences in population are accounted for, we do not identify strong correlations with socio-demographic variables such as education or income.","Treatment with P28GST, a schistosome-derived enzyme, after acute colitis induction in mice: Decrease of intestinal inflammation associated with a down regulation of Th1/Th17 responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592734,PloS one,2019 05 21,"P28GST, a 28Kd glutathione S-transferase enzymatic protein derived from a schistosome helminth prevents experimental colitis when administered subcutaneously in the presence of adjuvant by decreasing pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 response.

The combinatory transfection effect of mechanical treatments and conventional chemical carriers is also investigated on a formerly reported hard-to-transfect cell line (TC-1). To study the effect of mechanical loadings on transfection rate, TC-1 tumor cells are subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch, equiaxial cyclic stretch, and shear stress. The TurboFect transfection reagent is exerted for chemical transfection purposes. The pEGFP-N1 vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression is utilized to determine gene delivery into the cells. The results show a significant DNA delivery rate (by ~30%) in mechanically transfected cells compared to the samples that were transfected with chemical carriers. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of TC-1 tumor cells with chemical carriers and mechanical loadings significantly increases the gene transfection rate up to ~ 63% after 24 h post-transfection.

A total of 72 LDLR-M patients and 50 LDLR-WT patients were enrolled in the study and underwent CT as a part of an assessment of coronary calcium scoring. AVCS was determined and compared between the two patient groups. AVCS was significantly higher in the LDLR-M group in comparison to the LDLR-WT group (13.8 ± 37.9 vs. 0.94 ± 3.1, p = 0.03). The Yates' chi-squared test for independence revealed that LDLR mutation and AVCS were significantly dependable (Chi^2 = 6.106, p = 0.013). The LDLR mutation was a strong predictor of a high AVCS (OR 7.83, 95% CI 2.08-29.50, p = 0.002) on multivariate regression analysis.

An assessment of computed tomography calcium scores showed that LDLR-M patients have increased AVCS in comparison to those with LDLR-WT. In addition, LDLR mutation can be considered as an independent risk factor of having high AVSC even after adjustment for risk factors including cholesterol levels. This may result from the associated process connected with the regulatory role of LDLR in evolution of aortic valve calcifications.",Impact of mydriasis in fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592718,PloS one,2019 05 17,"Fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO) is a novel technique that measures in vivo autofluorescence intensity decay over time of endogenous fluorophores in the retina.

Since the mydriatic status influence the FLIO result, the impact of mydriasis on FLIO need to be clarified. In this prospective, observational study, the impact of mydriasis on measurements from fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscope (FLIO) images in normal subjects were evaluated. 12 healthy participants (24 eyes) were volunteered and all subjects were scanned twice and the mean fluorescence lifetime (τm) values were computed with dilation and without dilation on different days. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from the measured τm in dilated, nondilated and between the dilated and non-dilated setting. Test duration was also compared and correlated with lifetimes in both settings. Repeatability was excellent for both the dilation and non-dilation settings (ICC; 0.967-0.996; 0.926-0.986, respectively). The agreement between the dilation and non-dilation settings, however, were lower (ICC; 0.688-0.970). The τm in the non-dilation setting was significantly longer than in the dilation setting for the SSC (P<0.05). The FLIO test duration in the non-dilation setting was significantly longer than with dilation for the SSC (P <0.05). Although good repeatability in τm measurements between imaging sessions were observed both with and without dilation, the agreement was not as good when comparing dilated with non-dilated measurements. Since FLIO without mydriasis results in longer τm in the SSC and takes a longer time for image acquisition, maximal dilation is recommended for FLIO testing.","The prevalence of non-GII.4 norovirus genotypes in acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in Jinan, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592717,PloS one,2019 05 17,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks.

Their structure is highly dynamic, allowing them to adapt to different energy requirements, to be partitioned during cell division, and to maintain functionality. Mitochondrial dynamics, including membrane fusion and fission reactions, are well studied in yeast and mammals but it is not known if these processes are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Kinetoplastid parasites are some of the earliest-diverging eukaryotes to retain a mitochondrion. Each cell has only a single mitochondrial organelle, making them an interesting model for the role of dynamics in controlling mitochondrial architecture. We have investigated the mitochondrial division cycle in the kinetoplastid Crithidia fasciculata. The majority of mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and the mitochondrion is divided symmetrically in a process coincident with cytokinesis. Live cell imaging revealed that the mitochondrion is highly dynamic, with frequent changes in the topology of the branched network. These remodeling reactions include tubule fission, fusion, and sliding, as well as new tubule formation. We hypothesize that the function of this dynamic remodeling is to homogenize mitochondrial contents and to facilitate rapid transport of mitochondria-encoded gene products from the area containing the mitochondrial nucleoid to other parts of the organelle.",Adult attachment and social anxiety: The mediating role of emotion regulation strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592712,PloS one,2019 04 29,"Despite extensive evidence relating attachment dimensions to maladaptive interpersonal behaviours and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, few studies have explored social anxiety in the context of adult attachment dimensions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are associated with symptoms of social anxiety and whether cognitive emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal and suppression) play a role in the relationship between adult attachment and social anxiety. A sample of 253 adults (male n = 47, 18.6%; female n = 202, 79.8%; gender not disclosed n = 4, 1.6%) ranging in age from 18 to 74 years (M = 33.12, SD = 11.56) completed an online questionnaire that consisted of the Experience in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire (ECR-R); The Inventory of Interpersonal Situations Discomfort scale (IIS-D); and The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Results indicated that both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have a direct effect on indices of social anxiety symptomology. Reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and social anxiety. However, the relationship between attachment avoidance and social anxiety was not mediated by the use of reappraisal and suppression. Findings of the study have implications for the development of clinical interventions targeting mediators of psychological distress associated with social anxiety.",Suitability of traits related to aggression and handleability for integration into pig breeding programmes: Genetic parameters and comparison between Gaussian and binary trait specifications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592711,PloS one,2019 04 24,"Changes in husbandry systems as well as consumers' increasing demands for animal welfare lead to increasing importance of traits such as handleability and aggressiveness in pigs. However, before using such novel traits for selection decisions, information on genetic parameters for these traits for the specific population is required. Therefore, weight gain and behaviour-related traits were recorded in 1004 pigs (814 Pietrain x German Landrace crossbred, 190 German Landrace purebred) at different ages. Behaviour indicators and tests were assessed and conducted, respectively under commercial farm conditions and included scoring of skin lesions (twice) and behaviour during backtests (twice), injections (once), handling (twice) and weighing (three times). Since behaviour scores often exhibit suboptimal statistical properties for parametric analyses, variance components were estimated using an animal model assuming a normal (Gaussian, GA; all traits) and additionally a binary distribution of variables (BI; using a logit-link function for all behaviour traits). Heritabilities for behavioural traits ranged from 0.02 ± 0.04 (finishing pig handling test; BI) to 0.36 ± 0.08 (backtest 2; GA) suggesting that some of the traits are potentially useful for genetic selection (e.g. finishing pig weighing test: h2 (GA) = 0.20 ± 0.07). Only minor differences were observed for results from binary and Gaussian analyses of the same traits suggesting that either approach might yield valid results. However, four-fold cross-validation using correlations between breeding values of a sub-set of animals for the sample trait finishing pig weighing score indicated slight superiority of the logit model (r = 0.85 ± 0.04 vs. r = 0.77 ± 0.03). Generally, only weak to moderate associations were found between behavioural reactions to the same test at different ages (rp ≤ 0.11 for weighing at different ages; rp = 0.30 but rg (GA) = 0.84 ± 0.11 for the backtests) as well as between reactions to different tests. Therefore, for inclusion of behaviour traits into breeding programmes, and considering high labour input required for some tests such as the backtest, it is recommended to assess behaviour during situations that are relevant and identical to practical conditions, while the use of indicator traits generally does not appear to be a very promising alternative.",Podoplanin+ tumor lymphatics are rate limiting for breast cancer metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592710,PLoS biology,2019 05 21,"Metastatic dissemination employs both the blood and lymphatic vascular systems. Solid tumors dynamically remodel and generate both vessel types during cancer progression. Lymphatic vessel invasion and cancer cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) are prognostic markers for breast cancer metastasis and patient outcome, and tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis likely influences metastasis. Deregulated tumor tissue fluid homeostasis and immune trafficking associated with tumor lymphangiogenesis may contribute to metastatic spreading; however, the precise functional characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in tumors is challenged by the lack of specific reagents to decipher their rate-limiting role in metastasis. Therefore, we generated novel transgenic mice (PDPN promoter-driven Cre recombinase transgene [PDPN-Cre] and PDPN promoter-driven thymidine kinase transgene [PDPN-tk]) that allow for the identification and genetically controlled depletion of proliferating podoplanin (Pdpn)-expressing LECs. We demonstrate that suppression of lymphangiogenesis is successfully achieved in lymphangioma lesions induced in the PDPN-tk mice. In multiple metastatic breast cancer mouse models, we identified distinct roles for LECs in primary and metastatic tumors. Our findings support the functional contribution of primary tumor lymphangiogenesis in controlling metastasis to axillary LNs and lung parenchyma. Reduced lymphatic vessel density enhanced primary tumor lymphedema and increased the frequency of intratumoral macrophages but was not associated with a significant impact on primary tumor growth despite a marked reduction in metastatic dissemination. Our findings identify the rate-limiting contribution of the breast tumor lymphatic vessels for lung metastasis."

Yet the factors influencing disease spread, especially in the early stages of the outbreak, are not well-understood. We present scaling relationships, of potentially widespread relevance, that were developed from more than 15 years of field and in silico single focus studies of wheat stripe rust spread. These relationships emerged as a consequence of accounting for a greater proportion of the fat-tailed disease gradient that may be frequently underestimated in disease spread studies. Leptokurtic dispersal gradients (highly peaked and fat-tailed) are relatively common in nature and they can be represented by power law functions. Power law scale invariance properties generate patterns that repeat over multiple spatial scales, suggesting important and predictable scaling relationships between disease levels during the first generation of disease outbreaks and subsequent epidemic spread. Experimental wheat stripe rust outbreaks and disease spread simulations support theoretical scaling relationships from power law properties and suggest that relatively straightforward scaling approximations may be useful for projecting the spread of disease caused by long-distance dispersed pathogens. Our results suggest that, when actual dispersal/disease data are lacking, an inverse power law with exponent = 2 may provide a reasonable approximation for modeling disease spread. Furthermore, our experiments and simulations strongly suggest that early control treatments with small spatial extent are likely to be more effective at suppressing an outbreak caused by a long-distance dispersed pathogen than would delayed treatment of a larger area. The scaling relationships we detail and the associated consequences for disease control may be broadly applicable to plant and animal pathogens characterized by non-exponentially bound, fat-tailed dispersal gradients.",Colorado Seed Potato Certification Data Analysis Shows Mosaic and Blackleg are Major Diseases of Seed Potato and Identifies Tolerant Potato Varieties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592697,Plant disease,2019 03 22,"Seed potato certification programs aim to limit disease incidence in planting material to levels below a threshold that causes significant losses to seed potato buyers. Records maintained for seed potato certification can be analyzed for trends in seed potato varietal mixture and disease incidences over time. We used logistic regression models to determine effects of year, potato variety, and their interaction on the incidences of potato diseases and disorders based on seed potato certification data collected in Colorado from 2012 to 2016. The effect of seed generation of important varieties on the incidence of common potato diseases was also quantified. Among the documented diseases, mosaic, caused primarily by Potato virus Y, is a persistent problem leading to high percentage of seed lot rejections in both summer and winter inspections, while blackleg, caused by Dickeya spp. and Pectobacterium spp., was a common disease causing summer rejections. The model demonstrated year, potato variety, and their interaction were key factors contributing to incidence of varietal mixture, or one or more potato diseases and disorders. For summer inspections, our models identified 53, 42, and six varieties sensitive to mosaic, blackleg, and leafroll, respectively. There were 17, 15, and six varieties that were tolerant to mosaic, blackleg, and leafroll regardless of pathogen pressures in the environment. For winter inspections, 51 varieties were sensitive to mosaic and three to leafroll, whereas 45 and one were relatively tolerant to mosaic and leafroll. The pattern of seed generation effects of selected potato varieties on mosaic and blackleg incidence was inconsistent across inspection years. In addition, we observed a significant negative correlation between the relative abundance of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and mosaic in winter inspections. Mosaic incidences in summer and leafroll incidences were not influenced by common aphid species captured or total aphids in the valley. These results identify mosaic and blackleg as major causes of seed potato rejections and downgrades, sensitive and tolerant varieties, and provide suggestions for improving integrated crop management practices in Colorado.","Comparing the Effects of Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM), Music and LKM Plus Music on Psychological Well-Being.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592696,The Journal of psychology,2019 05 16,"Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a meditative practice directing caring feelings toward self and others, is a popular, evidence-base approach to increasing well-being. Music listening is also a popular form of emotion regulation used to enhance well-being. This interdisciplinary study evaluated a novel intervention called Convergence-combining LKM with accompanying classical guitar music-and its effects on adults' well-being, mindfulness, compassion and self-compassion outcomes. Convergence was compared to active control groups LKM-only and Music-only regarding their relative effectiveness in improving these outcomes. Participants (N = 78; aged 18 to 69 years; 90% females; recruited from the general public) were assigned to either the Convergence, LKM-only, or Music-only condition. Each condition received a 2-hour workshop, involving psychoeducation, three prerecorded meditations, and group enquiry and discussion. Participants were assessed at pre-program, post-program, and 4-week follow-up. Findings revealed that Convergence, LKM-only and Music-only were equally effective interventions, producing improvements in dependent variables with small effect sizes. There was no additive effect of the components when delivered together as Convergence. Significant correlations were found between the amount of home practice, and mindfulness and self-compassion at follow-up. LKM, music listening and Convergence all provide brief, evidence-based alternatives for improving well-being. Practical and theoretical implications are provided, as well as recommendations for future research.",Audience Responses to Physical Activity in the Biggest Loser Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592695,Journal of health communication,2019 02 26,"The popular reality television show The Biggest Loser Australia (TBL) is a significant source of media content about physical activity. This study examined audience responses to and interpretations of physical activity in TBL. A qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. A sample of 46 viewers of TBL was recruited, stratified by gender, age group, area of residence, and body mass index. Interview data were thematically analyzed to identify how viewers evaluated TBL. Respondents were most positive about TBL as public health education, premised on personal responsibility, the need for extreme action, and the possibilities of human agency (individually and collectively). Conversely, they were critical about whether the portrayal of physical activity could guide and inspire them personally. They expressed feelings of disgust and fear in response to the exercise challenges, questioned the practicality of the behavior change process in light of their own experience, and were skeptical about the purpose of the program itself. TBL's representation of physical activity may be limited in its capacity to encourage physical activity. Despite the wide viewership of this program, encouraging physical requires innovation in the development of practical, persuasive and evidence based media messages about physical activity.",Characterization of the Papain-Like Protease p29 of the Hypovirus CHV1-CN280 in Its Natural Host Fungus Cryphonectria parasitica and Nonhost Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592694,Phytopathology,2019 05 08,"Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 strain CN280 (CHV1-CN280) was isolated from North China and exhibited typical hypovirulence-associated traits. We previously reported that CHV1-CN280 was more aggressive and had a higher horizontal transmission ability between Cryphonectria parasitica isolates belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups than two other CHV1 hypoviruses (namely, CHV1-EP713 and CHV1-Euro7), thus displaying greater potential for biological control of chestnut blight. The genome sequence of CHV1-CN280 shared approximately 70% identity with three other hypoviruses (CHV1-EP713, CHV1-Euro7, and CHV1-EP721). The coding region for p29, a papain-like protease encoded by CHV1-CN280 hypovirus, displayed an average of only approximately 60% amino acid identity among them, while the identity between the other three CHV1 isolates was higher than 89%. Protease p29 acted as a virus-encoded determinant responsible for altering fungal host phenotypes in other CHV1 isolates. In this study, the impacts of CHV1-CN280 p29 expression in virus-free C. parasitica were investigated. CHV1-CN280 p29 expression in C. parasitica resulted in significantly reduced sporulation, pigmentation, extracellular laccase activities, and pathogenicity, which is consistent with previous investigations. Subsequently, the potential of CHV1-CN280 p29 as a viral determinant responsible for suppression of host phenotypes in other phytopathogenic fungi such as Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, was discussed. However, heterologous expression of p29 in M. oryzae induced the opposite effect on sporulation, extracellular laccase activities, and pathogenicity; had no significant effect on pigmentation and mycelial growth; and contributed to extracellular peroxidase activities, suggesting that CHV1-CN280 p29 may disturb a unique regulatory pathway in C. parasitica, rather than a basic regulatory pathway conserved in diverse range of fungi. Alternatively, CHV1-CN280 p29-mediated modulation of fungal phenotypes may be facilitated by the specific interaction between p29 and a special fungal-host component, which exists only with C. parasitica but not M. oryzae.","Draft Genome Resources of Two Strains (""ESVL"" and ""IVIA5901"") of Xylella fastidiosa Associated with Almond Leaf Scorch Disease in Alicante, Spain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592693,Phytopathology,2019 03 22,"An outbreak of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. multiplex sequence type ST6 was discovered in 2017 in mainland Spain affecting almond trees.

Improving systemic therapy is considered the major challenge in improving the outcome of this disease. Areas covered: This review covers novel chemotherapy and targeted agents in the treatment of PDAC, with a focus on advanced stage disease. Expert opinion: Current frontline therapies used in the treatment of patients with PDAC with favorable performance status are gemcitabine (GEM) and nab-paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). PDAC has a number of genetic mutations that may explain its biological behavior, such as KRAS, p53 and CDK2NA, which occur in more than 90% of cases. Unfortunately, to this day, a specific targeting agent to any of those frequent gene mutations is lacking. Emerging areas of targeted therapies include the DNA repair, stroma, metabolism, and stem cells.

Whether folic acid (FA) directly affects FGF pathways to influence neurodevelopment and the possible mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we presented evidence that in human FA-insufficient encephalocele, the FGF pathway was interfered. Furthermore, in Brachyury knockout mice devoid of such T-box transcription factors regulating embryonic neuromesodermal bipotency and a key component of FGF pathway, change in expression of Brachyury downstream targets, activator Fgf8 and suppressor dual specificity phosphatase 6 was detected, along with the reduction in expression of other key FGF pathway genes. By using a FA-deficient cell model, we further demonstrated that decrease in Brachyury expression was through alteration in hypermethylation at the Brachyury promoter region under FA deficiency conditions, and suppression of Brachyury promoted the inactivation of the FGF pathway. Correspondingly, FA supplementation partially reverses the effects seen in FA-deficient embryoid bodies. Lastly, in mice with maternal folate-deficient diets, aberrant FGF pathway activity was found in fetal brain dysplasia. Taken together, our findings highlight the effect of FA on FGF pathways during neurogenesis, and the mechanism may be due to the low expression of Brachyury gene via hypermethylation under FA-insufficient conditions.-Chang, S., Lu, X., Wang, S., Wang, Z., Huo, J., Huang, J., Shangguan, S., Li, S., Zou, J., Bao, Y., Guo, J., Wang, F., Niu, B., Zhang, T., Qiu, Z., Wu, J., Wang, L.

Its 2 major toxins, toxins A and B, enter host cells and inactivate GTPases of the Ras homologue/rat sarcoma family by glucosylation. Pore formation of the toxins in the endosomal membrane enables the translocation of their glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol, and membrane cholesterol is crucial for this process. Here, we asked whether the activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) pathway, which regulates the cholesterol content in membranes, affects the susceptibility of target cells toward toxins A and B. We show that the SREBP-2 pathway is crucial for the intoxication process of toxins A and B by using pharmacological inhibitors (PF-429242, 25-hydroxycholesterol) and cells that are specifically deficient in SREBP-2 pathway signaling. SREBP-2 pathway inhibition disturbed the cholesterol-dependent pore formation of toxin B in cellular membranes. Preincubation with the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin protected cells from toxin B intoxication. Inhibition of the SREBP-2 pathway was without effect when the enzyme portion of toxin B was introduced into target cells via the cell delivery property of anthrax protective antigen.

TRK fusions have also been identified at lower frequencies across a broad range of other pediatric cancers, including undifferentiated sarcomas, gliomas, papillary thyroid cancers, spitzoid neoplasms, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and acute leukemias. Here we review the prevalence and diseases associated with TRK fusions and methods of detection of these fusions in light of the recent development of selective TRK inhibitors, such as larotrectinib, which demonstrated a 75% response rate across children and adults with TRK fusion cancers. We provide recommendations for screening pediatric tumors for the presence of TRK fusions, including the use of immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization for patients with tumors likely to harbor TRK fusions. Further, we recommend next-generation sequencing for tumors that have a relatively low prevalence of TRK fusions, both to identify patients who may benefit from TRK inhibition and to identify other targetable oncogenic drivers that exist in the same tumor types.","Rapid testing of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in intensive care patients using the HemoScreen™ point-of-care analyzer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592636,Platelets,2018 12 28,"Acute major bleeding is a condition that can be encountered in critically ill patients and may require rapid transfusions.

Furthermore, CXCL8 was up-regulated in cocultures of BM-MSCs and leukemic cell lines compared with either monoculture. CXCL8 expression was significantly higher in MSCs compared with mononuclear cells in patients with de novo AML.

Many problem features have been proposed in the literature in an attempt to provide insights into the structure of problem landscapes and to use in selecting an effective algorithm for a given optimization problem. While there has been some success, evaluating the utility of problem features in practice presents some significant challenges. Machine learning models have been employed as part of the evaluation process, but they may require additional information about the problems as well as having their own hyper-parameters, biases and experimental variability. As a result, extra layers of uncertainty and complexity are added into the experimental evaluation process, making it difficult to clearly assess the effect of the problem features. In this article, we propose a novel method for the evaluation of problem features which can be applied directly to individual or groups of features and does not require additional machine learning techniques or confounding experimental factors. The method is based on the feature's ability to detect a prior ranking of similarity in a set of problems. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) significance tests are used to determine if the feature has successfully distinguished the successive problems in the set. Based on ANOVA test results, a percentage score is assigned to each feature for different landscape characteristics. Experimental results for twelve different features on four problem transformations demonstrate the method and provide quantitative evidence about the ability of different problem features to detect specific properties of problem landscapes."

Initially, six types of complexing agents, linear(A)-linear(B), linear(A)-linear(B)-linear(A), linear-dendritic, dendritic-linear-dendritic, linear-hyperbranched, and hyperbranched-linear-hyperbranched amphiphilic block copolymers, are proven to significantly enhance enzyme activity of three different types of lipases - Penicillium camemberti, Candida rugosa, and Burkholderia cepacia (up to 1400%, 1700%, and 870% increase with respect to the native enzymes). The copolymerization is performed in several consecutive steps: (a) lipase and laccase are dissolved in aqueous medium at neutral pH; (b) a complexing agent is added leading to cocompartmentalization of the two enzymes within a micelle or physical network; (c) the two comonomers are introduced simultaneously to the tandem enzyme complex. The reaction proceeds in the following pathway: laccase catalyzes the oxidation of catechol to o-quinone followed by lipase comediated Michael addition of a diamine. While laccase could catalyze the entire process, addition of lipase is able to increase copolymer yield up to 30.7%. Addition of a complexing agent improves the yield further up to 67.9% (23.2% yield obtained for native laccase). Complexing agents significantly increase polymer molecular mass ( Mw = 130 900 vs 35 500 Da for the native enzymes reaction system). The resulting copolymers are highly fluorescent (quantum yield up to 0.733) and demonstrate pH sensitive behavior, properties that hint toward their potential as imaging agents.",Enhancing the In Vitro and In Vivo Stabilities of Polymeric Nucleic Acid Delivery Nanosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592619,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 02 20,"Gene therapy holds great promise for various medical and biomedical applications. Nonviral gene delivery systems formed by cationic polymer and nucleic acids (e.g., polyplexes) have been extensively investigated for targeted gene therapy; however, their in vitro and in vivo stability is affected by both their intrinsic properties such as chemical compositions (e.g., polymer molecular weight and structure, and N/P ratio) and a number of environmental factors (e.g., shear stress during circulation in the bloodstream, interaction with the serum proteins, and physiological ionic strength). In this review, we surveyed the effects of a number of important intrinsic and environmental factors on the stability of polymeric gene delivery systems, and discussed various strategies to enhance the stability of polymeric gene delivery systems, thereby enabling efficient gene delivery into target cells.

In previous experiments where water was used as the poor solvent, a negative surface charge was measured on the precipitated nanoparticles, which led to the long-time stability of the dispersion. It was argued that these charges originate presumably from either water or hydroxide adsorption at the hydrophobic nanoparticle surface or from impurities in the feed streams that preferentially adsorb on the precipitated nanoparticles. To elucidate the origin of this stabilization mechanism, we performed experiments wherein we replaced water with a nonpolar poor solvent. The polymers aggregated into stable nanoparticles for a range of processing parameters. We investigated theoretically three possible explanations for this stability, i.e., electrostatic stabilization, conditional thermodynamic equilibrium, and steric stabilization. Our experiments and considerations suggest that steric stabilization is the most likely candidate.",NMR Dynamics Study Reveals the Zα Domain of Human ADAR1 Associates with and Dissociates from Z-RNA More Slowly than Z-DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592616,ACS chemical biology,2019 02 15,"Human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 deaminates adenosine in pre-mRNA to yield inosine. The Zα domain of human ADAR1 (hZαADAR1) binds specifically to left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA and stabilizes the Z-conformation. To answer the question of how hZαADAR1 can induce both the B-Z transition of DNA and the A-Z transition of RNA, we investigated the structure and dynamics of hZαADAR1 in complex with 6-base-pair Z-DNA or Z-RNA. We performed chemical shift perturbation and relaxation dispersion experiments on hZαADAR1 upon binding to Z-DNA as well as Z-RNA. Our study demonstrates the unique dynamics of hZαADAR1 during the A-Z transition of RNA, in which the hZαADAR1 protein forms a thermodynamically stable complex with Z-RNA, similar to Z-DNA, but kinetically converts RNA to the Z-form more slowly than DNA. We also discovered some distinct structural features of hZαADAR1 in the Z-RNA binding conformation. Our results suggest that the A-Z transition of RNA facilitated by hZαADAR1 displays unique structural and dynamic features that may be involved in targeting ADAR1 for a role in recognition of RNA substrates.",Optical Chemical Sensor Using Intensity Ratiometric Fluorescence Signals for Fast and Reliable pH Determination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592615,ACS sensors,2019 01 25,"Optical pH sensors enable noninvasive monitoring of pH, yet in pure sensing terms, the potentiometric method of measuring pH is still vastly superior.

A highly photostable triangulenium fluorophore emitting at 590 nm was immobilized in an organically modified silicon matrix that allows for fast time-response by rapid diffusion of water in and out of the resulting composite polymer deposited on a polycarbonate substrate. Fluctuations from the fiber optical sensor hardware have been reduced by including a highly photostable terrylene-based reference dye emitting at 660 nm, thus enabling intensity-based ratiometric readouts. The dyes were excited by 505 nm light from a light emitting diode. The sensor was operational within a pH range of 4.6-7.6, and was characterized and demonstrated to have properties that are comparable to those of commercial pH electrodes considering time-response ( t90 < 90 s), precision (0.03 pH-units), and drift.",Synthesis of Arenesulfonyl Fluorides via Sulfuryl Fluoride Incorporation from Arynes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592614,Organic letters,2019 06 03,"Transition-metal-free multicomponent reactions involving aryne precursors, secondary amines, and sulfuryl fluoride are reported herein.

Modification of native proteins in test tubes and biological contexts by site-specific and target-selective approaches remains challenging because appropriate organic chemistry to carry out such modifications is currently limited. Nonetheless, a variety of promising strategies have appeared recently that address this grand challenge in chemical biology. These new chemistries yield native protein-based well-defined bioconjugations, specific labeling of endogenous proteins in various biological crude milieus, and the establishment of chemical proteomics as a new research area in protein science. In this Perspective, we focus on recent remarkable progress in chemistry for native protein modification.

In the case of two-dimensional materials such as graphene, the large-scale growth of single-oriented materials on an amorphous substrate has remained unsolved. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the presence of uniformly oriented graphene seeds facilitates the growth of millimeter-scale single-oriented graphene with 3 × 4 mm2 on palladium silicide, which is an amorphous thin film, where the uniformly oriented graphene seeds were epitaxially grown. The amorphous palladium silicide film promotes the growth of the single-oriented growth of graphene by causing carbon atoms to be diffusive and mobile within and on the substrate. In contrast to these results, without the uniformly oriented seeds, the amorphous substrate leads to the growth of polycrystalline graphene grains. This millimeter-scale single-oriented growth from uniformly oriented seeds can be applied to other amorphous substrates.",Photothermal-Induced Self-Healable and Reconfigurable Shape Memory Bio-Based Elastomer with Recyclable Ability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592610,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory materials have drawn much attention due to the rapidly growing technical applications and environmental requirements. As epoxy natural rubber (ENR) is a kind of bio-based elastomer with good mechanical properties, weather resistance, and air impermeability, it is of great significance to incorporate ENR with recyclable, photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory properties. In this study, we report a simple method to cross-link ENR with dodecanedioic acids (DAs) through esterification reaction, and during the cross-linking process, a little aniline trimer (ACAT, a kind of oligoaniline) was added at the same time. Then, the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimers that were covalently cross-linked with recyclable, self-healable, and multiple responsive properties were obtained, which also possessed various functions. As a result of the transesterification reactions at elevated temperatures, the ENR-based vitrimers possess the ability to be reprocessed and self-healed, and the mechanical properties could be maintained even after three consecutive breaking/mold pressing cycles. Besides, the vitrimer is also responsive to near-infrared (NIR) light and pH with the introduction of ACAT, and we also find that ACAT can be used as a catalyst to accelerate the transesterification reaction. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimer could also be used to construct the reconfigurable shape memory polymer; the shape fixing ratio and shape recovery ratio are both above 95% in the reconfiguration process, and the multistage shape memory performance can also be achieved by NIR irradiation, which will potentially lead to a wide application for ENR in the field of actuators.",Coaxial Carbon Nanotube Supported TiO2@MoO2@Carbon Core-Shell Anode for Ultrafast and High-Capacity Sodium Ion Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592609,ACS nano,2019 02 06,"The sluggish kinetic in electrode materials is one of the critical challenges in achieving high-power sodium ion storage.

These are thermodynamic conditions relevant to, for example, cooling-, heating-, compression-, and decompression-induced protein denaturation. We find that at all ( T, P) studied, the potential of mean force between the graphene plates, as a function of plate separation r, exhibits local minima at specific plate separations r = r n that can accommodate n water layers ( n = 0,1,2,3). In particular, our results show that isobaric cooling and isothermal compression have a similar effect on WMI between the plates; both processes tend to suppress the attraction and ultimate collapse of the graphene plates by kinetically trapping the plates at the metastable states with r = r n ( n > 0). In addition, isobaric heating and isothermal decompression also have a similar effect; both processes tend to reduce the range and strength of the interactions between the graphene plates. Interestingly, at low temperatures, the WMI between the plates is affected by crystallization. However, crystallization depends deeply on the water model considered, SPC/E and TIP4P/2005 water models, with the crystallization occurring at different ( T, P) conditions, into different forms of ice.",Impact of Dopamine Oxidation on Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592597,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 02 20,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The characteristic feature of PD is the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). DAergic neurons in the SN accumulate black and insoluble membrane structures known as neuromelanin during aging. The oxidation of dopamine (DA) to form neuromelanin generates many o-quinones, including DA o-quinones, aminochrome, and 5,6-indolequinone. The focus of this review is to discuss the role of DA oxidation in association with PD. The oxidation of DA produces oxidative products, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein degradation, α-synuclein aggregation into neurotoxic oligomers, and oxidative stress, in vitro. Recent studies have demonstrated that the DA content is critical for both DJ-1 knockout and A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice to develop PD pathological features, providing evidence for DA action in PD pathogenesis in vivo.

Here, we designed hybrid coatings obtained by the consolidation of organically modified polysilsesquioxanes called ""melting gels"" for the corrosion protection of AZ31 magnesium alloy in NaCl solutions. The main focus was to study the interaction between coatings and substrate and the influence of the coating thickness on the final properties. Micro-scratch tests, adhesion by tape tests, confocal Raman microscopy, SEM-EDS, and ToF-SIMS indicate good adhesion of coatings based on the interaction of melting gels and substrate.

Low-intensity near-infrared light was focused at the single cell size on a gold-nanorod-integrated microelectrode array platform, generating a photothermal effect underneath a target neuron for photothermal stimulation. We found that the photothermal stimulation modulates the spontaneous activity of a target neuron in an inhibitory manner. Single neuron inhibition was fast and highly reliable without thermal damage, and it can induce changes in network firing patterns, potentially suggesting their application for in vivo circuit modulation and functional connectomes.",Thermodynamics of Adsorption on Graphenic Surfaces from Aqueous Solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592594,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 02 15,"Adsorption of organic molecules from aqueous solution to the surface of carbon nanotubes or graphene is an important process in many applications of these materials. Here we use molecular dynamics simulation, supplemented by analytical chemistry, to explore in detail the adsorption thermodynamics of a diverse set of aromatic compounds on graphenic materials, elucidating the effects of the solvent, surface coverage, surface curvature, defects, and functionalization by hydroxy groups. We decompose the adsorption free energies into entropic and enthalpic components and find that different classes of compounds-such as phenols, benzoates, and alkylbenzenes-can easily be distinguished by the relative contributions of entropy and enthalpy to their adsorption free energies. Overall, entropy dominates for the more hydrophobic compounds, while enthalpy plays the greatest role for more hydrophilic compounds. Experiments and independent simulations using two different force field frameworks (CHARMM and Amber) support the robustness of these conclusions. We determine that concave curvature is generally associated with greater adsorption affinity, more favorable enthalpy, and greater contact area, while convex curvature reduces both adsorption enthalpy and contact area. Defects on the graphene surfaces can create concave curvature, resulting in localized binding sites. As the graphene surface becomes covered with aromatic solutes, the affinity for adsorbing an additional solute increases until a complete monolayer is formed, driven by more favorable enthalpy and partially canceled by less favorable entropy. Similarly, hydroxylation of the surface leads to preferential adsorption of the aromatic solutes to remaining regions of bare graphene, resulting in less favorable adsorption entropy, but compensated by an increase in favorable enthalpic interactions.",Points & Pearls: First trimester pregnancy emergencies: recognition and management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592592,Emergency medicine practice,2019 06 13,"Timely management of patients presenting to the ED while in their first trimester of pregnancy can improve outcomes for both the patient and the fetus.

The analysis demonstrated that the studied fragment included structural bacteriocin, immunity, partial transporter and potential regulatory encoding regions. Based on the results, there was one DNA polymorphic site in plnE as well as plnF of the studied sequences. One nucleotide substitution in plnE of BL1 isolate lead to replacement of Glycin with Valine. These two are of non-polar type which did not affect instability index of plnE protein. The only nucleotide variation in plnF of EL3 isolate did not change the amino acid sequence since the modified nucleotide constituted alternative codon of the original amino acid. The highest DNA polymorphism occurred in the region with immunity function which in BL1 resulted in the conversion of start codon to amino acid codon. In the partial transporter sequence, one variable nucleotide site caused amino acid replacement in all the isolates which elevated stability of N-terminal domain in the transporter protein compared to nominated reference isolate L. plantarum C11.

Targeted integration (TI) approaches, which involve integration of a transgene into a specific locus in the genome, are increasingly utilized for CHO cell line development (CLD) in recent years. None of these CLD approaches, however, are suitable for expression of toxic or difficult-to-express molecules, or for determining the underlying causes for poor expression of some molecules. Here we introduce a regulated target integration (RTI) system, where the desired transgene is integrated into a specific locus and transcribed under a regulated promoter. This system was used to determine the underlying causes of low protein expression for a difficult-to-express antibody (mAb-A). Interestingly, we observed that both antibody heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) subunits of mAb-A independently contributed to its low expression. Analysis of RTI cell lines also revealed that while mAb-A LC triggered accumulation of intracellular BiP, its HC displayed impaired degradation and clearance. RTI pools, generated by swapping the WT or point-mutant versions of difficult-to-express antibody HC and LC with that of an average antibody, were instrumental in understanding the contribution of HC and LC subunits to the overall antibody expression. The ability to selectively turn off the expression of a target transgene in an RTI system could help to directly link expression of a transgene to an observed adverse effect. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

An analytical method was developed for the simultaneous detection of 10 DOA under control in France: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at 1 ng/mL, and cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZE), morphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) at 10 ng/mL. Samples were eluted using the Quantisal® buffer and extracted by liquid-liquid extraction for THC and by solid-phase extraction for the remaining analytes. Analyses were performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The validated method made it possible to detect the concentrations required by law and was successfully applied to samples from drivers who screened positive. The main limitations of this kit are the large variability of the collected OF volume and the poor stability of DOA in OF, requiring the use of a conservation buffer.","Impact of Insulin Tregopil and Its Permeation Enhancer on Pharmacokinetics of Metformin in Healthy Volunteers: Randomized, Open-Label, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592549,Clinical and translational science,2019 05 21,"Oral insulin tregopil (IN-105; a new drug under development) may be coadministered with oral antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for optimal glycemic control. IN-105 has sodium caprate excipient, a permeation enhancer, for enhancing absorption in the stomach and increasing bioavailability via an oral route. Sodium caprate may increase bioavailability of metformin by a similar mechanism. Therefore, it was necessary to study the effect of IN-105 on pharmacokinetics (PKs) of metformin. In this randomized, open-label, cross-over study, metformin was administered to healthy volunteers receiving IN-105/placebo under fed/fasting conditions. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric mean ratio of the area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf ; fasting and fed) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax ; fed) of metformin were within 0.80-1.25 acceptance range. Under fasting conditions, the upper bound margin of Cmax was just beyond this range (i.e., 1.27) and was concluded as functionally not relevant. There was no clinically significant effect of sodium caprate/IN-105 on PKs of metformin under fasting/fed conditions, and it was safe.","The ACCOuNT Consortium: A Model for the Discovery, Translation, and Implementation of Precision Medicine in African Americans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592548,Clinical and translational science,2019 05 21,"The majority of pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies have been conducted on European ancestry populations, thereby excluding minority populations and impeding the discovery and translation of African American-specific genetic variation into precision medicine.

To address these challenges, we formed the Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC), African American Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetic Consortium (ACCOuNT), to discover novel genetic variants in African Americans related to clinically actionable cardiovascular phenotypes and to incorporate African American-specific sequence variations into clinical recommendations at the point of care. The TCC consists of two research projects focused on discovery and translation of genetic findings and four cores that support the projects.

Evidence indicates that mating system is an effective predictor of the global range of native species or naturalized alien plants, but the mechanisms underlying this predictability are not elaborated. Here, we develop a theoretical model to account for the ranges of plants under different mating systems based on migration-selection processes (an idea proposed by Haldane). The model includes alternation of gametophyte and sporophyte generations in one life cycle and the dispersal of haploid pollen and diploid seeds as vectors for gene flow. We show that the interaction between selfing rates and gametophytic selection determines the role of mating system in shaping a species' range. Selfing restricts the species' range under gametophytic selection in nonrandom mating systems, but expands the species' range under the absence of gametophytic selection in any mating system. Gametophytic selection slightly restricts the species' range in random mating. Both logarithmic and logistic models of population demography yield similar conclusions in the case of fixed or evolving genetic variance. The theory also helps to explain a broader relationship between mating system and range size following biological invasion or plant naturalization.","A prospective, multicenter study of a novel, miniaturized rechargeable sacral neuromodulation system: 12-month results from the RELAX-OAB study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592526,Neurourology and urodynamics,2019 03 08,"Historically, providing SNM therapy required use of a non-rechargeable implantable pulse generator (IPG) with an average device lifespan of 4.4 years.

All the literature concerning BRAF mutations and colorectal carcinoma published in PubMed from 2010 to 2018 was reviewed. Multiple variants of BRAF mutations exist in colorectal cancer, the most common type being V600E. The mutation is found in 5 to 15% of colorectal carcinomas and is less common in Asian populations. BRAF mutations are linked with older age, female gender, cigarette smoking and are more common in the right (proximal) portion of the large intestine. BRAF mutations are associated with carcinomas of high histological grade and advanced cancer stages. Often BRAF mutated carcinomas demonstrate adverse histological features such as lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumour budding and lymph node metastases. BRAF mutations are found in serrated polyposis syndrome and have a negative correlation with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). An array of methods of detection of BRAF mutation in colorectal carcinoma are available, such as immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing, etc. Combinatorial approaches involving anti-BRAF therapies targeting both MAPK signalling as well as the PI3K/mTOR pathway could be a new approach for treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma. To conclude, BRAF mutation is important in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Further research on the detection method as well as its role in target therapy will help to improve the management of patients with colorectal cancer.","The Danish Psychosocial Work Environment Questionnaire (DPQ): Development, content, reliability and validity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592500,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",2018 12 28,"Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the development and the content of the Danish Psychosocial Work Environment Questionnaire (DPQ) and to test its reliability and validity. Methods We describe the identification of dimensions, the development of items, and the qualitative and quantitative tests of the reliability and validity of the DPQ. Reliability and validity of a 150 item version of the DPQ was evaluated in a stratified sample of 8958 employees in 14 job groups of which 4340 responded. Reliability was investigated using internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The factorial validity was investigated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). For each multi-item scale, we undertook CFA within each job group and multi-group CFA to investigate factorial invariance across job groups. Finally, using multi-group multi-factor CFA, we investigated whether scales were empirically distinct. Results Internal consistency reliabilities and test-retest reliabilities were satisfactory. Factorial validity of the multi-item scales was satisfactory within each of the 14 job groups. Factorial invariance was demonstrated for 10 of the 28 multi-item scales. The hypothesis that the scales of the DPQ were empirically distinct was supported. The final DPQ version consisted of 119 items covering 38 different psychosocial work environment dimensions. Conclusions Overall, the DPQ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing psychosocial working conditions in a variety of job groups. The results indicate, however, that questions about psychosocial working conditions may be understood differently across job groups, which may have implications for the comparability of questionnaire-based measures of psychosocial working conditions across job groups.",A Novel Achromatopsia Mouse Model Resulting From a Naturally Occurring Missense Change in Cngb3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592498,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,2019 05 24,"A local colony of inbred mice (129S6/SvEvTac origin), in isolation for over a decade, were found to have absent light-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) responses.

We now extend the evidence for the lack of properly processed DSBs by improving meiotic chromosome synapsis with exogenous DSBs. A single injection of chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin increased frequency of RPA and DMC1 foci at the zygotene stage of sterile hybrids, enhanced homolog recognition and increased the proportion of spermatocytes with fully synapsed homologs at pachytene.

Despite individuals maintaining distinctive antibody 'fingerprints', responses were consistent across vaccinated cohorts. Seventy-two functionally distinct proteins were associated with WCV-induced increases in IgG binding. These shared characteristics with naturally immunogenic proteins, being enriched for transporters and cell wall metabolism enzymes, likely unusually exposed on the unencapsulated WCV's surface. Vaccine-induced responses were specific to variants of the diverse PclA, PspC and ZmpB proteins, whereas PspA- and ZmpA-induced antibodies recognised a broader set of alleles.

To analyze the plasticity of genetic interactions, we performed a combinatorial RNAi screen in Drosophila cells at multiple time points and after pharmacological inhibition of Ras signaling activity. Using an image-based morphology assay to capture a broad range of phenotypes, we assessed the effect of 12768 pairwise RNAi perturbations in six different conditions. We found that genetic interactions form in different trajectories and developed an algorithm, termed MODIFI, to analyze how genetic interactions rewire over time. Using this framework, we identified more statistically significant interactions compared to end-point assays and further observed several examples of context-dependent crosstalk between signaling pathways such as an interaction between Ras and Rel which is dependent on MEK activity.","High-Throughput Sequencing in Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine Research.

Yaa mice developed typical lesions of MPGN and showed strong expression of Tlr9 mRNA throughout the glomerulus particularly toward the periphery of the glomerulus. However, BXSB/MpJ (BXSB) mice showed no lesion for MPGN but a very weak expression of Tlr9 mRNA. Relative mRNA expression of Tlr9 and its downstream cytokines, including interleukin 1 beta (Il1b), Il6, interferon gamma (Ifng) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) was markedly increased in glomeruli isolated from Yaa mice. Tlr9 protein expression was almost absent in BXSB mice but intense expression was found in Yaa mice. Podocyte protein expression was normal in BXSB mice but decreased in Yaa mice and colocalized with Tlr9 protein. Furthermore, electron microscopy examination revealed podocyte injury and electron-dense materials in thickened glomerular basement membrane of Yaa mice. Glomerular Tlr9 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with anti-dsDNA antibody, proteinuria, renal function indices (sBUN and sCr), glomerular histopathology indices, downstream factors of Tlr family (Ilb and Tnfa), podocyte injury parameters (p < .05 and p < .01). In conclusion, overexpression of TLR9 correlates with podocyte injury and development of MPGN."

We have herein, for the first time, reported the construction of luminescent lanthanide-collagen peptide hybrid three-dimensional nanofibrous scaffolds, which well mimic the characteristic architectural structure of native collagen. Three collagen mimetic peptides, composed of repetitive central (GPO)7 sequences and altered terminal amino acids, have been shown to consistently self-assemble to form biocompatible nanofibers under the trigger of a variety of lanthanide ions, which also functionalize the assembled materials with easily tunable photoluminescence. Furthermore, the collagen peptide-lanthanide hybrid scaffolds possess programmable pH-responsive features. The lanthanide ion-mediated assembly of all three collagen peptides are conveniently and reversibly regulated by pH, while their pH-dependent patterns are finely tuned by the identity of terminal amino acids. Using camptothecin and cefoperazone sodium as two model drugs, the drug-loading and releasing efficiency of the collagen peptide-lanthanide scaffolds are nicely modulated by pH, demonstrating the efficacy of these nanofibrous scaffolds as pH-responsive drug carriers. These novel luminescent collagen peptide-lanthanide scaffolds provide a facile system for pH-controlled drug delivery, suggesting promising applications in the development of therapies for many diseases.","Potent Antagonists of RORγt, Cardenolides from Calotropis gigantea, Exhibit Discrepant Effects on the Differentiation of T Lymphocyte Subsets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592425,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"RORγt is the master transcription factor of IL-17 cytokine expression and Th17 lymphocyte differentiation, which are responsible for the induction of many autoimmune diseases. Recently, RORγt has become an attractive target for drug development to treat these types of diseases, and the field of RORγt antagonist research is now extremely competitive. In our current study, molecular docking was applied to demonstrate that cardenolides, including uscharin, calactin, and calotropin derived from Calotropis gigantea, probably directly bind to RORγt. Therefore, the inhibitory effect was further validated using a luciferase reporter assay. Because RORγt is the key transcriptional factor for Th17 differentiation, the effects of these compounds on Th17 differentiation were studied by flow cytometry. The results showed that uscharin, calactin, and calotropin inhibited Th17 differentiation from 100 to 500 nM. Furthermore, uscharin had a better effect than digoxin, a well-known inverse agonist of RORγt, in reducing Th17 polarization. Additionally, the effects of the cardenolides on the differentiation of other Th lineages, including Th1, Th2, and Treg, were investigated. Uscharin suppressed Th1, Th2, and Treg cell differentiation, while calactin suppressed the differentiation of Th1 cells, and calotropin did not influence the other T cell subsets, indicating that calactin suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and calotropin selectively quenched Th17 polarization. Structural analysis of the three compounds showed that the selectivity of uscharin, calactin, and calotropin on the suppression of the different subsets of T cells is correlated to the minor differences in their chemical structures. Collectively, calactin and calotropin have greater potential to be developed as lead compounds than uscharin to treat autoimmune diseases mediated by Th17 and/or Th1 cells.",Targeted Mitochondrial COQ10 Delivery Attenuates Antiretroviral-Drug-Induced Senescence of Neural Progenitor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592424,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"HIV infection is associated with symptoms of accelerated or accentuated aging that are likely to be driven not only by HIV itself but also by the toxicity of long-term use of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, it is crucially important to understand the mechanisms by which antiretroviral drugs may contribute to aging. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that antiretroviral drugs cause increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and culminates in promoting cellular senescence. In addition, we applied targeted nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery to specifically enrich mitochondria with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in order to enhance antioxidant protection. The studies employed neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as differentiation of these cells into mature neurons is affected both during HIV infection and in the aging process. Exposure of cultured NPCs to various combinations of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) induced a more than 2-fold increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential, a more than 50% decrease in oxygen consumption and ATP levels, a 60% decrease in SIRT3 expression, and a 42% decrease in cell proliferation relative to control levels. These alterations were accompanied by a 37% increase in beta-galactosidase staining and a shortening of the telomere length to more than half of the length of controls as assessed by quantitative telomere-FISH labeling, indicating accelerated NPC senescence in response to ART exposure. Importantly, CoQ10 delivered by targeted nanoparticles effectively attenuated these effects. Overall, these results indicate that ART promotes cellular senescence by causing mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be successfully reversed by supplementation with mitochondria-targeted CoQ10.",Enantioselective Ir-Catalyzed Bidirectional Reductive Coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592423,Organic letters,2019 06 03,"In the presence of a chiral iridium complex, commercially available 3-chloro-2-chloromethyl-1-propene (1) was selectively activated for various reductive couplings.

Its characterization by XRD reveals a high disorder of the uranyl cations and the formation of monodimensional chains of anionic [(UO2)7.2(HCOO)7.8(P8W48O184)Cl8]41.4- entities linked through formate ligands. The uranyl species are located either in the coordinating sites of the macrocycle [P8W48O184]40- or at its surface. Further studies of the molecule by SAXS and TEM show that the 1D chain collapses to give rise to the formation of polydisperse spherically aggregated species with an average radius of 129 Å.,Development and Evolution of Mechanistic Understanding in Iron-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592421,Accounts of chemical research,2019 05 15,"Since the pioneering work of Kochi in the 1970s, iron has attracted great interest for cross-coupling catalysis due to its low cost and toxicity as well as its potential for novel reactivity compared to analogous reactions with precious metals like palladium. Today there are numerous iron-based cross-coupling methodologies available, including challenging alkyl-alkyl and enantioselective methods. Furthermore, cross-couplings with simple ferric salts and additives like NMP and TMEDA ( N-methylpyrrolidone and tetramethylethylenediamine) continue to attract interest in pharmaceutical applications. Despite the tremendous advances in iron cross-coupling methodologies, in situ formed and reactive iron species and the underlying mechanisms of catalysis remain poorly understood in many cases, inhibiting mechanism-driven methodology development in this field. This lack of mechanism-driven development has been due, in part, to the challenges of applying traditional characterization methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to iron chemistry due to the multitude of paramagnetic species that can form in situ. The application of a broad array of inorganic spectroscopic methods (e.g., electron paramagnetic resonance, 57Fe Mössbauer, and magnetic circular dichroism) removes this barrier and has revolutionized our ability to evaluate iron speciation. In conjunction with inorganic syntheses of unstable organoiron intermediates and combined inorganic spectroscopy/gas chromatography studies to evaluate in situ iron reactivity, this approach has dramatically evolved our understanding of in situ iron speciation, reactivity, and mechanisms in iron-catalyzed cross-coupling over the past 5 years. This Account focuses on the key advances made in obtaining mechanistic insight in iron-catalyzed carbon-carbon cross-couplings using simple ferric salts, iron-bisphosphines, and iron- N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Our studies of ferric salt catalysis have resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented iron-methyl cluster, allowing us to identify a novel reaction pathway and solve a decades-old mystery in iron chemistry. NMP has also been identified as a key to accessing more stable intermediates in reactions containing nucleophiles with and without β-hydrogens. In iron-bisphosphine chemistry, we have identified several series of transmetalated iron(II)-bisphosphine complexes containing mesityl, phenyl, and alkynyl nucleophile-derived ligands, where mesityl systems were found to be unreliable analogues to phenyls. Finally, in iron-NHC cross-coupling, unique chelation effects were observed in cases where nucleophile-derived ligands contained coordinating functional groups. As with the bisphosphine case, high-spin iron(II) complexes were shown to be reactive and selective in cross-coupling. Overall, these studies have demonstrated key aspects of iron cross-coupling and the utility of detailed speciation and mechanistic studies for the rational improvement and development of iron cross-coupling methods.",Versatile Types of Organic/Inorganic Nanohybrids: From Strategic Design to Biomedical Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592420,Chemical reviews,2019 02 13,"Organic/inorganic nanohybrids have attracted widespread interests due to their favorable properties and promising applications in biomedical areas. Great efforts have been made to design and fabricate versatile nanohybrids. Among different organic components, diverse polymers offer unique avenues for multifunctional systems with collective properties. This review focuses on the design, properties, and biomedical applications of organic/inorganic nanohybrids fabricated from inorganic nanoparticles and polymers. We begin with a brief introduction to a variety of strategies for the fabrication of functional organic/inorganic nanohybrids. Then the properties and functions of nanohybrids are discussed, including properties from organic and inorganic parts, synergistic properties, morphology-dependent properties, and self-assembly of nanohybrids. After that, current situations of nanohybrids applied for imaging, therapy, and imaging-guided therapy are demonstrated.

In this study, we find that 10% SbGe alloying in GeTe modifies the phonon dispersions significantly, closes the acoustic-optical phonon band gap, increases the phonon-phonon scattering rates, and reduces the phonon group velocities. These changes, together with grain boundaries, nanoprecipitates, and planar vacancies, lead to a significant decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, an extra 2-6% Zn alloying decreases the energy offset between valence band edges at L and Σ points in Ge1- xSb xTe that is found to be induced by the Ge 4s2 lone pairs. Since Zn is free of s2 lone pair electrons, substituting Ge with Zn atoms can consequently diminish the Ge 4s2 lone-pair characters and reduce the energy offset, resulting in two energetically merged valence band maxima. The refined band structures render a power factor up to 40 μW cm-1 K-2 in Ge0.86Sb0.1Zn0.04Te. Ultimately, a superhigh zT of 2.2 is achieved. This study clarifies the impacts of high-concentration substitutional atoms on phonon band structure, phonon-phonon scattering rates, and the convergence of electron valence band edges, which could provide guidelines for developing high-performance thermoelectric materials.","Targeted Modification of the Cationic Anticancer Peptide HPRP-A1 with iRGD To Improve Specificity, Penetration, and Tumor-Tissue Accumulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592418,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"The chimeric peptide HPRP-A1-iRGD, composed of a chemically conjugated tumor-homing/penetration domain (iRGD) and a cationic anticancer peptide domain (HPRP-A1), was used to study the effect of targeted modification to enhance the peptide's specificity, penetration, and tumor accumulation ability. The iRGD domain exhibits tumor-targeting and tumor-penetrating activities by specifically binding to the neuropilin-1 receptor. Acting as a homing/penetration domain, iRGD contributed to enhancing the tumor selectivity, permeability, and targeting of HPRP-A1 by targeted receptor dependence. As the anticancer active domain, HPRP-A1 kills cancer cells by disrupting the cell membrane and inducing apoptosis. The in vitro membrane selectivity toward cancer cells, such as A549 and MDA-MB-23, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), normal cells, the penetrability assessment in the A549 3D multiple cell sphere model, and the in vivo tumor-tissue accumulation test in the A549 xenograft model indicated that HPRP-A1-iRGD exhibited significant increases in the selectivity toward membranes that highly express NRP-1, the penetration distance in 3D multiple cell spheres, and the accumulation in tumor tissues after intravenous injection, compared with HPRP-A1 alone. The mechanism of the enhanced targeting ability of HPRP-A1-iRGD was demonstrated by the pull-down assay and biolayer interferometry test, which indicated that the chimeric peptide could specifically bind to the neuropilin-1 protein with high affinity. We believe that chemical conjugation with iRGD to increase the specificity, penetration, and tumor-tissue accumulation of HPRP-A1 is an effective and promising approach for the targeted modification of peptides as anticancer therapeutics."

In this work, we demonstrate a skin-like, dynamically stretchable, planar supercapacitor (SPS). The SPS consists of buckled manganese/molybdenum (Mn/Mo) mixed oxide@multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes; organic gel polymer electrolyte of adiponitrile, succinonitrile, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, and poly(methyl methacrylate); and a porous, elastomeric substrate. The addition of an Mn/Mo mixed oxide to the MWCNT film produces an 8-fold increase in the areal capacitance. The use of an organic solvent-based electrolyte enhances the operation cell voltage to 2 V and air stability to one month under ambient air conditions. The fabricated planar supercapacitors are biaxially stretchable up to 50% strain and maintain ∼90% of their initial capacitance after 1000 repetitive stretching/releasing cycles. Furthermore, the SPS exhibits stable electrochemical performance under dynamic stretching in real time regardless of the strain rate and performs reliably during repetitive bending/spreading motions of an index finger while attached to skin.",Plasmonic and Photothermal Immunoassay via Enzyme-Triggered Crystal Growth on Gold Nanostars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592404,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Immunoassay is commonly used for the detection of disease biomarkers, but advanced instruments and professional operating are often needed with current techniques. The facile readout strategy for immunoassay is mainly limited to the gold nanoparticles-based colorimetric detection. Here, we show that photothermal nanoparticles can be applied for biosensing and immunoassay with temperature as readout. We develop a plasmonic and photothermal immunoassay that allows straightforward readout by color and temperature based on crystal growth, without advanced equipment. It is demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase-triggered silver deposition on the surface of gold nanostars causes a large blue shift in the localized surface plasmon resonance of the nanosensor, accompanied by photothermal conversion efficiency changes. This approach also allows dual-readout of immunoassays with high sensitivity and great accuracy for the detection of prostate-specific antigen in complex samples.

However, increasing the drug loading capacity and regulating the release system to adapt to the microenvironment after myocardial infarction face a huge challenge. In this research, an ROS-sensitive injectable hydrogel strengthened by self-nanodrugs was constructed. A hyperbranched ROS-sensitive macromer (HB-PBAE) with multiacrylate end groups was synthesized through dynamic controlled Michael addition. Meanwhile, a simple protocol based on dopamine polymerization was employed to generate a polydopamine (PDA) layer deposited on the tanshinone IIA (TIIA) nanoparticles (NPs) formed from spontaneous hydrophobic self-assembly. The HB-PBAE reacted with thiolate-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) to form an in situ hydrogel, where TIIA@PDA NPs can be conveniently entrapped through the chemical cross-link between thiolate and quinone groups on PDA, which doubles the modulus of hydrogels. The in vivo degradation behavior of the hydrogels was characterized by MRI, exhibiting a much slower degradation behavior that is markedly different from that of in vitro. Importantly, a significant improvement of cardiac functions was achieved after hydrogel injection in terms of increased ejection fraction and decreased infarction size, accompanied by inhibition of the expression of inflammation factors, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α.",Morpholino Oligonucleotide Cross-Linked Hydrogels as Portable Optical Oligonucleotide Biosensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592402,ACS sensors,2019 01 25,"Morpholino Oligonucleotides (MOs), an uncharged DNA analogue, are functionalized with an acrylamide moiety and incorporated into polymer hydrogels as responsive cross-links for microRNA sequence detection.

To tackle this issue, we constructed core-satellite ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs, which consist of gelatin (Gel) nanoparticles (NPs) with payloads of near-infrared fluorochrome indocyanine green (ICG) and chemo-drug doxorubicin (DOX) and surrounding CuS NPs. The fluorescence of ICG was initially shielded by satellite CuS NPs within the intact ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs and increased in proportion to the amount of DOX released from NMs in response to enzyme-activated NMs degradation. For more comprehensive understanding of the drug-release profile, a theoretical model derived from computer simulation was employed to reconstruct the enzyme-activatable drug release of the ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs, which demonstrated the underlying kinetics functional relationship between the released DOX amount and recovered ICG fluorescence intensity. The kinetics of drug release in vivo was assessed by administrating ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs both locally and systemically into MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice. Upon accumulation of ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs in the tumor, overexpressed enzymes triggered the degradation of the gelatin scaffold as well as the release of DOX and ICG, which can be visually depicted with the ICG fluorescence signal increasing only in the tumor area by fluorescence imaging. Additionally, the photoacoustic signal from CuS NPs was independent from the physical status of ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs and hence was utilized for real-time NMs tracking. Thus, by taking advantage of the core-satellite architecture and NMs degradability in tumor site, the DOX release profile of ICG/DOX@Gel-CuS NMs was monitored by fluorescence and photoacoustic dual-modal imaging in a real-time noninvasive manner.",Composition-Morphology Correlation in PTB7-Th/PC71BM Blend Films for Organic Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592400,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"From a morphological perspective, the understanding of the influence of the [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) content on the morphology of the active layer is not complete in organic solar cells (OSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration based on the low-bandgap polymer poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2- b;4,5- b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl- alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4- b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th). In this work, we obtain the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.5% for BHJ organic solar cells (OSCs) with a PTB7-Th/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1.5. To understand the differences in PCEs caused by the PC71BM content, we investigate the morphology of PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend films in detail by determining the domain sizes, the polymer crystal structure, optical properties, and vertical composition as a function of the PC71BM concentration. The surface morphology is examined with atomic force microscopy, and the inner film morphology is probed with grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. The PTB7-Th crystal structure is characterized with grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and UV/vis spectroscopy. X-ray reflectivity is employed to yield information about the film vertical composition. The results show that in PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend films, the increase of PC71BM content leads to an enhanced microphase separation and a decreased polymer crystallinity. Moreover, a high PC71BM concentration is found to decrease the polymer domain sizes and crystal sizes and to promote polymer conjugation length and formation of fullerene-rich and/or polymer-rich layers. The differences in photovoltaic performance are well explained by these findings.","A Novel Chemiluminescent Probe Based on 1,2-Dioxetane Scaffold for Imaging Cysteine in Living Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592399,ACS sensors,2019 01 25,"A novel chemiluminescent probe for detection of cysteine (Cys) from other biothiols has been reported by utilizing the excellent chemiluminescent Schaap's adamantylidene-dioxetane scaffold.

Deficiencies in vitamins, minerals and polyphenolic compounds, whose main sources are fruit and vegetables (F&V), may predispose to these diseases. The PICO (Patient, Intervention of interest, Comparison or Control Intervention, and Outcome) question was: What is the effect of F&V intake on the outcomes of periodontal diseases, observed in either experimental or observational studies of human populations suffering from periodontitis or gingivitis, compared to controls without intervention or healthy people.The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol for search strategy, selection criteria and data extraction. The searched databases included MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar. A total of 181 potentially relevant articles were identified, which were then evaluated according to pre-specified criteria relating to relevance and quality. Finally, 15 articles were selected for review. Four articles described intervention studies, 3 reported on prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and 8 concerned cross-sectional studies. A total of 10,604 people aged 15-90 years took part in the studies. On the basis of the research it can be concluded that the consumption of at least 5 servings of F&V per day may prevent the progression of periodontal diseases, especially periodontitis, and even tooth loss. Moreover, incorporation of specific F&V into the diet or, alternatively, their lyophilized forms, and nutritional education activities seem to support the standard of care therapy of gingivitis and periodontitis. However, further observational and well-designed experimental studies, with homogeneous periodontal status outcomes, are needed to confirm these findings. Furthermore, professional dietetics care for periodontal patients should become an integral component of the healthcare program.",Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) for Knee Osteoarthritis: Repeated MSC Dosing Is Superior to a Single MSC Dose and to Hyaluronic Acid in a Controlled Randomized Phase I/II Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592390,Stem cells translational medicine,2019 03 08,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability. Although conventional treatments show modest benefits, pilot and phase I/II trials with bone marrow (BM) and adipose-derived (AD) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) point to the feasibility, safety, and occurrence of clinical and structural improvement in focal or diffuse disease. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the intra-articular injection of single or repeated umbilical cord-derived (UC) MSCs in knee OA. UC-MSCs were cultured in an International Organization for Standardization 9001:2015 certified Good Manufacturing Practice-type Laboratory.

Clinical scores and magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were assessed throughout the 12 months follow-up. No severe adverse events were reported. Only MSC-treated patients experienced significant pain and function improvements from baseline (p = .001). At 12 months, Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC-A; pain subscale) reached significantly lower levels of pain in the MSC-2-treated group (1.1 ± 1.3) as compared with the HA group (4.3 ± 3.5; p = .04).

Higher solubility of hydrogen in supercritical carbon dioxide provides higher concentration of hydrogen on the rhodium surface, but lower that of the intermediate on rhodium surface, which suppresses the flipping of surface intermediate, leading to higher catalyst activities and cis selectivities to the corresponding ring-hydrogenated products as compared with those in organic solvents.","Very Early Introduction of Everolimus in De Novo Liver Transplantation: Results of a Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592371,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,2019 01 31,"Early everolimus (EVR) introduction and tacrolimus (TAC) minimization after liver transplantation may represent a novel immunosuppressant approach. This phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of early EVR initiation. Patients treated with corticosteroids, TAC, and basiliximab were randomized (2:1) to receive EVR (1.5 mg twice daily) on day 8 and to gradually minimize or withdraw TAC when EVR was stable at >5 ng/mL or to continue TAC at 6-12 ng/mL. The primary endpoint was the proportion of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR)-free patients at 3 months after transplant. As secondary endpoints, composite tBPAR plus graft/patient loss rate, renal function, TAC discontinuation rate, and adverse events were assessed. A total of 93 patients were treated with EVR, and 47 were controls. After 3 months from transplantation, 87.1% of patients with EVR and 95.7% of controls were tBPAR-free (P = 0.09); composite endpoint-free patients with EVR were 85% (versus 94%; P = 0.15). Also at 3 months, 37.6% patients were in monotherapy with EVR, and the tBPAR rate was 11.4%. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher with EVR, as early as 2 weeks after randomization. In the study group, higher rates of dyslipidemia (15% versus 6.4%), wound complication (18.32% versus 0%), and incisional hernia (25.8% versus 6.4%) were observed, whereas neurological disorders were more frequent in the control group (13.9% versus 31.9%; P < 0.05). In conclusion, an early EVR introduction and TAC minimization may represent a suitable approach when immediate preservation of renal function is crucial.","Strategies for Synthesis of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine Derivatives: Carbene Transformations or C-H Functionalizations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592370,"Chemical record (New York, N.Y.)",2018 12 28,"The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines are an important target in organic synthetic chemistry and have attracted critical attention of chemists mainly due to the discovery of the interesting properties exhibited by a great number of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives. Although lots of synthetic methods of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines have been developed in the past years, the chemistry community faces continuing challenges to use green reagents, maximize atom economy and enrich the functional group diversity of product. Undoubtedly, with its low cost and lack of environmentally hazardous byproducts, cascade reactions and C-H functionalizations are ideal strategies for this field. In this record we highlight some of our progress toward the goal to synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives through carbene transformations or C-H functionalizations.","Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to compare hard tissue changes following socket preservation using alloplasts, xenografts vs no grafting: Clinical and histological findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592368,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2019 02 07,To compare dimensional changes and bone quality of two different grafting materials used for socket preservation.,Adrenomedullin in heart failure: pathophysiology and therapeutic application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592365,European journal of heart failure,2019 05 21,"Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide hormone first discovered in 1993 in pheochromocytoma. It is synthesized by endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and diffuses freely between blood and interstitium. Excretion of ADM is stimulated by volume overload to maintain endothelial barrier function. Disruption of the ADM system therefore results in vascular leakage and systemic and pulmonary oedema. In addition, ADM inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ADM is strongly elevated in patients with sepsis and in patients with acute heart failure. Since hallmarks of both conditions are vascular leakage and tissue oedema, we hypothesize that ADM plays a compensatory role and may exert protective properties against fluid overload and tissue congestion. Recently, a new immunoassay that specifically measures the biologically active ADM (bio-ADM) has been developed, and might become a biomarker for tissue congestion. As a consequence, measurement of bio-ADM might potentially be used to guide diuretic therapy in patients with heart failure. In addition, ADM might be used to guide treatment of (pulmonary) oedema or even become a target for therapy. Adrecizumab is a humanized, monoclonal, non-neutralizing ADM-binding antibody with a half-life of 15 days. Adrecizumab binds at the N-terminal epitope of ADM, leaving the C-terminal side intact to bind to its receptor. Due to its high molecular weight, the antibody adrecizumab cannot cross the endothelial barrier and consequently remains in the circulation. The observation that adrecizumab increases plasma concentrations of ADM indicates that ADM-binding by adrecizumab is able to drain ADM from the interstitium into the circulation. We therefore hypothesize that administration of adrecizumab improves vascular integrity, leading to improvement of tissue congestion and thereby may improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. A phase II study with adrecizumab in patients with sepsis is ongoing and a phase II study on the effects of adrecizumab in patients with acute decompensated heart failure with elevated ADM is currently in preparation.",Polysubstance addiction vulnerability in mental illness: Concurrent alcohol and nicotine self-administration in the neurodevelopmental hippocampal lesion rat model of schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592364,Addiction biology,2018 12 28,"Multiple addictions frequently occur in patients with mental illness. However, basic research on the brain-based linkages between these comorbidities is extremely limited. Toward characterizing the first animal modeling of polysubstance use and addiction vulnerability in schizophrenia, adolescent rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHLs) and controls had 19 weekdays of 1 hour/day free access to alcohol/sucrose solutions (fading from 10% sucrose to 10% alcohol/2% sucrose on day 10) during postnatal days (PD 35-60). Starting in adulthood (PD 63), rats acquired lever pressing for concurrent oral alcohol (10% with 2% sucrose) and iv nicotine (0.015 mg/kg/injection) across 15 sessions. Subsequently, 10 operant extinction sessions and 3 reinstatement sessions examined drug seeking upon withholding of nicotine, then both nicotine and alcohol, then reintroduction. Adolescent alcohol consumption did not differ between NVHLs and controls. However, in adulthood, NVHLs showed increased lever pressing at alcohol and nicotine levers that progressed more strongly at the nicotine lever, even as most pressing by both groups was at the alcohol lever. In extinction, both groups showed expected declines in effort as drugs were withheld, but NVHLs persisted with greater pressing at both alcohol and nicotine levers. In reinstatement, alcohol reaccess increased pressing, with NVHLs showing greater nicotine lever activity overall. Developmental temporal-limbic abnormalities that produce mental illness can thus generate adult polydrug addiction vulnerability as a mechanism independent from putative cross-sensitization effects between addictive drugs. Further preclinical modeling of third-order (and higher) addiction-mental illness comorbidities may advance our understanding and treatment of these complex, yet common brain illnesses.",Optimal haemodynamics during left ventricular assist device support are associated with reduced haemocompatibility-related adverse events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592363,European journal of heart failure,2019 05 09,"Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy improves the haemodynamics of advanced heart failure patients.

A number of lesions are now amenable to a percutaneous procedure, eliminating or at least postponing the need for a surgical intervention. Due to the increase in the complexity of the procedures performed, the involvement of anesthesiologists and their close collaboration with the interventional cardiologists have increased. It is important to understand the physiology and pathophysiology of the patients and to anticipate the plans and the potential complications in order to manage them. We are witnessing a rise in the number of complex interventions in newborns and infants, such as balloon valvotomy (critical aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis), radio frequency perforation (of pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum), right ventricular outflow tract stenting (in Tetralogy of Fallot), ductal stenting (in some ductus-dependent pulmonary circulation), and combined with a surgical procedure (hybrid procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Multiple registries have been created in order to understand and improve outcomes of patients with congenital heart disease undergoing catheterization procedures and to develop performance and quality metrics, from which data regarding anesthetic-related risks can be extrapolated. Experienced personnel and a multidisciplinary team approach with direct communication among the team members is a must to ensure anticipation and management of critical events when they occur."

Yet, the yield strength values of medium- and high-entropy alloys investigated so far do not substantially exceed those of conventional alloys owing to the insufficient utilization of lattice distortion. Here it is shown that a simple VCoNi equiatomic medium-entropy alloy exhibits a near 1 GPa yield strength and good ductility, outperforming conventional solid-solution alloys. It is demonstrated that a wide fluctuation of the atomic bond distances in such alloys, i.e., severe lattice distortion, improves both yield stress and its sensitivity to grain size. In addition, the dislocation-mediated plasticity effectively enhances the strength-ductility relationship by generating nanosized dislocation substructures due to massive pinning. The results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a key property for identifying extra-strong materials for structural engineering applications.",Modification of nanocrystalline TiO2 coatings with molecularly imprinted TiO2 for uric acid recognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592338,Journal of molecular recognition : JMR,2019 05 15,"Combining the surface modification and molecular imprinting technique, a novel piezoelectric sensing platform with excellent molecular recognition capability was established for the detection of uric acid (UA) based on the immobilization of TiO2 nanoparticles onto quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrode and modification of molecularly imprinted TiO2 (MIT) layer on TiO2 nanoparticles.

However, patients with significant levels of organ dysfunction were excluded from all major clinical trials, leaving the clinical benefit in these subsets uncertain. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) specifically often require anticoagulation for acute or long-term indications such as venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, or mechanical heart valves. The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients with renal failure is less certain, however, particularly with DOACs which have altered pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure and limited observational data on their use in this population. In this review, we compile the most up to date data on the DOAC use in patients with CKD. DOAC use in patients with ESRD and advanced CKD is increasing despite the presence of a clear benefit, and with the potential for increased risk of bleeding compared to warfarin. Apixaban has the greatest amount of outcomes research supporting its use over warfarin in this patient population; however, further research on DOAC safety and efficacy in those with advanced CKD is still needed.",Realizing Ultralow Concentration Gelation of Graphene Oxide with Artificial Interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592336,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 02 25,"Understanding the chemistry in the gelation (interfacial assembly) of graphene oxide (GO) is very essential for the practical uses of graphene-based materials. Herein, with the designed artificial interfaces due to the introduction of water-miscible isopropanol, the gelation of GO is achieved in water at an ultralow concentration (0.1 mg mL-1 , the lowest ever-reported) with a solvothermal treatment. Intrinsically, with a lower intercalation energy, water shows much stronger attraction with GO than isopropanol, inducing a microphase separation in the miscible mixture of isopropanol and water. In the solvothermal process, the partially reduced GO sheets interact with each other along the water-isopropanol interface and assemble into interconnected frameworks. In general, the formation of the artificial interface results in locally concentrated GO in the water phase, which is the final driving force for the gelation at ultralow concentration. Thus, the threshold for the GO gelation concentration is dependent upon the water fraction in the mixture and water acts as the spacer to facilitate the gelation and final control of the resulting materials microstructure. This study enriches interface/gelation chemistry of GO and indicates a practical way for precise structural control and scale-up preparation of graphene-based materials.",Evaluation of a portable device for assessment of motility in stallion semen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592335,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,2019 05 02,"In horse breeding, quality assessment of semen before insemination is often requested. Non-laboratory-based techniques for objective analysis of sperm motility are thus of interest. The aim of this study was evaluating a portable device for semen analysis (Ongo sperm test) and its comparison with computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Semen was collected from 10 stallions, diluted to 100, 50 and 25 × 106  sperm/ml and analysed for total (TM) and progressive motility (PM). The final sperm concentration influenced total motility analysed by Ongo (p < 0.05) which was higher at 100 × 106  sperm/ml when compared to 25 × 106  sperm/ml (p < 0.05) but not when compared to 50 × 106  sperm/ml (n.s.). Sperm concentration did not influence total motility when assessed by SpermVision (n.s.). Agreement between methods was evaluated by correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plot. Intra-assay variation of Ongo was 5.2% ± 3.0 for TM and 6.9% ± 3.4 for PM. Correlation between Ongo and CASA was r = 0.79, 0.88 and 0.83 for 100, 50 and 25 × 106  sperm/ml for TM, and r = 0.87, 0.89 and 0.87 for PM, respectively (all p < 0.001). At the 100 and 25 mio/ml dilutions, the difference between the two systems deviated significantly from 0, while no such bias existed at the 50 mio/ml dilution (TM Ongo 85.0%, CASA 82.3%; PM Ongo 64.1%, CASA 66.1%).

Fundamental understandings gained from biological interfaces boost the control of wettability under different dimensionalities, such as 2D surfaces, 1D fibers and channels, and 3D architectures, thus permitting manipulation of the transport physics of liquids, gases, and ions, which profoundly impacts chemical reactions and material fabrication. In this context, the progress of new chemistry based on superwetting interfaces is highlighted, beginning with mass transport dynamics, including liquid, gas, and ion transport. In the following sections, the impacts of the superwettability-mediated transport dynamics on chemical reactions and material fabrication is discussed. Superwettability science has greatly enhanced the efficiency of chemical reactions, including photocatalytic, bioelectronic, electrochemical, and organic catalytic reactions, by realizing efficient mass transport. For material fabrication, superwetting interfaces are pivotal in the manipulation of the transport and microfluidic dynamics of liquids on solid surfaces, leading to the spatially regulated growth of low-dimensional single-crystalline arrays and high-quality polymer films.

SLC34A2 has been reported to play critical roles in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the researches about the biological roles of SLC34A2 in glioma have not yet been reported. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of SLC34A2 in clinical glioma tumor tissues and cell lines. The results demonstrated that SLC34A2 was generally overexpressed in both glioma tissues and cell lines. To further investigate the roles of SLC34A2 in glioma, lentivirus containing specific SLC34A2 short hairpin RNA (sh-SLC34A2) was used to infect glioma cell lines U251 and U87 for the knockdown of SLC34A2. The following studies proved that SLC34A2 knockdown exhibited suppressive effects on cell proliferation and migration/invasion. SLC34A2 knockdown also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, as evidenced by the increased E-cadherin expression, and the decreased N-cadherin and fibronectin expressions. Besides, knockdown of SLC34A2 enhanced the temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity of U251 and U87 cells. In vivo tumorigenicity assay demonstrated that SLC34A2 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, SLC34A2 knockdown suppressed the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in U87 cells. GW2974 (EGFR inhibitor) increased SLC34A2 knockdown-inhibited cell proliferation, migration/invasion, as well as enhanced SLC34A2 knockdown-increased the TMZ sensitivity of glioma cells. These findings suggested that SLC34A2 might be a new potential therapeutic target for the therapy of glioma patients."

Thus, confronting a universe of not-self-antigens, a potential host organism spread its resources widely. In the 1960s, the two signal hypothesis showed how this might work. However, in the 1970s an affinity/avidity model further proposed that anticipating a pathogen strategy of exploiting ""holes"" in the repertoire created by negative selection, hosts should also positively select near-self-reacting cells. A microbe mutating an antigen from a form foreign to its host to a form resembling that host should prevail over host defences with respect to that antigen. By mutating a step towards host self, along the path from non-self to self, it should come to dominate the microbe population. By progressive stepwise mutations, such microbes would become better adapted, to the detriment of their hosts. But they would lose this advantage if, as they mutated closer to host self, they encountered progressively stiffer host defences. Thus, as described in the affinity/avidity model, positive selection of lymphocytes for specificities that were very close to, but not quite, anti-self (ie, ""anti-near-self"") should be an important host adaptation. While positive selection affects both B and T cells, mechanisms are uncertain. Converging evidence from studies of lymphocyte activation, either polyclonally (with lectins as ""antigen-analogs"") or monoclonally (by specific antigen), supports the original generic affinity/avidity model for countering mutations towards host self.",Combination of D-dimer and carcinoembryonic antigen levels as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in advanced colorectal cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592316,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2018 12 28,"In view of the controversial findings on the utility of D-dimer and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as biomarkers in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), we evaluated the predictive and prognostic value of the D-dimer and CEA levels in unresectable advanced CRC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy. A total of 57 previously untreated patients with advanced CRC were enrolled. We assessed both plasma D-dimer and CEA levels at the start (D1 and CEA1) and after two cycles (D2 and CEA2) of chemotherapy. Based on the respective optimal cut-off values of 0.8 and 5.0 ng/mL for D1 and CEA1, respectively, patients were divided into low and high D-dimer or CEA groups. The results show that D1 and CEA1 levels were correlated (r = 0.392, P = 0.003). Mean CEA2 was reduced by 26.24 ng/mL in patients with partial response and stable disease and increased by 165.95 ng/mL in patients with progressive disease relative to the CEA1 level (P < 0.001). However, no correlation was evident between changes in the D-dimer levels and chemotherapy response (P = 0.441). The overall survival (OS) of patients with high D1 was shorter than that of patients with low D1 (median OS, 16 vs 29 months, P = 0.009). Multivariate analyses further demonstrated that D1 (P = 0.042) and chemotherapy response (P = 0.016), but not CEA, were independent prognostic factors for OS in advanced CRC. Taken together, our result found that changes in CEA levels may serve as a predictive biomarker of the chemotherapy response and baseline D-dimer levels as a prognostic biomarker of OS in patients with advanced CRC.",Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk-derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592315,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.",A weighted rebinned backprojection-filtration algorithm from partially beam-blocked data for a single-scan cone-beam CT with hybrid type scatter correction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592313,Medical physics,2019 03 13,"Scatter contamination constitutes a dominant source of degradation of image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).

As pathogenic bacteria in biofilms are a major concern in food industries due to their growing resistance to cleaning and sanitizing procedures, the development of photoactive surfaces exhibiting bactericidal properties is acknowledged as an effective approach to tackle bacterial contaminations. Our principal aim concerns the study of the photoactive top-layer thickness impact (from 80 nm to ~500 nm) on Listeria monocytogenes. Structural characterization of the TiO2 layers demonstrates that anatase and rutile phases are both present, depending on the film thickness. Photocatalytic activity of the samples has been evaluated through the degradation of aqueous methylene blue (MB) solutions under UVA light illumination for various time periods. The results show an efficiency rating increase according to TiO2 film thickness up to a threshold value close to 400 nm. Moreover, a significant decrease of the adherent bacteria number is observed after 20 min of UVA illumination. The quantitative study of the bactericidal activity associated with scanning electron microscopy observations of the postprocess bacteria damaged cells demonstrates the efficiency of the 240-nm-thick TiO2 coating sample. The results are correlated with the production of hydroxyl radicals during the process of photocatalysis.",Surface-based registration between CT and US for image-guided percutaneous renal access - A feasibility study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592311,Medical physics,2019 03 13,"As a crucial step in accessing the kidney in several minimally invasive interventions, percutaneous renal access (PRA) practicality and safety may be improved through the fusion of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) data.

Though these household pets can attack humans and other animals, they are also frequently victims of cruelty, neglect and theft. In human-oriented investigations, the tendency of domestic dogs to leave behind physical traces (such as hair) can serve as valuable links between crime scenes and suspects/victims. This demonstrated utility of canine biological evidence has created demand for genotyping marker sets for canine forensic genetic testing. Through research and casework, short tandem repeat (STR) panels have been shown to be very efficient for identity and parentage testing in dogs. However, there is an absence of comparative studies between different canine forensic identification kits. The Thermo Fisher Scientific Canine Genotypes ™ Panel 1.1 and 2.1 Kits were originally designed and developed for routine and forensic use respectively, although both kits can be used for either purpose. In this study, we evaluated both STR panels to determine how critical forensic genetic metrics are affected by panel-to-panel variation in marker composition and design. Our results show that although STR panel composition can influence estimates such as inbreeding, combined power of discrimination and combined probability of exclusion, greater average allele number values exhibited across all markers in Panel 2.1 facilitated significantly more precise estimates of random match probability (RMP) and combined probability of identity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a theta (θ) correction of 0.09 can be used to conservatively adjust RMPs generated from a small reference database of fewer than 50 samples, confirming that Panel 2.1 is a more robust forensic genotyping system than is Panel 1.1. for domestic dogs. We also demonstrate that opportunistic local sampling of fewer than 50 mixed-breed dogs can produce sufficient discriminatory and exclusionary power with either genotyping kit.","Culture-dependent hunt and characterization of iron-oxidizing bacteria in Baiyin Copper Mine, China, and their application in metals extraction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592309,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 04 18,"The exploration of microbial diversity in extremely acidic habitats has provided a vital base for the progression of minerals biotechnology. Three indigenous iron-oxidizing acidophilic bacterial strains were isolated through serial dilution of enriched bacterial culture from Baiyin Copper Mine Stope, China. The morphological, biochemical, physiological, and phylogenetic characteristics of isolates were investigated. These isolates were motile, Gram-negative, and curved shape with pleomorphism except isolate WG101 that was a straight rod. The optimum growth pH and temperature for all isolates were 1.5 and 30 °C, respectively, and showed extreme acidophilic nature. All the isolates showed obligate chemoautotrophic nature and used ferrous iron and pyrite as an energy source, however, isolates WG102 and WG103 were unable to use sulfur, while isolate WG101 could use elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sodium thiosulfate as an energy source. The phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the isolates WG101, WG102, and WG103 were homologous with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strain AS2 (99%), Leptospirillum ferriphilum strain YSK (98%), and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans strain L15 (98%), respectively. These bacterial isolates showed efficient copper and zinc dissolution from the ore. The metals dissolution rate of At. ferrooxidans strain WG101 was 54.5 ± 4.33% (copper) and 49.6 ± 5% (zinc). The metals recovery rate of L. ferriphilum strain WG102 was 45.7 ± 3.5% (copper) and 40.5 ± 2.5% (zinc). The recovery rate of copper and zinc was 49.6 ± 4% and 46.5 ± 3% respectively in the case of L. ferrooxidans strain WG103. The findings of this study are consistent with the notion that the indigenous bacteria are more efficient in minerals dissolution.",Evidence for a young adult face bias in accuracy and consensus of age estimates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592308,"British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2018 12 28,"Adults' face processing may be specialized for the dimensions of young adult faces. For example, young and older adults exhibit increased accuracy in normality judgments and greater agreement in attractiveness ratings for young versus older adult faces. The present study was designed to examine whether there is a similar young adult face bias in facial age estimates. In Experiment 1, we created a face age continuum by morphing an averaged young adult face with an averaged older adult face in 5% increments, for a total of 21 faces ranging from 0 to 100% old. Young and older adults estimated facial age for three stimulus age categories [young (morphs 0-30%), middle-aged (morphs 35-65%), and older adult (morphs 70-100%)]. Both age groups showed the least differentiation in age estimates for young adult faces, despite showing greater consensus across participants in estimates for young faces. In Experiment 2, young and older adults made age estimates for individual young and older adult identities. Both age groups were more accurate and showed greater consensus in age estimates for young faces. Collectively, these results provide evidence for a bias in processing young adult faces beyond that which is often observed in recognition and normality/attractiveness judgment tasks.",Modiolar rotational cheiloplasty: Addressing the central oval in facial paralysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592307,The Laryngoscope,2018 12 28,"Current static reanimation of the midface fails to provide adequate functional and aesthetic improvement; there is a need for more effective static correction of the ptotic midface.

Moreover, it was previously demonstrated that miR‑210 alleviates lipopolysaccharide‑stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that miR‑210 is able to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. However, it remains unclear whether miR‑210, similar to miR‑155, affects the progress of hepatitis B by regulating macrophage function. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect miR‑210 levels in serum and cells. HBV‑associated antigens stimulated different types of macrophages and facilitated the observation of the effects of these antigens on miR‑210 expression in macrophages. Co‑culture of peripheral blood monocytes from healthy controls and the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was conducted to evaluate the effect of HBV‑associated elements in the serum on the expression of the macrophage miR‑210 in vivo. It was observed that miR‑210 expression levels were decreased in the peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) and serum of patients with CHB and negatively associated with serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, but not other clinical parameters including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, anti‑HBe antibody (HBeAb) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and HBV‑DNA. Notably, it was demonstrated that miR‑210 expression was not affected by treatment with HBV‑associated antigens in different types of macrophages. Notably, the serum of patients with CHB was able to markedly downregulate the miR‑210 expression of PBMs in healthy controls. These findings suggested that, unlike the induction of miR‑155 by HBeAg, there may be certain other elements, apart from HBV‑associated antigens, regulating miR‑210 levels in the serum and PBMs of patients with CHB that affect macrophage activation.",SHCBP1 is a novel target and exhibits tumor‑promoting effects in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592290,Oncology reports,2019 03 05,"The present study investigated the expression and potential influence of SHC SH2 domain‑binding protein 1 (SHCBP1) in gastric cancer (GC) cells. SHCBP1 is closely related to cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, but its role in GC remains unclear. The TCGA database revealed that SHCBP1 is highly expressed in GC tissues. Furthermore, SHCBP1 was revealed to be highly expressed in GC cell lines MGC‑803 and SGC‑7901 cells, and downregulation of SHCBP1 significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation. Furthermore, SHCBP1 expression promoted cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. Since the CDK4, cyclin D1 and caspase family proteins play important roles in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, it was examined whether there was an association between SHCBP1 and these signaling pathways in GC. Our results revealed that SHCBP1 promoted cell cycle progression by regulating the CDK4‑cyclin D1 cascade and suppressed caspase‑3, caspase PARP‑dependent apoptotic pathways. Cell invasion and metastasis experiments also revealed that SHCBP1 promoted tumor growth and invasiveness. These tumor‑promoting functions of SHCBP1 may provide a potential molecular basis for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of GC.",Integrating modern approaches to pathogenetic concepts of malignant transformation of endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592289,Oncology reports,2019 03 11,"In the present study, we summarize the role of the shared and independent (epi)genetic background between endometrioid carcinoma (EC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), two histological subtypes of endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC). Using the PubMed database, we conducted a literature review of various studies related to the malignant transformation of endometriosis. Both endometriosis and EAOC face potential environmental hazards, including hemoglobin (Hb), heme and free iron, which induces DNA damage and mutations. Although EC is distinguished from CCC due to different morphologies, both represent common environmental profiles and maintain the similar (epi)genomic abnormalities with multiple overlaps and share similar molecular signatures. By contrast, EAOC also has disease-specific gene signatures corresponding with each histological subtype: Estrogen receptor promotes EC cell proliferation ('go') and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) induces CCC cell cycle arrest ('stop') under oxidative stress conditions. This model underscores a subtype-dependent 'go or stop' dichotomy, possibly through better ability to adapt in a changing environment. It was found that cyst fluid Hb and iron concentrations were significantly lower in EAOC when compared to benign ovarian endometrioma (OE), supporting the hypothesis that the redox imbalance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of EAOC. There are at least two phases of iron carcinogenesis and tumor progression: The initial wave of iron-induced oxidative stress and DNA mutations would be followed by the second big wave of subsequent synthesis of the antioxidants, which diminishes cellular oxidative stress capacity, increases apoptosis resistance and promotes tumor initiation and progression. Special emphasis is given to novel pathophysiological concepts of malignant transformation of endometriosis.",Prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome mosaicism with two marker chromosomes in three cell lines and a review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592288,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 31,"The present study described the diagnosis of a fetus with sex chromosome mosaicism in three cell lines and two marker chromosomes. A 24‑year‑old woman underwent amniocentesis at 21 weeks and 4 days of gestation due to noninvasive prenatal testing identifying that the fetus had sex chromosome abnormalities. Amniotic cell culture revealed a karyotype of 45,X[13]/46,X,+mar1[6]/46,X,+mar2[9], and prenatal ultrasound was unremarkable. The woman underwent repeat amniocentesis at 23 weeks and 4 days of gestation for molecular detection. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis on uncultured amniocytes revealed that the fetus had two Y chromosomes and 7.8‑Mb deletions in Yq11.222q12. The deletion regions included DAZ, RBMY and PRY genes, which could cause spermatogenesis obstacle and sterility. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using centromeric probes DXZ1/DYZ3/D18Z1 was performed on uncultured amniocytes to verify the two marker chromosomes to be Y chromosome derivatives. According to these examinations, the mar1 was identified as a derivative of the Y chromosome with a deletion in Yq11.222q12, and the mar2 was identified as a dicentric derivative of the Y chromosome. The molecular karyotype was therefore 45,X,ish(DXZ1+, DYZ3‑,D18Z1++)[5]/46,X,del(Y)(q11.222),ish(DXZ1+,DYZ3+,D18Z1++)[11]/46, X,idic(Y)(q11.222),ish(DXZ1+,DYZ3++,D18Z1++)[14]. The comprehensive use of cytogenetic, SNP array and FISH detections was advantageous for accurately identifying the karyotype, identifying the origin of the marker chromosome and preparing effective genetic counseling.",Astrocytes enhance the tolerance of rat cortical neurons to glutamate excitotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592287,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 24,"Glutamate excitotoxicity is responsible for neuronal death in acute neurological disorders, including stroke, trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are the main cells for the removal of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and may affect the tolerance of neurons to the glutamate excitotoxicity. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the tolerance of rat cortical neurons to glutamate excitotoxicity in the presence and absence of astrocytes. Rat cortical neurons in the presence or absence of astrocytes were exposed to different concentrations of glutamate (10‑2,000 µM) and 10 µM glycine for different incubation periods. After 24 h, the Cell Counting kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay was used to measure the cytotoxicity to neurons in the presence or absence of astrocytes. According to the results, in the absence of astrocytes, glutamate induced a concentration‑dependent decrease of neuronal survival rate compared with the control rat cortical neurons, and the neurotoxic half‑maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 15, 30 and 60 min was 364.5, 258.5 and 138.3 µM, respectively. Furthermore, in the presence of astrocytes, glutamate induced a concentration‑dependent decrease of neuronal survival rate compared with the control rat cortical neurons, and the neurotoxic IC50 at 15, 30 and 60 min was 1,935, 932.8 and 789.3 µM, respectively. However, astrocytic toxicity was not observed when the rat cortical astrocytes alone were exposed to different concentrations of glutamate (500, 1,000 and 2,000 µM) for 6, 12 and 24 h. In conclusion, the glutamate‑induced neurotoxic IC50 values at 15, 30 and 60 min were respectively higher in the presence of astrocytes as compared with those in the absence of astrocytes, suggesting that astrocytes can protect against rat cortical neuronal acute damage induced by glutamate.",miR‑498 inhibits the growth and metastasis of liver cancer by targeting ZEB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592286,Oncology reports,2019 03 05,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the growth, metastasis and therapeutic resistance of liver cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that miR‑498 is aberrantly expressed in several human malignancies. However, the role and underlying mechanism of miR‑498 in liver cancer remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles and clinical value of miR‑498 in liver cancer. We found that the miR‑498 expression level was significantly lower in liver cancer patient tissues than that in healthy control tissues. The expression of miR‑498 was also decreased in liver cancer cell lines compared to that noted in a normal human normal liver cell line. miR‑498 overexpression markedly inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. miR‑498 overexpression induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis while it suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer cells. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay further identified zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) as a novel target of miR‑498. Furthermore, ZEB2 knockdown recapitulated the inhibitory effects of miR‑498 overexpression in liver cancer cells. ZEB2 overexpression rescued the inhibition of liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by miR‑498, indicating that ZEB2 acts as a downstream effector of miR‑498 in liver cancer cells. Thus, we demonstrated that miR‑498 suppresses the growth and metastasis of liver cancer cells, partly at least, by directly targeting ZEB2, suggesting that miR‑498 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and therapy of liver cancer.",Gambogenic acid inhibits the proliferation of small‑cell lung cancer cells by arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592285,Oncology reports,2019 03 11,"Gambogenic acid (GNA), which is an important active compound present in gamboge, exerts anticancer activity in various types of tumor cells. However, the effect of GNA on small‑cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and the underlying mechanism involved still remain unclear. In the present study, GNA inhibited the proliferation and cell cycle progression of SCLC cells. GNA also promoted the apoptosis of SCLC cells in a dose‑dependent manner, which is associated with modulating the levels of proteins involved in apoptosis pathways in NCI‑H446 and NCI‑H1688 cells. The results demonstrated that GNA increased the level of cleaved caspase‑3, ‑8 and ‑9, and Bax but decreased the expression of anti‑apoptotic protein, Bcl‑2. Furthermore, similar results were obtained in a mouse tumor xenograft model. Additionally, GNA exhibit low toxicity in tissues when administered to mice in the SCLC xenograft models. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that GNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of SCLC cells and promoted cell apoptosis via cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis.",miR‑34a derived from mesenchymal stem cells stimulates senescence in glioma cells by inducing DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592284,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 31,"Insights into the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) in development and disease, particularly in cancer, have made miRNAs attractive tools and targets for novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of glioma. miR‑34a, as a well‑known tumor suppressor miRNA, is closely related with cellular senescence. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and possess the ability to deliver exogenous miRs to glioma cells to exert anti‑tumor effects. The present study investigated whether modified MSCs with miR‑34a possess an anti‑tumor function in glioma cells. A Transwell system was used to co‑culture U87 glioma cells and MSCs overexpressing miR‑34a, and cell proliferation and senescence assessed. The expression of senescence‑related genes p53, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn2c were tested using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression levels of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and γ‑H2A histone family, member X were detected by western blotting. Telomerase activity of U87 cells was examined using the Telo TAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA PLUS kit. The results demonstrated that the delivered exogenous miR‑34a from MSCs significantly decreased expression of the target gene SIRT1. In addition, the delivered miR‑34a decreased the proliferation of glioma cells and provoked the expression of senescence‑related genes p53, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn2c. In addition, upregulation of miR‑34a induced DNA damage, shortened telomere length and impaired telomerase activity. However, these pro‑senescent effects were reversed by forced SIRT1 upregulation. In conclusion, the results demonstrated a novel role for miR‑34a, inducing glioma cell senescence, whereas miR‑34a modulation of SIRT1, inducing DNA damage, is crucial for miRNA replacement therapy in glioma treatment.",Identification and validation of alternative splicing isoforms as novel biomarker candidates in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592283,Oncology reports,2019 03 11,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a transcriptional regulation mechanism that participates in multiple aspects of cancer. The present study aimed to identify differential AS events from tumor and non‑tumor samples and investigate the potential of AS as a source of candidate cancer diagnostic biomarkers. Deep RNA sequencing of three paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors and adjacent non‑tumors was applied to identify AS events. RT‑qPCR was performed on 45 HCC clinical samples to validate the splicing differences. The maximal information coefficient was first used to build an association between clinical features and AS changes. We identified 197 significantly differential skipped exon events, of which only 29% overlapped with the differentially expressed genes. The differentially spliced genes were mainly enriched in HCC‑characterized biological processes and pathways, clearly separating tumors from non‑tumors. We also validated the statistically significant splicing differences of three AS candidates (CEACAM1 exon 7, VPS29 exon 2 and ISOC2 exon 3). Furthermore, a clinicopathological analysis revealed that carcinoembryonic antigen‑related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) exon 7 was significantly correlated with the survival time, and VPS29 exon 2 was associated with cell differentiation stages. In conclusion, the findings of the three AS candidates in the present study could be beneficial in HCC prognosis and new treatment strategies.",LncRNA BANCR participates in polycystic ovary syndrome by promoting cell apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592281,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 24,"The long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) BANCR is a well‑studied lncRNA that serves pivotal roles in various malignancies; however, to the best of our knowledge, its involvement in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression levels of lncRNA BANCR were detected in granulosa cells (GCs) from patients with PCOS and non‑PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, GCs and the KGN human granulosa‑like tumor cell line were treated with insulin, and BANCR expression was detected. KGN cells were also transfected with a BANCR expression vector, after which, cell proliferation, apoptosis and the expression levels of pro‑apoptotic B‑cell lymphoma 2‑associated X protein (Bax) and p53 were detected by Cell Counting kit‑8 assay, MTT assay and western blotting, respectively. The results revealed that the expression levels of lncRNA BANCR in GCs were significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared with in non‑PCOS patients. In addition, insulin treatment significantly upregulated the expression of BANCR in GCs and KGN cells. Transfection with the BANCR expression vector significantly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of KGN cells, and significantly promoted the expression levels of pro‑apoptotic Bax and p53. Therefore, it may be concluded that lncRNA BANCR participates in PCOS by promoting cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Bax and p53."

Keratinocytes (KCs), as skin‑specific cells, serve an important role in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. In the present study, transcriptome data derived from psoriasis‑like KCs were used together with the reported transcriptome data from the skin/epidermis of patient with psoriasis, excluding known psoriasis‑associated genes that have been well described in the previous studies according to GeneCards database, to screen for novel psoriasis‑associated genes. According to the human expressed sequence tag of UniGene dataset, six genes that are located near psoriasis‑associated loci were highly expressed in skin. Among these six genes, four genes (epiregulin, NIPA like domain containing 4, serpin family B member 7 and WAP four‑disulfide core domain 12) were highly expressed in normal mouse epidermis (mainly KCs) and mouse psoriatic epidermis cells, but not in psoriatic dermis cells, which further emphasized the specificity of these genes. Furthermore, in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), SERPINB7 showed no difference in expression in immune‑activated tissues from SIRS and control mice. It was also found that the mRNA expression levels of SERPINB in lesional skin of patients with psoriasis were significantly higher than in non‑lesional psoriatic skin from the same patients. SERPINB7 may be a valuable candidate for further studies. In the present study, a method for identifying novel key pathogenic skin‑specific molecules is presented, which may be used for investigating and treating psoriasis.",Long non‑coding RNA DLX6‑AS1 is associated with malignant progression and promotes proliferation and invasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592268,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 24,"Despite being one of the most prevalent and fatal types of cancer worldwide, the biological details of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in diverse biological processes including cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression profile of distal‑less homeobox 6 antisense RNA 1 (DLX6‑AS1) in ESCC tissues and its contributions to ESCC cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. The expression of DLX6‑AS1 in a series of ESCC samples and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues was evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were performed to evaluate the roles of DLX6‑AS1 in the ESCC cell lines EC109 and KYSE30 transfected with DLX6‑AS1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Compared with the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues, DLX6‑AS1 expression was upregulated in the ESCC tissues and significantly associated with differentiation status, Tumor‑Node‑Metastasis stage, distant metastasis, and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of DLX6‑AS1 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration abilities, and enhanced the apoptotic rate in the two ESCC cell lines. Furthermore, western blot assays revealed that silencing DLX6‑AS1 partly influenced the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process in ESCC cells. These results imply that the oncogenic function of DLX6‑AS1 may be a novel candidate target for treating human ESCC.","lncRNA SNHG1 negatively regulates miRNA‑101‑3p to enhance the expression of ROCK1 and promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592267,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 05 20,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare malignant bone tumor that commonly occurs in children and adolescents and causes pain and swelling of the long bones of the legs and arms. Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro (mi)RNA‑101 are important in the initialization and progression of OS. However, the mechanism underlying the role of the lncRNA and miRNA‑101 in OS remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, through reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, it was first found that the lncRNA SNHG1 was upregulated and miRNA‑101‑3p was downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Second, the knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 induced cell apoptosis and maintained the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, which decreased the overall cell viability. Furthermore, according to a dual‑luciferase assay and western blot analysis, miRNA‑101‑3p was found to be a target of the lncRNA SNHG1 in OS, which further regulated the expression of Rho‑associated coiled‑coil‑containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1). It was found that the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/ATK pathway was inactivated and that epithelial‑mesenchymal transition was activated in OS cell lines with overexpression of the lncRNA SNHG1. Taken together, in OS cell lines, the lncRNA SNHG1 acted as an oncogene, and miRNA‑101‑3p was considered a tumor suppressor. The lncRNA SNHG1 promoted OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion by downregulating the expression of miRNA‑101‑3p, which enhanced the expression of ROCK1.",Normobaric oxygen inhibits AQP4 and NHE1 expression in experimental focal ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592266,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 05 20,"The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of 60% normobaric oxygen (NBO) on neurological function, brain edema and the expression of hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α), aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) in a rat model of cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats underwent transient focal cerebral ischemia via right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 120 min followed by 48 h of reperfusion. The rats were exposed to NBO at 60 and 100% or no treatment during reperfusion for 48 h. Neurological impairment score (NIS) was evaluated prior to the sacrifice of all rats. Hematoxylin‑eosin staining was performed after 48 h of reperfusion with NBO treatment. The infarct volume and brain water content (BWC) were determined to assess brain ischemic injury at 24 and 48 h. The levels of HIF‑1α, AQP4 and NHE1 expression in brain tissue samples were determined by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. During reperfusion, the protein and mRNA expression of HIF‑1α, AQP4 and NHE1 increased over time (up to 48 h). Exposure to 60 and 100% NBO during reperfusion following MCAO improved NIS, and alleviated BWC and infarct volume after 24 and 48 h, with further improvements in the 100% NBO group, compared with 60%. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of NBO may be associated with reduced AQP4 and NHE1 expression and increased HIF‑1α expression. However, 60% NBO therapy during reperfusion following an acute ischemic stroke did not achieve the same effects as 100% NBO. Further experimental studies should be performed to elucidate the mechanism and beneficial effects of 60% NBO, as it is more cost‑effective to use, compared with 100% NBO.",Tougu Xiaotong capsule exerts a therapeutic effect on knee osteoarthritis by regulating subchondral bone remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592265,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 31,"Previous studies have shown that Tougu Xiaotong capsule (TGXTC) has therapeutic effects on knee osteoarthritis (OA) through multiple targets. However, the mechanisms of action underlying its regulation of subchondral bone reconstruction remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGXTC on subchondral bone remodeling. Eighteen six-month-old New Zealand white rabbits of average sex were randomly divided into the normal, model and TGXTC groups. The rabbit knee OA model was induced by a modified Hulth's method in the model and TGXTC groups, but not the normal group. Five weeks postoperatively, intragastric administration of TGXTC was performed for four weeks. After drug administration, the medial femoral condyle and tibia were prepared for observation of cartilage histology via optical microscopy and micro-computed tomography, the serum was collected for biochemical parameters assay and the subchondral bone isolated from the lateral femoral condyle was collected for detection of IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA and protein by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that treatment with TGXTC significantly mitigated cartilage injury and subchondral bone damage, improved the parameter of subchondral trabecular bone, decreased alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, and significantly reducing the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand ratio, reduced the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA and protein. These results suggest that TGXTC could delay the pathological development of OA by regulating subchondral bone remodeling through regulation of bone formation and bone resorption and its relating inflammatory factors, and this may partly explain its clinical efficacy in the treatment of knee OA.",MicroRNA‑219 overexpression serves a protective role during liver fibrosis by targeting tumor growth factor β receptor 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592264,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 24,"Progressive liver fibrosis is the primary cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and leads to considerable morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are associated with fibrotic processes in liver disorders, although the exact role of miR‑219 remains unclear and the relevant mechanisms remain to be completely understood. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate the functional implications of miR‑219 expression during liver fibrosis. The present study reported that miR‑219 exhibited significantly reduced expression in serum from patients and that its expression was negatively associated with clinical stage. It was also demonstrated that miR‑219 attenuated angiotensin II‑induced expression of pro‑fibrotic markers, including α‑smooth muscle actin, atlastin GTPase 1 and collagen. Additionally, a CCl4‑induced mouse liver injury model was used to demonstrate that miR‑219 strongly suppressed liver fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the present study identified tumor growth factor β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) as a direct target gene of miR‑219. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that miR‑219 may regulate pro‑fibrotic markers by directly targeting the TGFBR2 gene and the miR‑219/TGFBR2 signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.",miR‑675 promotes colorectal cancer cell growth dependent on tumor suppressor DMTF1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592263,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 24,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a worldwide health concern, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the present study focuses on the investigation of oncogenic microRNA (miR)‑675‑3p, and its role in colorectal carcinogenesis. miR‑675‑3p expression was either overexpressed or inhibited in SW480 CRC cells in order to demonstrate its positive effect on the cell proliferation, as determined by MTS and flow cytometry. Then the present study utilized a luciferase assay to demonstrate that cyclin D binding myb like transcription factor 1 (DMTF1) was modulated by miR‑675‑3p directly at its 3'untranslated region. Overexpression or inhibition of miR‑675‑3p affected the expression of DMTF1, as determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. In addition, the overexpression of miR‑675‑3p promoted cell proliferation, whereas the additional introduction of DMTF1 rescued the overgrowth of the SW480 cells. These results were also confirmed in HT29 CRC cells. In summary, the results of the study demonstrated that miR‑675‑3p directly regulated the expression of DMTF1, which contributed to the further regulation of CRC cell proliferation.",The mitochondrial transfer RNAAsp A7551G mutation may contribute to the clinical expression of deafness associated with the A1555G mutation in a pedigree with hearing impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592262,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 31,"The role of mitochondrial (mt)DNA variations in hearing loss have been studied extensively; in particular, the well‑known pathogenic A1555G mutation in the human mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene is associated with aminoglycoside‑induced and non‑syndromic hearing loss. The present paper described a Chinese pedigree with hearing impairments. We first performed polymerase chain reaction and direct sequence analysis for the mtDNA genes. Additionally, the GJB2 gene mutations were also genotyped. Notably, this family had a very high penetrance of deafness (66.7 and 33.3%; including and excluding aminoglycoside use, respectively). Sequence analysis of the mtDNA genes from the matrilineal relatives identified the occurrence of A1555G mutation, as well as the tRNAAsp A7551G mutation. The A7551G mutation occurred at position 37 in the anticodon stem of tRNAAsp, which is extremely conserved among various species. The nucleotide at this position is often chemically modified and thus contributes to the maintenance of functional tRNAAsp, therefore, this mutation may cause an imbalance in the level of tRNAAsp and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction which is involved in the pathogenesis of hearing loss. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrated that the A7551G mutation may have contributed to the deafness phenotype caused by the A1555G mutation.","The novel long non‑coding RNA PRNCR1‑2 is involved in breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592261,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 31,"Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been reported to act as important mediators of tumor initiation and progression. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and pathogenic roles of the lncRNA prostate cancer‑associated non‑coding RNA (PRNCR)1‑2 in breast cancer. The expression levels of PRNCR1‑2 were detected in breast cancer tissues and numerous breast cancer cell lines using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Depletion of PRNCR1‑2 expression in breast cancer cells was conducted through small interfering RNA‑mediated silencing. Subsequently, cell proliferation was assessed by MTS assay, cell migration and invasion capacities were evaluated using the Transwell culture system, and cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein expression levels of the signaling components checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated (p)‑CHK2 and p‑AKT were measured by western blotting. The results demonstrated that PRNCR1‑2 expression was significantly elevated in breast cancer tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, depletion of PRNCR1‑2 in HS‑578T and MDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cells markedly suppressed their proliferation rates, migration and invasion capacities, and cell cycle progression; however, it had no effect on cell apoptosis. In addition, PRNCR1‑2 depletion increased CHK2 phosphorylation and decreased AKT phosphorylation in HS‑578T and MDA‑MB‑231 cells. In conclusion, the lncRNA PRNCR1‑2 may promote breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression.",Establishment of a Gentamicin Cochlear Poisoning Model in Guinea Pigs and Cochlear Nerve Endings Recognition of Ultrasound Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592260,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 03 08,"BACKGROUND Aminoglycosides, a type of gram-negative antibacterial, are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are highly potent and have satisfactory therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of life-threatening infections. Our study aimed to establish a gentamicin-induced cochlear injury model and to investigate the cochlear nerve endings' recognition of ultrasound signals. MATERIAL AND METHODS A guinea pig cochlear injury model was established by intraperitoneal injection of gentamycin. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) and fMRI an affected cerebral cortex region of interest (ROI) of the cerebral cortex blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect was induced by bone-conducted ultrasound. Immunofluorescence was used to detect expression of Prestin in outer hair cells, Otoferlin in inner hair cells, and cochlear hair cell microfilament protein (F-Actin). RESULTS For 30-35 KHz bone-conducted ultrasound, the induction rate of ABR threshold or ROI in the control group and the cochlear injury group was 40% and 0%, respectively, and for 80-90 KHz the induction rate was 20% and 20%, respectively. Gentamicin poisoning induced downregulation of expression of Prestin in cochlear outer cochlea, and Otoferlin and F-Actin in cochlear hair cells in different regions. CONCLUSIONS Gentamicin poisoning can cause different degrees of damage to cochlea hair cells in different regions. Guinea pigs with gentamicin poisoning can recognize high-frequency ultrasonic signals."

AUC potentially has an important relationship with the development of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD). We conducted a prospective study to describe the relationship between severe (grade III-IV) aGVHD and cyclosporine AUC in pediatric HSCT recipients. Pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic myeloablative HSCT and scheduled to receive cyclosporine for aGVHD prophylaxis participated in this multicenter study. Cyclosporine doses were adjusted based on C0 according to each center's standard of care. Cyclosporine AUC was determined weekly until neutrophil engraftment or Day +42, whichever was later. Associations between severe aGVHD and cyclosporine AUC and other patient and treatment-related factors were evaluated. Of the 110 children enrolled, 97 were evaluable. Thirty-seven (38%) children developed aGVHD; 13 (13.4%) had severe aGVHD. On univariate analysis, there was no association between severe aGVHD and cyclosporine AUC at any time point before engraftment. Future research should focus on refinement of C0 targets for cyclosporine therapeutic drug monitoring in HSCT.","Benefits, challenges, and needs of people living with cancer and their companion dogs: An exploratory study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592245,Journal of psychosocial oncology,2019 04 15,"The study examined whether the bond with a companion dog is associated with well-being among people with cancer, and described the perceived benefits, challenges, and needs accompanying the relationship with the dog.",Ultrasound as a Diagnostic and Interventional Aid at Point-of-Care in Dermatology Clinic: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592244,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2018 12 28,"Ultrasound is currently underutilized in dermatology practice. However, ultrasound provides clinicians with precise and unique information on cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions, while minimizing costs and complications related to more common and invasive diagnostic methods. We report a patient who presented with a tender subcutaneous mass that was diagnosed and treated using point-of-care ultrasound-guidance at the dermatology clinic. Ultrasound revealed features consistent with a ganglion cyst, which was subsequently injected with triamcinolone acetonide under ultrasound-guidance with resolution of symptoms upon follow-up one month later. Our study demonstrates the utility of ultrasound as an effective, time-efficient diagnostic and interventional aid that can modify dermatology practice.","Low-temperature organic phase change material microcapsules for asphalt pavement: preparation, characterisation and application.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592243,Journal of microencapsulation,2019 03 18,"Low-temperature phase change material (PCM) is a material that stores additional heat at elevated temperatures and releases energy when the temperature is below the limit. A way to solve the low-temperature disaster of asphalt pavement is desired to be developed. In this article, a two-component organic low-temperature PCM was encapsulated by melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin and finally reinforced with polypropylene. The reinforced PCM microcapsules were mixed with 70# SBS (Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene) modified asphalt in SMA-10 (Stone Matrix Asphalt-10) to form aggregates. The results showed that after adding 6.0% (w/w) reinforced PCM microcapsules, there was a significant delay compared to a blank sample with a maximum temperature difference of 1.8 °C when the temperature dropped to 0 °C, which proved that this method has a good potential in resisting low-temperature disasters on asphalt pavement and deserves further improvement.","Effectiveness and safety of omalizumab in severe, persistent IgE-mediated asthma in pediatric and adult patients: a real-world observational study in Egyptian population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592242,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2018 12 28,"Real-world studies on the effectiveness of omalizumab in Egyptian population with asthma are limited.

Undergraduates ( N = 408) were randomly assigned to either an experimental group where the perpetrator is a fraternity member or a control group where no fraternity information is given. Males rated perpetrators as less guilty and victims as more culpable when the perpetrator was a fraternity member, suggesting that sexual violence may be reinforced among fraternity members as they are both more likely to perpetrate sexual assault and less likely to be blamed.",Efficient estimation of a linear transformation model for current status data via penalized splines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592240,Statistical methods in medical research,2018 12 28,"We propose a flexible and computationally efficient penalized estimation method for a semi-parametric linear transformation model with current status data. To facilitate model fitting, the unknown monotone function is approximated by monotone B-splines, and a computationally efficient hybrid algorithm involving the Fisher scoring algorithm and the isotonic regression is developed. A goodness-of-fit test and model diagnostics are also considered. The asymptotic properties of the penalized estimators are established, including the optimal rate of convergence for the function estimator and the semi-parametric efficiency for the regression parameter estimators. An extensive numerical experiment is conducted to evaluate the finite-sample properties of the penalized estimators, and the methodology is further illustrated with two real studies.",Discussing Out-of-Pocket Costs With Patients: Shared Decision Making for Sacubitril-Valsartan in Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592239,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background ""Financial toxicity"" is a concern for patients, but little is known about how patients consider out-of-pocket cost in decisions. Sacubitril-valsartan provides a contemporary scenario to understand financial toxicity. It is guideline recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, yet out-of-pocket costs can be considerable. Methods and Results Structured interviews were conducted with 49 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction at heart failure clinics and inpatient services. Patient opinions of the drug and its value were solicited after description of benefits using graphical displays. Descriptive quantitative analysis of closed-ended responses was conducted, and qualitative descriptive analysis of text data was performed. Of participants, 92% (45/49) said that they would definitely or probably switch to sacubitril-valsartan if their physician recommended it and out-of-pocket cost was $5 more per month than their current medication. Only 43% (21/49) would do so if out-of-pocket cost was $100 more per month ( P<0.001). At least 40% across all income categories would be unlikely to take sacubitril-valsartan at $100 more per month. Participants exhibited heterogeneous approaches to cost in decision making and varied on their use and interpretation of probabilistic information. Few (20%) participants stated physicians had initiated a conversation about cost in the past year. Conclusions Out-of-pocket cost variation reflective of contemporary cost sharing substantially influenced stated willingness to take sacubitril-valsartan, a guideline-recommended therapy with mortality benefit. These findings suggest a need for cost transparency to promote shared decision making. They also demonstrate the complexity of cost discussion and need to study how to incorporate out-of-pocket cost into clinical decisions.",Modified Ride-on Cars as Early Mobility for Children with Mobility Limitations: A Scoping Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592238,Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics,2018 12 28,This study aims to systematically examine and map current available evidence describing the benefits of modified ride-on car use for young children with mobility limitations and identify potential applications to occupational and physical therapy practice while illuminating gaps in knowledge to be explored in future research.
