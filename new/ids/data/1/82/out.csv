In contrast to most other organisms, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe carries two Trm4/NSun2 homologs, Trm4a (SPAC17D4.04) and Trm4b (SPAC23C4.17). Here, we have employed tRNA methylome analysis to determine the dependence of cytosine-5 methylation (m5C) tRNA methylation in vivo on the two enzymes. Remarkably, Trm4a is responsible for all C48 methylation, which lies in the tRNA variable loop, as well as for C34 in tRNALeuCAA and tRNAProCGG, which are at the anticodon wobble position. Conversely, Trm4b methylates C49 and C50, which both lie in the TΨC-stem. Thus, S. pombe show an unusual separation of activities of the NSun2/Trm4 enzymes that are united in a single enzyme in other eukaryotes like humans, mice and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, in vitro activity assays showed that Trm4a displays intron-dependent methylation of C34, whereas Trm4b activity is independent of the intron. The absence of Trm4a, but not Trm4b, causes a mild resistance of S. pombe to calcium chloride.","Good and bad molecular fingerprints for human rhinovirus 3C protease inhibition: identification, validation, and application in designing of new inhibitors through Monte Carlo-based QSAR study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646829,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 01 31,"HRV 3 C protease (HRV 3Cpro) is an important target for common cold and upper respiratory tract infection. Keeping in view of the non-availability of drug for the treatment, newer computer-based modelling strategies should be applied to rationalize the process of antiviral drug discovery in order to decrease the valuable time and huge expenditure of the process. The present work demonstrates a structure wise optimization using Monte Carlo-based QSAR method that decomposes ligand compounds (in SMILES format) into several molecular fingerprints/descriptors. The current state-of-the-art in QSAR study involves the balance of correlation approach using four different sets: training, invisible training, calibration, and validation. The final models were also validated through mean absolute error, index of ideality of correlation, Y-randomization and applicability domain analysis. R2 and Q2 values for the best model were 0.8602, 0.8507 (training); 0.8435, 0.8331 (invisible training); 0.7424, 0.7020 (calibration); 0.5993, 0.5216 (validation), respectively. The process identified some molecular substructures as good and bad fingerprints depending on their effect to increase or decrease the HRV 3Cpro inhibition. Finally, new inhibitors were designed based on the fundamental concept to replace the bad fragments with the good fragments as well as including more good fragments into the structure. The study points out the importance of the fingerprint based drug design strategy through Monte Carlo optimization method in the modelling of HRV 3Cpro inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Therefore, school-based prevention programs are often developed to try to mitigate these issues. The attitudinal and behavioral changes stemming from school-based intervention programs are often the primary focus of outcome research, but it is also important to identify program feasibility (e.g., dosage, adherence) and acceptability (e.g., likeability). The current study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a high school classroom-based RA and SA intervention, Bringing in the Bystander-High School Curriculum (BITB-HSC); the BITB-HSC also includes a workshop and reading materials for school personnel and parents. Data were collected after the BITB-HSC was administered in high schools from students who participated in the program ( N = 970) and school personnel who were exposed to some components of the BITB-HSC and provided feedback ( N = 161). Results indicate that overall students were adherent to the BITB-HSC (e.g., attended sessions) and that the majority of students understood the information presented, thought the program was good, and liked the facilitators. School personnel data indicated that they were generally supportive of the program and found the school personnel workshop and handout helpful.

Therefore, two experiments were conducted to investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the first two eye fixations for specific recognition memory processes, that is, familiarity and recollection. In addition, we looked in detail at the unique contributions of (a) longer input duration and (b) additional information provided by a second fixation for familiarity- and recollection-based recognition, using a gaze-contingent stimulus presentation technique. The experiments showed that recollection- but not familiarity-based recognition increased with two compared to only one fixation, and that the second fixation boosted recollection both due to longer availability of the input and additional stimulus information gathered.",Beneficial Impact of Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity Program on Circulating Number and Functional Capacity of Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Children: The Crucial Role of Nitric Oxide and VEGF-A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646825,Pediatric exercise science,2019 01 16,Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) appear to interact with physical training.

Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations could provide important prior information for medical researchers. Therefore, reliable computational models are expected to be an effective supplement for inferring associations between miRNAs and diseases. In this study, we developed a novel calculative model named Negative Samples Extraction based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (NSEMDA). NSEMDA filtered reliable negative samples by two positive-unlabeled learning models, namely, the Spy and Rocchio techniques and calculated similarity weights for ambiguous samples. The positive samples, reliable negative samples and ambiguous samples with similarity weights were used to construct a Support Vector Machine-Similarity Weight model to predict miRNA-disease associations. NSEMDA improved the credibility of negative samples and reduced the impact of noise samples by introducing ambiguous samples with similarity weights to train prediction model. As a result, NSEMDA achieved the AUC of 0.8899 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8353 under local LOOCV. In 100 times 5-fold cross validation, NSEMDA obtained an average AUC of 0.8878 and standard deviation of 0.0014. These AUCs are higher than many classical models. Besides, we also carried out three kinds of case studies to evaluate the performance of NSEMDA. Among the top 50 potential related miRNAs of esophageal neoplasms, lung neoplasms and carcinoma hepatocellular predicted by NSEMDA, 46, 50 and 45 miRNAs were verified to be associated with the investigated disease by experimental evidences, respectively. Therefore, NSEMDA would be a reliable calculative model for inferring miRNA-disease associations.",Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646822,Circulation research,2019 03 29,"In observational studies, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension, and vice versa; however, the causality between these conditions remains to be determined."

We downloaded 130 transparency reports covering the period January 2013 to December 2016 from the website of Medicines Australia and carried out a descriptive analysis. For the most heavily funded organizations and their sponsors, we examined Public Summary Documents of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to identify relevant products under consideration for public reimbursement over the study period. Thirty-four pharmaceutical companies provided 1,482 sponsorships to 230 organizations, spending a total of AU$34,507,810. The top clinical areas in terms of amount of funding received were cancer, eye health, and nervous system disorders.

So far, PtdIns3P and ATG16L1 are the best known WIPI2 interaction partners. In the screening of novel binding proteins for WIPI2, we recently identified interactions between WIPI2 and MTORC1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1. With this clue, we uncovered that WIPI2 is a phosphorylation substrate of MTORC1 and a ubiquitination target of HUWE1. Further, by determining the phosphorylation site on WIPI2 targeted by MTORC1, we show that MTORC1-dependent phosphorylation directs WIPI2 to interact with HUWE1, leading to WIPI2 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. Finally, we provide evidence that this quantity control mechanism of WIPI2 is utilized by cells for not only the regulation of basal autophagy but also nutrient deprivation-stimulated autophagy. Together, these results indicate that WIPI2 protein level regulated by MTORC1 and HUWE1 is a pivotal determinant of cellular autophagy intensity. The findings firm up the role of MTORC1 as a master regulator of autophagy, suggesting that the quantity control of WIPI2 is a potential intervention point in autophagy-related physiopathological processes.

EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 or NP-Fe3O4 reaches the highest concentration in the infarction areas in 1 h. To evaluate the targeting ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4, a fluorochrome dye, Dir, was loaded into the nanoparticle. As shown by the in vivo organ multispectral fluorescence imaging, Dir-loaded EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 exhibited higher fluorescence than those of model rats treated with Dir-loaded NP-Fe3O4. Coronal frozen sections and transmission electron microscope further showed that EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 was mainly accumulated in the tissue factor exposure region of brain. The data indicated that the EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 targeted cerebral thrombosis and might be applied in the early diagnosis of intracranial thrombosis.",Risk Factors Associated With Altered Circulating Micro RNA -125b and Their Influences on Uremic Vascular Calcification Among Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646802,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 08,"Background Micro RNA -125b (miR-125b) has been shown to regulate vascular calcification ( VC ), and serum miR-125b levels are a potential biomarker for estimating the risk of uremic VC status. However, it is unknown whether clinical features, including chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder molecules, affect serum miR-125b levels. Methods and Results Patients receiving chronic dialysis for ≥3 months were recruited from different institutes. Serum miR-125b and chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder effectors, including intact parathyroid hormone, 25- OH -D, fibroblast growth factor-23, osteoprotegerin, and fetuin-A, were quantified. We used multivariate regression analyses to identify factors associated with low serum miR-125b levels and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve curve to derive optimal cutoffs for factors exhibiting close associations. Further regression analyses evaluated the influence of miR-125b on VC risk. Among 223 patients receiving chronic dialysis (mean age, 67.3 years; mean years of dialysis, 5.2), 54 (24.2%) had high serum miR-125b levels. Osteoprotegerin ( P=0.013), fibroblast growth factor-23 ( P=0.006), and fetuin-A ( P=0.036) were linearly associated with serum miR-125b levels. High osteoprotegerin levels independently correlated with high serum miR-125 levels. Adding serum miR-125b levels and serum osteoprotegerin levels (≥400 pg/mL) into models estimating the risk of uremic VC increased the area under receiver operating characteristic curve values (for models without miR-125b/osteoprotegerin, with miR-125b, and both: 0.74, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Conclusions Serum osteoprotegerin levels ≥400 pg/mL and serum miR-125b levels synergistically increased the accuracy of estimating VC risk among patients receiving chronic dialysis. Taking miR-125b and osteoprotegerin levels into consideration when estimating VC risk may be recommended.",Thrombotic/Thrombolytic Balance as a Cardiac Treatment Determinant in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus and Coronary Artery Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646801,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 08,"Background This study aimed to assess whether the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/tissue plasminogen activator ( PAI -1/ tPA ) ratio as a prothrombotic state is useful for optimizing cardiac treatment strategy.

The risk of major cardiac events in patients with high PAI -1/ tPA ratio was significantly higher when receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% CI , 1.16-2.93; P=0.01) than when receiving medical therapy, whereas that in patients with low PAI -1/ tPA ratio did not differ significantly between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI , 0.66-1.36; P=0.77); the interaction between the cardiac treatment strategy and PAI -1/ tPA ratio was significant ( P=0.02). However, regardless of the PAI -1/ tPA ratio, major cardiac event risk seemed to be lower in patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting than in those receiving medical therapy. Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, this study demonstrated that those with high PAI -1/ tPA ratio were at higher risks of major cardiac events when treated with percutaneous coronary intervention than when treated with intensive medical therapy.",Not Just Arterial Damage: Increased Incidence of Venous Thromboembolic Events in Cardiovascular Patients With Elevated Plasma Levels of Apolipoprotein CIII.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646800,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 08,"Background Apolipoprotein CIII (apo CIII ) is a crucial player in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, but may also act pleiotropically, provoking inflammatory responses and stimulating coagulation. Elevated apo CIII plasma levels have been associated with increased activity of coagulation factors. Since these features of prothrombotic diathesis are linked with venous thromboembolism ( VTE ), we hypothesized that apo CIII plays a role in VTE . Methods and Results We recorded nonfatal VTE events in 1020 patients (age 63.3±11.4 years; 29.1% women) with or without coronary artery disease (79.1% with coronary artery disease and 20.9% without coronary artery disease) during a long follow-up. Complete plasma lipid and apolipoproteins were available for all patients. Forty-five patients (4.4%) experienced nonfatal VTE events during a median follow-up period of 144 months. Apo CIII plasma concentration at enrollment was higher in patients with VTE compared with patients without VTE (12.2 [95% CI, 11.10-13.5] mg/dL vs 10.6 [95% CI, 10.4-10.9] mg/dL, respectively; P=0.011). Patients with apo CIII levels above the median value (10.6 mg/dL) exhibited an increased risk of VTE (incidence rate, 6.0 [95% CI , 4.0-8.0] vs 1.8 [95% CI, 0.7-2.9] VTE events/1000 person-years; unadjusted hazard ratio [ HR ], 3.42 [95% CI , 1.73-6.75]; P<0.001). This association was confirmed after adjustment for sex, age, coronary artery disease diagnosis, body mass index, hypertension, and anticoagulant treatment at enrollment ( HR , 2.66; 95% CI , 1.31-5.37 [ P=0.007]), with inclusion of lipid parameters in the Cox model (HR, 3.74; 95% CI , 1.24-11.33 [ P=0.019]), and even with exclusion of patients who died at follow-up ( HR, 3.92; 95% CI , 1.68-9.14 [ P=0.002]) or patients taking anticoagulants ( HR , 3.39; 95% CI , 1.72-6.69 [ P<0.001]). Conclusions Our results suggest that high plasma apo CIII concentrations may predict an increased risk of VTE in patients with cardiovascular disease.",Central Arterial Stiffness Is Associated With Structural Brain Damage and Poorer Cognitive Performance: The ARIC Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646799,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 08,"Background Central arterial stiffening and increased pulsatility, with consequent cerebral hypoperfusion, may result in structural brain damage and cognitive impairment. Methods and Results We analyzed a cross-sectional sample of ARIC - NCS (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive Study) participants (aged 67-90 years, 60% women) with measures of cognition (n=3703) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (n=1255). Central arterial hemodynamics were assessed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and pressure pulsatility (central pulse pressure). We derived factor scores for cognitive domains. Brain magnetic resonance imaging using 3-Tesla scanners quantified lacunar infarcts; cerebral microbleeds; and volumes of white matter hyperintensities, total brain, and the Alzheimer disease signature region. We used logistic regression, adjusted for demographics, apolipoprotein E ɛ4, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and select cardiovascular risk factors, to estimate the odds of lacunar infarcts or cerebral microbleeds. Linear regression, additionally adjusted for intracranial volume, estimated the difference in log-transformed volumes of white matter hyperintensities , total brain, and the Alzheimer disease signature region. We estimated the mean difference in cognitive factor scores across quartiles of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity or central pulse pressure using linear regression. Compared with participants in the lowest carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity quartile, participants in the highest quartile of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity had a greater burden of white matter hyperintensities ( P=0.007 for trend), smaller total brain volumes (-18.30 cm3; 95% CI , -27.54 to -9.07 cm3), and smaller Alzheimer disease signature region volumes (-1.48 cm3; 95% CI , -2.27 to -0.68 cm3). These participants also had lower scores in executive function/processing speed (β=-0.04 z score; 95% CI , -0.07 to -0.01 z score) and general cognition (β=-0.09 z score; 95% CI , -0.15 to -0.03 z score). Similar results were observed for central pulse pressure . Conclusions Central arterial hemodynamics were associated with structural brain damage and poorer cognitive performance among older adults.",A Retrospective Analysis of the use of Tap Water Iontophoresis for Focal Hyperhidrosis at a District General Hospital: The Patients' Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646797,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 01 16,"Tap water iontophoresis as a treatment for focal hyperhidrosis, is given as an initial series of treatments in hospital followed by home maintenance treatments. Our study assessed quality of life and perception of hyperhidrosis with the use of iontophoresis. All patients treated with iontophoresis at our hospital from 2012 - 2017 were retrospectively assessed (n = 82, mean age 34 years; 60% female). 50 of the 82 patients (mean age 34 years; 60% female) had a pre-treatment DLQI (mean 12.6). Twenty three of these patients (mean age 33 years; 60% female) had a paired pre- and post-treatment DLQI recorded. The average DLQI pre-treatment was 14.1 and post-treatment was 2.2. Therefore, the average reduction (improvement) was 11.9 (p < 0.05). 38 of the 82 patients (46%) completed a telephone interview (mean age 35 years; 65% female). Of this cohort, 24 had an improvement in HDSS following treatment, and the remaining 14 patients had no change. 9 patients (24%) bought their own iontophoresis machine. In these patients, there was a higher average improvement in HDSS (1.8), compared to the total interviewed cohort (1.0). In conclusion tap water iontophoresis can result in a significant improvement in perceived severity of hyperhidrosis and quality of life."

Advanced diseases accounted for 70% of patients at diagnosis. Most patients (93.1%) had positive staining for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The five-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 79.7% and 73.3%, respectively.

Two studies were conducted. Study 1 examined 225 typically developing (TD) children age 4 to 12. Results suggested that early recognition of complete faces and interpretation of emotional expression might depend on local processing abilities, while the recognition of masked faces and emotion expression matching seemed to share configural processing. Study 2 compared 22 children with Down syndrome (DS) to two TD groups matched on mental age (MA group) and chronological age (CA group). Results showed that children with DS processed the identity of complete faces (local processing) similarly to the MA and CA groups. In contrast, their performances for masked faces (configural processing) indicated a developmental delay as they were only comparable to the MA group. Children with DS were also able to identify the emotion expressions according to labels as well as the two control groups, while they had more difficulties on the matching condition. Furthermore, specific difficulties in processing the surprise expression were observed, rather than general difficulties in encoding emotion expressions. Finally, their performances on emotion matching tasks seemed to be supported by local information processing, which might explain their lower scores compared to CA controls that mainly used configural information. These results could aid in the development of targeted interventions for DS to improve their social skills."

The authors optimized moderately large structures of Cu/H/Cu, Cu/HCuH/Cu, Cu/H2/Cu, Cu/H2O/Cu, Cu/OH/Cu, Cu/O/Cu, and Cu/O2/Cu and calculated appropriate values for conductance and inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) properties of the contact junctions, elucidating them as being a possible outcome resulting from the exposure of copper electrodes to the atomic/molecular contaminant species. Here we also demonstrate the IETS properties, by means of ab initio calculations, which can determine the form of the junction geometries. Furthermore, we identify the bonding geometries at the interfaces of the copper electrodes that directly give rise to the specific IETS signatures that have been observed in recent experiments. Based on low-bias conductance and IETS calculations, for the specific case of water exposure of copper electrodes, it was concluded that a single hydrogen or a single oxygen atom bridging the copper electrodes is not responsible for the high conductance peak measurements. Regarding Model 4, where an individual water molecule is considered to be the bridging constituent, our computational results suggest that it has a relatively low probability of being an appropriate candidate. Based upon current computational results, the two hydrogens in Model 3 appear to be in molecular form, although they still form a bond with the adjacent copper atoms. Comparing computational with experimental results indicates that Model 3 is in acceptable agreement with available data.",Active escape dynamics: The effect of persistence on barrier crossing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646719,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"We study a system of non-interacting active particles, propelled by colored noises, characterized by an activity time τ, and confined by a double-well potential. A straightforward application of this system is the problem of barrier crossing of active particles, which has been studied only in the limit of small activity. When τ is sufficiently large, equilibrium-like approximations break down in the barrier crossing region. In the model under investigation, it emerges as a sort of ""negative temperature"" region, and numerical simulations confirm the presence of non-convex local velocity distributions. We propose, in the limit of large τ, approximate equations for the typical trajectories which successfully predict many aspects of the numerical results. The local breakdown of detailed balance and its relation with a recent definition of non-equilibrium heat exchange is also discussed.",Phononic heat transport in molecular junctions: Quantum effects and vibrational mismatch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646718,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"Problems of heat transport are ubiquitous to various technologies such as power generation, cooling, electronics, and thermoelectrics. In this paper, we advocate for the application of the quantum self-consistent reservoir method, which is based on the generalized quantum Langevin equation, to study phononic thermal conduction in molecular junctions. The method emulates phonon-phonon scattering processes while taking into account quantum effects and far-from-equilibrium (large temperature difference) conditions. We test the applicability of the method by simulating the thermal conductance of molecular junctions with one-dimensional molecules sandwiched between solid surfaces. Our results satisfy the expected behavior of the thermal conductance in anharmonic chains as a function of length, phonon scattering rate, and temperature, thus validating the computational scheme. Moreover, we examine the effects of vibrational mismatch between the solids' phonon spectra on the heat transfer characteristics in molecular junctions. Here, we reveal the dual role of vibrational anharmonicity: It raises the resistance of the junction due to multiple scattering processes, yet it promotes energy transport across a vibrational mismatch by enabling phonon recombination and decay processes.",Revisiting the Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646717,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"We present diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity data for the Lennard-Jones fluid along nine isochores above the critical density, each involving a temperature variation of roughly two orders of magnitude.

The translocation events are classified into two types: one is the trapped translocation in which the entire polymer is trapped in the pore and the other is the non-trapped translocation where the pore cannot hold the whole polymer. We find that the trapped translocation is favored at large spheres and small external voltages. However, the monomer-pore attraction would lead to the non-monotonic behavior of the trapped translocation possibility out of all translocation events. Moreover, both the trapped and non-trapped translocation times are dependent on the polymer length, pore size, external voltage, and the monomer-pore attraction. There exist two pathways for the polymer in the trapped translocation: an actively trapped pathway for the polymer trapped in the pore before the head monomer arrives at the pore exit, and a passively trapped pathway for the polymer trapped in the pore while the head monomer is struggling to move out of the pore. The studies of trapped pathways can provide a deep understanding of the polymer translocation behavior.",Dynamics of a polymer under multi-gradient fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646714,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"Effects of multi-gradient fields on the transport of a polymer chain are investigated using Langevin dynamics simulations.

The distribution of angular tumbling time has exponentially decaying tails, and at high Wi, it deviates from Poisson behavior. Competition between the velocity gradient, which results in a shear flow in the system, and the solvent quality gradient arising due to the interaction among monomers reveals that there is another scaling associated with the angular tumbling time distribution. Moreover, at low temperature, we observe unusual behavior that at intermediate shear rates, the decay rate ν decreases with Wi.",Predictive collective variable discovery with deep Bayesian models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646713,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"Extending spatio-temporal scale limitations of models for complex atomistic systems considered in biochemistry and materials science necessitates the development of enhanced sampling methods. The potential acceleration in exploring the configurational space by enhanced sampling methods depends on the choice of collective variables (CVs). In this work, we formulate the discovery of CVs as a Bayesian inference problem and consider the CVs as hidden generators of the full-atomistic trajectory. The ability to generate samples of the fine-scale atomistic configurations using limited training data allows us to compute estimates of observables as well as our probabilistic confidence on them. The methodology is based on emerging methodological advances in machine learning and variational inference. The discovered CVs are related to physicochemical properties which are essential for understanding mechanisms especially in unexplored complex systems. We provide a quantitative assessment of the CVs in terms of their predictive ability for alanine dipeptide (ALA-2) and ALA-15 peptide.",Rheological investigation of gels formed by competing interactions: A numerical study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646712,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 08,"A transition from solid-like to liquid-like behavior occurs when colloidal gels are subjected to a prolonged exposure to a steady shear. This phenomenon, which is characterized by a yielding point, is found to be strongly dependent on the packing fraction. However, it is not yet known how the effective inter-particle potential affects this transition. To this aim, we present a numerical investigation of the rheology of equilibrium gels in which a short-range depletion is complemented by a long-range electrostatic interaction. We observe a single yielding event in the stress-strain curve, occurring at a fixed strain. The stress overshoot is found to follow a power-law dependence on the Péclet number, with an exponent larger than that found in depletion gels, suggesting that its value may depend systematically on the underlying colloid-colloid interactions. We also establish a mapping between equilibrium states and steady states under shear, which allows us to identify the structural modifications induced by the presence of the shear. Remarkably, we find that steady states corresponding to the same Péclet number, obtained by different combinations of shear rate and solvent viscosity, show identical structural and rheological properties. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the coupling between colloidal interactions, solvent effects, and flow to be able to describe the microscopic organization of colloidal particles under shear."

For complex systems, these reaction networks are not known a priori and cannot be efficiently computed with ab initio methods; therefore, an important goal is to estimate effective reaction networks from observations, such as time series of the main species. Reaction networks estimated with standard machine learning techniques such as least-squares regression may fit the observations but will typically contain spurious reactions. Here we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to vector-valued ansatz functions, each describing a particular reaction process. The resulting sparse tensor regression method ""reactive SINDy"" is able to estimate a parsimonious reaction network. We illustrate that a gene regulation network can be correctly estimated from observed time series.",Glycerol confined in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks: The temperature-dependent cooperativity length scale of glassy freezing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646699,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"In the present work, we employ broadband dielectric spectroscopy to study the molecular dynamics of the prototypical glass former glycerol confined in two microporous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8 and ZIF-11) with well-defined pore diameters of 1.16 and 1.46 nm, respectively. The spectra reveal information on the modified α relaxation of the confined supercooled liquid, whose temperature dependence exhibits clear deviations from the typical super-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the bulk material, depending on the temperature and pore size. This allows assigning well-defined cooperativity length scales of molecular motion to certain temperatures above the glass transition. We relate these and previous results on glycerol confined in other host systems to the temperature-dependent length scale deduced from nonlinear dielectric measurements. The combined experimental data can be consistently described by a critical divergence of this correlation length as expected within theoretical approaches assuming that the glass transition is due to an underlying phase transition.",Electron density topological and adsorbate orbital analyses of water and carbon monoxide co-adsorption on platinum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646698,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"The electron density topology of carbon monoxide (CO) on dry and hydrated platinum is evaluated under the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and by adsorbate orbital approaches. The impact of water co-adsorbate on the electronic, structural, and vibrational properties of CO on Pt are modelled by periodic density functional theory (DFT). At low CO coverage, increased hydration weakens C-O bonds and strengthens C-Pt bonds, as verified by changes in bond lengths and stretching frequencies. These results are consistent with QTAIM, the 5σ donation-2π* backdonation model, and our extended π-attraction σ-repulsion model (extended π-σ model). This work links changes in the non-zero eigenvalues of the electron density Hessian at QTAIM bond critical points to changes in the π and σ C-O bonds with systematic variation of CO/H2O co-adsorbate scenarios. QTAIM invariably shows bond strengths and lengths as being negatively correlated. For atop CO on hydrated Pt, QTAIM and phenomenological models are consistent with a direct correlation between C-O bond strength and CO coverage. However, DFT modelling in the absence of hydration shows that C-O bond lengths are not negatively correlated to their stretching frequencies, in contrast to the Badger rule: When QTAIM and phenomenological models do not agree, the use of the non-zero eigenvalues of the electron density Hessian as inputs to the phenomenological models, aligns them with QTAIM. The C-O and C-Pt bond strengths of bridge and three-fold bound CO on dry and hydrated platinum are also evaluated by QTAIM and adsorbate orbital analyses.",Shockwave compression and dissociation of ammonia gas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646697,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"We performed a series of plate impact experiments on NH3 gas initially at room temperature and at a pressure of ∼100 psi. Shocked states were determined by optical velocimetry and the temperatures by optical pyrometry, yielding compression ratios of ∼5-10 and second shock temperatures in excess of 7500 K. A first-principles statistical mechanical (thermochemical) approach that included chemical dissociation yielded reasonable agreement with experimental results on the principal Hugoniot, even with interparticle interactions neglected. Theoretical analysis of reshocked states, which predicts a significant degree of chemical dissociation, showed reasonable agreement with experimental data for higher temperature shots; however, reshock calculations required the use of interaction potentials. We rationalize the very different shock temperatures obtained, relative to previous results for argon, in terms of atomic versus molecular heat capacities.",Automated detection of many-particle solvation states for accurate characterizations of diffusion kinetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646696,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"Discrete-space kinetic models, i.e., Markov state models, have emerged as powerful tools for reducing the complexity of trajectories generated from molecular dynamics simulations. These models require configuration-space representations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics. Well-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this representation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to study conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary, applications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been scarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order parameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this work, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse configuration-space representation, using generic features of the solvation structure-the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the inherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the features as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting hidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most likely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are then used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately describes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model for glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the diffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide quantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they also reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the heterogeneity of local diffusion.","Adsorption of water, methanol, and their mixtures in slit graphite pores.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646695,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"The behavior of water, methanol, and water-methanol mixtures confined in narrow slit graphite pores as a function of pore size was investigated by Monte Carlo, hybrid Monte Carlo, and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Interactions were described using TIP4P/2005 for water, OPLS/2016 for methanol, and cross interactions fitted to excess water/methanol properties over the whole range of concentrations, which provide a rather accurate description of water-methanol mixtures. As expected for hydrophobic pores, whereas pure methanol is adsorbed already from the gas phase, pure water only enters the pore at pressures well beyond bulk saturation for all pore sizes considered. When adsorbed from a mixture, however, water adsorbs at much lower pressures due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with previously adsorbed methanol molecules. For all studied compositions and pore sizes, methanol adsorbs preferentially over water at liquid-vapor equilibrium conditions. In pure components, both water and methanol are microscopically structured in layers, the number of layers increasing with pore size. This is also the case in adsorbed mixtures, in which methanol has a higher affinity for the walls. This becomes more evident as the pore widens. Diffusion of pure water is higher than that of pure methanol for all pore sizes due to the larger size of the methyl group. In mixtures, both components present similar diffusivities at all pore sizes, which is explained in terms of the coupling of molecular movements due to strong hydrogen bonding between methanol and water molecules. This is particularly evident in very narrow pores, in which pure methanol diffusion is completely impeded on the time scale of our simulations, but the presence of a small amount of water molecules facilitates alcohol diffusion following a single-file mechanism. Additionally, our results indicate that pure water diffusivities display a non-monotonous dependence of pore size, due to effects of confinement (proximity to a fluid-solid-fluid transition induced by confinement as reported in previous work) and the dynamic anomalies of water.",A transient bond model for dynamic constraints in meso-scale coarse-grained systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646694,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 30,"The dynamical properties of entangled polymers originate from the dynamic constraints due to the uncrossability between polymer chains.

In our model, a polymer chain is expressed as a single particle, and particles are connected by transient bonds. The transient bonds modulate the dynamics of particles, but they do not affect static properties in equilibrium. We show the relation between parameters for the entangled polymer systems and those for the transient bond model. By performing simulations based on the transient bond model, we show how model parameters affect the linear viscoelastic behavior and the diffusion behavior. We also show that the viscoelastic behavior of entangled polymer systems can be well reproduced by the transient bond model.",Enhancing the signal strength of surface sensitive 2D IR spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646693,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 02 06,"Spectroscopic techniques that are capable of measuring surfaces and interfaces must overcome two technical challenges: one, the low coverage of molecules at the surface, and two, discerning between signals from the bulk and surface. We present surface enhanced attenuated reflection 2D infrared (SEAR 2D IR) spectroscopy, a method that combines localized surface plasmons with a reflection pump-probe geometry to achieve monolayer sensitivity. The method is demonstrated at 6 µm with the amide I band of a model peptide, a cysteine terminated α-helical peptide tethered to a gold surface. Using SEAR 2D IR spectroscopy, the signal from this sample is enhanced 20 000-times over a monolayer on a dielectric surface. Like attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy, SEAR 2D IR spectroscopy can be applied to strongly absorbing solvents. We demonstrated this capability by solvating a peptide monolayer with H2O, which cannot normally be used when measuring the amide I band.

The introduction of single vacancy and Stone-Wales defects with different orientations affords an effective route for modulating the band structures and optical spectra, resulting in the variation of the selection rules of the excitons and turning dipole-forbidden excitons into dipole-allowed ones. The new localized impurity states in defected tubes will provide additional optically allowed transitions and give rise to pronounced satellite red-shifted peaks.

We study several generic scenarios for the coupling between a small module and a larger environment, with the environment consisting of a chain of mono-molecular reactions. By mapping the dynamics of this coupled system onto random walks, we are able to give exact analytical expressions for the arising memory functions. Hence, our results give insights into the possible types of memory functions and thereby help to better predict subnetwork dynamics."

The rate constants of HOTf-promoted epoxidation of all styrene derivatives with [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+ and electron transfer from electron donors to [(N4Py)MnV(O)]2+ exhibit a remarkably unified correlation with the driving force of outer-sphere electron transfer in light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. The same electron-transfer driving force dependence is observed in the oxygen atom transfer from [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+-(HOTf)2 to thioanisole derivatives as well as in the hydrogen atom transfer from toluene derivatives to [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+-(HOTf)2. Thus, mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer (epoxidation and sulfoxidation) reactions of styrene and thioanisole derivatives and hydrogen atom transfer (hydroxylation) reactions of toluene derivatives by [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+-(HOTf)2 have been unified for the first time as the same reaction pathway via outer-sphere electron transfer, followed by the fast bond-forming step, which exhibits the singly unified electron-transfer driving force dependence of the rate constants as outer-sphere electron-transfer reactions. In the case of the epoxidation of cis-stilbene by [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+-(HOTf)2, the isomerization of cis-stilbene radical cation to trans-stilbene radical cation occurs after outer-sphere electron transfer from cis-stilbene to [(N4Py)MnIV(O)]2+-(HOTf)2 to yield trans-stilbene oxide selectively, which is also taken as evidence for the occurrence of electron transfer in the acid-catalyzed epoxidation.",Preoperative vitamin D levels do not relate with the risk of hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy.

However, the understanding of the roles of transport modes in the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic spread across mainland China is limited. Herein, we collected 127,797 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in mainland China from May 2009 to April 2010. Arrival days and peak days were calculated for all 340 prefectures to characterize the dissemination patterns of the pandemic. We first evaluated the effects of airports and railway stations on arrival days and peak days, and then we applied quantile regressions to quantify the relationships between arrival days and air, rail, and road travel. Our results showed that early arrival of the virus was not associated with an early incidence peak. Airports and railway stations in prefectures significantly advanced arrival days but had no significant impact on peak days. The pandemic spread across mainland China from the southeast to the northwest in two phases that were split at approximately 1 August 2009. Both air and road travel played a significant role in accelerating the spread during phases I and II, but rail travel was only significant during phase II. In conclusion, in addition to air and road travel, rail travel also played a significant role in accelerating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread between prefectures. Establishing a multiscale mobility network that considers the competitive advantage of rail travel for mid to long distances is essential for understanding the influenza pandemic transmission in China.",Impacts of Lean Construction on Safety Systems: A System Dynamics Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646628,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 23,"Lean construction has been viewed as an effective management approach for reducing the occurrence of no-value or destructive activities, such as wasting resources and safety-related accidents. However, few studies have systematically addressed how and to what extent lean construction practices influence construction safety. To bridge this gap, a conceptual model is developed and validated using a system dynamics approach. The construction system in this model comprises four sub-systems (i.e., environment system, equipment system, management system, and employee system). Data were collected from 448 projects in China. Simulations were conducted to determine the correlations between five types of lean tools and the four construction sub-systems. The results show that: (a) 5S management has significant positive impacts on the control of key locations and facilities at construction sites, and contributes to the mitigation of environmental impacts; (b) visual management can significantly improve safety compliance and safety management; (c) just-in-time management has significantly positive influences on the safety facilities layout and formulation of the safety plan; and (d) the Last Planner® System and conference management are effective in improving safety training and the implementation of the safety plan.

At the beginning of the pathologic process of atherosclerosis, irregular VSMC proliferation promotes plaque formation, but in advanced plaques VSMCs are beneficial, promoting the stability and preventing rupture of the fibrous cap. Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the vascular system are involved in the control of VSMC proliferation. This review summarizes recent findings on the miRNAs in the regulation of VSMC proliferation, including miRNAs that exhibit the inhibition or promotion of VSMC proliferation, and their targets mediating the regulation of VSMC proliferation. Up to now, most of the studies were performed only in cultured VSMC. While the modulation of miRNAs is emerging as a promising strategy for the regulation of VSMC proliferation, most of the effects of miRNAs and their targets in vivo require further investigation.",Management of Acute Respiratory Failure Due to Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646626,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 12,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. CAP mortality is driven by the development of sepsis and acute respiratory failure (ARF). We performed a systematic review of the available English literature published in the period 1 January 1997 to 31 August 2017 and focused on ARF in CAP. The database searches identified 189 articles-of these, only 29 were retained for data extraction. Of these 29 articles, 12 addressed ARF in CAP without discussing its ventilatory management, while 17 evaluated the ventilatory management of ARF in CAP. In the studies assessing the ventilatory management, the specific treatments addressed were: high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (n = 1), continuous positive airway pressure (n = 2), non-invasive ventilation (n = 9), and invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5). When analyzed, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) success rates ranged from 20% to 76% and they strongly predicted survival, while NIV failure led to an increased risk of adverse outcome. In conclusion, ARF in CAP patients may require both ventilatory and non-ventilatory management. Further research is needed to better evaluate the use of NIV and HFNC in those patients. Alongside the prompt administration of antimicrobials, the potential use of steroids and the implementation of severity scores should also be considered.",Probiotic Lactobacillus spp. act Against Helicobacter pylori-induced Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646625,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 02 03,"The bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori, is associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, and poses serious health threats owing to its resistance to antibiotics. Lactobacillus spp., on the other hand, possess probiotic activities that have beneficial effects in humans. However, the mechanisms by which Lactobacillus spp. harbor favorable functions and act against H. pylori infection remain to be explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of bacterial strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, termed GMNL-74 and GMNL-185, respectively, to inhibit H. pylori growth and inflammation. Our results showed that GMNL-74 and GMNL-185 possess potent antimicrobial activity against multidrug resistant (MDR)-H. pylori. In addition, an in vitro cell-based model revealed that the inhibition of H. pylori adhesion and invasion of gastric epithelial cells and interleukin-8 production were significantly decreased by treatment with both the Lactobacillus strains. In vivo studies demonstrated that colonization of H. pylori and induced inflammation in the mouse stomach were also alleviated by these Lactobacillus strains. Furthermore, the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, including Bifidobacterium spp. and Akkermansia muciniphilia, were significantly increased in H. pylori-infected mice treated with GMNL-74 and GMNL-185. These results demonstrate that Lactobacillus spp. ameliorate H. pylori-induced inflammation and supports beneficial gut specific bacteria that act against H. pylori infection.",Bacterial Concentration Detection using a PCB-based Contactless Conductivity Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646622,Micromachines,2019 02 06,"Capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C⁴D) is an improved approach to avoid the problems of labor-intensive, time-consuming and insufficient accuracy of plate count as well as the high-cost apparatus of flow cytometry (FCM) in bacterial counting.

Furthermore, no syringe pump is needed in the detection, it reduces the system size, and, more importantly, avoids the effect on the bacteria due to high pressure. The recovered bacteria after C⁴D detection at excitation of 25 Vpp and 60⁻120 kHz were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a survival rate higher than 96% was given. It was verified that C⁴D detection did not influence the bacterial viability. Moreover, bacteria concentrations from 10⁶ cells/mL to 10⁸ cells/mL were measured in a linear range, and relative standard deviation (RSD) is below 0.2%. In addition, the effects on bacteria and C⁴D from background solutions were discussed. In contrast to common methods used in most laboratories, this method may provide a simple solution to in situ detection of bacterial cultures.",Investigation of the Phase Transition Mechanism in LiFePO₄ Cathode Using In Situ Raman Spectroscopy and 2D Correlation Spectroscopy during Initial Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646621,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,The phase transition of the LiFePO₄ and FePO₄ in Li-ion cell during charging-discharging processes in the first and second cycles is elucidated by Raman spectroscopy in real time. In situ Raman spectroscopy showed the sudden phase transition between LiFePO₄ and FePO₄. Principal component analysis (PCA) results also indicated that the structural changes and electrochemical performance (charge-discharge curve) are correlated with each other. Phase transition between LiFePO₄ and FePO₄ principally appeared in the second charging process compared with that in the first charging process. 2D correlation spectra provided the phase transition mechanism of LiFePO₄ cathode which occurred during the charging-discharging processes in the first and second cycles. PCA and 2D correlation spectroscopy are very helpful methods to understand in situ Raman spectra for the Li-ion battery.,Bipolar Disorder and Comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder: Patient Characteristics and Outcomes in US Hospitals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646620,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 02 14,"Background and objectives: The quality of life and disease outcomes in bipolar patients, including increased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide, are adversely affected by the presence of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Our study aims to determine the impact of BPD on the inpatient outcomes of bipolar disorder patients. Methods: We used Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the US hospitals and identified cases with bipolar disorder and comorbid BPD (N = 268,232) and controls with bipolar disorder only (N = 242,379), using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and Clinical Modification codes. We used multinomial logistic regression to generate odds ratios (OR) and evaluate inpatient outcomes. Results: The majority of the bipolar patients with BPD were female (84.2%), Caucasian (83.1%) and 18⁻35 years age (53.9%). Significantly longer inpatient stays, higher inpatient charges, and higher prevalence of drug abuse were noted in bipolar patients with BPD. The suicide risk was higher in bipolar patients with BPD (OR = 1.418; 95% CI 1.384⁻1.454; p <0.001). In addition, utilization of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) was higher in bipolar patients with comorbid BPD (OR = 1.442; 95% CI 1.373⁻1.515; p <0.001). Conclusions: The presence of comorbid BPD in bipolar disorder is associated with higher acute inpatient care due to a longer inpatient stay and higher cost during hospitalization, and higher suicide risk, and utilization of ECT. Further studies in the inpatient setting are warranted to develop effective clinical strategies for optimal outcomes and reduction of suicide risk in bipolar patients with BPD.",Synthesis and Biochemical Evaluation of Lid-Open D-Amino Acid Oxidase Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646619,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Most of the known inhibitors of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) are small polar molecules recognized by the active site of the enzyme. More recently a new class of DAAO inhibitors has been disclosed that interacts with loop 218-224 at the top of the binding pocket. These compounds have a significantly larger size and more beneficial physicochemical properties than most reported DAAO inhibitors, however, their structure-activity relationship is poorly explored. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of this type of DAAO inhibitors that open the lid over the active site of DAAO. In order to collect relevant SAR data we varied two distinct parts of the inhibitors. A systematic variation of the pendant aromatic substituents according to the Topliss scheme resulted in DAAO inhibitors with low nanomolar activity. The activity showed low sensitivity to the substituents investigated. The variation of the linker connecting the pendant aromatic moiety and the acidic headgroup revealed that the interactions of the linker with the enzyme were crucial for achieving significant inhibitory activity. Structures and activities were analyzed based on available X-ray structures of the complexes. Our findings might support the design of drug-like DAAO inhibitors with advantageous physicochemical properties and ADME profile.",Carbon Nanotube/Graphene Nanoplatelet Hybrid Film as a Flexible Multifunctional Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646618,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"A flexible hybrid film consisting of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was prepared and employed as a multifunctional sensor to monitor temperature and liquid leakage, based on the piezoresistive effect. The influences of the GNP content on the mechanical, thermal, and sensing properties were investigated. Experimental results showed that both the hardness and Young's modulus of the hybrid film were decreased with an increasing GNP content, while the thermal conductivity exhibited in an opposite trend. The electrical resistance of the hybrid film decreased was linearly with an increase in temperature. The resistance change increased linearly with an increase of the solvent adsorption. These features demonstrated the potential applications of the hybrid film in the detection of temperature, and liquid leakage. The sensitivity of leakage detection is increasing with the increase of the GNP loading, while temperature sensitivity is in the opposite trend."

Identifying characteristic genes of PTC are of great importance to reveal its potential genetic mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed a framework, as well as a measure named Normalized Centrality Measure (NCM), to identify characteristic genes of PTC. The framework consisted of four steps. First, both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes, collectively called differentially expressed genes (DEGs), were screened and integrated together from four datasets, that is, GSE3467, GSE3678, GSE33630, and GSE58545; second, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed, where each node represented a gene and each edge represented an interaction between linking nodes; third, both traditional measures and the NCM measure were used to analyze the topological properties of each node in the network. Compared with traditional measures, more genes related to PTC were identified by the NCM measure; fourth, by mining the high-density subgraphs of this network and performing Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, several meaningful results were captured, most of which were demonstrated to be associated with PTC. The experimental results proved that this network framework and the NCM measure are useful for identifying more characteristic genes of PTC.",Metformin Impairs Glutamine Metabolism and Autophagy in Tumour Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646605,Cells,2019 02 07,"Metformin has been shown to inhibit glutaminase (GLS) activity and ammonia accumulation thereby reducing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy in type 2 diabetic patients. Since tumour cells are addicted to glutamine and often show an overexpression of glutaminase, we hypothesize that the antitumoral mechanism of metformin could be ascribed to inhibition of GLS and reduction of ammonia and ammonia-induced autophagy. Our results show that, in different tumour cell lines, micromolar doses of metformin prevent cell growth by reducing glutamate, ammonia accumulation, autophagy markers such as MAP1LC3B-II and GABARAP as well as degradation of long-lived proteins. Reduced autophagy is then accompanied by increased BECN1/BCL2 binding and apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, GLS-silenced cells reproduce the effect of metformin treatment showing reduced MAP1LC3B-II and GABARAP as well as ammonia accumulation. Since metformin is used as adjuvant drug to increase the efficacy of Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we co-treated tumour cells with micromolar doses of metformin in the presence of cisplatin observing a marked reduction of MAP1LC3B-II and an increase of caspase 3 cleavage. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the anti-tumoral action of metformin is due to the inhibition of glutaminase and autophagy and could be used to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.",A Sequence-Based Novel Approach for Quality Evaluation of Third-Generation Sequencing Reads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646604,Genes,2019 02 05,"The advent of third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies, such as the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore machines, provides new possibilities for contig assembly, scaffolding, and high-performance computing in bioinformatics due to its long reads. However, the high error rate and poor quality of TGS reads provide new challenges for accurate genome assembly and long-read alignment. Efficient processing methods are in need to prioritize high-quality reads for improving the results of error correction and assembly. In this study, we proposed a novel Read Quality Evaluation and Selection Tool (REQUEST) for evaluating the quality of third-generation long reads. REQUEST generates training data of high-quality and low-quality reads which are characterized by their nucleotide combinations. A linear regression model was built to score the quality of reads. The method was tested on three datasets of different species. The results showed that the top-scored reads prioritized by REQUEST achieved higher alignment accuracies. The contig assembly results based on the top-scored reads also outperformed conventional approaches that use all reads. REQUEST is able to distinguish high-quality reads from low-quality ones without using reference genomes, making it a promising alternative sequence-quality evaluation method to alignment-based algorithms.",Role of FoxO Proteins in Cellular Response to Antitumor Agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646603,Cancers,2019 02 06,"FoxO proteins (FoxOs) are transcription factors with a common DNA binding domain that confers selectivity for DNA interaction. In human cells, four proteins (FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6), with redundant activity, exhibit mainly a positive effect on genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis regulation and drug resistance. Thus, FoxOs can affect cell response to antitumor agent treatment. Their transcriptional activity depends on post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and mono/poly-ubiquitination. Additionally, alterations in microRNA network impact on FoxO transcripts and in turn on FoxO levels. Reduced expression of FoxO1 has been associated with resistance to conventional agents (e.g., cisplatin) and with reduced efficacy of drug combinations in ovarian carcinoma cells. FoxO3 has been shown as a mediator of cisplatin toxicity in colorectal cancer. A requirement for FoxO3-induced apoptosis has been reported in cells exposed to targeted agents (e.g., gefitinib). Recently, the possibility to interfere with FoxO1 localization has been proposed as a valuable approach to improve cell sensitivity to cisplatin, because nuclear retention of FoxO1 may favor the induction of pro-apoptotic genes. This review focuses on the role of FoxOs in drug treatment response in tumor cells and discusses the impact of the expression of these transcription factors on drug resistance/sensitivity.",Multiscale 3D Curvature Analysis of Processed Surface Textures of Aluminum Alloy 6061 T6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646602,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 05,"The objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the viability, and to validate, in part, a multiscale method for calculating curvature tensors on measured surface topographies with two different methods of specifying the scale. The curvature tensors are calculated as functions of scale, i.e., size, and position from a regular, orthogonal array of measured heights. Multiscale characterization of curvature is important because, like slope and area, it changes with the scale of observation, or calculation, on irregular surfaces. Curvatures can be indicative of the topographically dependent behavior of a surface and, in turn, curvatures are influenced by the processing and use of the surface. Curvatures of surface topographies have not been well- characterized yet. Curvature has been used for calculations in contact mechanics and for the evaluation of cutting edges. Manufactured surfaces are studied for further validation of the calculation method because they provide certain expectations for curvatures, which depend on scale and the degree of curvature. To study a range of curvatures on manufactured surfaces, square edges are machined and honed, then rounded progressively by mass finishing; additionally, a set of surfaces was made by turning with different feeds. Topographic measurements are made with a scanning laser confocal microscope. The calculations use vectors, normal to the measured surface, which are calculated first, then the eigenvalue problem is solved for the curvature tensor. Plots of principal curvatures as a function of position and scale are presented. Statistical analyses show expected interactions between curvature and these manufacturing processes.",A Small Aromatic Compound Has Antifungal Properties and Potential Anti-Inflammatory Effects against Intestinal Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646601,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"Resistance of the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans to antifungal drugs has increased significantly in recent years. After screening 55 potential antifungal compounds from a chemical library, 2,3-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (DHMB) was identified as having potential antifungal activity. The properties of DHMB were then assessed in vitro and in vivo against C. albicans overgrowth and intestinal inflammation. Substitution on the aromatic ring of DHMB led to a strong decrease in its biological activity against C. albicans. The MIC of DHMB was highly effective at eliminating C. albicans when compared to that of caspofungin or fluconazole. Additionally, DHMB was also effective against clinically isolated fluconazole- or caspofungin-resistant C. albicans strains. DHMB was administered to animals at high doses. This compound was not cytotoxic and was well-tolerated. In experimental dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, DHMB reduced the clinical and histological score of inflammation and promoted the elimination of C. albicans from the gut. This finding was supported by a decrease in aerobic bacteria while anaerobic bacteria populations were re-established in mice treated with DHMB. DHMB is a small organic molecule with antifungal properties and anti-inflammatory activity by exerting protective effects on intestinal epithelial cells.",Professionalisation of International Medical Volunteer Work to Maintain Ethical Standards: A Qualitative Study Exploring the Experience of Volunteer Doctors in Relation to UK Policy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646600,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 12,"Doctors from the United Kingdom are increasingly involved in international medical volunteerism in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although supported by government policy this practice lacks infrastructure and coordination. Volunteer activities can have positive impact but also risk causing harm. Without external governance the responsibility lies with volunteers and their organisations to self-evaluate their activities. This study aimed to explore influences affecting volunteer engagement with ethical standards and evaluative practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven doctors working in the Scottish National Health Service with volunteer experience in LMICs. Findings were analysed thematically to explore this issue in view of ongoing policy development. Although ethical standards were valued by participants they were unaware of relevant government policy. Influences on volunteer development are unstructured and vary in quality. Evaluation lacks structure and framing. Volunteer physicians face a number of barriers to engaging in critical evaluation of their activities in LMICs. Development and professionalization of medical volunteering in LMICs needs to address volunteer preparation and evaluative practice to maximise the benefits of volunteering, reduce the risk of harm and maximise learning and accountability. Further areas of research are suggested to inform professionalisation of this sector.",The Opposing Contribution of SMS1 and SMS2 to Glioma Progression and Their Value in the Therapeutic Response to 2OHOA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646599,Cancers,2019 02 06,"Background: 2-Hydroxyoleic acid (2OHOA) is particularly active against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and successfully finished a phase I/IIA trial in patients with glioma and other advanced solid tumors. However, its mechanism of action is not fully known. Methods: The relationship between SMS1 and SMS2 expressions (mRNA) and overall survival in 329 glioma patients was investigated, and so was the correlation between SMS expression and 2OHOA's efficacy. The opposing role of SMS isoforms in 2OHOA's mechanism of action and in GBM cell growth, differentiation and death, was studied overexpressing or silencing them in human GBM cells. Results: Patients with high-SMS1 plus low-SMS2 expression had a 5-year survival ~10-fold higher than patients with low-SMS1 plus high-SMS2 expression. SMS1 and SMS2 also had opposing effect on GBM cell survival and 2OHOA's IC50 correlated with basal SMS1 levels and treatment induced changes in SMS1/SMS2 ratio. SMSs expression disparately affected 2OHOA's cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, ER-stress and autophagy. Conclusions: SMS1 and SMS2 showed opposite associations with glioma patient survival, glioma cell growth and response to 2OHOA treatment. SMSs signature could constitute a valuable prognostic biomarker, with high SMS1 and low SMS2 being a better disease prognosis. Additionally, low basal SMS1 mRNA levels predict positive response to 2OHOA.",Genomic Enhancers in Brain Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646598,Genes,2019 05 08,"Enhancers are non-coding DNA elements that function in cis to regulate transcription from nearby genes. Through direct interactions with gene promoters, enhancers give rise to spatially and temporally precise gene expression profiles in distinct cell or tissue types. In the brain, the accurate regulation of these intricate expression programs across different neuronal classes gives rise to an incredible cellular and functional diversity. Newly developed technologies have recently allowed more accurate enhancer mapping and more sophisticated enhancer manipulation, producing rapid progress in our understanding of enhancer biology. Furthermore, identification of disease-linked genetic variation in enhancer regions has highlighted the potential influence of enhancers in brain health and disease. This review outlines the key role of enhancers as transcriptional regulators, reviews the current understanding of enhancer regulation in neuronal development, function and dysfunction and provides our thoughts on how enhancers can be targeted for technological and therapeutic goals.",Analysis of Popcorn (Zea mays L. var. everta) for Antioxidant Capacity and Total Phenolic Content.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646597,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 05,"Popcorn, one of the most popular snack foods in the world, is known for being a high fiber, healthy food. Our research has found that commercial popcorn also contains significant amounts of the class of antioxidants known as phenolic acids. The total antioxidant power of raw and popped popcorn extract has been quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu and FRAP assays. The polyphenols were found exclusively in the pericarp of the kernel completely bound to the oligosaccharide fiber matrix. An in vitro digestion study was also performed to predict the phenolic acids' bioavailability. On average, nine commercial popcorn samples contain 5.93 ± 0.92 mg/g of total polyphenols after alkaline hydrolysis and 2.66 ± 0.15 mg/g after in vitro digestion as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Furthermore, the popping process was found not to significantly decrease the antioxidant capacity. These results indicate that a considerable amount of the bound polyphenols are bioaccessible. Due to the high levels of bioaccessible polyphenols, popcorn may be a significant source of dietary polyphenol antioxidants."

Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a machine learning system that has the advantages of high computational speed and good accuracy for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for UAV-based sprayers. A machine learning system was developed by using the mutual subspace method (MSM) for images collected from a UAV. Two target lands: agricultural croplands and orchard areas, were considered in building two classifiers for distinguishing spray and non-spray areas. The field experiments were conducted in target areas to train and test the system by using a commercial UAV (DJI Phantom 3 Pro) with an onboard 4K camera. The images were collected from low (5 m) and high (15 m) altitudes for croplands and orchards, respectively. The recognition system was divided into offline and online systems. In the offline recognition system, 74.4% accuracy was obtained for the classifiers in recognizing spray and non-spray areas for croplands. In the case of orchards, the average classifier recognition accuracy of spray and non-spray areas was 77%. On the other hand, the online recognition system performance had an average accuracy of 65.1% for croplands, and 75.1% for orchards. The computational time for the online recognition system was minimal, with an average of 0.0031 s for classifier recognition. The developed machine learning system had an average recognition accuracy of 70%, which can be implemented in an autonomous UAV spray system for recognizing spray and non-spray areas for real-time applications.",Genetic Instability and Chromatin Remodeling in Spermatids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646585,Genes,2019 02 05,"The near complete replacement of somatic chromatin in spermatids is, perhaps, the most striking nuclear event known to the eukaryotic domain. The process is far from being fully understood, but research has nevertheless unraveled its complexity as an expression of histone variants and post-translational modifications that must be finely orchestrated to promote the DNA topological change and compaction provided by the deposition of protamines. That this major transition may not be genetically inert came from early observations that transient DNA strand breaks were detected in situ at chromatin remodeling steps. The potential for genetic instability was later emphasized by our demonstration that a significant number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed and then repaired in the haploid context of spermatids. The detection of DNA breaks by 3'OH end labeling in the whole population of spermatids suggests that a reversible enzymatic process is involved, which differs from canonical apoptosis. We have set the stage for a better characterization of the genetic impact of this transition by showing that post-meiotic DNA fragmentation is conserved from human to yeast, and by providing tools for the initial mapping of the genome-wide DSB distribution in the mouse model. Hence, the molecular mechanism of post-meiotic DSB formation and repair in spermatids may prove to be a significant component of the well-known male mutation bias. Based on our recent observations and a survey of the literature, we propose that the chromatin remodeling in spermatids offers a proper context for the induction of de novo polymorphism and structural variations that can be transmitted to the next generation.",Alcyonacea: A Potential Source for Production of Nitrogen-Containing Metabolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646584,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Alcyonacea (soft corals and gorgonia) are well known for their production of a wide array of unprecedented architecture of bioactive metabolites.

It covers the era from the beginning of marine nitrogen-containing terpenoids isolation from Alcyonacea up to December 2018. One hundred twenty-one compounds with nitrogenous moiety are published from fifteen genera.

We recently demonstrated that type II Testicular Germ Cell Tumours (TGCTs) express c-MET receptor. In particular, we elucidated that the non-seminoma lesions express c-MET protein at higher level, compared with the seminoma ones. In line with this observation, NTERA-2 clone D1 (NT2D1) non-seminoma cells increase their proliferation, migration and invasion in response to Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). One of the well-known adaptor-proteins belonging to c-MET signaling cascade is c-Src. Activation of c-Src is related to the increase of aggressiveness of many cancers. For this reason, we focused on the role of c-Src in c-MET-triggered and HGF-dependent NT2D1 cell activities. In the present paper, we have elucidated that this adaptor-protein is involved in HGF-dependent NT2D1 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, since Src inhibitor-1 administration abrogates these responses. Despite these biological evidences western blot analyses have not revealed the increase of c-Src activation because of HGF administration. However, notably, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that cytoplasmic and membrane-associated localization of c-Src shifted to the nuclear compartment after HGF stimulation. These results shed new light in the modality of HGF-dependent c-Src recruitment, and put the basis for novel investigations on the relationship between c-Src, and TGCT aggressiveness.",Nanobody Detection of Standard Fluorescent Proteins Enables Multi-Target DNA-PAINT with High Resolution and Minimal Displacement Errors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646582,Cells,2019 02 07,"DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) is a rapidly developing fluorescence super-resolution technique, which allows for reaching spatial resolutions below 10 nm. It also enables the imaging of multiple targets in the same sample. However, using DNA-PAINT to observe cellular structures at such resolution remains challenging. Antibodies, which are commonly used for this purpose, lead to a displacement between the target protein and the reporting fluorophore of 20⁻25 nm, thus limiting the resolving power. Here, we used nanobodies to minimize this linkage error to ~4 nm. We demonstrate multiplexed imaging by using three nanobodies, each able to bind to a different family of fluorescent proteins. We couple the nanobodies with single DNA strands via a straight forward and stoichiometric chemical conjugation. Additionally, we built a versatile computer-controlled microfluidic setup to enable multiplexed DNA-PAINT in an efficient manner. As a proof of principle, we labeled and imaged proteins on mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, and chromatin. We obtained super-resolved images of the three targets with 20 nm resolution, and within only 35 minutes acquisition time.","The Phylogeny and Pathogenesis of Sacbrood Virus (SBV) Infection in European Honey Bees, Apis mellifera.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646581,Viruses,2019 06 06,"RNA viruses that contain single-stranded RNA genomes of positive sense make up the largest group of pathogens infecting honey bees. Sacbrood virus (SBV) is one of the most widely distributed honey bee viruses and infects the larvae of honey bees, resulting in failure to pupate and death. Among all of the viruses infecting honey bees, SBV has the greatest number of complete genomes isolated from both European honey bees Apis mellifera and Asian honey bees A. cerana worldwide. To enhance our understanding of the evolution and pathogenicity of SBV, in this study, we present the first report of whole genome sequences of two U.S. strains of SBV. The complete genome sequences of the two U.S. SBV strains were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers: MG545286.1 and MG545287.1. Both SBV strains show the typical genomic features of the Iflaviridae family. The phylogenetic analysis of the single polyprotein coding region of the U.S. strains, and other GenBank SBV submissions revealed that SBV strains split into two distinct lineages, possibly reflecting host affiliation. The phylogenetic analysis based on the 5'UTR revealed a monophyletic clade with the deep parts of the tree occupied by SBV strains from both A. cerane and A. mellifera, and the tips of branches of the tree occupied by SBV strains from A. mellifera. The study of the cold stress on the pathogenesis of the SBV infection showed that cold stress could have profound effects on sacbrood disease severity manifested by increased mortality of infected larvae. This result suggests that the high prevalence of sacbrood disease in early spring may be due to the fluctuating temperatures during the season. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of SBV infection in honey bees, and have important epidemiological relevance.",Investigating Spatial Autocorrelation and Spillover Effects in Freeway Crash-Frequency Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646580,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 23,"This study attempts to investigate spatial autocorrelation and spillover effects in micro traffic safety analysis. To achieve the objective, a Poisson-based count regression with consideration of these spatial effects is proposed for modeling crash frequency on freeway segments. In the proposed hybrid model, the spatial autocorrelation and the spillover effects are formulated as the conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior and the exogenous variables of adjacent segments, respectively. The proposed model is demonstrated and compared to the models with only one kind of spatial effect, using one-year crash data collected from Kaiyang Freeway, China. The results of Bayesian estimation conducted in WinBUGS show that significant spatial autocorrelation and spillover effects simultaneously exist in the freeway crash-frequency data. The lower value of deviance information criterion (DIC) and more significant exogenous variables for the hybrid model compared to the other alternatives, indicate the strength of accounting for both spatial autocorrelation and spillover effects on improving model fit and identifying crash contributing factors. Moreover, the model results highlight the importance of daily vehicle kilometers traveled, and horizontal and vertical alignments of targeted segments and adjacent segments on freeway crash occurrences.",Real-Time Model-Free Minimum-Seeking Autotuning Method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Controllers Based on Fibonacci-Search Algorithm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646579,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"The paper presents a novel autotuning approach for finding locally-best parameters of controllers on board of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The controller tuning is performed fully autonomously during flight on the basis of predefined ranges of controller parameters. Required controller properties may be simply interpreted by a cost function, which is involved in the optimization process. For example, the sum of absolute values of the tracking error samples or performance indices, including weighed functions of control signal samples, can be penalized to achieve very precise position control, if required. The proposed method relies on an optimization procedure using Fibonacci-search technique fitted into bootstrap sequences, enabling one to obtain a global minimizer for a unimodal cost function. The approach is characterized by low computational complexity and does not require any UAV dynamics model (just periodical measurements from basic onboard sensors) to obtain proper tuning of a controller. In addition to the theoretical background of the method, an experimental verification in real-world outdoor conditions is provided. The experiments have demonstrated a high robustness of the method to in-environment disturbances, such as wind, and its easy deployability.","Epigenetic Factors in Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: MTHFR and CTH Gene Polymorphisms, Metabolic Transsulfuration and Methylation Pathways, and B Vitamins.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646578,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"DNA methylation and other epigenetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations occur in most elderly patients with memory loss. MTHFR is critical for production of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), the principal methyl donor. A common mutation (1364T/T) of the cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH) gene affects the enzyme that converts cystathionine to cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway causing plasma elevation of total homocysteine (tHcy) or hyperhomocysteinemia-a strong and independent risk factor for cognitive loss and AD. Other causes of hyperhomocysteinemia include aging, nutritional factors, and deficiencies of B vitamins. We emphasize the importance of supplementing vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), vitamin B₉ (folic acid), vitamin B₆ (pyridoxine), and SAM to patients in early stages of LOAD.",Silkworm Storage Protein 1 Inhibits Autophagy-Mediated Apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646576,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"Autophagy is a natural physiological process, and it induces the lysosomal degradation of intracellular components in response to environmental stresses, including nutrient starvation. Although an adequate autophagy level helps in cell survival, excessive autophagy triggered by stress such as starvation leads to autophagy-mediated apoptosis. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for producing biopharmaceuticals, including monoclonal antibodies. However, apoptosis induced by high stress levels, including nutrient deficiency, is a major problem in cell cultures grown in bioreactors, which should be overcome. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method for suppressing excessive autophagy and for maintaining an appropriate autophagy level in cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of silkworm storage protein 1 (SP1), an antiapoptotic protein, on autophagy-mediated apoptosis. SP1-expressing CHO cells were generated to assess the effect and molecular mechanism of SP1 in suppressing autophagy. These cells were cultured under starvation conditions by treatment with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) to induce autophagy. We observed that SP1 significantly inhibited autophagy-mediated apoptosis by suppressing caspase-3 activation and reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, SP1 suppressed EBSS-induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression of autophagy-related protein 7. Notably, basal Beclin-1 level was significantly low in the SP1-expressing cells, indicating that SP1 regulated upstream events in the autophagy pathway. Together, these findings suggest that SP1 offers a new strategy for overcoming severe autophagy-mediated apoptosis in mammalian cells, and it can be used widely in biopharmaceutical production."

However, despite timely treatment with antiviral medication, some viral infections remain refractory to treatment, which hampers outcomes after HSCT, and are responsible for a high proportion of transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived lymphocytes aims to improve cellular immunity and to prevent or treat viral diseases after HSCT. Early reports described the feasibility of transferring nonspecific lymphocytes from donors, which led to the development of cell therapy approaches based on virus-specific T cells, allowing a targeted treatment of infections, while limiting adverse events such as graft versus host disease (GvHD). Both expansion and direct selection techniques have yielded comparable results in terms of efficacy (around 70⁻80%), but efficacy is difficult to predict for individual cases. Generating bespoke products for each donor⁻recipient pair can be expensive, and there remains the major obstacle of generating products from seronegative or poorly responsive donors. More recent studies have focused on the feasibility of collecting and infusing partially matched third-party virus-specific T cells, reporting response rates of 60⁻70%. Future development of this approach will involve the broadening of applicability to multiple viruses, the optimization and cost-control of manufacturing, larger multicentred efficacy trials, and finally the creation of cell banks that can provide prompt access to virus-specific cellular product. The aim of this review is to summarise present knowledge on adoptive T cell manufacturing, efficacy and potential future developments.",Discrimination between Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and Cardiac Syndrome X in Women with Typical Angina and Positive Exercise Test; Utility of Cardiovascular Risk Calculators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646563,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 02 14,"Introduction: Nearly 40% of women with typical angina and a positive exercise tolerance test (ETT) have normal or near normal coronary angiography (CAG) labeled as cardiac syndrome X (CSX). Objective: We performed this study to evaluate the power of common cardiovascular risk calculators to distinguish patients with CSX from those with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: 559 women participated in the study. Three risk scores, including (1) newly pooled cohort equation of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) to predict 10 years risk of first atherosclerotic cardiovascular hard event (ASCVD), (2) Framingham risk score (FRS) for the prediction of 10 years coronary heart disease, and (3) the SCORE tool to estimate 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality (SCORE), were applied. Results: CAD was diagnosed in 51.5% of the patients. 11.6% of the population had ASCVD < 2.5%, and only 13.8% of these patients had CAD on their CAG. By choosing FRS, 14.4% of patients had FRS < 7.5%, and only 11.3% of these patients had recorded CAD on CAG, while the rest of the patients were diagnosed as CSX. Using the SCORE model, 13.8% of patients had the least value (<0.5%) in whom the prevalence of CAD was 19.9%. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to discriminate CSX from CAD was calculated for each scoring system, being 0.750 for ASCVD, 0.745 for FRS, and 0.728 for SCORE (p value for all AUROCs < 0.001). The Hosmer⁻Lemeshow chi squares (df, p value) for calibration were 8.787 (8, 0.361), 11.125 (8, 0.195), and 10.618 (8, 0.224) for ASCVD, FRS, and SCORE, respectively. Conclusions: Patients who have ASCVD < 2.5% or FRS < 7.5% may be appropriate cases for noninvasive imaging (Such as coronary CT angiography). CAG is indicated for patients with ASCVD ≥ 7.5% and FRS ≥ 15%, whereas the patients with intermediate risk need comprehensive patient⁻physician shared decision-making.",Functionalized β-Cyclodextrin Immobilized on Ag-Embedded Silica Nanoparticles as a Drug Carrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646562,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"Cyclodextrins (CDs) have beneficial characteristics for drug delivery, including hydrophobic interior surfaces. Nanocarriers with β-CD ligands have been prepared with simple surface modifications as drug delivery vehicles. In this study, we synthesized β-CD derivatives on an Ag-embedded silica nanoparticle (NP) (SiO₂@Ag NP) structure to load and release doxorubicin (DOX). Cysteinyl-β-CD and ethylenediamine-β-CD (EDA-β-CD) were immobilized on the surface of SiO₂@Ag NPs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. DOX was introduced into the β-CD on the SiO₂@Ag NPs and then successfully released. Neither cysteinyl-β-CD and EDA-β-CD showed cytotoxicity, while DOX-loaded cysteinyl-β-CD and EDA-β-CD showed a significant decrease in cell viability in cancer cells.

The influence of round cell and leukocyte proteins on the sperm proteome has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to identify if the proteins from round cells, including leukocytes, interfere with the proteomic analysis of spermatozoa in frozen semen samples. Proteomic profiling of sperm was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in four groups: Group 1 contained neat semen with round cells and leukocytes ≥ 1 × 10⁶/mL, group 2 contained neat semen with round cells ≥ 1 × 10⁶/mL that was processed by 65% density gradient to remove the round cells and leukocytes, group 3 contained neat semen with round cells < 1 × 10⁶/mL, and group 4 contained neat semen with round cells < 1 × 10⁶/mL that was processed by 65% density gradient to remove the round cells. Pure leukocyte culture was used as control group. A total of 1638, 1393, 1755, and 1404 proteins were identified in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Comparative analysis of group 1 vs. 3 revealed 26 (1.18%) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). On the other hand, only 6 (0.31%) DEPs were observed with group 2 vs. 4. Expression of these DEPs were either absent or very low in the control group. The results of our proteomics analysis failed to show any influence of non-spermatogenic round cell proteins on sperm proteome identification. These results validate the use of neat semen samples for sperm proteomic studies.",Protective Smell of Hydrogen Sulfide and Polysulfide in Cisplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646560,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"Though historically known as a toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) has displayed a new face as the third endogenous gaseous signaling molecule after nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Here in this review, we survey the role and therapeutic potential of H₂S in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Specifically, reduction of H₂S by cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) downregulation upon cisplatin treatment may contribute to cisplatin-induced renal cell injury, possibly by augmentation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while H₂S donation may prevent subsequent renal dysfunction by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activation. Intriguingly, H₂S slow-releasing compound GYY4137 seems to increase the anticancer activity of cisplatin, at least in several cancer cell lines, and this is probably due to its own anticancer effect. However, the efficacy of H₂S donors in tumor-bearing animals remains to be tested in terms of renal protection and cancer inhibition after receiving cisplatin. Furthermore, accumulative evidence regarding usage of polysulfide, a novel H₂S derived molecule, in the therapy of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, was also summarized.",Lamellar-like Electrospun Mesoporous Ti-Al-O Nanofibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646558,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 05,"Ceramic oxides nanofibers are promising materials as catalysts, electrodes and functional materials.

The influence of pH and temperature stressors on the stability of certain Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) isolated at high purity levels was examined. MAAs were highly stable at room temperature during 24 h at pH 4.5⁻8.5. At 50 °C, MAAs showed instability at pH 10.5 while at 85 °C, progressive disappearances were observed for MAAs through the studied pH range. In alkaline conditions, their degradation was much faster. Mycosporine-serinol and porphyra-334 (+shinorine) were the most stable MAAs under the conditions tested. They were included in four cosmetically stable topical sunscreens, of which the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and other Biological Effective Protection Factors (BEPFs) were calculated. The formulation containing these MAAs showed similar SPF and UVB-BEPFs values as those of the reference sunscreen, composed of synthetic UV absorbing filters in similar percentages, while UVA-BEPFs values were slightly lower. Current in vitro data strongly suggest that MAAs, as natural and safe UV-absorbing and antioxidant compounds, have high potential for protection against the diverse harmful effects of solar UV radiation. In addition, novel complementary in vitro tests for evaluation of commercial sunscreens efficacy are proposed.","Materials for the Spine: Anatomy, Problems, and Solutions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646556,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 05,"Disc degeneration affects 12% to 35% of a given population, based on genetics, age, gender, and other environmental factors, and usually occurs in the lumbar spine due to heavier loads and more strenuous motions. Degeneration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within reduces mechanical integrity, shock absorption, and swelling capabilities of the intervertebral disc. When severe enough, the disc can bulge and eventually herniate, leading to pressure build up on the spinal cord. This can cause immense lower back pain in individuals, leading to total medical costs exceeding $100 billion. Current treatment options include both invasive and noninvasive methods, with spinal fusion surgery and total disc replacement (TDR) being the most common invasive procedures. Although these treatments cause pain relief for the majority of patients, multiple challenges arise for each. Therefore, newer tissue engineering methods are being researched to solve the ever-growing problem. This review spans the anatomy of the spine, with an emphasis on the functions and biological aspects of the intervertebral discs, as well as the problems, associated solutions, and future research in the field.",Multi-Parametric Analysis of Reliability and Energy Consumption in IoT: A Deep Learning Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646555,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"Small-to-medium scale smart buildings are an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the major enabler for smart control in such environments. Reliability is among the key performance requirements for many loss-sensitive IoT and WSN applications, while Energy Consumption (EC) remains a primary concern in WSN design. Error-prone links, traffic intense applications, and limited physical resources make it challenging to meet these service goals-not only that these performance metrics often conflict with one another, but also require solving optimization problems, which are intrinsically NP-hard. Correctly forecasting Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and EC can play a significant role in different loss-sensitive application environments. With the ever-increasing availability of performance data, data-driven techniques are becoming popular in such settings. It is observed that a number of communication parameters like transmission power, packet size, etc., influence metrics like PDR and EC in diverse ways. In this work, different regression models including linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep learning are used for the purpose of predicting both PDR and EC based on such communication parameters. To evaluate the performance, a public dataset of the IEEE 802.15.4 network, containing measurements against more than 48,000 combinations of parameter configurations, is used. Results are evaluated using root mean square error and it turns out that deep learning achieves up to 98% accuracy for both PDR and EC predictions. These prediction results can help configure communication parameters taking into account the performance goals.",Adaptive Phase Transform Method for Pipeline Leakage Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646554,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"In leak noise correlation surveys, time delay estimation (TDE) is of great importance in pinpointing a suspected leak. Conventional TDE methods involve pre-filtering processes prior to performing cross-correlation, based on a priori knowledge of the leak and background noise spectra, to achieve the desired performance. Despite advances in recent decades, they have not proven to be capable of tracking changes in sensor signals as yet. This paper presents an adaptive phase transform method based on least mean square (LMS) algorithms for the determination of the leak location to overcome this limitation. Simulation results on plastic water pipes show that, compared to the conventional LMS method, the proposed adaptive method is more robust to a low signal-to-noise ratio. To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive method, an analysis is carried out on field tests of real networks. Moreover, it has been shown that by using the actual measured data, improved performance of the proposed method for pipeline leakage detection is achieved. Hence, this paper presents a promising method, which has the advantages of simple implementation and ability to track changes in practice, as an alternative technique to the existing correlation-based leak detection methods."

Nevertheless, its biosafety data are still scarce. Herein, we assessed the in vivo proinflammatory properties of crotamine, including its local effect and systemic serum parameters. Sixty male Wistar rats were intradermically injected with 200, 400 and 800 µg crotamine and analyzed after 1, 3 and 7 days. Local effect of crotamine was assessed by determination of MPO and NAG activities, NO levels and angiogenesis. Systemic inflammatory response was assessed by determination of IL-10, TNF-α, CRP, NO, TBARS and SH groups. Crotamine induced macrophages and neutrophils chemotaxis as evidenced by the upregulation of both NAG (0.5⁻0.6 OD/mg) and MPO (0.1⁻0.2 OD/mg) activities, on the first and third day of analysis, respectively. High levels of NO were observed for all concentrations and time-points. Moreover, 800 μg crotamine resulted in serum NO (64.7 μM) and local tissue NO (58.5 μM) levels higher or equivalent to those recorded for their respective histamine controls (55.7 μM and 59.0 μM). Crotamine also induced a significant angiogenic response compared to histamine. Systemically, crotamine induced a progressive increase in serum CRP levels up to the third day of analysis (22.4⁻45.8 mg/mL), which was significantly greater than control values. Crotamine (400 μg) also caused an increase in serum TNF-α, in the first day of analysis (1095.4 pg/mL), however a significant increase in IL-10 (122.2 pg/mL) was also recorded for the same time-point, suggesting the induction of an anti-inflammatory effect. Finally, crotamine changed the systemic redox state by inducing gradual increase in serum levels of TBARS (1.0⁻1.8 μM/mL) and decrease in SH levels (124.7⁻19.5 μM/mL) throughout the experimental period of analysis. In summary, rats intradermally injected with crotamine presented local and systemic acute inflammatory responses similarly to histamine, which limits crotamine therapeutic use on its original form.",Evaluation of a Brief Sodium Screener in Two Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646541,Nutrients,2019 03 11,"The Sodium Screener© (SS©), as developed by NutritionQuest (Berkeley, CA, USA), was designed to reduce the burden of repeated dietary or urinary sodium measurements, but the accuracy of daily sodium intake estimates has not been reported. Associations were examined between sodium intakes derived from the SS© scores and repeated 24-h recalls (24DR) in two studies with different administration modes. In one study, 102 registered dietitians (RD) completed three Automated Self-Administered 24DRs (ASA24©), version 2014, followed by the SS©; both were self-administered and web-based. In the second sample, (the Study of Household Purchasing Patterns, Eating, and Recreation or SHoPPER), trained dietitians conducted 24DR interviews with 69 community-dwelling adults in their homes; all the community adults then completed a paper-based SS© at the final visit. In the RD study, SS© -predicted sodium intakes were 2604 ± 990 (mean ± Standard deviation (SD)), and ASA24© sodium intakes were 3193 ± 907 mg/day. In the SHoPPER sample, corresponding values were 3338 ± 1310 mg/day and 2939 ± 1231 mg/day, respectively.

This study focuses on the relationship between the socioeconomic status and the morbidity rates in China, which helps to add new evidence for the fragmentary relationship between socioeconomic status and morbidity rates. The National Health Services Survey (NHSS) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data are used to examine whether the association holds in both all-age cohorts and in older only cohorts. Three morbidity outcomes (two-week incidence rate, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and the number of sick days per thousand people) and two socioeconomic status indicators (income and education) are mainly examined. The results indicate that there are quadratic relationships between income per capita and morbidities. This non-linear correlation is similar to the patterns in European countries. Meanwhile, there is no association between education years and the morbidity in China, i.e., either two-week incidence rate or prevalence rate of chronic diseases has no statistically significant relationship with the education level in China.","Health Risk Assessment of Inorganic Mercury and Methylmercury via Rice Consumption in the Urban City of Guiyang, Southwest China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646539,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 23,"Rice consumption is the main methylmercury (MeHg) exposure route for residents in mercury (Hg) mining areas.

The THg concentrations in all rice samples (range: 0.97 to 13.10 μg·kg-1; mean: 3.88 μg·kg-1) were lower than the Chinese national standard (20 μg·kg-1). The average MeHg concentration in rice was 1.16 μg·kg-1. The total HQs (THQs) ranged from 0.0106 to 0.1048, with a mean of 0.0462, which was far lower than 1.

Moreover, the interaction between hYSK1 and p21WAF1/Cip1 led to the inhibition of SP-1 transcriptional activity, as revealed by a significant down-regulation of SP-1-mediated transactivation of p16INK4a promoter, and accelerated MMP-2 expression. Conversely, the knock-down of hYSK1 enhanced the p16INK4a promoter activity and protein expression, and diminished MMP-2 transcription and protein levels in hypoxic conditions as compared to control. Taken together, hYSK1 blocks the p21WAF1/Cip1 functions by direct interaction and inhibits the p16INK4a expression and induces MMP-2 expression by its regulations of SP-1 transcriptional activity under the hypoxia conditions.",Pathway Analysis of Fucoidan Activity Using a Yeast Gene Deletion Library Screen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646537,Marine drugs,2019 02 06,"Fucoidan, the sulfated fucose-rich polysaccharide derived from brown macroalgae, was reported to display some anti-cancer effects in in vitro and in vivo models that included apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The proposed mechanisms of action involve enhanced immune surveillance and direct pro-apoptotic effects via the activation of cell signaling pathways that remain largely uncharacterized. This study aimed to identify cellular pathways influenced by fucoidan using an unbiased genetic approach to generate additional insights into the anti-cancer effects of fucoidan. Drug⁻gene interactions of Undaria pinnatifida fucoidan were assessed by a systematic screen of the entire set of 4,733 halpoid Saccharomycescerevsiae gene deletion strains. Some of the findings were confirmed using cell cycle analysis and DNA damage detection in non-immortalized human dermal fibroblasts and colon cancer cells. The yeast deletion library screen and subsequent pathway and interactome analysis identified global effects of fucoidan on a wide range of eukaryotic cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, protein synthesis, sorting, targeting and transport, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial maintenance, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage repair-related pathways. Fucoidan also reduced clonogenic survival, induced DNA damage and G1-arrest in colon cancer cells, while these effects were not observed in non-immortalized human fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate global effects of fucoidan in diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic cells and further our understanding about the inhibitory effect of Undaria pinnatifida fucoidan on the growth of human cancer cells.",Statistical Approach to Spectrogram Analysis for Radio-Frequency Interference Detection and Mitigation in an L-Band Microwave Radiometer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646536,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"For the elimination of radio-frequency interference (RFI) in a passive microwave radiometer, the threshold level is generally calculated from the mean value and standard deviation. However, a serious problem that can arise is an error in the retrieved brightness temperature from a higher threshold level owing to the presence of RFI. In this paper, we propose a method to detect and mitigate RFI contamination using the threshold level from statistical criteria based on a spectrogram technique. Mean and skewness spectrograms are created from a brightness temperature spectrogram by shifting the 2-D window to discriminate the form of the symmetric distribution as a natural thermal emission signal. From the remaining bins of the mean spectrogram eliminated by RFI-flagged bins in the skewness spectrogram for data captured at 0.1-s intervals, two distribution sides are identically created from the left side of the distribution by changing the standard position of the distribution. Simultaneously, kurtosis calculations from these bins for each symmetric distribution are repeatedly performed to determine the retrieved brightness temperature corresponding to the closest kurtosis value of three. The performance is evaluated using experimental data, and the maximum error and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in the retrieved brightness temperature are served to be less than approximately 3 K and 1.7 K, respectively, from a window with a size of 100 × 100 time⁻frequency bins according to the RFI levels and cases.",Robotic System for Inspection by Contact of Bridge Beams Using UAVs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646535,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"This paper presents a robotic system using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for bridge-inspection tasks that require physical contact between the aerial platform and the bridge surfaces, such as beam-deflection analysis or measuring crack depth with an ultrasonic sensor. The proposed system takes advantage of the aerodynamic ceiling effect that arises when the multirotor gets close to the bridge surface. Moreover, this paper describes how a UAV can be used as a sensor that is able to fly and touch the bridge to take measurements during an inspection by contact. A practical application of the system involving the measurement of a bridge's beam deflection using a laser tracking station is also presented. In order to validate our system, experiments on two different bridges involving the measurement of the deflection of their beams are shown.",Preparation and Study of the Antibacterial Applications and Oxidative Stress Induction of Copper Maleamate-Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646534,Pharmaceutics,2019 02 16,"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are an interesting class of nanomaterials with potential applications in different therapeutic areas and that have been extensively used as drug carriers in different fields of medicine. The present work is focused on the synthesis of MSNs containing a maleamato ligand (MSN-maleamic) and the subsequent coordination of copper(II) ions (MSN-maleamic-Cu) for the exploration of their potential application as antibacterial agents. The Cu-containing nanomaterials have been characterized by different techniques and the preliminary antibacterial effect of the supported maleamato-copper(II) complexes has been tested against two types of bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative) in different assays to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The biological results showed a moderate antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli which motivated a more detailed study of the antibacterial mechanism of action of the synthesized maleamate-containing nanosystems and whose findings showed oxidative stress generation in bacterial cells. All the prepared nanomaterials were also tested as catalysts in the ""solvent free"" selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, to observe if there is a potential correlation between the catalytic oxidation capacity of the materials and the observed oxidative stress in bacteria. This may help in the future, for a more accurate rational design of antibacterial nanosystems, based on their observed catalytic oxidation activity.",White Sweet Potato as Meal Replacement for Overweight White-Collar Workers: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646532,Nutrients,2019 03 11,"Overweight and obesity are a global concern. Meal replacements (MRs) are portion- and calorie-controlled meals, which make the food environment part of an individual's weight loss regimen. White sweet potato (WSP; Ipomoea batatas L.), used in traditional medicine in Brazil, Japan, and Taiwan, is a healthy carbohydrate source. In this randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effects of a WSP formula on body weight management in 58 white-collar workers through MR to elucidate the effects of this WSP-MR on factors leading to overweight. The participants consumed either two packs a day for a total of 132 g of WSP (WSP-MR group) or a normal diet daily (non-WSP group) for eight weeks. After eight weeks, body weight, body fat, body mass index, wrist circumference, thigh circumference, calf circumference, mid-arm circumference, and triceps skinfolds decreased significantly in both the groups. Moreover, the WSP-MR group demonstrated a 5% decrease in body weight, body fat, body mass index, and mid-arm circumference and a 3.5% decrease in glycated hemoglobin levels (p < 0.05). The treatment was well tolerated, without side effects or adverse events. Thus, our WSP formula as an MR can facilitate individual weight loss and thus has commercial application in the food industry."

Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies against PEDV is an effective prevention measure. In this study, single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against PEDV were screened from the porcine scFv phage display library. After four rounds of biopanning, scFvs that showed higher affinity to the PEDV antigen were selected for further study. The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection.",Bortezomib Augments Natural Killer Cell Targeting of Stem-Like Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646520,Cancers,2019 04 02,"Tumor cells harboring stem-like/cancer stem cell (CSC) properties have been identified and isolated from numerous hematological and solid malignancies. These stem-like tumor cells can persist following conventional cytoreductive therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, thereby repopulating the tumor and seeding relapse and/or metastasis. We have previously shown that natural killer (NK) cells preferentially target stem-like tumor cells via non- major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, augments NK cell targeting of stem cell-like tumor cells against multiple solid human tumor-derived cancer lines and primary tissue samples. Mechanistically, this was mediated by the upregulation of cell surface NK ligands MHC class I chain-related protein A and B (MICA and MICB) on aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH)-positive CSCs. The increased expression of MICA and MICB on CSC targets thereby enhanced NK cell mediated killing in vitro and ex vivo from both human primary tumor and patient-derived xenograft samples. In vivo, the combination of bortezomib and allogeneic NK cell adoptive transfer in immunodeficient mice led to increased elimination of CSCs as well as tumor growth delay of orthotopic glioblastoma tumors. Taken together, our data support the combination bortezomib and NK transfer as a strategy for both CSC targeting and potentially improved outcomes in clinical cancer patients.",Macrovascular Networks on Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Improves Survival Prediction in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646519,Cancers,2019 02 06,"A higher degree of angiogenesis is associated with shortened survival in glioblastoma. Feasible morphometric parameters for analyzing vascular networks in brain tumors in clinical practice are lacking. We investigated whether the macrovascular network classified by the number of vessel-like structures (nVS) visible on three-dimensional T1-weighted contrast⁻enhanced (3D-T1CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve survival prediction models for newly diagnosed glioblastoma based on clinical and other imaging features. Ninety-seven consecutive patients (62 men; mean age, 58 ± 15 years) with histologically proven glioblastoma underwent 1.5T-MRI, including anatomical, diffusion-weighted, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, and 3D-T1CE sequences after 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. We assessed nVS related to the tumor on 1-mm isovoxel 3D-T1CE images, and relative cerebral blood volume, relative cerebral flow volume (rCBF), delay mean time, and apparent diffusion coefficient in volumes of interest for contrast-enhancing lesion (CEL), non-CEL, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter. We also assessed Visually Accessible Rembrandt Images scoring system features. We used ROC curves to determine the cutoff for nVS and univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards regression for overall survival. Prognostic factors were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival and ROC analyses. Lesions with nVS > 5 were classified as having highly developed macrovascular network; 58 (60.4%) tumors had highly developed macrovascular network. Patients with highly developed macrovascular network were older, had higher volumeCEL, increased rCBFCEL, and poor survival; nVS correlated negatively with survival (r = -0.286; p = 0.008). On multivariate analysis, standard treatment, age at diagnosis, and macrovascular network best predicted survival at 1 year (AUC 0.901, 83.3% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity, 96.2% PPV, 73.7% NPV).

Olive oil, a major component of the Mediterranean diet, is an abundant source of phenolic compounds. Olive oil production is associated with the generation of a waste material, termed 'olive mill wastewater' (OMWW) that have been reported to contain water-soluble polyphenols. Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered as an ideal cancer type for chemopreventive approaches, due to its wide incidence but relatively long latency period and progression time. Here, we investigated activities associated with potential preventive properties of a polyphenol-rich olive mill wastewater extract, OMWW (A009), on three in vitro models of PCa. A009 was able to inhibit PCa cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion. Molecularly, we found that A009 targeted NF-κB and reduced pro-angiogenic growth factor, VEGF, CXCL8, and CXCL12 production. IL-6/STAT3 axis was also regulated by the extract. A009 shows promising properties, and purified hydroxytyrosol (HyT), the major polyphenol component of A009, was also active but not always as effective as A009. Finally, our results support the idea of repositioning a food waste-derived material for nutraceutical employment, with environmental and industrial cost management benefits.",G-Protein Coupled Estrogen Receptor in Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646517,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"The G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), an alternate estrogen receptor (ER) with a structure distinct from the two canonical ERs, being ERα, and ERβ, is expressed in 50% to 60% of breast cancer tissues and has been presumed to be associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance in ERα positive breast cancer. On the other hand, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 15% to 20% of breast cancers and frequently displays a more aggressive behavior. GPER is prevalent and involved in TNBC and can be a therapeutic target. However, contradictory results exist regarding the function of GPER in breast cancer, proliferative or pro-apoptotic. A better understanding of the GPER, its role in breast cancer, and the interactions with the ER and epidermal growth factor receptor will be beneficial for the disease management and prevention in the future.",Biological Properties of Calcium Phosphate Bioactive Glass Composite Bone Substitutes: Current Experimental Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646516,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 24,"Standard treatment for bone defects is the biological reconstruction using autologous bone-a therapeutical approach that suffers from limitations such as the restricted amount of bone available for harvesting and the necessity for an additional intervention that is potentially followed by donor-site complications. Therefore, synthetic bone substitutes have been developed in order to reduce or even replace the usage of autologous bone as grafting material. This structured review focuses on the question whether calcium phosphates (CaPs) and bioactive glasses (BGs), both established bone substitute materials, show improved properties when combined in CaP/BG composites. It therefore summarizes the most recent experimental data in order to provide a better understanding of the biological properties in general and the osteogenic properties in particular of CaP/BG composite bone substitute materials. As a result, BGs seem to be beneficial for the osteogenic differentiation of precursor cell populations in-vitro when added to CaPs. Furthermore, the presence of BG supports integration of CaP/BG composites into bone in-vivo and enhances bone formation under certain circumstances.","Immunological Features in the Process of Blood Platelet-Induced Alloimmunisation, with a Focus on Platelet Component Transfusion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646515,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Alloimmunisation to platelet antigens is not uncommon; a large number of females, having had pregnancies, developed antibodies to Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) moieties harboured on their foetuses' cells (inherited from the father(s)) that may conflict with further pregnancies and transfused Platelet Components occasionally. This is possible since platelets constitutionally express HLA class I molecules (though in copy numbers that consistently differ among individuals). Platelets also express HPA moieties that are variants of naturally expressed adhesion and aggregation molecules; HPA differences between mothers and foetuses and between donors and recipients explain alloimmune conflicts and consequences. Lastly, platelets express ABO blood group antigens, which are rarely immunising, however transfusion mismatches in ABO groups seem to be related to immunisation in other blood and tissue groups. Transfusion also brings residual leukocytes that may also immunise through their copious copy numbers of HLA class I (rarely class II on activated T lymphocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells). In addition, residual red blood cells in platelet concentrates may induce anti-red blood cell allo-antibodies. This short review aims to present the main mechanisms that are commonly reported in alloimmunisation. It also critically endeavours to examine paths to either dampen alloimmunisation occurrences or to prevent them.",Combined Effect of Light and Temperature on the Production of Saxitoxins in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii Strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646514,Toxins,2019 02 06,"Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a potentially toxic freshwater cyanobacterium that can tolerate a wide range of light and temperature. Due to climatic changes, the interaction between light and temperature is studied in aquatic systems, but no study has addressed the effect of both variables on the saxitoxins production. This study evaluated the combined effect of light and temperature on saxitoxins production and cellular quota in C. raciborskii. Experiments were performed with three C. raciborskii strains in batch cultures under six light intensities (10, 40, 60, 100, 150, and 500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) and four temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 °C). The growth of C. raciborskii strains was limited at lower temperatures and the maximum growth rates were obtained under higher light combined with temperatures equal or above 20 °C, depending on the strain. In general, growth was highest at 30 °C at the lower light intensities and equally high at 25 °C and 30 °C under higher light. Highest saxitoxins concentration and cell-quota occurred at 25 °C under high light intensities, but were much lower at 30 °C. Hence, increased temperatures combined with sufficient light will lead to higher C. raciborskii biomass, but blooms could become less toxic in tropical regions.",Assistive Grasping Based on Laser-point Detection with Application to Wheelchair-mounted Robotic Arms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646513,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 15,"As the aging of the population becomes more severe, wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) are gaining an increased amount of attention. Laser pointer interactions are an attractive method enabling humans to unambiguously point out objects and pick them up. In addition, they bring about a greater sense of participation in the interaction process as an intuitive interaction mode. However, the issue of human⁻robot interactions remains to be properly tackled, and traditional laser point interactions still suffer from poor real-time performance and low accuracy amid dynamic backgrounds. In this study, combined with an advanced laser point detection method and an improved pose estimation algorithm, a laser pointer is used to facilitate the interactions between humans and a WMRA in an indoor environment. Assistive grasping using a laser selection consists of two key steps. In the first step, the images captured using an RGB-D camera are pre-processed, and then fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the 2D coordinates of the laser point and objects within the image. Meanwhile, the centroid coordinates of the selected object are also obtained using the depth information. In this way, the object to be picked up and its location are determined. The experimental results show that the laser point can be detected with almost 100% accuracy in a complex environment. In the second step, a compound pose-estimation algorithm aiming at a sparse use of multi-view templates is applied, which consists of both coarse- and precise-matching of the target to the template objects, greatly improving the grasping performance. The proposed algorithms were implemented on a Kinova Jaco robotic arm, and the experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness. Compared with commonly accepted methods, the time consumption of the pose generation can be reduced from 5.36 to 4.43 s, and synchronously, the pose estimation error is significantly improved from 21.31% to 3.91%.",Colorectal Cancer and Nutrition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646512,Nutrients,2019 03 11,"Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the US.

This study investigated the fraction distribution and release of phosphorus from soil aggregates structure under different land uses (rice, maize and soybean). The soil aggregates were characterized as large macro-aggregates (L-mac, >1 mm), small macro-aggregates (S-mac, 0.25⁻1 mm), micro-aggregates (MIC, 0.053⁻0.25 mm) and silt clay (SC, <0.053 mm) with the wet-sieving method. A sequential chemical extraction scheme was used to separate phosphorus into labile inorganic phosphorus (L-Pi), labile organic phosphorus (L-Po), moderately labile organic phosphorus (Ml-Po), iron-aluminum bound phosphorus (Fe.Al-P), calcium-magnesium bound phosphorus (Ca.Mg-P), humic phosphorus (Hu-P) and residual phosphorus (Re-P). Experimental results indicated that soil aggregates were mainly S-mac and MIC, followed by L-mac and SC, and they accounted for 52.16%, 25.20%, 14.23% and 8.49% in rice fields, 44.21%, 34.61%, 12.88% and 8.30% in maize fields, and 28.87%, 47.63%, 3.52% and 19.99% in soybean fields, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN), soil organic matter (SOM), Fe and Mn in soil aggregate fractions decreased with the reduction in soil aggregate grain-sizes. For phosphorus fractions (P-fractions), Fe.Al-P and Re-P tended to condense in L-mac and S-mac. MIC and SC were the primary carriers of Ca.Mg-P. Adsorption isotherm simulation results demonstrated that L-mac and S-mac have a strong capacity to retain phosphorus. In rice fields, phosphorus bioavailability and utilization rate were high. However, the P-fractions there were easily changed under aerobic-anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the risk of phosphorus loss during drainage should be given considerable attention.",Assessing Parameter Suitability for the Strength Evaluation of Intramolecular Resonance Assisted Hydrogen Bonding in o-Carbonyl Hydroquinones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646498,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) interactions have attracted considerable attention due to their central role in molecular structure, chemical reactivity, and interactions of biologically active molecules. Precise correlations of the strength of IMHB's with experimental parameters are a key goal in order to model compounds for drug discovery. In this work, we carry out an experimental (NMR) and theoretical (DFT) study of the IMHB in a series of structurally similar o-carbonyl hydroquinones. Geometrical parameters, as well as Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) parameters for IMHB were compared with experimental NMR data. Three DFT functionals were employed to calculated theoretical parameters: B3LYP, M06-2X, and ωB97XD. O…H distance is the most suitable geometrical parameter to distinguish among similar IMHBs. Second order stabilization energies ΔEij(2) from NBO analysis and hydrogen bond energy (EHB) obtained from QTAIM analysis also properly distinguishes the order in strength of the studied IMHB. ΔEij(2) from NBO give values for the IMHB below 30 kcal/mol, while EHB from QTAIM analysis give values above 30 kcal/mol. In all cases, the calculated parameters using ωB97XD give the best correlations with experimental ¹H-NMR chemical shifts for the IMHB, with R² values around 0.89. Although the results show that these parameters correctly reflect the strength of the IMHB, when the weakest one is removed from the analysis, arguing experimental considerations, correlations improve significantly to values around 0.95 for R².",Transungual Delivery of Ciclopirox Is Increased 3⁻4-Fold by Mechanical Fenestration of Human Nail Plate in an In Vitro Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646496,Pharmaceutics,2019 02 16,"Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of nails that is widespread and difficult to treat because of the impermeable nature of human nails. Topically applied anti-fungal agents cannot penetrate this structure, and treatment regimens often resort to systemic antifungals with concomitant side effects. One recent clinical study suggested that mechanical fenestration of the nail using an intelligent nail drill might be a possible solution to this problem. In this work, an in vitro model of the transungual delivery of antifungal agents is presented, which utilizes real nail tissue and an inline flow system. This system was deployed to measure transungual delivery of ciclopirox and determined that nail fenestration improved drug delivery by 3⁻4-fold after 42 days.

However, no effective anti-MERS-CoV drug is currently available. Recently, numerous evolutionary studies have suggested that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronavirus (BatCoV). We herein reported that three peptides derived from the HR2 region in spike protein of BatCoV HKU4, including HKU4-HR2P1, HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, could bind the MERS-CoV HR1-derived peptide to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) with high stability. Moreover, these peptides, particularly HKU4-HR2P2 and HKU4-HR2P3, exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV S-mediated cell⁻cell fusion and viral infection, suggesting that these HKU4 HR2-derived peptides could be candidates for futher development as antiviral agents against MERS-CoV infection.",Success and Complication Rates After Sacral Neuromodulation for Fecal Incontinence and Constipation: A Single-center Follow-up Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646487,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2019 01 22,The aim of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) success in patients with fecal incontinence (FI) and/or constipation.,Differential Effects of Lactobacillus casei Strain Shirota on Patients With Constipation Regarding Stool Consistency in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646486,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2019 01 22,"Probiotics are expected to confer benefits on patients with constipation, but how probiotics act on constipated patients with variable stool consistencies remains unclear.
