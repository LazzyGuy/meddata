Unfortunately, the quantitative detection of the B2M monomer is difficult during B2M production. In this study, we established a method for the detection of the B2M monomer and its dimer in solution via gel filtration chromatography. The B2M powder was dissolved in 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.2-7.4) with a final mass concentration of 0.5 g/L. The B2M sample was analyzed on a TSKgel SuperSW2000 column (30 cm×4.6 mm, 4 μm) by an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC using 0.01 mol/L PBS (pH 7.2-7.4) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The temperature of the column was 25℃, and the detection wavelength was 280 nm. The purities of the B2M monomer and the B2M dimer were tested. A series of concentrations of B2M monomer solutions were prepared to create a standard working curve. The standard working curve of the B2M monomer had a good linear relationship (coefficient of correlation (r2) was 0.9948). The limit of quantitation for the B2M monomer in PBS was 0.08 g/L (S/N=10).

Three thousand two hundred and forty-two thyroid nodules images confirmed by pathology were categorized according to modified TI-RADS and ACR TI-RADS classification. The performances of two TI-RADS were assessed by ROC curves. The correlations between classifications with the pathology and the consistency of different doctors were evaluated. The ultrasonic differences of MTC, PTC, and benign nodules were analyzed. As a result, the number of high suspicious US features increased, the malignant risk of nodules also increased of two classifications, with significant differences between categories (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.751 (modified TI-TADS) and 0.744 (ACR TI-RADS). Areas under the ROC curve of the modified TI-RADS and ACR TI-RADS were 0.960 and 0.872 (P < 0.001).

The Kendall's correlation coefficients were 0.962, 0.930, and 0.987. MTC had special ultrasonography characters compared with PTC and benign nodules. These results suggest that modified TI-RADS is better than ACR TI-RADS in diagnosing thyroid carcinomas.

Forty people aged 20-29, 44 aged 60-69, and 32 aged 70-79 were presented with places consisting of four different objects during the encoding phase. In the test phase, they were then presented with a second place and had to decide whether it was the same or different. Test places were presented from different perspectives (0°, 30°, 60°) and with different object conditions (same, a swap of two objects, a substitution with a novel object). The sensitivity for detecting changes (d') decreased from 20-29 to 60-69 and to 70-79 years old, and with increasing perspective shifts. Importantly, older adults were less sensitive to object swapping than to object substitution, while young participants did not show any difference. Overall, these results suggest specific age-related difficulties in object-location binding in the context of place recognition."

NMR data is analyzed with the dynamics detector method, which yields timescale-specific information. An analogous analysis is performed on MD trajectories. Because specific MD predictions can be verified as agreeing with the NMR data, MD was used for further interpretation of NMR results: for the different timescales, cross-correlation coefficients were derived to quantify the correlation of the motion between different residues. Short timescales are the result of very local motions, while longer timescales are found for longer-range correlated motion. Similar trends on ns- and μs-timescales suggest that μs motion in fibrils is the result of motion correlated over many fibril layers.",Novel approach to enhance sensitivity in surface-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging using deposited organic-inorganic hybrid matrices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070274,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,2019 05 09,"Sample pretreatment is key to obtaining good data in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Although sublimation is one of the best methods for obtaining homogenously fine organic matrix crystals, its sensitivity can be low due to the lack of a solvent extraction effect. We investigated the effect of incorporating a thin film of metal formed by zirconium (Zr) sputtering into the sublimation process for MALDI matrix deposition for improving the detection sensitivity in mouse liver tissue sections treated with olanzapine. The matrix-enhanced surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (ME-SALDI) method, where a matrix was formed by sputtering Zr to form a thin nanoparticle layer before depositing MALDI organic matrix comprising α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) by sublimation, resulted in a significant improvement in sensitivity, with the ion intensity of olanzapine being about 1,800 times that observed using the MALDI method, comprising CHCA sublimation alone. When Zr sputtering was performed after CHCA deposition, however, no such enhancement in sensitivity was observed. The enhanced sensitivity due to Zr sputtering was also observed when the CHCA solution was applied by spraying, being about twice as high as that observed by CHCA spraying alone. In addition, the detection sensitivity of these various pretreatment methods was similar for endogenous glutathione. Given that sample preparation using the ME-SALDI-MSI method, which combines Zr sputtering with the sublimation method for depositing an organic matrix, does not involve a solvent, delocalization problems such as migration of analytes observed after matrix spraying and washing with aqueous solutions as sample pretreatment are not expected. Therefore, ME-Zr-SALDI-MSI is a novel sample pretreatment method that can improve the sensitivity of analytes while maintaining high spatial resolution in MALDI-MSI.",Bispecific Radioligands targeting Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and Gastrin Releasing Peptide receptors (GRPr) on the surface of prostate cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070273,Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals,2019 05 09,"Metastases of prostate cancer usually show highly heterogeneous or partly lost prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression. In order to image and treat both PSMA positive and negative tissues, the extension of PSMA tracer specificity to other receptors, also highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells, has been suggested. Prostate cancer cells usually express both PSMA and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors, thus bispecific heterodimeric molecules, addressing both targets at the same time, may significantly improve prostate cancer imaging and therapy.

For example, mechanochromic polymers have applications in force-responsive colorimetric sensors and soft robotics, but their integration into sensitive, multifunctional devices remains challenging. Herein, a hierarchical nanoparticle-in-micropore (NP-MP) architecture in porous mechanochromic polymers, which enhances the mechanosensitivity and stretchability of mechanochromic electronic skins (e-skins), is reported. The hierarchical NP-MP structure results in stress-concentration-induced mechanochemical activation of mechanophores, significantly improving the mechanochromic sensitivity to both tensile strain and normal force (critical tensile strain: 50% and normal force: 1 N). Furthermore, the porous mechanochromic composites exhibit a reversible mechanochromism under a strain of 250%. This architecture enables a dual-mode mechanochromic e-skin for detecting static/dynamic forces via mechanochromism and triboelectricity. The hierarchical NP-MP architecture provides a general platform to develop mechanochromic composites with high sensitivity and stretchability.",Exendin-4 analogs in insulinoma theranostics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070270,Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals,2019 05 09,"Insulinomas are neuroendocrine tumors arising from the pancreatic beta cells.

However, CMI has been difficult to evaluate because no simple CMI measurement method is available. We aimed to compare the performance of a CMI measurement method that we developed, which involves reacting whole blood with antigen, with the conventional method based on isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We compared and tested correlations between these methods before and after vaccination in 26 healthy adults (28-58 years old; 12 men and 14 women). Changes in CMI after influenza vaccination in PBMCs cultured with antigen for 48 and 96 h and whole blood cultured with antigen for 48 h were studied. We found CMI measurement results using whole blood on day 2 and PBMCs on day 4 to be correlated. Spearman's correlation coefficients with four antigens [A (H1N1), A (H3N2), B (Yamagata lineage), and B (Victoria lineage)] before vaccination were 0.55, 0.61, 0.58, and 0.70, respectively, and were 0.40, 0.45, 0.62, and 0.52 after vaccination. CMI was detected sooner when whole blood was reacted with antigen than when PBMCs were reacted with antigen. The positive reaction rate of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) in whole blood on day 2 was higher than that in PBMCs on day 2. Our method is simple and may be useful for vaccine development as it can measure CMI with a small amount of blood without separation into PBMCs. This article is protected by copyright.

This historical period overshadowed Carl Jung's visit to America between 1909 and 1937. The spirit of the times and practices of racism coloured Jung's views, attitudes, and theories about African Americans, just as colonialism coloured his attitudes toward Africa and Africans. Consequently Jung failed to see the African Diaspora and the extraordinary intellectual and artistic period of the Harlem Renaissance (1919-1929). Its introduction here foregrounds the exceptionalism of African Americans and the cultural continuity of African ancestry. This exceptionalism was not seen by Jung and there have been no attempts to redress its omission from analytical psychology and other sub-disciplines of Western psychology. Jung's theories of personality and psychoanalysis and his negative projections about primitivism among Africans and African American 'Negroes' would have been mediated by knowledge of a legislated American apartheid and the Harlem Renaissance which occurred within the barriers of apartheid. In this paper I posit that culture, kinship libido, and the African principle of Ubuntu are healing modalities that play a critical role in instinct and the relational ground of human psychology and biology, from which culture as an environmental expression constellates around common goals of the human species. Cultural equivalencies and expressions within the wisdom traditions and mythologies of the Africa Diaspora are considered. Specifically, the Bantu principle of Ubuntu or 'humanity' is identified as the relational ground in African cultures, while the Kemetic-Egyptian deity Maat, as an archetypal anima figure and the religio-mythology offer a transcendent position from which to critique the inequities and constitutional jurisprudence that structured American apartheid. Maat is the personification of truth, justice, balance and weighing of the heart in orderly judicial processes. In her we find the alignment of the spirit and matter in the law and judgement. The paper concludes with reflections on pathways toward healing the psychopathology of racism and recommendations to enhance clinical training and practice.",Characterization of arsenic resistant plant-growth promoting indigenous soil bacteria isolated from Centre-East regions of India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070248,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 05 09,"A total of forty-five morphologically distinct arsenic (As) resistant bacterial strains were isolated from the soils of different regions of Chhattisgarh, India. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of these isolates varied widely in the range of 100-500 mM for arsenate (As(V)) and 15-30 mM for arsenite (As(III)). Out of forty-five, three isolates viz.; ARP3, ARRP3 and ADT5 also revealed plant growth-promoting properties, including phosphate solubilization and productions of siderophores, indolacetic acid, ammonia and exopolysaccharide. Besides all these, the strains not only exhibited significant growth in the presence of As(V)/As(III) but also displayed higher efficiency (87-94%) of As removal from the growth medium followed by intracellular accumulation (17-19 mg As/g). Hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopic (HG-AAS) analysis revealed the intracellular accumulation of As, and the structural changes taken place in these isolates was further confirmed by microscopic studies. The 16S rRNA and phylogenetic analyses unveiled that the isolates ARP3, ARRP3 and ADT5 belonged to genera Pseudomonas, Exiguobaterium and Microbacterium, respectively. Conducted study suggested that such beneficial bacterial strains could be conveniently exploited at commercial level for enhancing plants growth in As contaminated agricultural fields, thereby improved productivity and enhanced bioremediation of soil having alarming strength of As.

However, it is now evident that certain forms of DILI are immune-mediated and may involve the activation of drug-specific T-cells. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that carry RNA, lipids and protein cargo from their cell of origin to distant cells, and may play a role in immune activation. Herein, primary human hepatocytes were treated with drugs associated with a high incidence of DILI (flucloxacillin, amoxicillin, isoniazid and nitroso-sulfamethoxazole) to characterize the proteins packaged within exosomes that are subsequently transported to dendritic cells for processing. Exosomes measured between 50-100 nm and expressed enriched CD63. LC-MS/MS identified 2109 proteins, with 608 proteins being quantified across all exosome samples. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010760. Analysis of gene ontologies revealed that exosomes mirrored whole human liver tissue in terms of the families of proteins present, regardless of drug treatment. However, exosomes from nitroso-sulfamethoxazole-treated hepatocytes selectively packaged a specific subset of proteins. LC-MS also revealed the presence of hepatocyte-derived exosomal proteins covalently modified with amoxicillin, flucloxacillin and nitroso-sulfamethoxazole. Uptake of exosomes by monocyte-derived dendritic cells occurred silently, mainly via phagocytosis, and was inhibited by latrunculin A. An, amoxicillin-modified 9-mer peptide derived from the exosomal transcription factor protein SOX30 activated naïve T-cells from HLA-A*02:01 positive human donors. Conclusion. This study shows that exosomes have the potential to transmit drug-specific hepatocyte-derived signals to the immune system and provides a pathway for the induction of drug hapten-specific T-cell responses.

Morphologies were extracted from tomography data and integrated with data from microscopy modalities at different resolution levels. This enables contextualization of some of the fine-scale properties which underpin the large-scale damage observed via tomography. Lateral views of crack development are presented, which show networks analogous to mud-cracks. Crack fronts which develop in the most porous regions within the sintered attachment layer travel across the boundary into the copper substrate. The propagation characteristics of these cracks within the substrate are analysed. Evidence is provided of heterogeneous densification within the sintered joint under power cycling, and this is shown to play a major role in driving the initiation and propagation of the cracks. Examination of the texture (differing levels of X-ray absorption) of virtual cross-sectional images reveals the origins of the nonuniformity of densification. Finally, cracks within the sintered joint are shown to have a negligible impact on the conduction pathway of the joint due to their aspect ratio and orientation with respect to the assembly. LAY DESCRIPTION: This paper concerns the use of three-dimensional (3D) X-ray tomography, a nondestructive technique, to perform cradle-to-grave studies of sintered nanosilver die-attachments under operation. Sintered nanosilver die-attachments have been proposed as a more reliable and environmentally friendly alternative to solder alloy joints for emerging power electronics module designs. However, their degradation mechanisms are not as well understood. This same sample-study is about observing how the fine-scale structure of a sintered attachment evolves and degrades over time. Using 3D tomography affords otherwise infeasible perspectives, such as virtual cross-sections in the lateral plane of the attachment. These perspectives provide qualitative information which elucidates the degradation mechanisms. They demonstrate, for example, that the structure of the sintered attachment densifies under operation, and a consequence of this is the formation of shrinkage cracks in the most porous regions, much like mud-cracks. Other imaging techniques (metallographic etching and scanning electron microscopy) have been used in correlation with 3D renderings of these cracks to analyse their propagation and reveal their relationship both with the internal structure of the sintered attachment itself, and the structure of the substrate to which it is joined. It is shown that the cracks develop within the sintered attachment layer and eventually cross over into the substrate. A comparison of two sintered attachments with contrasting bulk porosities allows the effect of initial bond quality on crack development to be examined.",Preliminary Evidence That Real World Sleep Timing and Duration are Associated With Laboratory-Assessed Alcohol Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070238,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2019 05 21,"Sleep timing and evening chronotype have been implicated in alcohol use problems but research has yet to study them in relation to theory-driven laboratory-based measures of alcohol use disorder risk.

We show that the single ICC reaction peak in the NaOH-activated slag is accompanied with a transformation of free water to bound water (from QENS analysis), which directly signals formation of a sodium-containing aluminum-substituted calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-(N)-A-S-H) gel, as confirmed by FTIR. In contrast, the Na2SiO3-activated slag sample exhibits two distinct reaction peaks in the ICC data, where the first reaction peak is associated with conversion of constrained water to bound and free water, and the second peak is accompanied by conversion of free water to bound and constrained water (from QENS analysis). The second conversion is attributed to formation of the main reaction product (i.e., C-(N)-A-S-H gel) as confirmed by FTIR and N2 sorption data. Analysis of the QENS, FTIR and N2 sorption data together with thermodynamic information from the literature explicitly shows that the first reaction peak is associated with the formation of an initial gel (similar to C-(N)-A-S-H gel) that is governed by the Na+ ions and silicate species in Na2SiO3 solution and the dissolved Ca/Al species from slag. Hence, this study exemplifies the power of in situ QENS, when combined with laboratory-based characterization techniques, in elucidating the water dynamics and associated chemical mechanisms occurring in complex materials, and has provided important mechanistic insight on the early-age reactions occurring during formation of two alkali-activated slags.","Alkaline manganese electrochemistry studied by in situ and operando spectroscopic methods - metal dissolution, oxide formation and oxygen evolution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070222,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 23,"Manganese-based systems are considered as candidate electrocatalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), because of their abundance in biochemical oxygen producing catalyst systems. In this work, the surface of metallic manganese was investigated in situ and operando in potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and potentiostatic chronoamperometry (CA) experiments in NaOH. In both cases, the surfaces were initially reduced. At corresponding potentials, no oxide species can be detected by Raman spectroscopy, though electrochemical data and the absence of dissolution above the reversible potential for reactions of type Mn → MnII indicate that the material is passive. The CV shows anodic peaks at potentials in line with expectations on the basis of thermodynamic data for the oxidation to Mn3O4 and Mn2O3; the thickness of the surface layer increases by a few nm during these peaks, as evidenced by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Dissolution of Mn as evidenced by downstream electrolyte analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in a scanning flow cell (SFC-ICP-MS) of the electrolyte is negligible in the range of electrode potential vs. Ag|AgCl|3 M KCl, EAg|AgCl, up to 0.3 V. Remarkably, Raman spectra already show the occurrence of α-MnO2 at EAg|AgCl > -0.25 V, which is ca. 0.5 V below the potential at which oxidation to MnO2 is expected. This observation is attributed to disproportionation above a certain level of MnIII. For EAg|AgCl > 0.4 V, dissolution sets in, at a constant layer thickness. Above the onset potential of the OER, at EAg|AgCl≈ 0.6 V, SFC-ICP-MS analysis shows fast dissolution, and the oxide layer thickness is constant or increases. CA experiments during the OER show strong dissolution, and the re-formation of a strongly disordered, β-MnO2-like oxide, which exists in a quasi-stationary state at the interface. Several CV cycles increase the dissolution per cycle and the fraction of α-MnO2 on the surface which cannot be reduced. The high dissolution currents show that metallic Mn is hardly suitable as an OER catalyst, however, at least the MnIV oxides remain stationarily present in the system.","Mono, bis, and tris(phosphoramidate) titanium complexes: synthesis, structure, and reactivity investigations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070221,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 09,"A series of variously substituted phosphoramidate titanium complexes bearing dimethylamido ligands are reported.

The results warrant further in vivo evaluation of the tracer candidates as prospective CB2 PET-imaging agents.","DFT studies on metal-catalyzed cycloisomerization of trans-1,5-enynes to cyclopropane sesquiterpenoids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070217,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 05 22,"We have recently described the synthesis of strained carbocyclic sesquiterpenoid motifs through a highly regioselective cycloisomerization of common enyne acetates, in the presence of platinum(ii) and gold(i) chlorides as catalysts. In this work, the mechanisms of these cyclization reactions have been studied by means of DFT methods. At the outset of the reactions, the propargyl substrates suffer 1,2- or 1,3-acetate rearrangements, which compete for the formation of a metal-carbene or a vinyl-metal species, respectively. These intermediates are the resting states of the cycles towards the formation of lindenane or myliol core structures. The DFT studies have revealed the energetics of the two migration processes, as well as the reasons for some of the key experimental observations, such as the syn/anti preference in the formation of the cyclopropane rings, the different reactivities of substrates containing furan or lactone moieties, and the different outcomes of the reactions when Pt(ii) and Au(i) salts are used.",Photochemistry of tyrosine dimer: when an oxidative lesion of proteins is able to photoinduce further damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070216,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 05 09,"The tyrosine dimer (Tyr2), a covalent bond between two tyrosines (Tyr), is one of the most important modifications of the oxidative damage of proteins. This compound is increasingly used as a marker of aging, stress and pathogenesis. At physiological pH, Tyr2 is able to absorb radiation at wavelengths significantly present in the solar radiation and artificial sources of light. As a result, when Tyr2 is formed in vivo, a new chromophore appears in the proteins. Despite the biomedical importance of Tyr2, the information of its photochemical properties is limited due to the drawbacks of its synthesis. Therefore, in this work we demonstrate that at physiological pH, Tyr2 undergoes oxidation upon UV excitation yielding different products which conserve the dimeric structure. During its photodegradation different reactive oxygen species, like hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion and singlet oxygen, are produced. Otherwise, we demonstrated that Tyr2 is able to sensitize the photodegradation of tyrosine. The results presented in this work confirm that Tyr2 can act as a potential photosensitizer, contributing to the harmful effects of UV-A radiation on biological systems.",Electrochemical modulation of plasmon-induced charge separation behaviour at Au-TiO2 photocathodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070215,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 05 09,"Plasmon-induced charge separation (PICS) at the interface between a plasmonic nanoparticle and a semiconductor becomes less efficient as the plasmon resonance wavelength increases, because the energy of a photon may not be sufficiently higher than the interfacial Schottky barrier height. In this study, we developed PICS photocathodes by coating Au nanoparticles of different sizes on an ITO electrode with a thin TiO2 layer, and applied negative potentials to those photocathodes so as to suppress back electron transfer and improve the PICS photocurrent responses. The photocurrent enhancement factor was increased as the particle size was decreased, and enhancement of about two orders of magnitude was observed for small Au nanoparticles when bias voltage of 0.5 V was applied. In some cases the photocurrent enhancement was accompanied by a slight redshift of the photocurrent peak, which was caused by a lowered barrier. This technique would be useful for tuning the photocurrents when it is applied to devices such as electrochemical LSPR sensors and photodetectors.",Cyanidin-3-glucoside attenuates 4-hydroxynonenal- and visible light-induced retinal damage in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070214,Food & function,2019 05 22,"4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) is a highly reactive end-product of lipid peroxidation reaction that leads to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell damage. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), the most abundant anthocyanin in the edible parts of plants, is a nutritional supplement used for preventing retinal damage. However, the protective effect of C3G against HNE-induced RPE cell damage remains to be elucidated. The protective mechanisms of C3G on ARPE-19 cells after HNE exposure were investigated in this study. Results showed that compared with HNE-treated cells, the viability of ARPE-19 cells was significantly (P < 0.05) increased after 1 and 5 μM C3G treatment. C3G exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) inhibitory effect on the expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase in ARPE-19 cells. VEGF levels in the C3G groups were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased relative to those of the HNE-treated group. C3G also regulated the release of two inflammatory mediators, namely monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukine-8, in ARPE-19 cells after HNE treatment. Furthermore, C3G attenuated retinal cell apoptosis in pigmented rabbits induced by visible light. Therefore, our data showed that C3G has efficient protective effects on HNE-induced apoptosis, angiogenesis, and dysregulated cytokine production in ARPE-19 cells."

A combination therapy with high selectivity and easy controllability is a pressing need for the effective treatment of such cancer. In this study, an indocyanine green derivative (Cy7)-conjugated lipid with a terminal carboxyl group was synthesized, which could self-assemble with a cerasome-forming lipid (CFL) into nanoparticles (NPs) by encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve combined photothermal chemotherapy. The resulting Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs with a surface covalent silicate framework showed excellent morphological stability and colloidal stability. Specifically, the conjugated Cy7 was covalently conjugated in the liposomal bilayer, resulting in high drug loading content, high photostability, and high photothermal conversion efficiency, which enabled the resulting nanoparticles to be an effective platform for photothermal therapy. Meanwhile, the encapsulated DOX leaked only slightly under physiological conditions due to the silicate surface of Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs and exhibited controlled release in a weakly acidic environment or under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation for chemotherapy. Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs were efficiently taken up by tumour cells. Upon light irradiation, the released DOX entered the nuclei of tumour cells, as observed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. In vitro cell experiments indicated that both healthy cells and tumour cells were viable under treatment with only Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs, indicating the encapsulated DOX was stably confined to the NPs, and cells were significantly killed when treated with both Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs and NIR laser irradiation. After i.v. administration, Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs accumulated at the tumour site, as monitored by near-infrared fluorescence imaging. A significant tumour inhibition rate (95.8%) was also achieved in a HT-29 colorectal cancer model when treated with Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs plus irradiation. Therefore, the Gly@Cy7-Si-DOX NPs hold great promise for controllable combined colorectal cancer photothermal chemotherapy.",Synthesis of germanium nanocrystals from solid-state disproportionation of a chloride-derived germania glass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070202,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 23,"Germanium nanocrystals (Ge NCs) have potential to be used in several optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. Here, we report a solid-state route to synthesizing Ge NCs through thermal disproportionation of a germania (GeOX) glass, which was synthesized by hydrolyzing a GeCl2·dioxane complex. The GeOX glass synthesized in this manner was found to have residual Cl content. The process of nanocrystal nucleation and growth was monitored using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Compared to existing solid-state routes for synthesizing colloidal Ge NCs, this approach requires fewer steps and is amenable to scaling to large-scale reactions.",A spermine-conjugated lipophilic Pt(iv) prodrug designed to eliminate cancer stem cells in ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070201,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 23,"We developed a spermine-conjugated lipophilic Pt(iv) prodrug that is able to reduce the cancer stem cell population in ovarian cancer.

Nonetheless, these molecules featuring small cross sections of optical absorption and high radiative recombination rates lead to inferior performance of photothermal conversion. Herein, porphyrin paddle-wheel framework-3 (PPF-3) composed of tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) and Co2+ was utilized to study the possibility of the enhanced photothermal effect induced by a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Finally, the supported PPF-3 membrane exhibited comparable solar steam generation performance to a supported membrane of Au nanoparticles. The solar thermal receiver efficiency of the supported PPF-3 membrane was increased to 70.3% which was ∼420% higher than that of the supported TCPP membrane. The enhanced performance benefits from the PPF-3 structure and components that enable the broadening of the optical absorption range and suppress the radiative recombination of excitons by PET from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TCPP to cobalt ions. Based on the ubiquitous structures of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the research opens a new avenue for the applications of MOFs as cost-efficient and eligible photothermal materials.",Porous hollow CoInOx nanocubes as a highly efficient catalyst for the catalytic combustion of toluene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070199,Nanoscale,2019 05 23,"Porous hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes were synthesized via a SiO2 template strategy involving a cobalt-based metal-organic framework derived from a Prussian Blue analogue. As a heterogeneous catalytic material for the catalytic combustion of toluene, the hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes displayed superior catalytic performance (T90 = 178 °C) and greatly reduced the activation energy for toluene oxidation due to their large surface area, the formation of surface dangling bands and oxygen vacancies, and increased number of weak acid sites. In comparison, the C-CoInOx sample (without the introduction of a SiO2 template) required a higher reaction temperature to achieve the same conversion of toluene (T90 = 345 °C). Especially, the insertion and coating of SiO2 in CoIn-PBA nanocubes greatly improves their thermal stability, and the nanocubic shape of the porous hollow HC-CoInOx sample can remain intact after roasting at 450 °C, while the nanocubic shape of the C-CoInOx sample without the introduction of SiO2 is partially damaged and suffers from serious aggregation under the same firing conditions. Simultaneously, the porous hollow HC-CoInOx nanocubes also exhibited excellent cycling and thermal stability for the catalytic combustion of toluene to CO2 and H2O.",Vitamin B12 inhibits α-synuclein fibrillogenesis and protects against amyloid-induced cytotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070198,Food & function,2019 05 22,"Vitamin B12 (VB12) is a necessary micronutrient for growth and the development of the nervous system. Severe deficiencies of VB12 have been linked to damage of learning and memory ability and cognitive decline, along with several neurological diseases. Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein (αSN) into insoluble fibrils is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), which affects tens of millions of elderly patients all over the world. Developing novel inhibitors to obstruct the aggregation of αSN has become a topic of intense research. In this study, the inhibitory effect of VB12 against the fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity of αSN was systematically analyzed using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, atomic force microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cytotoxicity assays. Both ThT and AFM results showed that VB12 could inhibit αSN fibrillogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. CD data suggested that VB12 delays the conformational conversion of αSN to β-sheet rich structures, especially to the parallel β-sheet conformation. As a result, VB12 greatly alleviated the cytotoxicity of αSN aggregates. Moreover, VB12 was also found to disassemble preexisting mature αSN fibrils and attenuate the consequent cytotoxicity. These findings not only provide a comprehensive understanding of the inhibitory effect of VB12 on αSN fibrillogenesis, but also identify a valuable nutrient source that possesses great potential to be developed as a new functional food ingredient to help alleviate PD.",Aluminum containing molecular bowls and pyridinophanes: use of pyridine modules to access different molecular topologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070197,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"Molecular topologies varying from simple complexes to pyridinophanes (neutral and cationic) and to bicyclic pyridinophane containing organoaluminum (Al-Me) species were synthesized by varying the relative stoichiometry of bis(trimethylsilyl)-N,N'-2,6-diaminopyridine (bap) and the reactive partner (AlMe3). The ultimate goal of these reactions was to systematically design cyclic structures containing group 13 elements. To highlight the reaction potential of these shapes, the bowl-shaped pyridinophane was reacted with the Lewis acid, B(C6F5)3, to generate a stable cationic derivative. An unprecedented bicyclic pyridinophane, [2,6-(Me3SiN)2C5H3N]3Al2, was obtained from the reaction of bap with AlH3·NMe2Et. The formation of [2,6-(Me3SiN)2C5H3N]3Al2 is in contrast to the known reaction between BH3·SMe2 and bap that afforded the syn-tetraazadibora[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane. Quantum chemical calculations have been performed to rationalize the preference for the formation of B-pyridinophane and Al-bicyclic pyridinophane and can be attributed to the nature of B-N and Al-N bonds.",In vivo migration of Fe3O4@polydopamine nanoparticle-labeled mesenchymal stem cells to burn injury sites and their therapeutic effects in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070196,Biomaterials science,2019 05 09,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration and repair. However, efficient targeted delivery to specific tissues remains an open challenge. Here, we non-invasively monitored the migration of MSCs labeled with Fe3O4@polydopamine nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PDA NPs) toward laser burn injury sites in a living rat model and evaluated the effects of the labeled MSCs at the injury site. The Fe3O4@PDA NPs could be effectively incorporated into the MSCs without any negative effects on stem cell properties. Furthermore, they enhanced the migration ability of the MSCs by up-regulating the expression level of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). They also increased the secretion of some cytokines and the expression of healing-related genes in comparison with unlabeled MSCs. Labeled MSCs were intravenously administered into injured rats, and live imaging was performed to monitor MSC migration. Fluorescent signals of the labeled MSCs appeared at burn injury lesions 1 day after injection and then gradually increased up to 7 days. After 7 days, the group injected with the labeled MSCs showed less inflammation compared with those injected with the unlabeled MSCs. Additionally, the labeled MSC group showed increased cytokines and reduced pro-inflammatory factors compared with the unlabeled MSC group. The Fe3O4@PDA NPs enhanced stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCR4-mediated MSC migration in vivo. Thus, we demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of using the Fe3O4@PDA NPs for optimizing MSC-based therapeutic strategies for burn wound healing.",In situ study of RSK2 kinase activity in a single living cell by combining single molecule spectroscopy with activity-based probes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070195,The Analyst,2019 06 10,"Protein phosphorylation is a very important regulatory mechanism in a majority of biological processes, and the determination of protein kinase activity plays a key role in the pathological study and drug development of kinase-related diseases. However, it is very challenging to in situ study endogenous protein kinase activity in a single living cell due to the shortage of in vivo efficient methods. Here, we propose a new strategy for direct determination of protein kinase activity in a single living cell by combining single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with activity-based probes (ABPs). Ribosomal S6 kinase-2 (RSK2) was used as a model, and the ABPs were synthesized on the basis of RSK2 inhibitor FMK to specially label active RSK2 in living cells. Conventional FCS and MEMFCS (maximum entropy method) single molecule techniques were used to in situ determine RSK2 activity in living cells based on the difference in molecular weight between free probes and probe-RSK2 complexes. Furthermore, wild-type and mutated RSK2 were fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using lentivirus infection, and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) was used to verify the selective binding of ABPs to RSK2-EGFP fusion protein in living cells. Finally, FCS with ABPs was applied for in situ monitoring of the activation of endogenous RSK2 in the stimulation of serum, epidermal growth factor, kinase inhibitors and ultraviolet irradiation; we observed that endogenous RSK2 showed different behaviors in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in some stimulation. Our results document that FCS with ABPs is a very promising method for studying endogenous protein kinases in living cells.",Current Status of Functional Studies on Circular RNAs in Bladder Cancer and their Potential Role as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070194,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 10,"d_abstr_R Worldwide, bladder cancer represents the ninth most common malignancy and is the 13th cause of cancer-associated death.

Recent studies have shown that circRNAs participate in many processes, including proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis in multiple types of malignancy, including bladder cancer. Some circRNAs are dysregulated in bladder cancer and play essential roles in cancer progression. Importantly, some circRNAs may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for bladder cancer. This review aims to summarize the findings from recent studies that have focused on the roles of human circRNAs in bladder cancer and discusses the clinical roles for circRNAs, including their potential roles as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers."

Demonstrations conducted on the curvilinear pull indicated that changes in the pull direction result in an interaction with the water to accelerate water backwards to generate a force thrusting the body forward.",First decade of clinical trials and published studies with mesenchymal stromal cells from umbilical cord tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070115,Regenerative medicine,2019 06 13,"Aim: This is the first analysis of both clinical trials and published studies that employ umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells, for the decade 2007-2017. Materials & methods: Searching international databases, we found 178 registered trials and 98 publications. Results: Among the registered clinical trials, 20% have resulted in publications so far. Among the publications, 18% report safety and 74% report some form of improvement. Between 36 and 45% of the publications do not report aspects of the cell manufacturing, including isolation method, culture medium or number of culture passages. Conclusion: Analyses that link trials with publications can elucidate factors that promote study completion and publication. More full disclosure of cell manufacturing is needed to evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell isolated from umbilical cord tissue (UC-MSC) products.",Semi-Quantitative Health Risk Assessment of Exposure to Chemicals in an Aluminum Rolling Mill.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070114,International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2019 05 09,"The main goal of this study was to evaluate the health risks resulting from occupational exposure to chemicals in an aluminium rolling mill to propose effective control measures. The exposure of workers to chemicals was assessed based on the Singapore Health Department's methodology. The health risks of exposure to the identified chemicals as well as the relative risk of developing cancer due to exposure to benzene were assessed. According to the results, the risk level of exposure to sulfuric acid in the washing line, and manganese in the manufacturing unit were high. In assessing the risk of developing cancer arising from benzene exposure, the lifetime cancer risk was found in the range 10-4 - 10-6 which could be assessed in the possible range. The results indicated that in the aluminium rolling industry occupational exposure to 75% of the chemicals had a low level, 15% had a moderate and 10% had a high risk level."

This systematic review analyzed articles regarding the theories and basis of handedness formation, highlighting the historical knowledge path that this literature underwent. Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Sciences, Science Direct and PubMed databases were searched. This review included review studies with handedness as the main topic. Only papers written in English with analyses exclusively in neurotypical humans (any age range) were included. Different approaches (genetic, neural, social, and behavioural) were reviewed in light of growing evidence, summarizing the current state of the art. Genetic and environmental/social impacts are common points in most of the reviews, each given more or less importance, depending on the author and theory proposed. Multifactorial, developmental approaches to handedness formation seem to be the most up to date view of the phenomenon.

Further work could explore public engagement in diverse settings to assess which approaches are effective in maximising research value and wider community benefit.","Expression, characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis of UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT88A1 from Arabidopsis thaliana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070087,Bioengineered,2019 06 10,"Quercetin-4'-O-glucoside is one of the major quercetin derivatives in the mature red onion bulb. It has an adjuvant effect on allergies, asthma, arthritis, and cancer. The present study aimed to use uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 88A1 (UGT88A1) from Arabidopsis thaliana to achieve the enzymatic synthesis of quercetin-4'-O-glucoside from quercetin. The results showed that UGT88A1 was most active at pH 9.0. The optimum temperature of UGT88A1 for synthesizing quercetin-4'-O-glucoside was 45°C, which was a little lower than that for synthesizing quercetin-3-O-glucoside (50°C). One mutant, V18R, of UGT88A1 was obtained by site-directed mutation and showed a greater affinity (Km 0.20 mM) and twice the enzyme activity (552.3 mU/mg) towards quercetin compared with the wild-type enzyme (0.36 mM and 227.6 mU/mg, respectively). The possible reason could be attributed to the distance change between the 18th amino-acid residue of UGT88A1 and the substrate quercetin, as deduced by molecular simulation.",Compound heterozygous CACNA1H mutations associated with severe congenital amyotrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070086,"Channels (Austin, Tex.)",2019 06 10,"Neuromuscular disorders encompass a wide range of conditions often associated with a genetic component. In the present study, we report a patient with severe infantile-onset amyotrophy in whom two compound heterozygous variants in the gene CACNA1H encoding for Cav3.2 T-type calcium channels were identified. Functional analysis of Cav3.2 variants revealed several alterations of the gating properties of the channel that were in general consistent with a loss-of-channel function. Taken together, these findings suggest that severe congenital amyoplasia may be related to CACNA1H and would represent a new phenotype associated with mutations in this gene.",Correlation Between White Matter Injury Identified by Neonatal Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Following Term Neonatal Asphyxia and Therapeutic Hypothermia: An Exploratory Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070085,Journal of child neurology,2019 05 09,"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is associated with damage to deep gray matter; however, white matter involvement has become recognized.

We targeted the SHR C3 gene (C3 knockout [C3 KO] SHRs ) by the zinc finger gene editing method. In the current study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the increased expression of C3 and the role of endogenous C3 in the synthetic phenotype of SHR VSMC s in comparison to cells from Wistar-Kyoto ( WKY) rats and C3 KO SHR s. Methods and Results Nonmuscle myosin heavy chain staining of aortas from SHR s at 1 day after birth was stronger in comparison to WKY rats and C3 KO SHR s. DNA synthesis in VSMC s from SHR s was significantly higher in comparison to WKY rats and C3 KO SHR s. Immunohistochemical staining of renin and liver X receptor α in VSMC s from SHR s was stronger in comparison to WKY rats and C3 KO SHR s. The expression of renin, Krüppel-like factor 5, and liver X receptor α proteins in VSMC s from SHR s was significantly higher in comparison to WKY rats and C3 KO SHR s. The expression of synthetic phenotype markers osteopontin, matrix gla, and l-caldesmon, growth factors transforming growth factor-β1 and platelet-derived growth factor-A, transcription factors Krüppel-like factor 5 and liver X receptor α, and angiotensinogen mRNA s in VSMC s from SHR s was significantly higher in comparison to WKY rats and C3 KO SHR s. The expression of miR-145 mRNA in VSMC s from SHR s was suppressed in comparison to cells from WKY rats. miR-145 inhibitor significantly increased the expression of C3 in VSMC s from WKY rats, but not in cells from SHR s. Conclusions These findings indicate that the increased C3 with the suppression of miR-145 induces the synthetic phenotype through Krüppel-like factor 5 and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system through liver X receptor α in VSMC s from SHR s.",The medial prefrontal cortex is required for responding to alcohol-predictive cues but only in the absence of alcohol delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070082,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",2019 05 09,"The prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in promoting drug-seeking in relapse tests.

The procedure relies on a combined Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) and QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) approach to sample extraction followed by qualitative analysis by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Since imidacloprid is not amenable to the conditions of gas chromatography, a trimethylsilyl derivative was created and characterized. Proposed mechanisms for the creation of this derivative and its mass spectrum are described. The imidacloprid-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative was detected in all samples submitted."

However, the results from these studies are inconsistent in terms of efficacy and safety to reach a clinical decision. The objective of this study was to systematically review the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux and LMWH for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis. Methods and Results Systematic search in various databases was done to identify randomized controlled trials comparing fondaparinux and LMWH published during the years 2000 to 2017. Outcomes of interest in this study included venous thromboembolism up to day 15, all-cause mortality up to day 90, major bleeding, and minor bleeding during the treatment period. Analyses were performed with the relative odds based on a random-effects model using Mantel-Haenszel statistics. Results were presented as odds ratios with their 95% CIs. The assessment of study quality was performed as per Cochrane collaboration. After screening 10 644 articles, 12 randomized controlled trials including 14 906 patients were included in the final analyses. Pooled analyses showed the odds of venous thromboembolism in the fondaparinux group were 0.49 times the odds in LMWH group ( OR =0.49 [0.38-0.64]). However, the odds of major bleeding in the fondaparinux group were 1.48 times the odds in the LMWH group ( OR =1.48 [1.15-1.90]). Conclusions Fondaparinux was associated with a superior efficacy in terms of reduction of venous thromboembolism in this meta-analysis.

Relapsed/refractory disease related to progressive dysregulation of immune system and acquired genetic abnormalities continues to be a major obstacle in achieving cure. Immune-based therapy harnessing the host defense mechanism of natural killer (NK) cells is a promising avenue in the treatment of myeloma. Areas covered: Here, we discuss the biology and cytotoxic activity of NK cells and the potential role of these innate immune cells in defense against cancer and specifically multiple myeloma. We also discuss the role of NK cells in the anti-myeloma effects of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, various novel drugs, and treatment modalities such as chimeric antigen receptor therapy. Immune evasion, either directly or indirectly involving NK cell dysfunction, may be a key and under-recognized mechanism in myeloma progression. We reviewed extensive literature identified using the keywords immunotherapy, natural killer cells, and multiple myeloma. Expert opinion: Novel treatment approaches in myeloma utilizing the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic properties of NK cells to eradicate resistant and quiescent clones could pave the way for potentially curative interventions.",Mental health literacy of maternal and paternal postnatal (postpartum) depression in British adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070064,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",2019 05 09,"Postnatal depression affects between 6 and 13% of new parents, but only a small proportion of individuals who meet diagnostic criteria receive optimal treatment.

In this review, tumour targeting of co-delivery intelligent PMs and its intracellular trafficking mechanisms were overviewed. And this review provides a comprehensive summarization of several intelligent co-delivery PMs. Such a system could control the multidrug to be released simultaneously or sequentially by special properties of tumour microenvironment (TME) (including acidic PH, redox, overexpressed enzyme, excessive temperature) and external environment trigger. Additionally, limitations, clinical translation and future perspectives of intelligent co-delivery PMs were also being discussed in this article.","The relationships between self-efficacy, self-control, chronotype, procrastination and sleep problems in young adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070062,Chronobiology international,2019 05 09,"The main aim of our study was to examine whether there was a relationship between psychological characteristics such as self-efficacy, self-control and chronotype as well as procrastination on the one hand and sleep problems on the other. There were 315 young adults aged between 18 and 27 years (M = 20.57). We used the General Procrastination Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Brief Self-Control Scale, the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Our results indicated that low self-efficacy, low self-control and eveningness were positive predictors of procrastination. The reciprocal relationship exists between procrastination and sleep problems. Procrastination positively contributed to sleep problems, whereas sleep problems were a negative predictor of procrastination.",Gender differences in chronotype diminish with age: a meta-analysis based on morningness/chronotype questionnaires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070061,Chronobiology international,2019 06 03,"Chronotype is an individual difference trait that is closely linked to biological variables. Usually, men and women differ in their chronotype with men being more evening oriented than women. The aim of the study was to assess gender differences in chronotype based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, many recent studies do not report gender differences any more although researchers collected data on men and women. This motivated us to contact many researchers directly to obtain and use these additional data. We included 164 studies giving 201 effect size measures in a data set, which only included the most commonly used questionnaires (MEQ, rMEQ and CSM) totaling 186,289 participants in total, of which 75,622 were men and 110,667 were women. We calculated an effect size of the standardized mean difference of -0.072 (95% CI from -0.062 to -0.082) in the fixed effects and of -0.066 (95% CI from -0.043 to- 0.089) in the random effects model. Men were on average more evening oriented than women. Type of questionnaire did not influence the standardized mean difference in chronotype between genders. Mean age, standard deviation of age and publication year (p ≤ 0.05) were found to have significant effects on the standardized mean difference in chronotype between genders. The standardized mean difference in chronotype between genders is predicted to change from negative to positive with increasing mean age (young women were more morning orientated than young men, but older women were less morning orientated than older men). This suggests that the differences between men and women diminish with time. The standardized mean difference in chronotype between genders is decreasing with increasing publication year, as well as with high variation in age of the samples.

Sequences of adult-child interactions, drawn from the data of a larger study focused on enhancing vocabulary and grammar skills, were examined. This current study comprises a secondary analysis of a corpus of 29 conversations totalling 808.36 min, analysing clause structures by type, linguistic complexity, and intensity of adult prompts (number of turns). Results show that, over time, the participants' clause structure complexity increased through addition of phrase-internal elements such as inflections, articles, and prepositions. Use of specific grammatical elements followed the developmental stages observed in children with typical development. For all participants, the personal pronoun I (first-person singular) emerged before she, he (third-person singular), and we or they (plural). Participants with the highest number of adult-child co-constructed clauses also had the highest number of well-formed clauses. The intensity of adult prompts increased as clause structures became more complex and as participants needed more support. Implications for practice and theory are discussed.",The transcriptional factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 and their novel inhibitors in cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070059,Expert opinion on drug discovery,2019 06 13,"Introduction: Hypoxia is one of the intrinsic features of solid tumors, and it is always associated with aggressive phenotypes, including resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, metastasis, and poor patient prognosis. Hypoxia manifests these unfavorable effects through activation of a family of transcription factors, Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a pivotal role in the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions by upregulating the transcription of several pro-oncogenic genes. Several advanced human cancers share HIFs activation as a final common pathway. Areas covered: This review highlights the role and regulation of the HIF-1/2 in cancers and alludes on the biological complexity and redundancy of HIF-1/2 regulation. Moreover, this review summarizes recent insights into the therapeutic approaches targeting the HIF-1/2 pathway. Expert opinion: More studies are needed to unravel the extensive complexity of HIFs regulation and to develop more precise anticancer treatments. Inclusion of HIF-1/2 inhibitors to the current chemotherapy regimens has been proven advantageous in numerous reported preclinical studies. The combination therapy ideally should be personalized based on the type of mutations involved in the specific cancers, and it might be better to include two drugs that inhibit HIF-1/2 activity by synergistic molecular mechanisms.",Induction of Dbp by a histone deacetylase inhibitor is involved in amelioration of insulin sensitivity via adipocyte differentiation in ob/ob mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070057,Chronobiology international,2019 06 03,"We previously reported that a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) increases D-site binding protein (Dbp) mRNA expression in adipose tissue and subsequently improved insulin sensitivity of obese (ob/ob) mice. However, the potential mechanism of this phenomenon was unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in enhanced Dbp mRNA expression and improvement of insulin sensitivity in mice. Ob/ob mice were treated with HDACi every second day for 3 weeks. At the end of treatment, an insulin tolerance test was performed and epididymal adipose tissue obtained for fractionation into adipocytes and preadipocytes. HDACi improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice and significantly increased Dbp mRNA in epididymal adipose tissue. Further, epididymal adipocytes of ob/ob mice showed a tendency towards a larger size distribution, while HDACi increased the proportion of smaller sized cells in fractionated preadipocytes. Dbp knocked-down 3T3-L1 cells down-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ1) protein expression during adipogenesis, which suppressed adipocyte differentiation. These data indicate that DBP promotes adipocyte differentiation via direct up-regulation of PPAR-γ1 production in preadipocytes. In fractionated preadipocytes of ob/ob mice, DBP binding to the promoter region of the Ppar-γ gene and splicing variant of Ppar-γ (Ppar-γ1sv) mRNA expression were suppressed. HDACi significantly increased DBP binding to the Ppar-γ gene and Ppar-γ1sv transcription. Altogether, this indicates a modification in genetic regulation downstream from the circadian clock that can ameliorate an environmental function of adipose tissue, leading to improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice."

A wide range of Parent Education and Training programmes are delivered around the globe, but there is limited knowledge about the characteristics of these programmes, or about the research methods and outcomes used to evaluate them, particularly in countries outside the United States. We, therefore, performed a scoping review of all peer-reviewed Parent Education and Training publications outside the United States. A search was conducted between March and May 2017. Four reviewers extracted data and performed a mixed-methods quality appraisal of publications. Thirty-seven publications representing 32 unique programmes were identified. Publications described a highly diverse range of Parent Education and Training programmes across 20 countries and all continents except South America. The majority were group-based, but varied significantly in goals, modalities and duration. The majority of studies (86.4%) reported positive outcomes in relation to the core study objectives and only two studies reported some negative findings. Quality appraisal rated only 27% of studies to have met all the methodological quality criteria. Implementation factors such as manualisation, fidelity and cost were commented on infrequently.

Consensus guidelines indicate surgery for IPMN at high risk of malignant progression, as assessed by specific radiological and clinical criteria, whereas an active radiological surveillance is recommended for IPMN at low risk of malignancy. The management of IPMN is further complicated by the risk of developing a distinct new cyst or a ductal adenocarcinoma in the remnant pancreas, either synchronously or metachronously. Several studies therefore investigated local progression in the remnant pancreas following partial pancreatic resection for IPMN and whether an unstable epithelium at risk for malignant degeneration may exist. Understanding the biological mechanisms behind progression of IPMN will help in identifying patients that would benefit from the resection of the entire pancreas.",Current treatment status in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070040,Chinese clinical oncology,2019 05 09,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (P-NENs) are a group of pathologically and clinically heterogeneous tumors. In the past several decades, the incidence has been increasing. In 2010, the WHO presented a new classification dividing P-NENs into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Surgery is the primary and most important treatment for P-NENs, and is also the only possible curative procedure. By the 2018 NCCN guideline, observation can be considered for <1 cm, low-grade asymptomatic nonfunctional P-NETs. And for patients who are not suitable for surgery, somatostatin analogues, targeted therapy, radionuclides, ablation therapies, (chemo)embolisation and chemotherapy should be considered to improve and maintain a good quality of life.

In humans, many known risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, diabetes and chronic pancreatitis, are often characterized by the induction of chronic inflammation. In mice, while oncogenic Kras itself causes spontaneous infiltration of immune cells, the additional chronic inflammatory damage further accelerates the progression of pancreatic cancer. Infiltrated immune cells in pancreatic cancer are essential for the initiation and development of pancreatic cancer, and produce immune-suppressive signals to dampen antitumor T-cell responses in tumor. Investigation into the mechanisms by which leukocytes contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer will help to find new approaches to improve therapy for this disease.",Targeting the tumor microenvironment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070038,Chinese clinical oncology,2019 05 09,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most dangerous cancers, and the overall 5-year survival rate is only 8%. The microenvironment of PDAC, which promotes tumorigenesis, disease development and metastasis, consists of fibroblasts, immune cells, pancreatic stellate cells (PaSCs), adipocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM). Because the microenvironment is a part of the tumor, it is also an important target for PDAC treatment. Several therapeutic regimens targeting PDAC microenvironment factors or cells have been investigated, but the treatment effects were poor.

The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of genomic profiling using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy samples to facilitate personalised therapy for PC. Ninty-five patients underwent additional research biopsies at the time of diagnostic EUS. Diagnostic formalin-fixed (FFPE) and fresh frozen EUS samples underwent DNA extraction, quantification and targeted gene sequencing. Whole genome (WGS) and RNA sequencing was performed as proof of concept. Only 2 patients (2%) with a diagnosis of PC had insufficient material for targeted sequencing in both FFPE and frozen specimens. Targeted panel sequencing (n=54) revealed mutations in PC genes (KRAS, GNAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4) in patients with histological evidence of PC, including potentially actionable mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRAF). WGS (n=5) of EUS samples revealed mutational signatures that are potential biomarkers of therapeutic responsiveness. RNA sequencing (n=35) segregated patients into clinically relevant molecular subtypes based on transcriptome. Integrated multi-omic analysis of PC using standard EUS guided biopsies offers clinical utility to guide personalized therapy and study the molecular pathology in all patients with PC.","Pure Red Iridium(III) Complexes Possessing Good Electron Mobility with 1,5-Naphthyridin-4-ol Derivatives for High-Performance OLEDs with an EQE over 31.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070035,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 13,"Three iridium(III) complexes (Ir(4tfmpq)2mND, Ir(4tfmpq)2mmND, and Ir(4tfmpq)2mpND) with the 4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)quinazoline (4tfmpq) main ligand and 1,5-naphthyridin-4-ol derivatives (mND: 8-methyl-1,5-naphthyridin-4-ol, mmND: 2,8-dimethyl-1,5-naphthyridin-4-ol, mpND: 8-methyl-2-phenyl-1,5-naphthyridin-4-ol) as ancillary ligands were studied.

A new cyclopentadienyl iron(II) tricarbonyl complex has been isolated, fully characterized, and applied in hydrogenation. This phosphine-free iron complex is the first Earth-abundant metal complex that is able to catalyze chemoselective reductive alkylation of various functionalized amines with functionalized aldehydes. Such selectivity and functionality tolerance (alkenes, esters, ketones, acetals, unprotected hydroxyl groups, and phosphines) have been demonstrated also for the first time at room temperature with an Earth-abundant metal complex. This alkylation reaction was also performed without any preliminary condensation and generated only water as a byproduct. The resulting amines provided rapid access to potential building blocks, metal ligands, or drugs. Density functional theory calculations highlighted first that the formation of the 16 electron species, via the activation of the tricarbonyl complex Fe3, was facilitated and, second, that the hydrogen cleavage did not follow the same pathway as bond breaking, usually described with the known cyclopentadienone iron tricarbonyl complexes (Fe1 and Fe4). These calculations highlighted that the new complex Fe3 does not behave as a bifunctional catalyst, in contrast to its former congeners."

While virulent pathogens and pathobionts play important roles in disease pathogenesis, the scientific community has long assumed disruption of the ocular surface occurs prior to microbial colonization and subsequent infection. While nonpathogenic bacteria are often detected in corneal and conjunctival cultures from healthy eyes, cultures also frequently fail to yield growth of common ocular pathogens or nonpathogenic bacteria. This prompts the following question: Is the ocular surface populated by a stable microbial population that cannot be detected using standard culture techniques? The study of the microbiome has recently become a widespread focus in physician and veterinary medicine. Research suggests a pivotal symbiotic relationship with these microbes to maintain healthy host tissues, and when altered is associated with various disease states (""dysbiosis""). The microbiota that lives within and on mammalian bodies have long been known to influence health and susceptibility to infection. However, limitations of traditional culture methods have resulted in an incomplete understanding of what many now call the ""forgotten organ,"" that is, the microbiome. With the introduction of high-throughput sequencing, physician ophthalmology has recognized an ocular surface with much more diverse microbial communities than suspected based on traditional culture. This article reviews the salient features of the ocular surface microbiome and highlights important future applications following the advent of molecular techniques for microbial identification, including characterizing ocular surface microbiomes in our veterinary species and their potential role in management of infectious and inflammatory ocular diseases.","HLA-DQB1*05:217, an HLA-DQB1*05:01:01:01 variant, identified in a Taiwanese individual.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070000,HLA,2019 05 30,"One nucleotide substitution in codon 142 of HLA-DQB1*05:01:01:01 results in a novel allele, HLA-DQB1*05:217.",Current status of hepatopulmonary syndrome in liver transplantation in Japan: a Japanese multicenter analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069999,Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,2019 06 11,Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) negatively affects the outcomes of deceased donor liver transplantation (LT).,Phylogeny-guided characterization of glycosyltransferases for epothilone glycosylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069998,Microbial biotechnology,2019 06 14,"Glycosylation of natural products can influence their pharmacological properties, and efficient glycosyltransferases (GTs) are critical for this purpose. The polyketide epothilones are potent anti-tumour compounds, and YjiC is the only reported GT for the glycosylation of epothilone. In this study, we phylogenetically analysed 8261 GTs deposited in CAZy database and revealed that YjiC locates in a subbranch of the Macrolide I group, forming the YjiC-subbranch with 160 GT sequences. We demonstrated that the YjiC-subbranch GTs are normally efficient in epothilone glycosylation, but some showed low glycosylation activities. Sequence alignment of YjiC-subbranch showed that the 66th and 77th amino acid residues, which were close to the catalytic cavity in molecular docking model, were conserved in five high-active GTs (Q66 and P77) but changed in two low-efficient GTs. Site-directed residues swapping at the two positions in the two low-active GTs (BssGT and BamGT) and the high-active GT BsGT-1 demonstrated that the two amino acid residues played an important role in the catalytic efficiency of epothilone glycosylation.

Because cythemias are nonspecific and may reflect either a reactive or neoplastic process, diagnostic workup of these patients is complicated and requires integration of numerous diagnostic modalities. Careful morphologic evaluation of the PB smear may provide insights into the underlying cause of the abnormal counts (such as the presence of teardrop erythrocytes in myelofibrosis or granulocytic dysplasia with left shift in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia). However, these morphologic findings need to be interpreted in concert with clinical findings and other laboratory results. In recent years, there has been a wealth of new genetic data in the field of MPN and many recurrent mutations have been identified, especially in cases lacking Philadelphia chromosome. Many of these genes impact the diagnosis and/or prognosis. Although certain mutations are preferentially enriched in specific MPN types, none of these mutations are disease defining; therefore, a thorough workup should always include a bone marrow biopsy for morphologic evaluation and diagnosis.

A promising solution is an omniphobic bilayer coating, tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP), which utilizes an immobilized tether to anchor a mobile, liquid surface lubricant that prevents adhesion of blood components to the substrate. In this study, we investigated the effects of TLP on real-time clot formation using thromboelastography (TEG). TLP was applied to TEG cups, utilizing perfluorodecalin (PFD) or FluorLube63 as the liquid layer, and compared to uncoated cups. Human blood (n = 10) was added to cups; and TEG parameters (R, K, α-angle, MA, LY30, LY60) and adherent thrombus weight were assessed. TLP decreased clot amplification (α-angle), clot strength (MA), and adherent clot weight (p < .0001). These effects were greater with FluorLube63 versus PFD (α-angle p < .0001; MA p = .0019; clot weight p < .0001). Reaction time (R) was longer in TLP-coated cups versus control cups with liquid lubricant added (p = .0377). Percent fibrinolysis (LY30 and LY60) was greater in the TLP versus controls at LY30 (p < .0001), and in FluoroLube63 versus controls at LY60 (p = .0021). TLP significantly altered clot formation, exerting antithrombogenic effects. This reduction in surface thrombogenicity supports TLP as a candidate for improved biocompatibility of ECLS materials, pending further validation with exposure to shear stress.",Smyd2 conformational changes in response to p53 binding: role of the C-terminal domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069954,Molecular oncology,2019 06 10,"Smyd2 lysine methyltransferase regulates monomethylation of histone and nonhistone lysine residues using S-adenosylmethionine cofactor as the methyl donor. The nonhistone interactors include several tumorigenic targets, including p53. Understanding this interaction would allow the structural principles that underpin Smyd2-mediated p53 methylation to be elucidated. Here, we performed μ-second molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on binary Smyd2-cofactor and ternary Smyd2-cofactor-p53 peptide complexes. We considered both unmethylated and monomethylated p53 peptides (at Lys370 and Lys372). The results indicate that (a) the degree of conformational freedom of the C-terminal domain of Smyd2 is restricted by the presence of the p53 peptide substrate, (b) the Smyd2 C-terminal domain shows distinct dynamic properties when interacting with unmethylated and methylated p53 peptides, and (c) Lys372 methylation confines the p53 peptide conformation, with detectable influence on Lys370 accessibility to the cofactor. These MD results are therefore of relevance for studying the biology of p53 in cancer progression.",Evaluation of R- (-) and S- (+) Clenbuterol enantiomers during a doping cycle or continuous ingestion of contaminated meat using chiral liquid chromatography by LC-TQ-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069953,Drug testing and analysis,2019 06 03,"Clenbuterol is known to improve competition resistance and muscular growth in athletes. Although it is an illegal drug, its use by farmers is widely spread to induce growth of their cattle. Thus, when clenbuterol is found in the urine of an athlete, there is doubt whether it was consumed with doping purposes or if it is due to the consumption of meat from a clenbuterol-fed animal. Previous studies suggest that enantiomeric relationship of clenbuterol may be different according to the intake source. However, the enantiomeric relationship throughout a doping cycle or a continuous intake of contaminated meat has not yet been explored. In this first approximation, our aim was the development and validation of a sensitive and rapid method for the determination of S- (+) and R- (─) clenbuterol enantiomers to be used in a controlled study in rats fed for one week with contaminated meat or simulating a doping cycle. Enantiomers were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole analyzer (LC-TQ-MS) and were separated on an AGP Chiralpak column. The method was fully validated following the VICH (Veterinary International Conference on Harmonization guidelines) and was linear in the range of 12.5-800 pg/mL with a correlation coefficient of ≥0.98 for each enantiomer, and with a limit of quantitation and detection (LOQ and LOD) of 12.5 pg/mL and 6.5 pg/mL, respectively, for both enantiomers. The application of this method pointed out the shift of the enantiomeric relationship in urine from rats during the first five days of the doping cycle compared to those fed with contaminated meat. This finding can be of substantial importance in further doping studies.",Recent Progress in Organic Electron Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069952,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 09,"Organic n-type materials (e.g., fullerene derivatives, naphthalene diimides (NDIs), perylene diimides (PDIs), azaacene-based molecules, and n-type conjugated polymers) are demonstrated as promising electron transport layers (ETLs) in inverted perovskite solar cells (p-i-n PSCs), because these materials have several advantages such as easy synthesis and purification, tunable frontier molecular orbitals, decent electron mobility, low cost, good solubility in different organic solvents, and reasonable chemical/thermal stability.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are a promising new version of conventional antibacterial nanosystem to fight against the bacterial resistance in concern of the drug discovery void. However, there are several challenges in controlling the size and colloidal stability of Ag NPs, which readily aggregate or coalesce in both solid and aqueous state. In this study, a template-guided synthesis of ultrafine Ag NPs of around 2 nm using water-soluble and biocompatible γ-cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks (CD-MOFs) is reported. The CD-MOF based synthetic strategy integrates AgNO3 reduction and Ag NPs immobilization in one pot achieving dual functions of reduced particle size and enhanced stability. Meanwhile, the synthesized Ag NPs are easily dispersible in aqueous media and exhibit effective bacterial inhibition. The surface modification of cross-linked CD-MOF particles with GRGDS peptide boosts the hemostatic effect that further enhances wound healing in synergy with the antibacterial effect. Hence, the strategy of ultrafine Ag NPs synthesis and immobilization in CD-MOFs together with GRGDS modification holds promising potential for the rational design of effective wound healing devices.",A reliable detachable balloon that prevents abdominal cavity contamination during transrectal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069947,Journal of digestive diseases,2019 06 06,To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a detachable endoluminal balloon in the prevention of abdominal cavity contamination during transrectal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).,"Psychological distress among prostate cancer survivors in South Korea: A nationwide population-based, longitudinal study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069946,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,2019 05 09,This time-dependent study aimed to analyze the prevalence of psychological distress in prostate cancer survivors by using claims data in South Korea.,DNA Nanotechnology as an Emerging Tool to Study Mechanotransduction in Living Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069945,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 09,"The ease of tailoring DNA nanostructures with sub-nanometer precision has enabled new and exciting in vivo applications in the areas of chemical sensing, imaging, and gene regulation.

A presumptive diagnosis is made based on location and appearance of the tumor via echocardiogram. Effective treatment options are limited to surgery (when feasible) or radiation therapy. Benefit of medical management is presently unknown. The goal of this retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of toceranib phosphate for dogs with HBT. Twenty-eight dogs with histologically, cytologically confirmed or presumed HBT were evaluated retrospectively. Twenty-seven dogs were treated with single agent toceranib. One dog received combination therapy with concurrent metronomic chemotherapy. This dog was not included in response or survival analysis. Factors assessed included clinical signs, hematologic/biochemical parameters, and response to treatment. For the 27 dogs receiving single agent toceranib, an overall response rate of 10% was found. Overall median survival time was 823 days (range, 68-1190 days). The overall response rate for the dogs presenting with metastasis was 28.5%, with a median survival time of 532 days (range, 77-679 days). This was not significantly different than the median survival time of 796 days for dogs who did not present with metastasis. Of the dogs displaying clinical signs at the time of diagnosis, 90% had improvement and 81% had complete resolution of signs after starting toceranib. Toxicity was seen in 54% of dogs with gastrointestinal distress as the most common toxicity dose reduction were infrequent. Results demonstrate that toceranib phosphate is well-tolerated and effective treatment for inoperable canine heart based tumors including dogs with advanced or metastatic disease.

Sequential testing involves selecting a sequence of tests, but only administering subsequent tests dependent on results of previous tests. This research provides guidance to choosing between single tests or the believe the positive (BP) and believe the negative (BN) sequential testing strategies, using accuracy (as measured by the Youden Index) as the primary determinant. Approximately 75% of the parameter combinations examined resulted in either BP or BN being recommended based on a higher accuracy at the optimal point. In about half of the scenarios BP was preferred, and the other half, BN, with the choice often a function of the value of the ratio of standard deviations of those without and with disease (b). Large values of b for the first test of the sequence tended to be associated with preference for BN as opposed to BP, while small values of b appear to favor BP. When there was no preference between sequences and/or single tests based on the Youden Index, cost of the sequence was considered. In this case, disease prevalence plays a large role in the selection of strategies, with lower values favoring BN and sometimes higher values favoring BP. The cost threshold for the sequential strategy to be preferred over a single, more accurate test, was often quite high. It appears that while sequential strategies most often increase diagnostic accuracy over a single test, sequential strategies are not always preferred.",Health-related Google searches performed by parents of pediatric oncology patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069926,Pediatric blood & cancer,2019 05 09,Little is known about the specific information parents of children with cancer search for online.

Providing that the behavioural effects of alcohol are processed within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, anterior ventral tegmental area (aVTA), and laterodorsal tegmental area (LDTg), we assessed the involvement of NMU signalling in the aforementioned areas on alcohol-mediated behaviours in rodents. We further examined the expression of NMU and NMU receptor 2 (NMUR2) in NAc and the dorsal striatum of high compared with low alcohol-consuming rats, as this area is of importance in the maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Finally, we investigated the involvement of NAc shell, aVTA and LDTg in the consumption of chow and palatable peanut butter, to expand the link between NMU and reward-related behaviours. We demonstrated here, that NMU into the NAc shell, but not aVTA or LDTg, blocked the ability of acute alcohol to cause locomotor stimulation and to induce memory retrieval of alcohol reward, as well as reduced peanut butter in mice. In addition, NMU into NAc shell decreased alcohol intake in rats. On a molecular level, we found increased NMU and decreased NMUR2 expression in the dorsal striatum in high compared with low alcohol-consuming rats. Both aVTA and LDTg, rather than NAc shell, were identified as novel sites of action for NMU's anorexigenic properties in mice based on NMU's ability to selectively reduce chow intake when injected to these areas.

Research suggests that overlapping pathophysiology may contribute to obesity and nicotine use disorder (NUD), yet no studies have investigated the effect of obesity on neural response to reward stimuli in NUD. This study used arterial spin-labeled perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural responses during exposure to smoking versus nonsmoking cues in 79 treatment-seeking participants with NUD, 26 with normal weight, 28 with overweight, and 25 with obesity. Given that deficits in behavioral inhibitory control have been associated with both obesity and NUD, participants completed an affect-congruent Go/NoGo task to assess the effect of body mass index (BMI) on this construct in NUD. Analyses revealed that BMI was negatively associated with activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in response to smoking cues, with significantly reduced response in smokers with overweight and smokers with obesity compared with normal-weight smokers. In addition, greater commission errors on the Go/NoGo task were correlated with reduced neural response to smoking cues in the right dlPFC only among those with obesity. Together, these findings provide evidence that obesity in treatment-seeking NUDs is related to neurobiological alterations in inhibitory control over cue-potentiated behaviors, suggesting that smoking cessation may be more difficult in individuals with comorbid NUD and obesity than in those without, requiring treatment strategies tailored to meet their unique needs.",The use of robots and other automated devices in nurses' work: An integrative review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069892,International journal of nursing practice,2019 05 09,"Future nursing shortages and advanced technological developments mean that robots and automated devices could play a valuable role in nursing, but little has been published on their use, and outcomes, to date.",Effect of inoculum density on human-induced pluripotent stem cell expansion in 3D bioreactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069891,Cell proliferation,2019 05 09,"For optimized expansion of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with regards to clinical applications, we investigated the influence of the inoculum density on the expansion procedure in 3D hollow-fibre bioreactors.",Discharged and dismissed: A qualitative study with back pain patients discharged without treatment from orthopaedic consultations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069890,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 05 28,"Consultation-based reassurance for patients with low back pain (LBP) in primary care has been shown to be associated with patients' outcomes.

While such properties have been obtained by engineering a surface with anisotropic microstructures, a microscopic liquid residue-though it might be invisible macroscopically-is generally left behind the transported drop, resulting in undesired transport loss and severely limiting practical applications of the surface. Here, the origin of microscopic liquid residue is studied by investigating directional drop self-transport on anisotropic surfaces made of radially arranged omniphobic microstripes. It is revealed that the occurrence of a liquid residue is governed by a transport-velocity-dependent dynamic wetting mechanism involving the formation of entrained thin liquid films at high capillary numbers while the local dynamic receding contact angle vanishes. Rayleigh-like breakup of the liquid films leads to the microscopic liquid residue. It is further shown that a liquid-like coating featuring highly flexible molecular chains can effectively suppress the formation of entrained liquid films at high transport velocities, thereby facilitating lossless and fast drop self-transport on anisotropic omniphobic surfaces.",Perovskite Grains Embraced in a Soft Fullerene Network Make Highly Efficient Flexible Solar Cells with Superior Mechanical Stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069886,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 09,"Halide perovskite films processed from solution at low-temperature offer promising opportunities to make flexible solar cells.

The HCHOA nanosystem is stable under normal oxygen partial pressure with a size of 100-150 nm. When exposed to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the nanosystem can quickly dissociate into ultrasmall HC and HO therapeutic nanoparticles with a diameter smaller than 10 nm, significantly enabling their enhanced intratumoral penetration. After the dissociation, the quenched fluorescence of Ce6 in the produced HC nanoparticles can be recovered for bioimaging. At the same time, the production of singlet oxygen is increased because of the enhancement in the photoactivity of the photosensitizer. On account of these improvements, combined photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy is realized to display superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Based on this simple strategy, it is possible to achieve the dissociation of hypoxic-responsive nanosystem to enhance the tumor penetration and therapeutic effect.","The MTase15 regulates reproduction in the wing-dimorphic planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069883,Insect molecular biology,2019 06 06,"S-Adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAMMTases) modulate important cellular and metabolic activities in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been increasingly identified and characterized in almost every aspect of biology, especially in cancer biology. This study desires to investigate the mechanism of circ-PITX1 on regulating GM development. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out to measure the expression of circ-PITX1, which was upregulated in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 52 patients and four cell lines of GM. Fisher's exact indicated the upregulation of circ-PITX1 was associated with patients' tumor size and World Health Organization grade. Gain and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that circ-PITX1 could facilitate the growth, migration, and invasion and inhibit cell apoptosis in GM cell lines.

Refugees from Myanmar are currently one of the largest refugee groups being resettled in Western countries. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a modified cognitive processing therapy (CPT) group program for Karen refugees with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; N =7). It was found that the CPT program was well accepted, with high satisfaction and no drop-outs. At posttreatment all participants no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria and had a reliable improvement in PTSD symptoms when compared with pretreatment scores. At 3-month follow-up four participants (57% of sample) did not meet PTSD diagnostic criteria and three participants (43%) had a reliable improvement in PTSD symptoms when compared with pretreatment scores. However, at follow-up four participants (57% of the sample) had a reliable worsening in PTSD symptoms when compared with their posttreatment PTSD symptom levels.

Aromatase inhibitors (AI) used in breast cancer induce loss in bone mineral density (BMD) and are reported to increase fracture risk. AI exposure is not a direct input to FRAX but is captured under ""secondary osteoporosis"". To inform use of FRAX in women treated with AI, we used a population-based registry for the Province of Manitoba, Canada, to identify women aged ≥40 years initiating AI for breast cancer with at least 12 months' AI exposure (n = 1775), women with breast cancer not receiving AI (n = 1016), and women from the general population (n = 34,205). Among AI users, fracture probability estimated without BMD (AI use coded as secondary osteoporosis) significantly overestimated risk (10-year observed/predicted ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.68; 10-year hip fracture observed/predicted ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.18-0.49). However, when BMD was included in the fracture probability, there was no significant difference between observed and predicted fracture risk. In Cox proportional hazards models, FRAX stratified risk of MOF, hip, and any fracture equally well in all subgroups (p-interaction >0.1). When adjusted for FRAX score without BMD, with AI use coded as secondary osteoporosis, AI users were at significantly lower risk for MOF (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95), hip fracture (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.73) and any fracture (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89). AI use was no longer significantly associated with fractures when AI use was not entered as secondary osteoporosis in FRAX without BMD or when BMD was included in the FRAX calculation. In conclusion, FRAX scores stratify fracture risk equally well in women receiving AI therapy as in non-users, but including secondary osteoporosis as a risk factor for AI users overestimates fracture risk.

However, the direct progenitor of maize, teosinte, is indigenous only to a relatively small range of tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and grows poorly or not at all outside of this region. Tripsacum, a sister genus to maize and teosinte, is naturally endemic to the majority of areas in the western hemisphere where maize is cultivated. A full-length reference transcriptome for Tripsacum dactyloides generated using long-read Iso-Seq data was used to characterize independent adaptation to temperate climates in this clade. Genes related to phospholipid biosynthesis, a critical component of cold acclimation in other cold adapted plant lineages, were enriched among those genes experiencing more rapid rates of protein sequence evolution in T. dactyloides. In contrast with previous studies of parallel selection, we find that there is a significant overlap between the genes which were targets of artificial selection during the adaptation of maize to temperate climates and those which were targets of natural selection in temperate adapted T. dactyloides. Genes related to growth, development, response to stimulus, signaling, and organelles were enriched in the set of genes identified as both targets of natural and artificial selection.

Then smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation supportive capacity of PAN-PEO nanofibers was investigated by culturing of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) on this scaffold and then its differentiation potential in different groups was investigated using SMC-related gene and protein markers. SEM and MTT results demonstrated that PAN-PEO supported AT-MSCs attachment, growth and proliferation, especially at early times after cell seeding.

We found that GAS5 was significantly downregulated in PDGF-bb-treated VSMCs, and overexpression of GAS5 remarkably attenuated PDGF-bb-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In addition, miR-21 was observed to potentially bind to GAS5, and we also identified that PDCD4 might be a direct target of miR-21 in VSMCs. Cotransfection of miR-21 mimics remarkably reduced the PDCD4 protein expression in GAS5 overexpressing VSMCs. Further, rescue experiments showed that enforced expression of miR-21 attenuated the inhibitory effects of GAS5 on VSMC proliferation and migration. Collectively, our results demonstrated that GAS5 inhibits PDGF-bb-induced VSMC proliferation and migration, partly through acting as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-21, and provided new evidence that GAS5 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for hypertension.",C4d immunohistochemical stain of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as a sensitive method in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069830,Journal of cutaneous pathology,2019 05 24,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common type of subepidermal bullous disease.

These compounds may both inhibit and potentiate the activity of P2XRs, but sex steroids such as 17β-estradiol or progesterone are reported to be inactive. Here, we tested a hypothesis that testosterone, another sex hormone, modulates activity of P2XRs. We examined actions of native testosterone and a series of testosterone derivatives on the gating of recombinant P2X2R, P2X4R and P2X7R and native channels expressed in pituitary cells and hypothalamic neurons. The 17β-ester derivatives of testosterone rapidly and positively modulate the 1 μM ATP-evoked currents in P2X2R- and P2X4R-expressing cells, but not agonist-evoked currents in P2X7R-expressing cells. In general, most of the tested testosterone derivatives are more potent modulators than endogenous testosterone. The comparison of chemical structures and whole-cell recordings revealed that their interactions with P2XRs depend on the lipophilicity and length of the alkyl chain at position C-17. Pretreatment with testosterone butyrate or valerate, increases the sensitivity of P2X2R and P2X4R to ATP by several fold, reduces the rate of P2X4R desensitization, accelerates resensitization, and enhances ethidium uptake by P2X4R. Native channels are also potentiated by testosterone derivatives, while endogenously expressed GABA receptors type A are inhibited. The effect of ivermectin, a P2X4R-specific allosteric modulator, on deactivation is antagonized by testosterone derivatives in a concentration-dependent manner. Together, our results provide evidence for potentiation of particular subtypes of P2XRs by testosterone derivatives and suggest a potential role of ivermectin binding site for steroid-induced modulation.

In this study, three rice cultivars, differing in their yield response to elevated CO2 , were grown under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions, using the free-air CO2 enrichment technology. Flag leaves of rice were used to determine (1) if manipulative increases in sink strength decreased the soluble sucrose concentration for the 'weak' responders and (2), whether the genetic expression of sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT2 was associated with an accumulation of soluble sugars and the maintenance of photosynthetic capacity. For the cultivars that showed a weak response to additional CO2 , photosynthetic capacity declined under elevated CO2 and was associated with an accumulation of soluble sugars. For these cultivars, increasing sink relative to source strength did not increase photosynthesis and no change in OsSUT1 or OsSUT2 expression was observed. In contrast, the 'strong' response cultivar did not show an increase in soluble sugars or a decline in photosynthesis but demonstrated significant increases in OsSUT1 and OsSUT2 expression at elevated CO2 . Overall, these data suggest that the expression of the sucrose transport genes OsSUT1 and OsSUT2 may be associated with the maintenance of photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf during grain fill; and, potentially, greater yield response of rice as atmospheric CO2 increases.",Event-related potentials in response to feedback following risk-taking in the hot version of the Columbia Card Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069812,Psychophysiology,2019 05 09,"Given the importance of risk-taking in individuals' personal and professional life, several behavioral tasks for measuring the construct have been developed. Recently, a new task was introduced, the Columbia Card Task (CCT). This task measures participants' risk levels and establishes how sensitive participants are to gains, losses, and probabilities when taking risk. So far, the CCT has been examined in behavioral studies and in combination with several (neuro)biological techniques. However, no electroencephalography (EEG) research has been done on the task. The present study fills this gap and helps to validate this relatively new experimental task. To this end, n = 126 students were asked to complete self-reports (reward responsiveness, impulsiveness, and sensation-seeking) and to perform the CCT (and other risk tasks) in an EEG setup. The results show that feedback appraisal after risky decision-making in the CCT was accompanied by a feedback-related negativity (FRN) and a P300, which were stronger in response to negative than positive feedback. Correlations between the FRN and P300 difference wave on the one hand and risk-related self-reports and behavior on the other were nonsignificant and small, but were mostly in the expected direction. This pattern did not change after excluding participants with psychiatric/neurological disorders and outliers. Excluding participants with reversed (positive > negative) difference waves strengthened FRN correlations. The impact such individuals can have on the data should be taken into account in future studies. Regarding the CCT in particular, future studies should also address its oddball structure and its masking of true values (censoring).",Comparison of 2 canine celiotomy closure models for training novice veterinary students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069811,Veterinary surgery : VS,2019 05 09,To compare a low-fidelity foam and fabric (FF) model to a high fidelity silicone (SI) model for teaching canine celiotomy closure.,Gata3 is required for the functional maturation of inner hair cells and their innervation in the mouse cochlea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069810,The Journal of physiology,2019 05 29,"The physiological maturation of auditory hair cells and their innervation requires precise temporal and spatial control of cell differentiation.

We speculated that light-quality signals of neighbouring vegetation might increase susceptibility to heat shocks because shade reduces tissue temperature and hence the likeness of heat shocks. In contrast, plants of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under low-red/far-red ratios typical of shade were less damaged by heat stress than plants grown under simulated sunlight. Neighbour signals reduce the activity of phytochrome B (phyB), increasing the abundance of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs). The phyB mutant showed high tolerance to heat stress even under simulated sunlight, and a pif multiple mutant showed low tolerance under simulated shade. phyB and red/far-red ratio had no effects on seedlings acclimated with nonstressful warm temperatures before the heat shock.

Clinical data from antipsychotic programs were collected from new drug applications submitted to the US Food and Drug administration from 1993 to 2015. A placebo response-dropout model was developed to describe the time course of total positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores in adults and adolescents. The final model in both populations suggested that patients with higher baseline scores exhibited a greater absolute reduction from baseline. Higher baseline total PANSS, enrollment in US trials, and increases or small improvements in total PANSS were found to be predictors of dropout in both populations. Simulated adolescent data using the final adult placebo response model resembled the observed adolescent data. By confirming similar changes in disease symptomology during an acute exacerbation, efficient regulatory pathways for adolescents can be facilitated by using the extrapolation paradigm.

We detected a novel heterozygous variant c.941A>G (p.Asp314Gly) of WARS in an index patient from an autosomal dominant dHMN family including five affected members over three generations. The variant completely co-segregates with the dHMN phenotype in the family, and it was classified as likely pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines. The clinical features included juvenile to adult onset (15-23 years), distal wasting and weakness, minimal sensory disturbance and length-dependent motor axonal degeneration with CMT examination score ranging from 6 to 10. Our report further confirms the role of WARS in dHMN and indicates that the variant c.941A>G (p.Asp314Gly) of WARS is related to a mild to moderate affected and later onset phenotype of dHMN.","Requirement for urgent tracheal intubation after traumatic injury: a retrospective analysis of 11,010 patients in the Trauma Audit Research Network database.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069782,Anaesthesia,2019 05 09,"Advanced airway management is a treatment priority in trauma care.

A retrospective review of the Trauma Audit and Research Network database was performed to identify airway intervention(s) performed for patients admitted to major trauma centres in England from 01 April 2012 to 27 June 2016. In total, 11,010 patients had airway interventions: 4375 patients (43%) had their tracheas intubated in the pre-hospital setting compared with 5889 patients (57%) in the emergency department. Of the patients whose tracheas were intubated in the emergency department, this was done within 30 min of hospital arrival in 3264 patients (75%).

Regenerative medicine aims to exploit MSCs and their tissue regeneration even though the underlying mechanisms for their beneficial effects are largely unknown. Despite many studies that have used various tissue-derived MSCs, the most effective tissue source for orthopedic procedures still remains to be identified. Another question that needs to be addressed is how to evaluate autologous MSCs (i.e., patient derived). Previous studies have suggested the features of bone-marrow-derived MSCs can differ widely between individuals, and can be changed in particular in patients suffering from some forms of degenerative disorder, such as osteoarthritis. The synovium is a thin membrane that protects the synovial joints, and it is a rich source of MSCs that show great potential for regenerative medicine. Here, we review synovium-derived MSCs from reports on basic and clinical studies. We discuss their potential to treat cartilage defects caused by either degeneration or trauma, and what needs to be done in further research toward their better exploitation for joint regeneration.","1H, 13C, 15N backbone NMR resonance assignments for the rRNA methyltransferase Dim1 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069720,Biomolecular NMR assignments,2019 05 09,"The protein dimethyladenosine transferase 1 (Dim1) is a highly conserved protein occurring in organisms ranging from bacteria such as E. coli where it is named KsgA to humans. Since Dim1 is involved in the biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit it is an essential protein. During ribosome biogenesis Dim1 acts as an rRNA modification enzyme and dimethylates two adjacent adenosine residues of the small ribosomal subunit rRNA. In eukaryotes it is also required to ensure the proper endonucleolytic processing of the small ribosomal subunit rRNA precursor. Recently, a third function was proposed for eukaryotic Dim1. Karbstein and coworkers suggested that Dim1 interacts with the essential ribosome assembly factor Fap7 and that Fap7 is responsible for the dissociation of Dim1 from the nascent small ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the backbone 1H, 13C and 15N NMR resonance assignments for the 30.9 kDa Dim1 homologue from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhDim1) as a prerequisite for a detailed structural investigation of the PhDim1/PhFap7 interaction.",Dacomitinib in the Management of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069718,Drugs,2019 06 10,"The use of targeted therapy in the management of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer is an important milestone in the management of advanced lung cancer. There are several generations of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors available for clinical use. Dacomitinib is a second-generation irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor with early-phase clinical studies showing efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer. In the recently published ARCHER 1050 phase III study, dacomitinib given at 45 mg/day orally was superior to gefitinib, a first-generation reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in improving both progression-free survival and overall survival when given as first-line therapy. There is no prospective evidence to support the use of dacomitinib as subsequent therapy in patients previously treated with chemotherapy or a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Dacomitinib has not demonstrated any benefit in unselected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, and its use should be limited to those with known EGFR-sensitizing mutations. Dacomitinib is associated with increased toxicities of diarrhea, rash, stomatitis, and paronychia compared with first-generation EGFR inhibitors. Global quality of life was maintained when assessed in phase III studies. Overall, dacomitinib is an important first- line agent in EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer in otherwise fit patients whose toxicities can be well managed.",Administration of the Probiotic Escherichia coli Strain A0 34/86 Resulted in a Stable Colonization of the Human Intestine During the First Year of Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069717,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2019 05 09,"Colinfant New Born (CNB) is an orally administered probiotic preparation containing the Escherichia coli strain A0 34/86, which is specially marketed for use in newborns and infants. Although the impact of different probiotics on the composition of the human gut microbiota has been previously described, the effects of E. coli probiotic consumption during infancy on the development of intestinal microbiota are not known. The effect of oral administration of CNB on the Enterobacteriaceae population was mapped using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in DNA samples isolated from the stools of one infant collected at 177 different time points during the first year of life. E. coli strains turnover was analyzed based on the detection of 26 genetic determinants, phylogroups, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Administration of CNB during the second and third month of life introduced the Escherichia genus to the infant's intestinal tract, and Escherichia became dominant among the Enterobacteriaceae family (p < 0.01). Genetic determinants, typical for probiotic E. coli A0 34/86 strain, were detected on the first day after application of CNB and persisted all year. In addition, nine transient E. coli strains were identified; these strains harbored different genetic determinants and showed different PFGE profiles. Transient strains were detected from 2 to 24 days in the stool samples. The first Escherichia colonizer originated from the application of the CNB probiotic preparation.

The interactions between some viruses and the host mitochondria are crucial for virus replication and pathogenicity. In this study, it was observed that EV-A71 infection resulted in a perinuclear redistribution of the mitochondria. The mitochondria rearrangement was found to require the microtubule network, the dynein complex and a low cytosolic calcium concentration. Subsequently, the EV-A71 non-structural protein 2BC was identified as the viral protein capable of inducing mitochondria clustering. The protein was found localized on mitochondria and interacted with the mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1 (RHOT1) that is a key protein required for attachment between the mitochondria and the motor proteins, which are responsible for the control of mitochondria movement. Additionally, suppressing mitochondria clustering by treating cells with nocodazole, EHNA, thapsigargin or A23187 consistently inhibited EV-A71 replication, indicating that mitochondria recruitment played a crucial role in the EV-A71 life cycle. This study identified a novel function of the EV-A71 2BC protein and provided a potential model for the regulation of mitochondrial motility in EV-A71 infection.",The Effect of Boron-Containing Nano-Hydroxyapatite on Bone Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069715,Biological trace element research,2019 05 09,"Metabolic diseases or injuries damage bone structure and self-renewal capacity. Trace elements and hydroxyapatite crystals are important in the development of biomaterials to support the renewal of bone extracellular matrix. In this study, it was assumed that the boron-loaded nanometer-sized hydroxyapatite composite supports the construction of extracellular matrix by controlled boron release in order to prevent its toxic effect. In this context, boron release from nanometer-sized hydroxyapatite was calculated by ICP-MS as in large proportion within 1 h and continuing release was provided at a constant low dose. The effect of the boron-containing nanometer-sized hydroxyapatite composite on the proliferation of SaOS-2 osteoblasts and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by WST-1 and compared with the effects of nano-hydroxyapatite and boric acid. Boron increased proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells at high doses and exhibited different effects on osteoblastic cell proliferation. Boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite composites increased osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity, when compared to nano-hydroxyapatite composite and boric acid. The molecular mechanism of effective dose of boron-containing hydroxyapatite has been assessed by transcriptomic analysis and shown to affect genes involved in Wnt, TGF-β, and response to stress signaling pathways when compared to nano-hydroxyapatite composite and boric acid. Finally, a safe osteoconductive dose range of boron-containing nano-hydroxyapatite composites for local repair of bone injuries and the molecular effect profile in the effective dose should be determined by further studies to validation of the regenerative therapeutic effect window.",Telephone-Based Shared Decision-making for Lung Cancer Screening in Primary Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069714,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 05 09,"The national rate of  lung cancer screening, approximately 3-5%, is too low and strategies which include shared decision-making and increase screening are needed. A feasibility study in one large primary care practice of telephone-based delivery of decision support via an online tool, the Decision Counseling Program© (DCP) was administered to patients eligible for lung cancer screening according to USPSTF screening guidelines. We collected data on demographics, decisional conflict, and conducted chart audits to ascertain screening. From electronic medical record data, we identified 829 age-eligible current or former smokers. Of the 297 individuals reached, 54 were eligible and 28 were recruited to the study and 20 underwent the DCP© intervention. Participants in the intervention were more likely to complete low-dose CT scans at 90 days. Current smokers were less likely to complete the DCP. Women were less likely to complete LDCT.

The NL-MELSM allows for fitting nonlinear functions to the location, or individual means, and the scale, or within-person variance. Specifically, in the context of learning, this model allows the within-person variance to follow a nonlinear trajectory, where it can be determined whether variability reduces during learning. It incorporates a sub-model that can predict nonlinear parameters for both the location and scale. This specification estimates random effects for all nonlinear location and scale parameters that are drawn from a common multivariate distribution. This allows estimation of covariances among the random effects, within and across the location and the scale. These covariances offer new insights into the interplay between individual mean structures and intra-individual variability in nonlinear parameters. We take a fully Bayesian approach, not only for ease of estimation but also for inference because it provides the necessary and consistent information for use in psychological applications, such as model selection and hypothesis testing. To illustrate the model, we use data from 333 individuals, consisting of three age groups, who participated in five learning trials that assessed verbal memory. In an exploratory context, we demonstrate that fitting a nonlinear function to the within-person variance, and allowing for individual variation therein, improves predictive accuracy compared to customary modeling techniques (e.g., assuming constant variance). We conclude by discussing the usefulness, limitations, and future directions of the NL-MELSM.",Parsimonious estimation of signal detection models from confidence ratings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069712,Behavior research methods,2019 05 09,"Signal detection theory (SDT) is used to quantify people's ability and bias in discriminating stimuli. The ability to detect a stimulus is often measured through confidence ratings. In SDT models, the use of confidence ratings necessitates the estimation of confidence category thresholds, a requirement that can easily result in models that are overly complex. As a parsimonious alternative, we propose a threshold SDT model that estimates these category thresholds using only two parameters. We fit the model to data from Pratte et al. (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 36, 224-232 2010) and illustrate its benefits over previous threshold SDT models.",Clinicopathologic Diagnostic and Prognostic Factors of Spindle Cell Carcinoma of Upper Airway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069711,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 05 09,"Spindle cell carcinoma (SpCC) is a rare tumor, which occurs in upper respiratory tract, mainly in larynx.

Its main innovations include: (1) the time order of evolution of patterns defined by Chinese medicine (CM) in AD was found, that is, ""the orderly pattern evolution starting from Shen (Kidney) deficiency, progressing to phlegm, stasis and fire, and worsening to severe toxin as well as functional collapse""; (2) the cascade hypothesis of Shen deficiency in AD and its sequential therapy based on Shen-reinforcing was proposed, that is, ""reinforcing Shen in the early stage and throughout the whole process, resolving phlegm, activating blood and purging fire in the middle stage, detoxifying and replenishing vitality to stop the collapse in the advanced stage"", and through meta-analysis, clinical drug use was optimized, thus the leap from ""inferential selection"" to ""evidence-based selection"" was realized; (3) the STEP regimen combined with CT maintained cognitive and behavioral stability in AD patients for at least 12 months, with cognitive enhancement and behavioral synergy after 9 months, and cognitive benefit was superior to CT at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months, respectively. The 2-year cognitive improvement rate was increased by 25.64% (P=0.020) and the cognitive deterioration rate was decreased by 48.71% (P=0.000).

The behavioral symptomatic relief of patients with vascular dementia received fire-purging therapy (540 cases) was superior to those received CT (P=0.016). These data suggested that the STEP regimen has synergistic effects on CTs at least in terms of cognitive benefit, and the earlier the use, the greater the benefit will have. Therefore, the STEP regimen should be considered as one of the clinical options, particularly for the dearth of effective pharmaceutical or immunological interventions that are currently available for AD.","Anatomical Relations Between the Esogastric Junction, the Diaphragm, the Pleura, and the Left Lung in Chronic Esogastro-bronchial and/or Esogastro-pleural Fistulas After Sleeve Gastrectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069692,Obesity surgery,2019 05 09,"Gastric fistula is a severe complication following sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

If an embryo is exposed to a harmful substance, or teratogen, during the critical period of development, an ensuing malformation may occur. These malformations and their associated mechanisms are studied and analyzed in laboratory animals in order to prevent them from occurring in humans. Rodents such as rats and mice have commonly been used in such studies because of their similarity to humans. In 1959, James G. Wilson designed, developed, and tested a protocol on how to observe and analyze structural malformations in rodent fetuses, which included: external examination, skeletal evaluation, soft tissue analysis, and data collection/analysis. For standardization purposes, i.e., to normalize findings from one lab to another, it is important that this protocol be followed with precision. Although many years have passed since Wilson initially created this protocol, it is still widely used to this day, and only minor changes have been made to his instructions such as the chemical reagents used in the experiments and methods of analysis of the experimental data. Such testing has resulted in major advances in the dissemination of teratology information, including the identification of an increasing number of teratogens and the understanding of the pathogenesis of birth defects. While mechanistically birth defect prevention will include the understanding of individual genomes and pharmacogenomics, overall, morphological assessment will still be required as an integral part of birth defects research. As the interaction between teratogenic and genetic factors is better understood, it is anticipated that the incidence of most types of defects will substantially be reduced.",The Application of High-Resolution Ultrasound for Assessment of Cardiac Structure and Function Associated with Developmental Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069689,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 07,"Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most prevalent anomaly both clinically and in laboratory animal species. Historically, it was difficult to assess the longitudinal progression or repair of such anomalies because assessment methodologies were too invasive (gross exams and/or histology). Recently, technological advances in the field of diagnostic imaging have led to the manufacture of high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS), capable of characterizing both embryonic and maternal cardiovascular structure and function in small animals (rat and mouse). HRUS is relatively noninvasive, facilitating the longitudinal assessment of heart development throughout gestation and postnatally, providing a comprehensive evaluation of changes in cardiovascular performance following toxicant exposure.Described herein is a brief overview of important theoretical and practical considerations when applying HRUS to understand the impact of perturbations on the fetal heart. Examples are given from our own work to help the reader interpret their own HRUS images and more readily identify anomalies in utero. In addition to embryonic assessment, maternal pathologies may adversely affect the cardiovascular performance of the conceptus indirectly. Umbilical blood flow is particularly vulnerable to such effects and procedures to assess this endpoint are described. Neonatal rats, born with CHD, may respond pathologically to cardiovascular challenges as they mature, and we outline the use of HRUS to evaluate cardiac performance over the lifetime of the animal. Some of the caveats related to HRUS are discussed, particularly with the emphasis on how this may impact experimental design.",Characterization of Epigenetic Histone Activation/Repression Marks in Sequences of Genes by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (ChIP-qPCR).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069688,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 07,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is widely used to measure protein-DNA interactions.

Briefly, DNA and proteins are cross-linked (via formaldehyde), and chromatin is sonicated into fragments between 200 and 1000 base pair (bp) long, with an average length of 500 bp. The DNA-protein complexes are captured using antibodies directed toward the protein or protein modification of interest. These immunoprecipitated complexes are retrieved using agarose beads. The DNA-protein cross-links are reversed (via heat and via presence of high salt concentrations), and the ChIP DNA is purified and measured via a quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) reaction. The results show the association of histone modifications at unknown sites of specific genes of interest, indicating which epigenetic modifications of specific genes may be responsible for the outcome of interest."

The existence of transgenic mice with fluorescent markers for the different stages of endochondral ossification adds a further dimension to the technique by allowing striking time course observations of the developing limb. Today, limb bud cultures are used to study the roles of genes during embryogenesis and the mechanisms by which chemicals interfere with critical signalling pathways.",Micromass Methods for the Evaluation of Developmental Toxicants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069668,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 07,"Chick embryonic heart has recently been utilized as a model to create a micromass (MM) culturing system.

We conclude that the negative electrons of NO2 and SO2 gases are strong. The probabilities of electron desorption on SO2 and NO2 negative ions are lower than that in air atmosphere at high temperature. Therefore, the introduction of SO2 causes NO2 to reduce the specific resistance value of coal-fired fly ash. When the pores on the surface of fly ash particles are filled with SO2, no change will occur in NO2, average pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area of fly ash particles, thereby resulting in fly ash that remains unchanged from the resistance value. When humidity increases, the surface conduction effect is greatly enhanced, and the specific resistance value is lowered considerably. Therefore, the specific resistance of dust can be reduced by humidification.","Metals in soils from a typical rapidly developing county, Southern China: levels, distribution, and source apportionment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069653,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 09,"A total of 321 surface soil samples were collected from Huilai County, Guangdong Province, Southern China. Concentrations of 12 metals (Cr, Hg, As, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn, Sb, Sn, Ti, and V) were measured. The mean concentrations of As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Sn, and Ti were higher than their corresponding soil background values, especially for As, Cd, and Sn, which were 1.36, 2.50, and 2.77 times of the background values, respectively. And the results of enrichment factor and pollution load index suggested that soil metals in the study area were moderately contaminated, but pollution of As, Cd, and Sn was relatively serious. According to one-way analysis of variance, there were significant differences in concentrations of Hg, As, Pb, Cd, Zn, and Sn between different land use types, indicating that they were associated with the anthropogenic inputs. The potential sources of metals were quantitatively apportioned by positive matrix factorization, and combined with correlation analysis and geostatistical. The results showed that Cr, Ni, Ti, and V mainly originated from natural sources. Lead, Zn, and partially, Cd mainly came from traffic emissions. Arsenic, Cu, and partially, Sb were ascribed to agricultural practices. Mercury, Sn, partially, Cd, and Sb were derived from industrial activities.

The aims of this study were to investigate the following, in a cauliflower-lettuce rotation: (i) agricultural system agronomic performance, (ii) fertilization treatments environmental sustainability through the energy inputs/outputs analysis, and (iii) carbon footprint through the GHG emissions and carbon sequestration analyses. Three fertilization strategies were compared: (i) CM, compost from municipal solid waste; ii) MIN, mineral fertilizers; iii) MIX, the CM compost plus a mineral fertilizer. Cauliflower and lettuce responses to fertilization were influenced by climatic conditions from year to year, and among the fertilizer treatments, the CM demonstrated a better resilience to the extreme weather events. It also showed the highest renewable energy (44.3%), suggesting that the substitution of mineral fertilizers with organic ones may help to reduce the non-renewable energy depletion, thus promoting the sustainability in horticultural systems. The CM was the most efficient treatment, since the energy stocked as C in the soil (145,889 MJ ha-1) and the net energy and the energy efficiency for cauliflower and lettuce (113,106 MJ ha-1 and 3.1, respectively) were the highest. Our results suggest that the application of the tested sustainable practices makes the farm a ""sink"" for the atmospheric CO2.",Potential of Cedrella fissilis bark as an adsorbent for the removal of red 97 dye from aqueous effluents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069651,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 09,"Cedar bark (Cedrella fissilis), a waste from wood processing, was evaluated as an adsorbent for the removal of red 97 dye from effluents. The material exhibited an amorphous structure, irregular surface, and was mainly composed of lignin and holocellulose. The adsorption was favored at pH 2.0. The general order model was most suitable for describing the experimental kinetic data, being the equilibrium reached in around 30 min. The isotherm experiments were better described by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 422.87 mg g-1 at 328 K. The values of standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0) were from - 21 to - 26 kJ mol-1, indicating a spontaneous and favorable process. The enthalpy change (ΔH0) was 18.98 kJ mol-1, indicating an endothermic process. From the fixed bed adsorption experiment, an inclined breakthrough curve was found, with a mass transfer zone of 5.36 cm and a breakthrough time of 329 min. Cedar bark was able to treat a simulated effluent attaining color removal of 86.6%.

Most of these studies involve young, healthy individuals and use a visual stimulus. As light is a possible countermeasure to sleep loss, and sometimes incompatible with the use of visual PVT, PVT with auditory cues (aPVT) has been used. A threshold of 400 ms is commonly used to delineate lapses from normal RT in the aPVT. As aging can influence a variety of brain functions, we wanted to examine whether this lapse threshold was accurate for use in older adults.",Current Systemic Treatment Landscape of Advanced Gynecologic Malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069647,Targeted oncology,2019 05 09,"Developments in systemic therapies beyond traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy have resulted in an unparalleled number of US Food and Drug Administration approvals in the past 5 years for ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. In this review, we highlight registration trials leading to recent Food and Drug Administration approvals for targeted systemic therapies in advanced gynecologic malignancies, encompassing three classes of agents: the antiangiogenic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab in ovarian and cervical cancer, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in ovarian cancer, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in cervical and endometrial cancer. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been approved in frontline and relapsed advanced ovarian cancer, in both platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive settings. Three poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are approved for women with ovarian cancer. Olaparib and rucaparib are utilized in recurrent germline or somatic BRCA mutated ovarian cancer. Along with a third poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, niraparib, they are also Food and Drug Administration approved as maintenance therapy regardless of BRCA mutation status for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. More recently, olaparib was approved as maintenance therapy for BRCA mutated ovarian cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab has been approved for relapsed cervical cancer with programmed death ligand 1 positivity and relapsed solid tumors with mismatch repair deficiency, which applies to 30% of endometrial cancers. Together, these therapies represent the advent of personalized medicine in gynecologic malignancies. Additional information is required to determine cost-effective strategies for incorporating these therapies and rational means of sequencing these agents.","Morphological and Genetic Characterization of the Poorly Known Species Subulura chinensis Schwartz, 1926 (Nematoda: Ascaridida) from Athene noctua (Scopoli) (Strigiformes: Strigidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069646,Acta parasitologica,2019 05 09,"Subulura chinensis Schwartz, 1926 is a hitherto poorly known nematode species.

RNF10 dissociation from the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor represents the first step of its synaptonuclear transport and it is followed by an importin-dependent translocation into the nucleus. Here, we have identified protein kinase C [PKC]-dependent phosphorylation of RNF10 Ser31 as a key step for RNF10 detachment from NMDA receptor and its subsequent trafficking to the nucleus. We show that pSer31-RNF10 plays a role both in synaptonuclear signaling and in neuronal morphology. In particular, the prevention of Ser31 RNF10 phosphorylation induces a decrease in spine density, neuronal branching, and CREB signaling, while opposite effects are obtained by mimicking a stable RNF10 phosphorylation at Ser31.

A total of 109 significant QTLs were identified to be associated with the examined traits. Sixty-one of these QTLs were integrated into nine stable QTLs. The higher heritability for RM and biomass traits and lower heritability for KUE-related traits, as well as nine stable QTLs for RM traits and only two for KUE-related traits, suggested that regulating RM traits would be more effective than selecting KUE traits directly to improve KUE by marker-assisted selection. Furthermore, the integration of stable QTLs identified in the HK, LK, high-nitrogen (HN) and low-nitrogen (LN) conditions gave 10 QTL clusters. Seven of these clusters were classified into major QTLs that explained 7.4%-23.7% of the total phenotypic variation. Five of the major QTL clusters were detected under all of the treated conditions, and four clusters were specifically detected under the LK and LN conditions. These common and specific QTL clusters may be useful for the simultaneous improvement of multiple traits by marker-assisted selection.",Mechanisms of ferritin assembly studied by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069627,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"The assembly reaction of Escherichia coli ferritin A (EcFtnA) was studied using time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). EcFtnA forms a cage-like structure that consists of 24 identical subunits and dissociates into dimers at acidic pH. The dimer maintains native-like secondary and tertiary structures and can reassemble into a 24-mer when the pH is increased. The time-dependent changes in the SAXS profiles of ferritin during its assembly were roughly explained by a simple model in which only tetramers, hexamers, and dodecamers were considered intermediates. The rate of assembly increased with increasing ionic strength and decreased with increasing pH (from pH 6 to pH 8). These tendencies might originate from repulsion between assembly units (dimers) with the same net charge sign. To test this hypothesis, ferritin mutants with different net charges (net-charge mutants) were prepared. In buffers with low ionic strength, the rate of assembly increased with decreasing net charge. Thus, repulsion between the assembly unit net charges was an important factor influencing the assembly rate. Although the differences in the assembly rate among net-charge mutants were not significant in buffers with an ionic strength higher than 0.1, the assembly rates increased with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that local electrostatic interactions are also responsible for the ionic-strength dependence of the assembly rate and are, on average, repulsive.","Relationship between performance, metabolic profile, and feed efficiency of lactating beef cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069625,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 09,"Twenty-seven Nellore cow-calf pairs were submitted for feed efficiency testing.

In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of the potent sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor antagonist fingolimod (FTY720) in an animal model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and to identify the potential mechanisms underlying these therapeutic effects. C57BL/6J mice were orally administered FTY720 before subcutaneous injection of MPTP. Open-field and rotarod tests were performed to determine the therapeutic effect of FTY720. The damage to dopaminergic neurons and the production of monoamine neurotransmitters were assessed using immunohistochemistry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence (CD68- positive) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze the activation of microglia, and the levels of activated signaling molecules were measured using Western blotting. Our findings indicated that FTY720 significantly attenuated MPTP-induced behavioral deficits, reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and increased dopamine release. FTY720 directly inhibited MPTP-induced microglial activation in the SNpc, suppressed the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α in BV-2 microglial cells treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), and subsequently decreased apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, in MPP+-treated BV-2 cells and primary microglia, FTY720 treatment significantly attenuated the increases in the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β, reduced ROS generation and p65 activation, and also inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1. In conclusion, FTY720 may reduce PD progression by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation via its effects on ROS generation and p65 activation in microglia. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of FTY720, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy against PD.

The purpose of the present study was to explore the organization of neural networks in olfactory-related cortices and modulatory nuclei that give rise to direct and indirect innervations to the glomerular layer (GL) of the OB at the whole-brain scale. Injection of different recombinant attenuated neurotropic viruses into the GL showed that it received direct inputs from each layer in the OB, centrifugal inputs from the ipsilateralanterior olfactory nucleus (AON), anterior piriform cortex (Pir), and horizontal limb of diagonal band of Broca (HDB), and various indirect inputs from bilateral cortical neurons in the AON, Pir, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, HDB, dorsal raphe, median raphe and locus coeruleus.

In this study, the ability of newly established S. littoralis cell lines to support replication of AcMNPV and SpliMNPV was examined. The microscopic observations showed that the S. littoralis cells infected with AcMNPV exhibited morphological changes such as cells breaking into small bodies and forming apoptosis-like bodies post-infection. Nuclear DNA fragmentation was observed in all AcMNPV-infected cell lines through DNA gel electrophoresis analysis. Therefore, the virus replication was unsuccessful in most of cells, which were able to abort the virus replication. On the other hand, cells that were infected with SpliMNPV did not show similar morphological changes and no small bodies were formed. In addition, SpliMNPV succeeded to infect the cells, replicate, and form viral occlusion bodies inside the infected cells. In suspension culture, S. littoralis cells, which were infected with AcMNPV, accumulated as composed balls in shaker flasks after infection overnight, with cell density decreasing dramatically. In contrast, there was no cell clumping seen in the infected cells with SpliMNPV and the uninfected cells. In conclusion, the newly established embryonic S. littoralis cells were highly susceptible to SpliMNPV, whereas the cells were non-permissive to AcMNPV, yet they still underwent programmed cell death.","Optimum salinity for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) growth and mRNA transcripts of ion-regulation, inflammatory, stress- and immune-related genes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069608,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 09,"We aim to study the optimum salinity concentration for Nile tilapia, through the assessment of its growth performance and the expression of its related genes (Gh and Igf-1), as well as its salinity adaptation and immune status through the assessment of the gene expression of ion-regulation genes (Na+/K+-ATPase α-1a and α-1b), stress-related genes (GST, HSP27, and HSP70), inflammatory-related genes (IL1, IL8, CC, and CXC chemokine), and immune-related genes (IgMH TLR7, MHC, and MX) at the osmoregulatory organs (gills, liver, and kidney). Based on the least mortality percentage and the physical appearance of the fish, three salt concentrations (6, 16, and 20 ppt) were chosen following a 6-month preliminary study using serial salt concentrations ranged from 6 to 36 ppt, which were obtained by rearing the fish in gradual elevated pond salinity through daily addition of 0.5 ppt saline water. The fish size was 10.2-12 cm and weight was 25.5-26.15 g. No significant differences in the fish weight gain were observed among the studied groups. The group reared at 16-ppt salt showed better performance than that of 20 ppt, as they have lower morality % and higher expression of ion-regulated gene (Na+/K+-ATPase α1-b), stress-related genes (GST, HSP27, and HSP70) of the gills and also GST, inflammatory-related genes (IL-1β and IL8), and TLR in the liver tissue. Higher expression of kidney-immune-related genes at 20-ppt salt may indicate that higher salinity predispose to fish infection and increased mortality. We concluded that 16-ppt salinity concentration is suitable for rearing O. niloticus as the fish are more adaptive to salinity condition without changes in their growth rate. Also, we indicate the use of immune stimulant feed additive to overcome the immune suppressive effect of hyper-salinity. Additionally, the survival of some fish at higher salinity concentrations (30-34 ppt) increase the chance for selection for salinity resistance in the Nile tilapia.",MicroRNA-494 targets PTEN and suppresses PI3K/AKT pathway to alleviate hypertrophic scar formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069607,Journal of molecular histology,2019 05 09,"Hypertrophic scar is a common complication after skin injury. MicroRNAs have been reported related to hypertrophic scar through posttranscriptional control of genes. Hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblast model and mice incision model were used to see the expression of microRNA-494 and whether the level changes of microRNA-494 could affect scar formation. It was found that in hypertrophic scar, the expression of microRNA-494 decreased. However, after over-express microRNA-494 in fibroblasts, the levels of scar related molecules such as Col I, Col III increased. And when suppress the level of microRNA-494 in fibroblasts, the levels of collagen decreased. Moreover, the up-regulation of microRNA-494 led to decreased apoptosis of fibroblasts while the down-regulation of it led to increased apoptosis. Further, it was found that PTEN was one of the downstream targets of microRNA-494. The up-regulation of PTEN led to inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway and the decreased expression of collagens. In conclusion, we confirmed that microRNA-494 could be a key regulator to suppress hypertrophic scar formation. The suppression of microRNA-494 could eliminate its inhibition effect to PTEN and finally decrease the expression of collagen and inhibit hypertrophic scar formation.","Zinc and iron complexes of oleanolic acid, (OA) attenuate allergic airway inflammation in rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069605,Inflammopharmacology,2019 05 09,"Oleanolic acid (OA) is a hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpene acid (HTAs) used in various ailments. Inflammatory diseases may be profoundly influenced by iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) status. We studied the anti-asthmatic effects of two metal complexes (Fe and Zn) of OA in the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced rat model. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) was measured. Total and differential leucocyte count was done in blood as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in lung tissue by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), immunoglobulin E (IgE) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) were estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Splenocyte proliferation was performed through BrdU uptake method and nitric oxide levels were measured by colorimetric assay kit. The acute toxicity study was also done for the complexes. The asthmatic group developed allergic airway inflammation shown by increased DTH and inflammatory markers in blood and BALF. OA + Fe and OA + Zn displayed significant decrease in DTH, NO, expression of IL-4, 5, 13, 17, toll-like receptor-2, nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor necrosis factor-α; serum IgE, COX-2, and 5-LOX. The metal complexes also attenuated OVA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation. While no hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic potential was shown by OA + Fe and OA + Zn. Our findings indicate that both OA + Fe and OA + Zn possess significant anti-asthmatic effect which may be ascribed to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory features.",Dexamethasone inhibits cytokine production in PBMC from systemic sclerosis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069604,Inflammopharmacology,2019 05 09,"Glucocorticoids (GC) are widely used in the treatment of SSc, although there is not much evidence to prove the benefits offered by these drugs in this disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GC on cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SSc patients. The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) was evaluated in PBMC of 21 SSc patients and 10 healthy volunteers after stimulation of cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-1β were quantified in the culture supernatant by CBA or ELISA. Of the patients evaluated in this study, 8 (38%) were taking corticosteroids, and esophageal dysfunction was more frequent in these patients when compared to those who did not take corticosteroids. DEX (1.000 nM) treatment in PBMC of SSc patients stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 promoted a significant reduction in IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF, IL-1β (p < 0.001 for all), and IL-17F (p = 0.023) cytokines levels. We did not observe differences in response to in vitro treatment with DEX between groups of patients taking or not taking corticosteroids. In PBMC from healthy volunteers, we observed that DEX treatment significantly reduced IL-4, IFN-γ (p = 0.003 for both), IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and TNF (p = 0.002 for all) cytokines. These results show that DEX treatment in PBMC of SSc patients reduced the production of important cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, suggesting a possible mechanism of action of the CG in the treatment of SSc.",Predictive Association of Smoking with Depressive Symptoms: a Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Twins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069603,Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 05 09,"Longitudinal, genetically informative studies of the association between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms among adolescents are limited. We examined the longitudinal association of cigarette smoking with subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence in a Finnish twin cohort. We used prospective data from the population-based FinnTwin12 study (maximum N = 4152 individuals, 1910 twin pairs). Current smoking status and a number of lifetime cigarettes smoked were assessed at the age of 14 and depressive symptoms at the age of 17. Negative binomial regression was conducted to model the association between smoking behavior and subsequent depressive symptoms among individuals, and within-pair analyses were conducted to control for unmeasured familial confounding. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, school grades, drinking alcohol to intoxication, health status, family structure, parental education, and smoking, as well as for pre-existing depressiveness. The results of the individual-level analyses showed that cigarette smoking at the age of 14 predicted depressive symptoms at the age of 17. Compared to never smokers, those who had smoked over 50 cigarettes (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.60) and regular smokers (IRR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.32-1.62) had higher depression scores. The associations were attenuated when adjusted for measured covariates and further reduced in within-pair analyses. In the within-pair results, the estimates were lower within monozygotic (MZ) pairs compared to dizygotic (DZ) pairs, suggesting that shared genetic factors contribute to the associations observed in individual-based analyses. Thus, we conclude that cigarette smoking is associated with subsequent depressive symptoms during adolescence, but the association is not independent of measured confounding factors and shared genetic influences.",The Right to Use Kratom from the Psychiatric and Islamic Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069602,Journal of religion and health,2019 05 09,"This paper aimed to summarize kratom's psychological effects on users and the Islamic views on kratom use. A literature survey of published kratom studies, teachings based on the holy Qur'an, the Sunnah, and views of several Islamic scholars based on qualitative methodology through text analysis was conducted. The results demonstrated that despite its beneficial therapeutic effects, the harm induced by kratom outweighs its benefits. We concluded that kratom use for medicinal purposes is only warranted if useful constituent mitragynine can be extracted and used on its own, and if more rigorous human studies demonstrated good safety profile and efficacy of mitragynine for therapeutic purposes.",Response shift effects in patients' assessments of their quality of life after cardiac rehabilitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069601,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 09,The effect of intervention programs on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) can be underestimated due to response shift effects.

The presented methods are based on a functional representation of shape called the square-root velocity function and a closely related elastic metric. The main benefit of this approach is its invariance to reparameterization (in addition to the standard shape-preserving transformations of translation, rotation and scale), and ability to compute optimal registrations (point correspondences) across objects. Building upon the defined distance between shapes, we additionally describe tools for computing sample statistics including the mean and covariance. Based on the covariance structure, one can also explore variability in shape samples via principal component analysis. Finally, the estimated mean and covariance can be used to define Wrapped Gaussian models on the shape space, which are easy to sample from. We present multiple case studies on various biological datasets including (1) leaf outlines, (2) internal carotid arteries, (3) Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging fiber tracts, (4) Glioblastoma Multiforme tumors, and (5) vertebrae in mice. We additionally provide a MATLAB package that can be used to produce the results given in this manuscript."

In this study, we aimed to utilize this difference to enhance the contrast between healthy and diseased tissues via snapshot narrow-band imaging (SNBI). Four narrow-band images centered at wavelengths of characteristic absorption/reflection peaks of hemoglobin were captured with zero-time delay in between by a custom-designed SNBI video camera. Then these spectral images were fused in real time into a single combined image to enhance the contrast between normal and abnormal tissues. Finally, a Euclidean distance algorithm was employed to classify the tissue into clinical meaningful tissue types. Two pre-clinical experiments were conducted to validate the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that contrast between different grades of diseased tissues in the SNBI generated image was indeed enhanced, as compared to conventional white light image (WLI). The computer-aided classification accuracy was 100% and 50% as compared to the gold standard histopathological diagnosis results with the SNBI and the conventional WLI methods, respectively. Further, the boundary contour between health tissue, cervical precancerous regions, and carcinoma in situ can be automatically delineated in SNBI. The proposed SNBI method was also fast, and it generated automatic diagnostic results with clear boundary contours at over 11 fps on a Pentium 1.6-GHz laptop. Hence, the proposed SNBI is of great significance to enlarge worldwide the coverage of regular cervical screening program, and to live guide surgeries such as biopsy sample collection and accurate cervical cancer treatment.",Temporal dynamics of peripheral neutrophil and lymphocytes following acute ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069585,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 05 09,"The immune response to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is implicated in diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention; however, the temporal dynamics of leukocytes following AIS are poorly understood.

While inlet BCs are typically determined non-invasively, invasive pressure catheterization is often used to determine patient specific outlet BCs and vessel wall mechanical properties. A method using 4D Flow MRI to non-invasively determine both patient specific outlet BCs and vessel wall mechanical properties is presented and results for both in vitro validation with a latex tube and an in vivo pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) stent intervention are presented. For in vitro validation, acceptable agreement is found between simulation using BCs from 4D Flow MRI and benchtop measurements. For the PAS virtual intervention, simulation correctly predicts flow distribution with 9% error compared to MRI. Using 4D Flow MRI to noninvasively determine patient specific BCs increases the ability to use image based simulations as pressure catheterization is not always performed.",Developmental Trajectories of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms from Early to Middle Childhood: a Population-Based Cohort Study in the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069583,Journal of abnormal child psychology,2019 05 09,"Developmental patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms in early childhood have previously been related to anxiety and mood disorders in middle childhood. In the current study, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms (1.5-10 years) were related to children's broader psychosocial and school-related functioning at 10 years. We included a population-based sample of 7499 children, for whom primary caregivers reported anxiety and depression symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist, at children's ages of 1.5, 3, 6, and 10. Growth Mixture Modeling identified four distinct, gender-invariant, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms: low (82.4%), increasing (7.4%), decreasing (6.0%), and increasing symptoms up to age 6 followed by a decrease to age 10 (preschool-limited, 4.2%). Children with a non-Dutch ethnicity had lower odds to be in the increasing trajectory and higher odds to be in the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Also, low maternal education predicted the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Higher levels of psychopathology during pregnancy for both mothers and fathers predicted the increasing, decreasing, and preschool-limited trajectory, compared to the low trajectory. At age 10, children in the increasing and preschool-limited trajectory had diminished psychosocial outcomes (friendship-quality and self-esteem) and worse school-related outcomes (school performance and school problems). This study adds to current knowledge by demonstrating that developmental patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms in early childhood are related to broader negative outcomes in middle childhood. Child and family factors could guide monitoring of anxiety and depression symptoms in the general population and provide targets for prevention programs.",Worldwide hernia repair: variations in the treatment of primary unilateral inguinal hernias in adults in the United Kingdom and in low- and middle-income countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069582,Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2019 05 09,"In this invited commentary, we aim to quantify and explain the variation between, and also within, developed healthcare systems (using the UK as an example) and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs).

In the past few decades, our knowledge of disease pathogenesis has improved, and disease classification systems have evolved to the point where no complex disease processes are considered homogenous. As a result, pathology and epidemiology have been integrated into the single, unified field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE). Advancing integrative molecular and population-level health sciences and addressing the unique research challenges specific to the field of MPE necessitates assembling experts in diverse fields, including epidemiology, pathology, biostatistics, computational biology, bioinformatics, genomics, immunology, and nutritional and environmental sciences. Integrating these seemingly divergent fields can lead to a greater understanding of pathogenic processes. The International MPE Meeting Series fosters discussion that addresses the specific research questions and challenges in this emerging field. The purpose of the meeting series is to: discuss novel methods to integrate pathology and epidemiology; discuss studies that provide pathogenic insights into population impact; and educate next-generation scientists. Herein, we share the proceedings of the Fourth International MPE Meeting, held in Boston, MA, USA, on 30 May-1 June, 2018. Major themes of this meeting included 'integrated genetic and molecular pathologic epidemiology', 'immunology-MPE', and 'novel disease phenotyping'. The key priority areas for future research identified by meeting attendees included integration of tumor immunology and cancer disparities into epidemiologic studies, further collaboration between computational and population-level scientists to gain new insight on exposure-disease associations, and future pooling projects of studies with comparable data.",Association between hyperechogenic pancreas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069577,Journal of medical ultrasonics (2001),2019 05 09,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may independently occur in the pancreas separate from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).

External ventricular drainage (EVD), the most common treatment adopted in these patients, may be unsuccessful due to short-term drain obstruction and requires weeks for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearing, increasing the risks of ventriculits. Administration of intraventricular fibrinolytic agents and endoscopic evacuation have been proposed as alternative treatments, but with equally poor results. We present a retrospective analysis of two groups of patients who respectively underwent endoscope-assisted microsurgical evacuation versus EVD for the treatment of cast IVH. In a 10-year time, 25 patients with cast IVH underwent microsurgical, endoscope-assisted evacuation. Twenty-seven were instead treated by EVD. The two groups were compared in terms of hematoma evacuation, CSF clearing time, infection rates, need for permanent shunting, short/long-term survival, and functional outcome. In endoscope-assisted surgeries, full CSF clearance required 14 ± 3 days in 20 patients and 21 ± 3 days in 5; in the EVD group, 21 ± 3 days were needed in 12 patients, 28 ± 3 days in 11, and 35 ± 3 days in 4.

We conducted a linguistic analysis, called Membership Categorization Analysis, of interviews with leaders of recent curriculum changes to explore how they talk about educational scientists in relation to these processes. The analysis was conducted on previously collected interview data with nine change leaders of major undergraduate medical curriculum change processes in the Netherlands. We analyzed how change leaders categorize HPESUs and educational scientists (use of category terms) and what they say about them (predicates). We noticed two ways of categorizing educational scientists, with observable different predicates. Educational scientists categorized by their first name were suggested to be closer to the change process, more involved in decisional practices and positively described, whereas those described in more generic terms were represented in terms of relatively passive and unspecified activities, were less explicit referenced for their knowledge and expertise and were predominantly factually or negatively described. This study shows an ambiguous portrayal of educational scientists by leaders of major curriculum change processes. Medical schools are challenged to establish medical curricula in consultation with a large, diverse and interdisciplinary stakeholder group. We suggest that it is important to invest in interpersonal relationships to strengthen the internal collaborations and make sure people are aware of each other's existence and roles in the process of curriculum development.",Acute esophageal necrosis with esophagus perforation treated by thoracoscopic subtotal esophagectomy and reconstructive surgery on a secondary esophageal stricture: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069560,Surgical case reports,2019 06 10,"Acute esophageal necrosis is defined as necrosis of the esophageal mucosa causing diffuse black pigmentation of the esophagus, the so-called black esophagus from its endoscopic findings.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that in some context CD95 has not only the potential to induce apoptosis but also can trigger non-apoptotic signal leading to cell survival, proliferation, cancer growth and metastasis. Despite extensive investigations focused on alterations in the expression level of CD95 and associated signal molecules, very few studies, however, have investigated the effects of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation and glutathionylation on CD95 function. Post-translational modifications of CD95 in mammalian systems are likely to play a more prominent role than anticipated in CD95 induced cell death. In this review we will focus on the alterations in CD95-mediated signaling caused by post-translational modifications of CD95.",Rapid mapping of the spatial and temporal intensity of influenza.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069558,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 06 15,"Surveillance of influenza epidemics is a priority for risk assessment and pandemic preparedness, yet representation of their spatiotemporal intensity remains limited. Using the epidemic of influenza type A in 2016 in Australia, we demonstrated a simple but statistically sound adaptive method of mapping epidemic evolution over space and time. Weekly counts of persons with laboratory confirmed influenza type A infections in Australia in 2016 were analysed by official national statistical region. Weekly standardised epidemic intensity was represented by a standard score (z-score) calculated using the standard deviation of below-median counts in the previous 52 weeks. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to present the epidemic progression. There were 79,628 notifications of influenza A infections included. Of these, 79,218 (99.5%) were allocated to a geographical area. The GIS maps indicated areas of elevated epidemic intensity across Australia by week and area that were consistent with the observed start, peak and decline of the epidemic when compared with counts aggregated at the state and territory level. This simple, adaptable approach could improve local level epidemic intelligence in a variety of settings and for other diseases. It may also facilitate increased understanding of geographic epidemic dynamics.",Cost-analysis and quality of life after laparoscopic and robotic ventral mesh rectopexy for posterior compartment prolapse: a randomized trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069557,Techniques in coloproctology,2019 05 09,"The aim of this study was to assess, whether robotic-assistance in ventral mesh rectopexy adds benefit to laparoscopy in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cost-effectiveness and anatomical and functional outcome.",Assessment of the Versius surgical robotic system for dual-field synchronous transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) in a preclinical model: will tomorrow's surgical robots promise newfound options?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069556,Techniques in coloproctology,2019 05 09,The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the Versius surgical robotic system for transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) in a preclinical setting.,Effect of Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy on Quality of Life in Patients with Peritoneal Mesothelioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069554,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 05 09,"Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is an accepted treatment for peritoneal mesothelioma.

Once AF develops, following the disappearance of pulsation, the circumstances within the atrium become prothrombotic and thrombus formation within the left atrium occurs in patients with AF. In recent years, not only warfarin but also new oral anticoagulants were introduced clinically and have become used as oral anticoagulants. In the perioperative period, the risk of major hemorrhage needs to be reduced. On the other hand, the suspension of anticoagulant therapy and neutralization of anticoagulant effects elevate the risk of thrombosis. The perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy is different from that of scheduled surgery and emergency surgery. In addition, knowledge of the characteristics of each oral anticoagulant is required at drug cessation and resumption. Unlike warfarin, which has been used in the past five decades, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not have sensitive indicators such as prothrombin time-international normalized ratio.

Trophozoite viability analysis and ultrastructural studies showed that dendrimers prevent encystment by lysing the cellular membrane of the amoeba. Moreover, one of the dendrimers showed low toxicity when tested on mammalian cell cultures, which suggest that it might be eventually used as an amoebicidal drug or as a disinfection compound in contact lens solutions.",Early suppression of B cell immune responses by low doses of chloroquine and pyrimethamine: implications for studying immunity in malaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069535,Parasitology research,2019 06 10,"Malaria remains a significant worldwide public health problem. To address biological questions, researchers rely on the experimental murine model. For decades, chloroquine (CQ) and pyrimethamine (Pyr) have been used to clear Plasmodium infections in experimental animals using standardised accepted protocols and, because of this, drug-treated controls are rarely included. However, there is limited data available on the modulation of anti-malarial immunity, including generation of memory B cells, when these drugs are administered days after malaria infection. We investigated B cell responses to an important malaria glycolipid, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), and the hapten nitrophenol (NP), with or without standard CQ and Pyr treatment using the murine model. At day 14, CQ/Pyr treatment significantly suppressed the frequency of NP+IgG1+ memory B cells in NP-KLH-immunised mice. Furthermore, CQ/Pyr-treated NP-KLH-immunised mice did not have significantly higher cellular counts of NP+ B cells, germinal centre B cells, nor NP+IgG1+ memory B cells than naïve mice (CQ/Pyr treated and untreated). CQ/Pyr-treated GPI-KLH-immunised mice did not have significantly higher cellular counts of GPI+ B cells than naïve untreated mice. By day 28, this effect appeared to resolve since all immunised mice, whether treated or untreated, had significantly higher B cell proliferative responses than naïve mice (CQ/Pyr treated and untreated) for the majority of B cell phenotypes. The current study emphasises the potential for drug modulation of antigenic B cell responses when using standardised malaria treatment protocols in the experimental murine model. It is recommended that drug-treated controls are included when using experimental malaria infections to address biological questions.",Effects of host fatty acid-binding protein 4 on Eimeria tenella sporozoites invasion of cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069534,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"In our previous study, proteomics analyses of host cells infected with Eimeria tenella sporozoites coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, identified several host proteins related to Eimeria invasion. In this study, A 458-bp Gallus gallus fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) gene was cloned and subcloned to pET-28c(+) vector to construct the prokaryotic recombinant expression plasmid pET-28c(+)-FABP4. The 18.5 kDa recombinant FABP4 protein (rFABP4) was expressed and identified by western blotting. Expression of FABP4 in E. tenella sporozoite-infected DF-1 cells was downregulated significantly than in non-infected cells detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The antibody inhibition assay showed that antibodies against FABP4 at 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 μg/mL had no significant effect on sporozoite invasion. BMS-309403 and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) was used to inhibit and improve the expression of FABP4 in DF-1 cells, respectively, and their effect on the sporozoite invasion of cells was detected by flow cytometry. Sporozoite invasion rate in the BMS-309403-treated group was not significantly affected; however, the invasion rate in the TGF-β3-treated group declined significantly. These results show that host FABP4 plays a negative role in Eimeria invasion. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of how FABP4 negatively regulates Eimeria invasion.",CpG enhances the immunogenicity of heterologous DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccination with the heavy chain myosin of Brugia malayi in BALB/c mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069533,Parasitology research,2019 05 20,"The recombinant heavy chain myosin of Brugia malayi (Bm-Myo) has earlier been reported as a potent vaccine candidate in our lab. Subsequently, we further enhanced its efficacy employing heterologous DNA prime/protein boost (Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo) immunization approach that produced superior immune-protection than protein or DNA vaccination. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of heterologous prime boost vaccination in combination with CpG, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) adjuvant in BALB/c mice. The results showed that CpG/Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo conferred 84.5 ± 0.62% protection against B. malayi infective larval challenge which was considerably higher than Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo (75.6 ± 1.10%) following immunization. Although, both the formulations of immunization elicited robust production of specific IgG antibody and their isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3); however, CpG/Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo predominantly enhanced the level of IgG2a suggesting Th1 biased immune response in presence of CpG. Furthermore, spleen isolated from mice that immunized with CpG/Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo had greater accumulation of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ B cells and there was an augmented expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD86 on host dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast to Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo group, the splenocytes of CpG/Myo-pcD+Bm-Myo immunized mice developed comparatively higher pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ leaving anti-inflammatory cytokine levels unchanged. Moreover, CpG formulation also upregulated the RNA expression of IL-12 and TNF-α in spleenocytes. The current findings suggest that the use of CpG would be more advantageous as an adjuvant predominantly in DNA/protein prime boost vaccine against Bm-Myo and presumably also for filarial infection.",Sir Hugh Cairns: a pioneering collaborator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069532,Acta neurochirurgica,2019 05 09,"In April 1988, Peter Schurr delivered the twelfth Sir Hugh Cairns Memorial Lecture to the Society of British Neurological Surgeons. In his lecture, The Cairns Tradition, Schurr extolled the personal virtues of Cairns. He encouraged his colleagues to draw inspiration from Cairns' renowned determination, organisation, drive for perfection, compassion, and commitment to the training of those around him. Indeed, Cairns' own personality has come to define the specialty which he established in Britain. Today's neurosurgeons are, whether knowingly or not, formed in his image. But there is a side to Hugh Cairns that has been lost in the telling of his remarkable story, and yet it played a central role in his greatest achievements. This is the side of himself which he turned towards others. Throughout his career, Cairns received an inordinate number of personal accolades. His tutelage under Cushing during a formative trip to America and the impact of his role in caring for T. E. Lawrence are well known to many. But, more than thirty years after Peter Schurr's memorial lecture, and following the eightieth anniversary of the department of neurosurgery founded by Cairns in Oxford, it is his work as a pioneering collaborator which defines his legacy today, and which calls us to learn yet another lesson from his remarkable life. In this legacy article, we review the origins of Cairns' collaborative spirit and uncover the achievements he shared with Charles Hallpike, Howard Florey, Derek Denny-Brown, William Ritchie Russell, Ludwig Guttman, and Peter Medawar, among many others."

Hence, better understanding of the spatial and temporal precipitation patterns is necessary in order to quantify desertification risks and design suitable mitigation measures. This study uses monthly precipitation measurements from a sparse network of 54 monitoring stations on the Mediterranean island of Crete (Greece). The study period extends from 1948 to 2012. The data reveal strong correlations between the western and eastern parts of the island. However, the average annual precipitation in the West is about 450 mm higher than that in the East. We construct a spatial model of average annual precipitation in Crete. The model involves a topographic trend and residuals with anisotropic spatial correlations which are fitted with a recently developed variogram function. We use regression kriging to generate annual precipitation maps and to identify locations of high estimation uncertainty. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed spatial analysis of precipitation in Crete to date. We present the analysis in detail for the year 1971. The trend accounts for ≈ 74% of the total variance. The highest precipitation estimate is 2331 mm in the West and 1781 mm in the East. The highest relative estimation uncertainty (≈ 20%) is observed along the southeastern coastline of the island, where the lowest values of annual precipitation are observed. This region includes one of the major agricultural areas of the island. The same overall patterns are found for other years in the study. Finally, we find no statistical evidence for a decrease in the global (over the entire island) annual precipitation during the study period.",Plant origin authentication of Sonoran Desert propolis: an antiproliferative propolis from a semi-arid region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069518,Die Naturwissenschaften,2019 05 22,"The main chemical composition of Sonoran propolis (SP), as well as its antiproliferative activity on cancer cells through apoptosis induction, has been reported. The chemical constitution of SP remained qualitatively similar throughout the year, whereas the antiproliferative effect on cancer cells exhibited significant differences amongst seasonal samples. The main goal of this study was to provide phytochemical and pharmacological evidence for the botanical source of SP and its antiproliferative constituents. A chemical comparative analysis of SP and plant resins of species found in the surrounding areas of the beehives was carried out by HPLC-UV-DAD, as well as by 1H NMR experiments. The antiproliferative activity on cancerous (M12.C3.F6, HeLa, A549, PC-3) and normal cell lines (L-929; ARPE-19) was assessed through MTT assays. Here, the main polyphenolic profile of SP resulted to be qualitatively similar to Populus fremontii resins (PFR). However, the antiproliferative activity of PFR on cancer cells did not consistently match that exhibited by SP throughout the year. Additionally, SP induced morphological modifications on treated cells characterised by elongation, similar to those induced by colchicine, and different to those observed with PFR treatment. These results suggest that P. fremontii is the main botanical source of SP along the year. Nevertheless, the antiproliferative constituents of SP that induce that characteristic morphological elongation on treated cells are not obtained from PFR. Moreover, the presence of kaempferol-3-methyl-ether in SP could point Ambrosia ambrosioides as a secondary plant source. In conclusion, SP is a bioactive poplar-type propolis from semi-arid zones, in which chemical compounds derived from other semi-arid plant sources than poplar contribute to its antiproliferative activity.",A novel approach for establishing fitness standards for occupational task performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069517,European journal of applied physiology,2019 06 15,To identify strength and performance thresholds below which task performance is impaired.,"Prediction of land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, India using geospatial techniques.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069516,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 12,"The Bharathapuzha river basin, once endowed with dense vegetation and abundant water, has been experiencing acute water shortage and extreme climatic conditions in recent times. To understand the influence of human interventions on the natural environmental conditions, including the problems mentioned above, it is essential to critically examine the changes in land use/cover over these years. The objective of this study is to assess land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, Kerala during the period 1990-2017 using LANDSAT series satellite images. The dynamics of land use/cover change were quantified and mapped using geospatial techniques. The multi-temporal LANDSAT images were classified by supervised maximum likelihood method to generate the corresponding land use/cover maps; changes in land use/cover in the river basin were subsequently detected by the post-classification technique. Results of the study revealed a drastic change in land use/cover in the period 1990-2017; the primary causes of this were deforestation and urbanization. The near- and long-term future land use/cover maps of the basin for 2020 and 2035 were generated from the historically retrieved land use/cover change pattern. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov chain techniques were used to generate future land use/cover maps. These maps reveal that the predominant land use/cover class in the basin will be barren land and about 46.13% of the existing (in 2017) dense vegetation will diminish by 2035. The efficiency of sustainable watershed management activities in the river basin can be improved based on the critical observations from this study.",Is conversion of decimal visual acuity measurements to logMAR values reliable?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069515,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2019 06 13,To assess if conversion of decimal visual acuity (VA) to logMAR is reliable for clinical and research purposes.,Different trophic groups of arboreal ants show differential responses to resource supplementation in a neotropical savanna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069514,Oecologia,2019 06 16,"Resource-ratio theory predicts that consumers should achieve optimal ratios of complementary nutrients. Accordingly, different trophic groups are expected to vary in their N-limitation depending on the extent to which they feed primarily on carbohydrate (CHO) or protein. Among arboreal ants, N-limitation ranges from high (for trophobiont tenders), intermediate (leaf foragers) and low (predators). We report results from a manipulative field experiment in a Brazilian savanna that tests the differential attractiveness of nitrogen and CHO to arboreal ants, as well as experimentally examines changes in broader ant foraging patterns in response to protein and CHO supplementation. Every tree within 32 20 × 20 m plots were supplemented with either protein, CHO; protein + CHO or a water control (n = 8 in each case) for a 7-day period in each of the wet and dry seasons. As predicted, different trophic groups responded differentially to supplementation treatment according to the extent of their N-limitation. The richness and abundance of the most N-limited group (trophobiont tenders) was highest at protein supplements, whereas less N-limited trophic groups showed highest species richness (leaf foragers) or abundance (predators) at CHO supplements. Protein supplementation markedly increased the general foraging abundance of trophobiont tenders, but decreased the abundance of leaf foragers. We attribute the latter to increased competition from behaviorally dominant trophobiont tenders. Our study provides experimental evidence that nutrient availability is a major factor influencing arboreal ant communities, both directly through the provision of different resources, and indirectly through increased competitive pressure.",Determination of the complete genome sequence of European mountain ash ringspot-associated emaravirus from Sorbus intermedia reveals two additional genome segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069513,Archives of virology,2019 06 10,"We report the complete genome sequence, comprising six single-stranded RNAs of negative orientation, of a European mountain ash ringspot-associated virus (EMARaV) isolate identified in a diseased Sorbus intermedia (Swedish whitebeam) tree exhibiting prominent chlorotic ringspots, mottle and line pattern on leaves. Since the first observation of EMARaV-like symptoms and detection of the virus in whitebeam in 2012, the tree displayed leaf symptoms every year in at least one third of its canopy, developed dieback symptoms, and showed signs of decline. Two previously unrecorded genome segments of the virus were identified, each encoding a single protein in a negative orientation. RNA5 is 1629 nucleotides long and encodes the putative movement protein (MP) of EMARaV with a molecular mass of 42.4 kDa. RNA6 (1362 nucleotides) encodes a small protein (26.8 kDa) exhibiting some sequence similarity to the P4 protein encoded by EMARaV RNA4. However, its biological function remains to be elucidated. Both novel genome segments are systematically present in EMARaV-infected Sorbus spp., and no additional genome segments could be identified by two independent methods. It is concluded that the six RNAs represent the complete genome of EMARaV.",Product recovery of an enzymatically synthesized (-)-menthol ester in a deep eutectic solvent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069512,Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,2019 05 09,"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have gained increased attention as alternative reaction media for biocatalysis in recent years. There are many investigations on biotransformations in a variety of DESs, but the purification of bioproducts from DES reaction mixtures has not yet been sufficiently addressed. The present study demonstrates a product recovery strategy from a DES reaction medium composed of (-)-menthol and dodecanoic acid. Since the DES is not formed by equimolar amounts of the substrates, but the eutectic point occurs at a 3:1 molar ratio, product isolation is an important task for effective biocatalytic process development, even if the limiting substrate is converted completely. Both DES compounds acted as substrates and reaction solvent in the lipase-catalyzed esterification to synthesize (-)-menthyl dodecanoate. The product (-)-menthyl dodecanoate ester was separated from the DES reaction mixture by a vacuum distillation step and a second esterification reaction can be performed with the recovered (-)-menthol.","Atrial fibrillation is associated with alterations in HDL function, metabolism, and particle number.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069509,Basic research in cardiology,2019 05 09,"Increased morbidity and mortality in atrial fibrillation (AF) are related to the pro-fibrotic, pro-thrombotic, and pro-inflammatory processes that underpin the disease. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-thrombotic properties. Functional impairment of HDL may, therefore, associate with AF initiation or progression. We studied indices of HDL quality and quantity of AF patients and healthy controls, including HDL-particle number, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I levels, serum amyloid A (SAA) content and HDL-cholesterol efflux capacity, and paraoxonase activity of apoB-depleted serum. Serum samples were collected from AF patients (n = 91) before catheter ablation and from age- and sex-matched control subjects (n = 54). HDL-cholesterol efflux capacity was assessed in a validated assay using [3H]-cholesterol-labeled J774 macrophages. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and paraoxonase activities were assessed using fluorometric assays, SAA levels were determined by ELISA, and total and subclass HDL-particle number was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. ApoA-I levels were determined by immunoturbidimetry. HDL-cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL-particle number, apoA-I levels, and LCAT activity were markedly reduced in AF patients when compared to healthy individuals (all p < 0.001), whereas HDL-associated paraoxonase activity and SAA content were not altered (p = 0.578, p = 0.681). Notably, cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL-particle number, apoA-I levels as well as LCAT activity recovered following restoration of sinus rhythm (all p < 0.001). We identified marked alterations in HDL function, HDL maturation, and HDL-particle number in AF patients.

A few studies have clarified the factor that determines the outcome of a contest between a guarding male and an invader male. We investigated the male-male contest and mating behavior of a saproxylic parasitoid wasp, Ibalia japonica (Hymenoptera: Cynipoidea: Ibaliidae) using field observations in Japan. These observations indicated that I. japonica males show precopulatory mate-guarding behavior and that four types of male-male contests occur on the Magnolia liliiflora (Magnoliales: Magnoliaceae) tree that virgin females emerge from. We show that the arrival order of I. japonica males that found the future emergence point of a female was key factor that allowed males to secure virgin females."

We previously established the six meningioma methylation classes (MC) benign 1-3, intermediate A and B, and malignant. Here, we set out to identify subgroup-specific mutational patterns and gene regulation. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 62 samples across all MCs and WHO grades from 62 patients with matched blood control, including 40 sporadic meningiomas and 22 meningiomas arising after radiation (Mrad). RNA sequencing was added for 18 of these cases and chromatin-immunoprecipitation for histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for 16 samples. Besides the known mutations in meningioma, structural variants were found as the mechanism of NF2 inactivation in a small subset (5%) of sporadic meningiomas, similar to previous reports for Mrad. Aberrations of DMD were found to be enriched in MCs with NF2 mutations, and DMD was among the most differentially upregulated genes in NF2 mutant compared to NF2 wild-type cases. The mutational signature AC3, which has been associated with defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR), was detected in both sporadic meningioma and Mrad, but widely distributed across the genome in sporadic cases and enriched near genomic breakpoints in Mrad. Compared to the other MCs, the number of single nucleotide variants matching the AC3 pattern was significantly higher in the malignant MC, which also exhibited higher genomic instability, determined by the numbers of both large segments affected by copy number alterations and breakpoints between large segments. ChIP-seq analysis for H3K27ac revealed a specific activation of genes regulated by the transcription factor FOXM1 in the malignant MC. This analysis also revealed a super enhancer near the HOXD gene cluster in this MC, which, together with general upregulation of HOX genes in the malignant MC, indicates a role of HOX genes in meningioma aggressiveness. This data elucidates the biological mechanisms rendering different epigenetic subgroups of meningiomas, and suggests leveraging HRR as a novel therapeutic target.",Motor Learning Feeding Interventions for Infants at Risk of Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069491,Dysphagia,2019 05 09,"Feeding difficulties and dysphagia are common in cerebral palsy (CP) and can lead to deficiencies of development and aspiration pneumonia; a leading cause of death in CP. Motor learning interventions have shown positive results in other clinical areas and may be beneficial for this population. This systematic review appraises research that addresses the question: are motor learning-based interventions more effective than compensatory strategies alone in treating dysphagia in infants with, or at risk of, CP?. Systematic searches were conducted in nine electronic databases. All levels of evidence, with at least one infant between 37 weeks post-menstrual age and 12 months corrected age who were at risk of, or diagnosed with CP, implemented interventions which aimed to improve oropharyngeal function for feeding, and aligned with at least two motor learning principles, were included. Studies were appraised by two independent reviewers using the Cho & Bero Instrument and GRADE. One historical case-control study and four case series met inclusion criteria. All involved a combination of motor learning interventions and compensatory strategies, which do not traditionally align with motor learning principles. All studies reported improvements in oral feeding outcomes, however, only three reported statistical analysis.

In this study, the trehalose synthesis and its protective role in Pleurotus ostreatus were investigated. As a signal in metabolic regulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in the mycelia of P. ostreatus under heat stress (HS). Furthermore, mycelial growth was significantly inhibited, and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level significantly increased under HS. First, exogenous addition of H2O2 inhibited mycelial growth and elevated the MDA level, while N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and vitamin C (VC) reduced the MDA level and recovered mycelial growth under HS by scavenging ROS. These results indicated that the mycelial radial growth defect under HS might be partly caused by ROS accumulation. Second, adding NAC and VC to the media resulted in rescued trehalose accumulation, which indicated that ROS has an effect on inducing trehalose synthesis. Third, the mycelial growth was recovered by addition of trehalose to the media after HS, and the MDA level was reduced. This effect was further verified by the overexpression of genes for trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and neutral trehalase (NTH), which led to increased and reduced trehalose content, respectively. In addition, adding validamycin A (NTH inhibitor) to the media promoted trehalose accumulation and the recovered mycelial growth after HS. In conclusion, trehalose production was partly induced by ROS accumulation in the mycelia under HS, and the accumulated trehalose could promote the recovery of growth after HS, partly by reducing the MDA level in the mycelia.",Ribokinase screened from T7 phage displayed Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA library had good potential for the serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069485,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 15,"Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases in the worldwide. Lack of more sensitive and effective diagnostic reagents has increased the awareness of rapid diagnosis for tuberculosis. In this study, T7 phage displayed genomic DNA library of M. tuberculosis was constructed to screen the antigens that specially bind with TB-positive serum from the whole genome of M. tuberculosis and to improve the sensitivity and specificity of tuberculosis serological diagnosis. After three rounds of biopanning, results of DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis showed that 19 positive phages displayed four different proteins and the occurrence frequency of the phage which displayed ribokinase was the highest. The results of indirect ELISA and dot immunoblotting indicated that representative phages could specifically bind to tuberculosis-positive serum. The prokaryotic expression vector containing the DNA sequence of ribokinase gene was then constructed and the recombinant protein was expressed and purified to evaluate the serodiagnosis value of ribokinase. The reactivity of the recombinant ribokinase with different clinical serum was detected and the sensitivities and specificities in tuberculosis serodiagnosis were 90% and 86%, respectively by screening serum from tuberculosis patients (n = 90) and uninfected individuals (n = 90) based on ELISA.

We find that Srs2 activity is required for normal meiotic progression and spore viability. A significant fraction of srs2 mutant cells progress through both meiotic divisions without separating the bulk of their chromatin, although in such cells sister centromeres often separate. Undivided nuclei contain aggregates of Rad51 colocalised with the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, suggesting the presence of persistent single-strand DNA. Rad51 aggregate formation requires Spo11-induced DSBs, Rad51 strand-invasion activity and progression past the pachytene stage of meiosis, but not the DSB end-resection or the bias towards interhomologue strand invasion characteristic of normal meiosis. srs2 mutants also display altered meiotic recombination intermediate metabolism, revealed by defects in the formation of stable joint molecules. We suggest that Srs2, by limiting Rad51 accumulation on DNA, prevents the formation of aberrant recombination intermediates that otherwise would persist and interfere with normal chromosome segregation and nuclear division.",Greenstick fracture-hinge decompressive craniotomy in infants: illustrative case and literature review of techniques for decompressive craniotomy without bone removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069483,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2019 05 09,"We present the potential usefulness of a greenstick fracture-hinge decompressive craniotomy, a variant of a hinge-craniotomy, as an alternative technique for use with a decompressive craniectomy (DC) in infants.

The present review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on microplastic pollution in soil environments. We critically summarize the source, contamination level and fate of microplastics in (industrial and arable) soils. Then, we thoroughly describe what effects have been observed on soil microbes, animals and plants, and analyze what insights we can get from available information. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled and give suggestions for future research.",Determination of the Leaching Potential and Residues Activity of Imidazolinone Herbicide in Clearfield Rice Soil Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069403,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 05 09,"The residual activity of herbicides may be detrimental to the environment, requiring analysis of the persistent residues in the soil and water. A field study was conducted to measure the residues of Imidazolinone (IMI) in three Clearfield® rice field soils at three different locations in Malaysia. The analyses of IMI in the soil samples were carried out using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These herbicides are widely used; however, few studies have been conducted on both residues, especially in the context of Malaysian soil. Residues of imazapic and imazapyr were found to fall within 0.03-0.58 µg/mL and 0.03-1.96 µg/mL, respectively, in three locations. IMI herbicides are persistent in the soil, and their residues remain for up to 85 days after application. A pre-harvest study was suggested for these herbicides on water, which will provide a clearer indicator on the use of IMI in Clearfield® rice fields.","[Nasal provocation with increased ASA dose: improved ""non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-exacerbated disease"" (N‑ERD) detection rate in chronic rhinosinusitis patients].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069402,HNO,2019 05 09,Analgesic intolerance (AI) is an important diagnostic feature of disease progression in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) accompanied by nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and asthma.,ApoAI-derived peptide increases glucose tolerance and prevents formation of atherosclerosis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069401,Diabetologia,2019 06 12,"Finding new treatment alternatives for individuals with diabetes with severe insulin resistance is highly desired.

Methods The advisory report was compiled by a multidisciplinary committee of ten scientists appointed by the Health Council of The Netherlands. The committee`s aims were to (i) describe the health of the ageing population, (ii) describe how prolonging working life influences health, (iii) describe determinants, besides health, for prolonging working lives, and (iv) review the literature on interventions aimed at retaining or improving employability of older workers. Results The report was presented to the Minister on 26 June 2018. As the likelihood of health problems increases with age, prolonging working life may be difficult. In general, life expectancy increases and gains in life years and health seem mainly attributable to people aged >75 years. Work is good for mental health. However, it may be beneficial for mental health to stop working around the retirement age. Besides health, financial factors, lifestyle, motivation to work, and working conditions play a role in prolonging working life. A systematic review of the evidence indicated that interventions such as worksite health promotion or career development workshops can support older workers in this matter. Conclusions The Health Council advised the Dutch Government to focus on worksite health promotion and career development interventions as well as the improvement of their implementation. This requires a tailored approach as there is a large diversity in health among older workers and particularly between low- and high-educated people. With this in mind, it was further recommended to explore whether flexible pension schemes might better suit this diversity.",DNA-guided DNA cleavage at moderate temperatures by Clostridium butyricum Argonaute.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069393,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 09,"Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) constitute a diverse group of endonucleases of which some mediate host defense by utilizing small interfering DNA guides (siDNA) to cleave complementary invading DNA. This activity can be repurposed for programmable DNA cleavage. However, currently characterized DNA-cleaving pAgos require elevated temperatures (≥65°C) for their activity, making them less suitable for applications that require moderate temperatures, such as genome editing. Here, we report the functional and structural characterization of the siDNA-guided DNA-targeting pAgo from the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium butyricum (CbAgo). CbAgo displays a preference for siDNAs that have a deoxyadenosine at the 5'-end and thymidines at nucleotides 2-4. Furthermore, CbAgo mediates DNA-guided DNA cleavage of AT-rich double stranded DNA at moderate temperatures (37°C). This study demonstrates that certain pAgos are capable of programmable DNA cleavage at moderate temperatures and thereby expands the scope of the potential pAgo-based applications.",Cognitive Function in Pediatric Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069392,Journal of pediatric psychology,2019 05 09,"Despite surgical palliation, children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have compromised cardiac functioning and increased risk for cognitive deficits.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is associated with the highest mortality and is an indication for emergent reperfusion therapy. Current guidelines for emergent reperfusion not only include ST segment elevations but also consider evidence of a new onset Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB). However, accumulating evidence indicates that RBBB is also associated with poor outcome in coronary artery disease. To-date, guidelines do not comment on the urgency of reperfusion therapy with sole evidence of a new onset Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB). Particularly we question whether clinicians should focus on new-onset RBBB as a ST-segment elevation equivalent. If so, appropriate management of patients with the new onset RBBB during cardiac ischemia can have a significant impact on cardiac function and outcomes. In this series, we present four cases of new-onset acute RBBB associated with chest pain in the setting of acute myocardial infarction with critical lesions of the left anterior descending artery. We also highlight the need to consider new RBBB as an additional indication for acute reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction.

However, the stiffness dependence of calcium flux on neutrophils remains unclear yet. Here, the effect of substrate stiffness by ECs on neutrophils' calcium spike was quantified when the individual neutrophils that adhered to the human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayer were pre-placed onto a stiffness-varied polyacrylamide substrate (5 or 34.88 kPa) or glass surface. Our data indicated that E-/P-selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on HUVECs and β2-integrins, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1), and CD44s on neutrophils were all involved in mediating neutrophil calcium spike in a stiffness-dependent manner, in which the increase in substrate stiffness enhanced the calcium intensity and the oscillation frequency (spike number). Such stiffness-dependent calcium response is associated with the induced selectin related to β2-integrin activation through the Syk/Src signaling pathway, and F-actin/myosin II are also involved in this. Moreover, tension-activated calcium ion channels displayed critical roles in initiating stiffness-dependent calcium spike. These results provide an insight into understanding how the stiffening of vascular walls could regulate the calcium flux of adhered neutrophils, and thus the immune responses in atherosclerosis.","Matrix crosslinking enhances macrophage adhesion, migration, and inflammatory activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069336,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Macrophages are versatile cells of the innate immune system that can adopt a variety of functional phenotypes depending on signals in their environment. In previous work, we found that culture of macrophages on fibrin, the provisional extracellular matrix protein, inhibits their inflammatory activation when compared to cells cultured on polystyrene surfaces. Here, we sought to investigate the role of matrix stiffness in the regulation of macrophage activity by manipulating the mechanical properties of fibrin. We utilize a photo-initiated crosslinking method to introduce dityrosine crosslinks to a fibrin gel and confirm an increase in gel stiffness through active microrheology. We observe that matrix crosslinking elicits distinct changes in macrophage morphology, integrin expression, migration, and inflammatory activation. Macrophages cultured on a stiffer substrate exhibit greater cell spreading and expression of αM integrin. Furthermore, macrophages cultured on crosslinked fibrin exhibit increased motility. Finally, culture of macrophages on photo-crosslinked fibrin enhances their inflammatory activation compared to unmodified fibrin, suggesting that matrix crosslinking regulates the functional activation of macrophages. These findings provide insight into how the physical properties of the extracellular matrix might control macrophage behavior during inflammation and wound healing.",Modulation of adhesion microenvironment using mesh substrates triggers self-organization and primordial germ cell-like differentiation in mouse ES cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069335,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"The cell adhesion microenvironment plays contributory roles in the induction of self-organized tissue formation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, physical factors emanating from the adhesion microenvironment have been less investigated largely in part due to overreliance on biochemical approaches utilizing cytokines to drive in vitro developmental processes. Here, we report that a mesh culture technique can potentially induce mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to self-organize and differentiate into cells expressing key signatures of primordial germ cells (PGCs) even with pluripotency maintained in the culture medium. Intriguingly, mESCs cultured on mesh substrates consisting of thin (5 μm-wide) strands and considerably large (200 μm-wide) openings which were set suspended in order to minimize the cell-substrate adhesion area, self-organized into cell sheets relying solely on cell-cell interactions to fill the large mesh openings by Day 2, and further into dome-shaped features around Day 6. Characterization using microarray analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that sheet-forming cells exhibited differential gene expressions related to PGCs as early as Day 2, but not other lineages such as epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm, implying that the initial interaction with the mesh microenvironment and subsequent self-organization into cells sheets might have triggered PGC-like differentiation to occur differently from the previously reported pathway via epiblast-like differentiation. Overall, considering that the observed differentiation occurred without addition of known biochemical inducers, this study highlights that bioengineering techniques for modulating the adhesion microenvironment alone can be harnessed to coax PSCs to self-organize and differentiate, in this case, to a PGC-like state.",Tunable synthetic extracellular matrices to investigate breast cancer response to biophysical and biochemical cues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069334,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is thought to play a critical role in the progression of breast cancer. In this work, we have designed a photopolymerizable, biomimetic synthetic matrix for the controlled, 3D culture of breast cancer cells and, in combination with imaging and bioinformatics tools, utilized this system to investigate the breast cancer cell response to different matrix cues. Specifically, hydrogel-based matrices of different densities and modified with receptor-binding peptides derived from ECM proteins [fibronectin/vitronectin (RGDS), collagen (GFOGER), and laminin (IKVAV)] were synthesized to mimic key aspects of the ECM of different soft tissue sites. To assess the breast cancer cell response, the morphology and growth of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and T47D) were monitored in three dimensions over time, and differences in their transcriptome were assayed using next generation sequencing. We observed increased growth in response to GFOGER and RGDS, whether individually or in combination with IKVAV, where binding of integrin β1 was key. Importantly, in matrices with GFOGER, increased growth was observed with increasing matrix density for MDA-MB-231s. Further, transcriptomic analyses revealed increased gene expression and enrichment of biological processes associated with cell-matrix interactions, proliferation, and motility in matrices rich in GFOGER relative to IKVAV. In sum, a new approach for investigating breast cancer cell-matrix interactions was established with insights into how microenvironments rich in collagen promote breast cancer growth, a hallmark of disease progression in vivo, with opportunities for future investigations that harness the multidimensional property control afforded by this photopolymerizable system.","Challenges and opportunities in exosome research-Perspectives from biology, engineering, and cancer therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069333,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Exosomes are small (∼30-140 nm) lipid bilayer-enclosed particles of endosomal origin. They are a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are secreted by most cell types. There has been growing interest in exosome research in the last decade due to their emerging role as intercellular messengers and their potential in disease diagnosis. Indeed, exosomes contain proteins, lipids, and RNAs that are specific to their cell origin and could deliver cargo to both nearby and distant cells. As a result, investigation of exosome cargo contents could offer opportunities for disease detection and treatment. Moreover, exosomes have been explored as natural drug delivery vehicles since they can travel safely in extracellular fluids and deliver cargo to destined cells with high specificity and efficiency. Despite significant efforts made in this relatively new field of research, progress has been held back by challenges such as inefficient separation methods, difficulties in characterization, and lack of specific biomarkers. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in exosome biogenesis, their roles in disease progression, and therapeutic applications and opportunities in bioengineering.

Whilst large numbers of cardiomyocytes can be generated from hPSCs, extensive characterization has revealed that they have immature cardiac properties. This has raised potential concerns over their usefulness for many applications and has led to the pursuit of driving maturation of hPSC-cardiomyocytes. Currently, the best approach for driving maturity is the use of tissue engineering to generate highly functional three-dimensional heart tissue. Although we have made significant progress in this area, we have still not generated heart tissue that fully recapitulates all the properties of an adult heart. Deciphering the processes driving cardiomyocyte maturation will be instrumental in uncovering the mechanisms that govern optimal heart function and identifying new therapeutic targets for heart disease."

Advancement of methods to characterize cell deformability in a high throughput manner and the capacity to process numerous samples can impact cancer-related applications ranging from analysis of patient samples to discovery of anti-cancer compounds to screening of oncogenes. In this study, we report a microfluidic technique called multi-sample deformability cytometry (MS-DC) that allows simultaneous measurement of flow-induced deformation of cells in multiple samples at single-cell resolution using a combination of on-chip reservoirs, distributed pressure control, and data analysis system. Cells are introduced at rates of O(100) cells per second with a data processing speed of 10 min per sample. To validate MS-DC, we tested more than 50 cell-samples that include cancer cell lines with different metastatic potential and cells treated with several cytoskeletal-intervention drugs. Results from MS-DC show that (i) the cell deformability correlates with metastatic potential for both breast and prostate cancer cells but not with their molecular histotype, (ii) the strongly metastatic breast cancer cells have higher deformability than the weakly metastatic ones; however, the strongly metastatic prostate cancer cells have lower deformability than the weakly metastatic counterparts, and (iii) drug-induced disruption of the actin network, microtubule network, and actomyosin contractility increased cancer cell deformability, but stabilization of the cytoskeletal proteins does not alter deformability significantly.

We discovered that inducing expression of a gain-of-function G22S mutant of MscL in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced spontaneous lung metastasis without affecting the growth of orthotopic tumor implants. To further investigate the effects of G22S MscL on cell migration, we designed a microfluidic device with channels of various cross-sections ranging from a 2D planar environment to narrow 3D constrictions. Both MscL G22S and control breast cancer cells migrated progressively slower in more constricted environments. Migration of cells expressing MscL G22S did not differ from control cells, even though MscL was activated in cells in constricted channels of 3 μm width. Interestingly, we found MscL expressing cells to be more frequently ""stuck"" at the entrance of the 3 μm channels and failed to migrate into the microchannel. Our work demonstrates the possibility of engineering mechanotransduction for controlling confined cell migration.","Interconnected feedback loops among ESRP1, HAS2, and CD44 regulate epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069317,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Aberrant activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma cells contributes to increased migration and invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor-initiating capacity. EMT is not always a binary process; rather, cells may exhibit a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. ZEB1-a key transcription factor driving EMT-can both induce and maintain a mesenchymal phenotype. Recent studies have identified two novel autocrine feedback loops utilizing epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1), hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (HAS2), and CD44 which maintain high levels of ZEB1. However, how the crosstalk between these feedback loops alters the dynamics of epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transition remains elusive. Here, using an integrated theoretical-experimental framework, we identify that these feedback loops can enable cells to stably maintain a hybrid E/M phenotype. Moreover, computational analysis identifies the regulation of ESRP1 as a crucial node, a prediction that is validated by experiments showing that knockdown of ESRP1 in stable hybrid E/M H1975 cells drives EMT. Finally, in multiple breast cancer datasets, high levels of ESRP1, ESRP1/HAS2, and ESRP1/ZEB1 correlate with poor prognosis, supporting the relevance of ZEB1/ESRP1 and ZEB1/HAS2 axes in tumor progression. Together, our results unravel how these interconnected feedback loops act in concert to regulate ZEB1 levels and to drive the dynamics of epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transition.",Breast tumor cell hybrids form spontaneously in vivo and contribute to breast tumor metastases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069316,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Cancer cell fusion was suggested as a mechanism of metastasis about a century ago. Since then, many additional modes of material transfer (i.e., tunneling nanotubes, and exosomes) to generate cell hybrids have been identified. However, studies documenting spontaneous tumor hybrid formation in vivo as a mechanism that enables metastasis are still lacking. Here, we tested whether spontaneous hybrid formation in vivo contributes to bona fide metastatic tumors. We first used single cell RNASeq to analyze the gene expression profile of spontaneously formed cancer cell-stromal hybrids, and results revealed that hybrids exhibit a clustering pattern that is distinct from either parental cell and suggestive of substantial diversity of individual hybrids. Despite the newly gained diversity, hybrids can retain expression of critical genes of each parental cell. To assess the biological impact of cancer cell hybrids in vivo, we transfected murine mammary tumor cells, isolated from FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J mice (PyVT) with Cre recombinase prior to injection to the murine fat pad of FVB.129S6(B6)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(Luc)Kael /J mice such that luciferase expression is induced with hybrid formation; luciferase expression was tracked for up to four months. We observed that hybrid formation occurs spontaneously in vivo and that a significantly higher number of hybrids reside in metastases compared to the primary tumor, supporting the possibility that hybrids can emerge from the primary tumor and proliferate to help create a new tumor at a distant site. Additional studies are now warranted to delineate the mechanisms of cancer cell hybrid transit to metastases since drugs to inhibit hybrid formation might prevent metastatic spread.",Epithelial vertex models with active biochemical regulation of contractility can explain organized collective cell motility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069315,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Collective motions of groups of cells are observed in many biological settings such as embryo development, tissue formation, and cancer metastasis. To effectively model collective cell movement, it is important to incorporate cell specific features such as cell size, cell shape, and cell mechanics, as well as active behavior of cells such as protrusion and force generation, contractile forces, and active biochemical signaling mechanisms that regulate cell behavior. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive model of collective cell migration in confluent epithelia based on the vertex modeling approach. We develop a method to compute cell-cell viscous friction based on the vertex model and incorporate RhoGTPase regulation of cortical myosin contraction. Global features of collective cell migration are examined by computing the spatial velocity correlation function. As active cell force parameters are varied, we found rich dynamical behavior. Furthermore, we find that cells exhibit nonlinear phenomena such as contractile waves and vortex formation. Together our work highlights the importance of active behavior of cells in generating collective cell movement. The vertex modeling approach is an efficient and versatile approach to rigorously examine cell motion in the epithelium.",Clinical doses of radiation reduce collagen matrix stiffness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069314,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Cells receive mechanical cues from their extracellular matrix (ECM), which direct migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and in some cases, the transition to a cancerous phenotype. As a result, there has been significant research to develop methods to tune the mechanical properties of the ECM and understand cell-ECM dynamics more deeply. Here, we show that ionizing radiation can reduce the stiffness of an ex vivo tumor and an in vitro collagen matrix. When non-irradiated cancer cells were seeded in the irradiated matrix, adhesion, spreading, and migration were reduced. These data have ramifications for both in vitro and in vivo systems. In vitro, these data suggest that irradiation may be a method that could be used to create matrices with tailored mechanical properties. In vivo, these suggest that therapeutic doses of radiation may alter tissue mechanics directly.",Perspective: Biophysical regulation of cancerous and normal blood cell lineages in hematopoietic malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069313,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"It is increasingly appreciated that physical forces play important roles in cancer biology, in terms of progression, invasiveness, and drug resistance. Clinical progress in treating hematological malignancy and in developing cancer immunotherapy highlights the role of the hematopoietic system as a key model in devising new therapeutic strategies against cancer. Understanding mechanobiology of the hematopoietic system in the context of cancer will thus yield valuable fundamental insights that can information about novel cancer therapeutics. In this perspective, biophysical insights related to blood cancer are defined and detailed. The interactions with immune cells relevant to immunotherapy against cancer are considered and expounded, followed by speculation of potential regulatory roles of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in this complex network. Finally, a perspective is presented as to how insights from these complex interactions between matrices, blood cancer cells, immune cells, and MSCs can be leveraged to influence and engineer the treatment of blood cancers in the clinic.",Perspective: The role of mechanobiology in the etiology of brain metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069312,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Tumor latency and dormancy are obstacles to effective cancer treatment. In brain metastases, emergence of a lesion can occur at varying intervals from diagnosis and in some cases following successful treatment of the primary tumor. Genetic factors that drive brain metastases have been identified, such as those involved in cell adhesion, signaling, extravasation, and metabolism. From this wealth of knowledge, vexing questions still remain; why is there a difference in strategy to facilitate outgrowth and why is there a difference in latency? One missing link may be the role of tissue biophysics of the brain microenvironment in infiltrating cells. Here, I discuss the mechanical cues that may influence disseminated tumor cells in the brain, as a function of age and disease. I further discuss in vitro and in vivo preclinical models such as 3D culture systems and zebrafish to study the role of the mechanical environment in brain metastasis in an effort of providing novel targeted therapeutics.",Review: Mechanotransduction in ovarian cancer: Shearing into the unknown.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069311,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Ovarian cancer remains a deadly diagnosis with an 85% recurrence rate and a 5-year survival rate of only 46%. The poor outlook of this disease has improved little over the past 50 years owing to the lack of early detection, chemoresistance and the complex tumor microenvironment. Within the peritoneal cavity, the presence of ascites stimulates ovarian tumors with shear stresses. The stiff environment found within the tumor extracellular matrix and the peritoneal membrane are also implicated in the metastatic potential and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ovarian cancer. Though these mechanical cues remain highly relevant to the understanding and treatment of ovarian cancers, our current knowledge of their biological processes and their clinical relevance is deeply lacking. Seminal studies on ovarian cancer mechanotransduction have demonstrated close ties between mechanotransduction and ovarian cancer chemoresistance, EMT, enhanced cancer stem cell populations, and metastasis. This review summarizes our current understanding of ovarian cancer mechanotransduction and the gaps in knowledge that exist. Future investigations on ovarian cancer mechanotransduction will greatly improve clinical outcomes via systematic studies that determine shear stress magnitude and its influence on ovarian cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment.",Rationally engineered advances in cancer research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069310,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"The physical and engineering sciences have much to offer in understanding, diagnosing, and even treating cancer. Microfluidics, imaging, materials, and diverse measurement devices are all helping to shift paradigms of tumorigenesis and dissemination. Using materials and micro-probes of elasticity, for example, epithelia have been shown to transform into mesenchymal cells when the elasticity of adjacent tissue increases. Approaches common in engineering science enable such discoveries, and further application of such tools and principles will likely improve existing cancer models in vivo and also create better models for high throughput analyses in vitro. As profiled in this special topic issue composed of more than a dozen manuscripts, opportunities abound for the creativity and analytics of engineering and the physical sciences to make advances in and against cancer."

The two effects are inextricably linked, particularly in traumatic brain injury or stroke, where permanent dysfunction is often observed. Chronic brain inflammation is a key barrier to regeneration. This is considered a toxic, growth inhibitory mechanism; yet, the inflammatory response must also be considered as a mechanism that can be exploited as protective and reparative. Repurposing this complex response is the challenge for tissue engineers: to design treatments to repair and regenerate damaged tissue after brain insult. Astrocytes are important cells within the CNS which play a key role after traumatic brain injury. A comprehensive understanding of their functions-both cytotrophic and cytotoxic-will enable designed materials and drug delivery approaches for improved treatment options post traumatic injury. Understanding, evaluating, and designing biomaterials that match the healthy neural environment to temporally alter the inflammatory cascade represent a promise neural tissue engineering strategy to optimise repair and regeneration after injury.",Perspective: Engineering noise in biological systems towards predictive stochastic design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069294,APL bioengineering,2019 05 12,"Significant progress has been made towards engineering both single-cell and multi-cellular systems through a combination of synthetic and systems biology, nanobiotechnology, pharmaceutical science, and computational approaches. However, our ability to engineer systems that begin to approach the complexity of natural pathways is severely limited by important challenges, e.g. due to noise, or the fluctuations in gene expression and molecular species at multiple scales (e.g. both intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations). This barrier to engineering requires that biological noise be recognized as a design element with fundamentals that can be actively controlled. Here we highlight studies of an emerging discipline that collectively strives to engineer noise towards predictive stochastic design using interdisciplinary approaches at multiple-scales in diverse living systems.","Adrenal Hypercortisolism: A Closer Look at Screening, Diagnosis, and Important Considerations of Different Testing Modalities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069279,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 05 12,"Although prolonged hypercortisolism is associated with increased mortality and substantial morbidity, the clinical signs and symptoms are wide ranging and often nonspecific, contributing to challenges in diagnosis, as well as treatment delays. Greater awareness is needed among clinicians to help identify which patients should undergo biochemical screening for excess cortisol. Several biochemical tests are available, each with important caveats that should be considered in the context of the individual patient. Cortisol secretion varies widely, further complicating the biochemical diagnosis of hypercortisolism, which relies on the use of definitive cutoff values. Patients with hypercortisolism resulting from adrenal adenomas, including those discovered incidentally, often do not present with overt Cushingoid features (plethora, striae, muscle weakness, moon facies, etc.). However, the consequences of prolonged exposure to even slight elevations in cortisol levels are profound, including increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, fractures, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Because most cases of hypercortisolism resulting from an adrenal adenoma can be managed, it is imperative to identify patients at risk and initiate testing early for the best outcomes. The aim of this report is to increase awareness of the indications for screening for hypercortisolism and to review the biochemical screening tests and diagnosis for hypercortisolism associated with adrenal adenomas.",A Retrospective Study of Early vs Delayed Home Dose Basal Insulin in the Acute Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069278,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 05 12,"Insulin via continuous intravenous infusion (ICII) is a standard of care for treating patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

We conducted surveys of highly mobile fauna (fishes) on artificial habitats (reefs) on the southeastern USA continental shelf to test whether, in comparison to natural reefs, artificial reefs enhance local abundance and biomass of fishes at their poleward range margins. Here, we show that while temperate fishes were more abundant on natural reefs, tropical, and subtropical fishes exhibited higher abundances and biomasses on deep (25-35 m) artificial reefs. Further analyses reveal that this effect depended on feeding guilds because planktivorous and piscivorous but not herbivorous fishes were more abundant on artificial reefs. This is potentially due to heightened prey availability on and structural complexity of artificial reefs. Our findings demonstrate that artificial habitats can facilitate highly mobile species at range edges and suggest these habitats assist poleward species movement.",Quantile regression analysis reveals widespread evidence for gene-environment or gene-gene interactions in myopia development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069276,Communications biology,2019 05 12,"A genetic contribution to refractive error has been confirmed by the discovery of more than 150 associated variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Environmental factors such as education and time outdoors also demonstrate strong associations. Currently however, the extent of gene-environment or gene-gene interactions in myopia is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that refractive error-associated variants exhibit effect size heterogeneity, a hallmark feature of genetic interactions. Of 146 variants tested, evidence of non-uniform, non-linear effects were observed for 66 (45%) at Bonferroni-corrected significance (P < 1.1 × 10-4) and 128 (88%) at nominal significance (P < 0.05). LAMA2 variant rs12193446, for example, had an effect size varying from -0.20 diopters (95% CI -0.18 to -0.23) to -0.89 diopters (95% CI -0.71 to -1.07) in different individuals. SNP effects were strongest at the phenotype extremes and weaker in emmetropes. A parsimonious explanation for these findings is that gene-environment or gene-gene interactions in myopia are pervasive.",Pharmacological systems analysis defines EIF4A3 functions in cell-cycle and RNA stress granule formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069274,Communications biology,2019 05 12,"The RNA helicase EIF4A3 regulates the exon junction complex and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay functions in RNA transcript processing. However, a transcriptome-wide network definition of these functions has been lacking, in part due to the lack of suitable pharmacological inhibitors. Here we employ short-duration graded EIF4A3 inhibition using small molecule allosteric inhibitors to define the transcriptome-wide dependencies of EIF4A3. We thus define conserved cellular functions, such as cell cycle control, that are EIF4A3 dependent. We show that EIF4A3-dependent splicing reactions have a distinct genome-wide pattern of associated RNA-binding protein motifs. We also uncover an unanticipated role of EIF4A3 in the biology of RNA stress granules, which sequester and silence the translation of most mRNAs under stress conditions and are implicated in cell survival and tumour progression. We show that stress granule induction and maintenance is suppressed on the inhibition of EIF4A3, in part through EIF4A3-associated regulation of G3BP1 and TIA1 scaffold protein expression.",Amiskwia is a large Cambrian gnathiferan with complex gnathostomulid-like jaws.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069273,Communications biology,2019 05 12,"Phylogenomic studies have greatly improved our understanding of the animal tree of life but the relationships of many clades remain ambiguous. Here we show that the rare soft-bodied animal Amiskwia from the Cambrian of Canada and China, which has variously been considered a chaetognath, a nemertine, allied to molluscs, or a problematica, is related to gnathiferans. New specimens from the Burgess Shale (British Columbia, Canada) preserve a complex pharyngeal jaw apparatus composed of a pair of elements with teeth most similar to gnathostomulids. Amiskwia demonstrates that primitive spiralians were large and unsegmented, had a coelom, and were probably active nekto-benthic scavengers or predators. Secondary simplification and miniaturisation events likely occurred in response to shifting ecologies and adaptations to specialised planktonic habitats.",Structural and biochemical analyses of the nuclear pore complex component ELYS identify residues responsible for nucleosome binding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069272,Communications biology,2019 05 12,"The nuclear pore complex embedded within the nuclear envelope is the essential architecture for trafficking macromolecules, such as proteins and RNAs, between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The nuclear pore complex assembly occurs on chromatin in the post-mitotic phase of the cell cycle. ELYS (MEL-28/AHCTF1) binds to the nucleosome, which is the basic chromatin unit, and promotes assembly of the complex around the chromosomes in cells. Here we show that the Arg-Arg-Lys (RRK) stretch of the C-terminal ELYS region plays an essential role in the nucleosome binding. The cryo-EM structure and the crosslinking mass spectrometry reveal that the ELYS C-terminal region directly binds to the acidic patch of the nucleosome. These results provide mechanistic insight into the ELYS-nucleosome interaction, which promotes the post-mitotic nuclear pore complex formation around chromosomes in cells.",P38 inhibition reverses TGFβ1 and TNFα-induced contraction in a model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069271,Communications biology,2019 05 12,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a metaplasia in the vitreous of the eye manifested by the transformation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and the development of contracting epiretinal membranes (ERM), which lead to retinal detachment and vision loss. While TGFβ1 and TNFα have been associated with PVR, here we show that these cytokines act synergistically to induce an aggressive contraction phenotype on adult human (ah)RPE. Connected RPE detach upon contraction and form motile membranes that recruit more cells. TGFβ1 and TNFα (TNT)-induced contracting membranes uniquely express muscle and extracellular rearrangement genes. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing of patient-dissected PVR membranes showed activation of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway. Inhibition of p38 during TNT treatment blocks ahRPE transformation and membrane contraction. Furthermore, TNT-induced membrane contractility can be reversed by p38 inhibition after induction. Therefore, targeting the p38-MAPK pathway may have therapeutic benefits for patients with PVR even after the onset of contracting ERMs."

A decrease of sleep quantity preflight and on the International Space Station (ISS) has been reported. Recent counter-measures have been implemented to better regulate sleep opportunities on ISS. In our study, astronauts were allocated enough time for sleep the night before the recordings. However, for proper sleep recovery, the quality of sleep is also critical. Unfortunately, data on sleep quality have yet to be acquired from the ISS. Here, we investigate sleep pressure markers during wakefulness in five astronauts throughout their 6-month space mission by the mean of electroencephalographic recordings. We show a global increase of theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) on the ISS compared to on Earth before the mission. We also show that local sleep-like events, another marker of sleep pressure, are more global in space (p < 0.001). By analysing the performances of the astronauts during a docking simulation, we found that local sleep-like events are more global when reaction times are slower (R2 = 0.03, p = 0.006) and there is an increase of reaction times above 244 ms after 2 months in space (p = 0.012).

Twenty-seven patients with iRBD in addition to patients with de novo PD and healthy controls were included from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Patients with iRBD were followed for up to 3 years. Clinical and MRI measures were compared across groups and the association between clinical features and structural MRI was assessed in iRBD patients. Cox regression analyses were applied to identify risk factors for progressing to a Lewy body disease in iRBD. Our results showed that, at baseline, iRBD patients showed parietal and occipital cortical thinning, compared to controls. They also showed worse motor and non-motor abilities, some of which correlated with motor, frontal or temporal cortical thinning. At follow-up, six (22%) iRBD patients were diagnosed with a Lewy body disorder. These patients showed cortical thinning in frontal, occipital and parietal areas compared to iRBD non-converters. Cortical thinning was a significant predictor for future development of a Lewy body disorder (HR: 0.784; 95% CI: 0.640-0.960; p = 0.02). We conclude that cortical thinning is associated with worse motor and non-motor abilities, and predicts conversion to a Lewy body disorder in iRBD, suggesting it could be used to select candidates for clinical trials to delay the onset of neurodegenerative disease.",Validation of Risk Stratification Criteria to Identify Febrile Neonates at Low Risk of Serious Bacterial Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069251,Global pediatric health,2019 05 12,"Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of risk stratification criteria for febrile neonates in the emergency department.

A 12-week longitudinal pretest/posttest design was used to assess physical activity, engagement in an online support group, self-efficacy, and QOL. A postintervention questionnaire was used to capture the participants' (n = 5) experience using the physical activity tracker and an electronic tablet to engage in an online support group. The sample size of this feasibility study precluded robust quantitative analysis of QOL or self-efficacy. Findings from the open-ended questionnaire suggest technology was challenging for most participants, yet it did provide social support. Teaching effective interventions to promote self-management for increasing physical activity, and consequently improving QOL, is recommended.

A deductive-inductive approach was taken while coding and analyzing, N = 18 participant narratives concerning the psychological and coping processes surrounding diagnosis and engagement in care. Active behavioral and cognitive coping after diagnosis was exhibited by PLWH expressing salient attributes of positive affect, whereas the salience of negative affect among PLWH was associated with avoidant coping and heightened distress.

Increasing primary care practices' adoption of ""comprehensive primary care"" capabilities might yield meaningful improvements in the quality and efficiency of primary care. However, many comprehensive primary care capabilities, such as care management and coordination, are not compensated via traditional fee-for-service payment. To calculate new payments for these capabilities, policymakers would need estimates of the costs that practices incur when adopting, maintaining, and using the capabilities. We performed a narrative review of the existing literature on the costs of adopting and implementing comprehensive primary care capabilities. These studies have found that practices incur significant costs when adopting and implementing comprehensive primary care capabilities. However, the studies had significant limitations that prevent extensive use of their estimates for payment policy. Particularly, the strongest studies focused on a small numbers of practices in specific geographic areas and the concepts and methods used to assess costs varied greatly across the studies. Furthermore, none of the studies in our review attempted to estimate differences in costs across practices with patients at varying levels of complexity and illness burden which is important for risk-adjusting payments to practices. Therefore, due to the heterogeneous designs and limited generalizability of published studies highlight the need for additional research, especially if payers wish to link their financial support for comprehensive primary care capabilities to the costs of these capabilities for primary care practices.",Visualizing Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Intercellular Mechanotransmission upon Wounding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069245,ACS photonics,2019 05 12,"During cell-to-cell communications, the interplay between physical and biochemical cues is essential for informational exchange and functional coordination, especially in multicellular organisms. However, it remains a challenge to visualize intercellular signaling dynamics in single live cells. Here, we report a photonic approach, based on laser microscissors and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, to study intercellular signaling transmission. First, using our high-throughput screening platform, we developed a highly sensitive FRET-based biosensor (SCAGE) for Src kinase, a key regulator of intercellular interactions and signaling cascades. Notably, SCAGE showed a more than 40-fold sensitivity enhancement than the original biosensor in live mammalian cells. Next, upon local severance of physical intercellular connections by femtosecond laser pulses, SCAGE enabled the visualization of a transient Src activation across neighboring cells. Lastly, we found that this observed transient Src activation following the loss of cell-cell contacts depends on the passive structural support of cytoskeleton but not on the active actomyosin contractility. Hence, by precisely introducing local physical perturbations and directly visualizing spatiotemporal transmission of ensuing signaling events, our integrated approach could be broadly applied to mimic and investigate the wounding process at single-cell resolutions. This integrated approach with highly sensitive FRET-based biosensors provides a unique system to advance our in-depth understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the physical-biochemical basis of intercellular coupling and wounding processes.",Diagnostic Performance of T2Candida Among ICU Patients With Risk Factors for Invasive Candidiasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069244,Open forum infectious diseases,2019 05 12,"Invasive candidiasis (IC) comprises candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis.

Homocysteine (HCys) is a key metabolite involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of methionine (Met), which plays a pivotal role in the physiological cell's life cycle. The biochemistry of Met is finely regulated by several enzymes that control HCys concentration. Indeed, balanced activity among the enzymes is essential for the cell's well-being, while its malfunction could raise HCys concentration which can lead to the onset of several pathological conditions. The HCys concentration increase seems to be caused mainly by the widely diffused polymorphisms of several enzymes. Nowadays, a blood test can easily detect elevated concentrations of HCys, referred to as Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCys). Prolonged exposure to this condition can lead to the onset of cardiovascular disease and can lead to the development of atherosclerosis, stroke, inflammatory syndromes like osteoporosis and rheumatism, as well as neuronal pathologies including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this review, we analyzed the literature of several pathological conditions in which the molecular pathways of HHCys are involved. Interestingly, several observations indicate that the calibrated assumption of correct doses of vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and betaine may control HHCys-related conditions.",Paroxysmal Permeability Disorders: Development of a Microfluidic Device to Assess Endothelial Barrier Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069229,Frontiers in medicine,2019 05 12,"Background: Paroxysmal Permeability Disorders (PPDs) are pathological conditions caused by periodic short lasting increase of endothelial permeability, in the absence of inflammatory, degenerative, ischemic vascular injury. PPDs include primary angioedema, idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome and some rare forms of localized retroperitoneal-mediastinal edema. Aim: to validate a microfluidic device to study endothelial permeability in flow conditions. Materials and Methods: we designed a microchannel network (the smallest channel is 30μm square section). Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were cultured under constant shear stress in the networks. Endothelial permeability assessment was based on interaction of biotinylated fibronectin used as a matrix for HUVECs and FITC-conjugated avidin. The increase in endothelial permeability was identified as changes in fluorescence intensity detected by confocal fluorescent microscopy. Results: The microchannels were constantly perfused with a steady flow of culture medium, ensuring a physiologically relevant level of shear stress at the wall of ~0.2 Pa. Our preliminary results demonstrated that circulation of culture medium or plasma from healthy volunteers was associated with low fluorescence of fibronectin matrix. When bradykinin diluted in culture medium was perfused, an increase in average fluorescence was detected. Conclusion: Our microvasculature model is suitable to study endothelial functions in physiological flow conditions and in the presence of factors like bradykinin known as mediator of several PPDs. Therefore, it can be a promising tool to better understand the mechanisms underlying disorders of endothelial permeability.",Geospatial Correlation of Amyopathic Dermatomyositis With Fixed Sources of Airborne Pollution: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069228,Frontiers in medicine,2019 05 12,"Objective: Dermatomyositis (DM) may result from exogenous triggers, including airborne pollutants, in genetically susceptible individuals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2011 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) models health risks associated with airborne emissions, available by ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA). Important contributors include point (fixed), on-road, and secondary sources. The objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial distributions of DM and subtypes, classic DM (CDM) and clinically amyopathic DM (CADM), and their associations with airborne pollutants. Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified 642 adult DM patients from 336 unique ZCTAs. GeoDa v.1.10 was used to calculate global and local Moran's indices and generate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) maps. All Moran's indices and LISA maps were permuted 999 times. Results: Univariate global Moran's indices for DM, CDM, and CADM prevalence were not significant, but LISA maps demonstrated differential local spatial clustering and outliers. CADM prevalence correlated with point sources (bivariate global Moran's index 0.071, pseudo-p = 0.018), in contrast to CDM (-0.0053, pseudo-p = 0.46). Bivariate global Moran's indices for DM, CDM, and CADM prevalence did not correlate with other airborne toxics, but bivariate LISA maps revealed local spatial clustering and outliers. Conclusion: Prevalence of CADM, but not CDM, is geospatially correlated with fixed sources of airborne emissions. This effect is small but significant and may support the hypothesis that triggering exposures influence disease phenotype. Important limitations are NATA data and ZCTA population estimates were collected from 2011 and ZCTA of residence may not have been where patients had greatest airborne pollutant exposure.",Patient Preference Studies During Early Drug Development: Aligning Stakeholders to Ensure Development Plans Meet Patient Needs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069227,Frontiers in medicine,2019 05 12,"Although patient preferences have been studied broadly for marketed products or around the time of submission to authorities and launch, patient preference studies have rarely been used during the early drug development phases. In this paper, we formulate three hypotheses supporting the use of patient preference studies in early product development: (1) integration of the patient perspective into the development process from phase 1 onwards will result in healthcare solutions with outcomes that best address patients' needs; (2) a structured process to build patient-based evidence involving partnerships between patients and other key stakeholders will improve alignment of development activities with the needs of patients; (3) quantitative patient preference research built on robust qualitative insights is necessary to strengthen development decisions in the interests of patients. To illustrate such a structured process, we describe qualitative insights research (social media analysis and online bulletin boards) and quantitative patient preference studies in dry eye disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis conducted during early product development by a pharmaceutical company to generate patient-based evidence. The outputs from such early patient preference studies are being used to inform patient reported outcome strategies, clinical development strategies, product design and delivery features, and form the basis for early dialog with regulators, health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and payers to ensure focus and alignment on patient-relevant endpoints. Furthermore, to discuss and theoretically substantiate our hypotheses, we review how different groups and organizations are working to embrace fully the patient perspective in product development and healthcare decision-making. The hypotheses are commensurate with the general trend toward patient-centered healthcare and the activities initiated by regulators, HTA agencies, and patient organizations. We advocate that all healthcare players should actively contribute to aligning on best practices concerning choice of methodologies and engage in multi-stakeholder dialog along the entire product development chain, to realize health technologies that best meet the needs of patients.","Death Receptor Interactions With the Mitochondrial Cell Death Pathway During Immune Cell-, Drug- and Toxin-Induced Liver Damage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069226,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 05 12,"Due to its extensive vascularization and physiological function as a filter and storage organ, the liver is constantly exposed to infectious and tumorigenic threat, as well as damaging actions of xenobiotics. Detoxification reactions are essential for the excretion of harmful substances, but harbor also the risk of ""side effects"" leading to dangerous metabolites of otherwise harmless substances, a well known effect during paracetamol overdose. These drugs can have detrimental effects, which often involves the induction of sterile inflammation and activation of the immune system. Therefore, the role of certain immune cells and their effector molecules in the regulation of drug-induced liver damage are of special interest. Hepatocytes are type II cells, and death receptor (DR)-induced cell death (CD) requires amplification via the mitochondrial pathway. However, this important role of the mitochondria and associated CD-regulating signaling complexes appears to be not restricted to DR signaling, but to extend to drug-induced activation of mitochondrial CD pathways. We here discuss the role of members of the TNF family, with a focus on TRAIL, and their interactions with the Bcl-2 family in the crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic CD pathway during xenobiotic-induced liver damage.",Neuronal Polarity: Positive and Negative Feedback Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069225,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 05 12,"Establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity are critical for neuronal development and function. One of the fundamental questions in neurodevelopment is how neurons generate only one axon and several dendrites from multiple minor neurites. Over the past few decades, molecular and cell biological approaches have unveiled a large number of signaling networks regulating neuronal polarity in cultured hippocampal neurons and the developing cortex. Emerging evidence reveals that positive and negative feedback signals play a crucial role in axon and dendrite specification. Positive feedback signals are continuously activated in one of minor neurites and result in axon specification and elongation, whereas negative feedback signals are propagated from a nascent axon terminal to all minor neurites and inhibit the formation of multiple axon, thereby leading to dendrite specification, and maintaining neuronal polarity. This current insight provides a holistic picture of the signaling mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization during neuronal development. Here, our review highlights recent advancements in this fascinating field, with a focus on the positive, and negative feedback signals as key regulatory mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization.","Neuronal Migration Generates New Populations of Neurons That Develop Unique Connections, Physiological Properties and Pathologies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069224,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 05 12,"Central nervous system neurons become postmitotic when radial glia cells divide to form neuroblasts. Neuroblasts may migrate away from the ventricle radially along glia fibers, in various directions or even across the midline. We present four cases of unusual migration that are variably connected to either pathology or formation of new populations of neurons with new connectivities. One of the best-known cases of radial migration involves granule cells that migrate from the external granule cell layer along radial Bergman glia fibers to become mature internal granule cells. In various medulloblastoma cases this migration does not occur and transforms the external granule cell layer into a rapidly growing tumor. Among the ocular motor neurons is one unique population that undergoes a contralateral migration and uniquely innervates the superior rectus and levator palpebrae muscles. In humans, a mutation of a single gene ubiquitously expressed in all cells, induces innervation defects only in this unique motor neuron population, leading to inability to elevate eyes or upper eyelids. One of the best-known cases for longitudinal migration is the facial branchial motor (FBM) neurons and the overlapping inner ear efferent population. We describe here molecular cues that are needed for the caudal migration of FBM to segregate these motor neurons from the differently migrating inner ear efferent population. Finally, we describe unusual migration of inner ear spiral ganglion neurons that result in aberrant connections with disruption of frequency presentation. Combined, these data identify unique migratory properties of various neuronal populations that allow them to adopt new connections but also sets them up for unique pathologies.",Glucocorticoids Target Ependymal Glia and Inhibit Repair of the Injured Spinal Cord.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069223,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 05 12,"Following injury, the mammalian spinal cord forms a glial scar and fails to regenerate. In contrast, vertebrate fish spinal cord tissue regenerates significantly to restore function. Cord transection in zebrafish (Danio rerio) initially causes paralysis and neural cell death. Subsequently, ependymal glia proliferate, bipolar glia extend across the lesion, and new neurons are born; axons from spared and nascent neurons extend along trans-lesional glial bridges to restore functional connectivity. Here we report that glucocorticoids, used in the clinical management of spinal cord injury, directly inhibit neural repair by targeting ependymal glia independently of hematogenous cells and microglia. After transecting injury, the glucocorticoid receptor in ependymal glia is regulated differentially in zebrafish (becoming inactive) vs. the rat (becoming active). Glucocorticoid blockade of neural regeneration via a direct effect on ependymal glia has important therapeutic implications for the putative benefit of corticosteroids in early management of spinal cord injury.",Divide or Commit - Revisiting the Role of Cell Cycle Regulators in Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069222,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 05 12,"The adult dentate gyrus continuously generates new neurons that endow the brain with increased plasticity, helping to cope with changing environmental and cognitive demands. The process leading to the birth of new neurons spans several precursor stages and is the result of a coordinated series of fate decisions, which are tightly controlled by extrinsic signals. Many of these signals act through modulation of cell cycle (CC) components, not only to drive proliferation, but also for linage commitment and differentiation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on key CC components and regulators, with emphasis on G1 phase, and analyze their specific functions in precursor cells of the adult hippocampus. We explore their role for balancing quiescence versus self-renewal, which is essential to maintain a lifelong pool of neural stem cells while producing new neurons ""on demand."" Finally, we discuss available evidence and controversies on the impact of CC/G1 length on proliferation versus differentiation decisions.","Next Steps for Access to Safe, Secure DNA Synthesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069221,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 05 12,"The DNA synthesis industry has, since the invention of gene-length synthesis, worked proactively to ensure synthesis is carried out securely and safely.

Taken together, these practices ensure that synthetic DNA is used to advance research that is designed and intended for public benefit. With increasing scale in the industry and expanding capability in the synthetic biology toolset, it is worth revisiting current practices to evaluate additional measures to ensure the continued safety and wide availability of DNA synthesis.

Existing literature shows that Dual Sensory Loss (DSL) is a prevalent condition amongst older adults. In China, it has been estimated that 57.2% of the population experience DSL. Based on a small number of research papers, it has been identified that DSL influences mental health and wellbeing. The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between DSL and mental health and wellbeing in a sample of older adults residing in China; and investigate whether the comorbidities of functional dependency [Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)] and chronic diseases influence the impacts of DSL on mental health and wellbeing. Method: The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study Wave 2, 2013 data collection of a sample of people aged 60 years and over (n = 8,268) was used in this study. The sensory loss variables selected for analysis included a combined variable of self-reported vision and hearing loss (DSL). Mental health was measured by depression, and general wellbeing was measured by life satisfaction. In addition, chronic diseases, and limitations in IADL and ADL were used to test how their comorbidities with DSL influence mental health and wellbeing. Results were analyzed descriptively and using regression and modeling techniques. Results and Discussion: DSL was significantly and positively associated with advanced age, having difficulty in any ADL or IADL and experiencing depression and less life satisfaction. The observed negative associations between DSL and mental health or wellbeing, are indirect and could be partially explained by its comorbidity with chronic diseases and relationship to functional limitations. It is recommended that health services in China screen for DSL in older people and develop integrated services to assist with appropriate management and rehabilitation of older people with DSL focusing on both functional and mental health issues.",AUPHA and Globalization: A Perspective on the Future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069205,Frontiers in public health,2019 05 09,"The Association of University Programs in Health Administration (AUPHA) celebrated its 70th year in 2018 with a publication of a book on its history (Looking Back to Look Forward: AUPHA at 70) (1).

The consideration gets to the core of why any association exists and how does an association best serve the needs of its constituencies. The purpose is to determine what lessons AUPHA's evolution has for healthcare management education associations globally.

Intravenous γ-immunoglobulin (IVIG) is recommended to be administrated within 10 days after fever onset. However, some patients didn't have IVIG therapies because of atypical disease presentations or spontaneous defervescence. We aimed to evaluate the coronary outcomes of the KD patients who didn't receive IVIG and had defervescence within 10 days. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the KD patients in NTUCH between 2008 and 2015. The patients with a diagnosis of KD and had a febrile length between 5 and 10 days were enrolled. Days of fever, clinical symptoms, laboratory data at the acute stage, and series of coronary artery measurements within a minimum of 3 months after disease onset were recorded. Risk factors associated with coronary lesions 1 month after KD onset were also analyzed. Results: Two hundred ninety-three eligible KD patients were enrolled (Male: 55.1%, mean age of onset: 1.8 years old). Thirty-seven patients had spontaneous defervescence without IVIG treatment. The incidence of coronary aneurysms at the 4th week after disease onset was higher in spontaneously defervesced KD patients than those treated with IVIG (18.9% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.002). Interestingly, of the 238 KD patients without coronary lesions at their acute phase, percentages of emerging coronary aneurysms became significantly higher if they didn't have IVIG therapies due to spontaneous defervescence (4/31), compared with those who received IVIG (3/208). Further analysis showed the development of coronary lesions at 1 month after disease onset was associated with younger age (<12 months old, p = 0.024), and leukocytosis (WBC > 17,000/cumm, p = 0.031). Conclusions: 18.9% of KD patients with spontaneous defervescence had coronary aneurysms. Even without initial coronary lesions, such patients were still riskier to develop coronary aneurysms, compared with KD patients who received IVIG therapies. Such findings address the importance of refining the strategy for use of IVIG in the spontaneously defervesced KD patients within 10 days after fever onset, at least in those with age younger than 1 year and those with leukocytosis.",Developing a Research Mentorship Program: The American Society of Pediatric Nephrology's Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069203,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 05 12,"Background: Most pediatric nephrologists work in academia. Mentor-mentee relationships provide support and guidance for successful research career. Mentorship program implementation is valuable in medical fields for providing research opportunities to young faculty. Methods: The American Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ASPN) established a research mentorship program to (a) assist with matching of appropriate mentor-mentee dyads and (b) establish metrics for desirable mentor-mentee outcomes with two independent components: (1) the grants review workshop, a short-term program providing mentor feedback on grant proposals, and (2) the longitudinal program, establishing long-term mentor-mentee relationships. Regular surveys of both mentors and mentees were reviewed to evaluate and refine the program. Results: Twelve mentees and 17 mentors participated in the grant review workshop and 19 mentees were matched to mentors in the longitudinal program. A review of NIH RePORTER data indicated that since 2014, 13 NIH grants have been awarded. Mentees in the longitudinal program reported that the program helped most with identifying an outside mentor, improving grant research content, and with general career development. Mentors perceived themselves to be most helpful in assisting with overall career plans. Email communications were preferred over phone or face-to-face communications. Mentees endorsed strong interest in staying in touch with their mentors and 100% of mentors expressed their willingness to serve in the future. Conclusion: This mentorship program was initiated and supported by a relatively small medical society and has shown early success in cultivating mentoring relationships for a future generation of clinician-scientists.",Placental ESRRG-CYP19A1 Expressions and Circulating 17-Beta Estradiol in IUGR Pregnancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069202,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 05 12,"Introduction: Sex steroids are regulating factors for intrauterine growth. 17-β Estradiol (E2) is particularly critical to a physiological pregnancy, as increased maternal E2 was correlated to lower fetal weight at delivery. The placenta itself is a primary source of estrogens, synthetized from cholesterol precursors. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (encoded by CYP19A1 gene) is a rate-limiting enzyme for E2 biosynthesis. CYP19A1 transcription is supported by Estrogen Related-Receptor Gamma (ERRγ- ESRRG gene), which thus has an indirect role in placental steroidogenesis. Here we investigated maternal E2 levels and placental CYP19A1 and ESRRG expressions in pregnancies with IntraUterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). Methods: Singleton pregnancies were studied. E2 was measured in maternal plasma by electrochemiluminescence in 16 term controls and 11 IUGR (classified by umbilical artery doppler pulsatility index) at elective cesarean section, and also in 13 controls during pregnancy at a gestational age comparable to IUGR. CYP19A1 and ESRRG expressions were analyzed in placental tissue. Maternal/fetal characteristics, placental and molecular data were compared among study groups and tested for correlations. Results: Maternal E2 plasma concentrations were significantly decreased in IUGR compared to controls at delivery. When analyzing normal pregnancies at a gestational age similar to IUGR, E2 levels were not different to pathological cases. However, E2 levels at delivery positively correlated with placental efficiency. Placental CYP19A1 levels were significantly higher in IUGR placental tissue vs. controls, and specifically increased in female IUGR placentas. ESRRG expression was not different among groups. Discussion: We report a positive correlation between 17-β Estradiol levels and placental efficiency, that might indicate a disrupted steroidogenesis in IUGR pregnancies. Moreover, we show alterations of CYP19A1 expression in IUGR placentas, possibly indicating a compensatory effect to the adverse IUGR intrauterine environment, also depending on fetal sex. Further studies are needed to deeper investigate IUGR alterations in the complex interaction among molecules involved in placental steroidogenesis.",Predictors of adverse drug reactions in geriatric patients: An exploratory study among cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069198,South Asian journal of cancer,2019 05 12,The objective of this study was to study the predictors of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among geriatric patients in the Department of Medical Oncology.,Influence of JAK2V617F allele burden on clinical phenotype of polycythemia vera patients: A study from India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069197,South Asian journal of cancer,2019 05 12,"Elevated JAK2V617F allele burden is associated with enhanced expression of downstream target genes in Philadelphia negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPNs) which include PV, ET & PMF.

As such, we evaluated herein the role of the S. suis serotype 9 AgI/II in the interactions with phagocytes and the development of systemic disease in a mouse model of infection. Results demonstrated that the presence of AgI/II is important for the development of clinical systemic disease by promoting bacterial survival in blood possibly due to its effect on S. suis phagocytosis, as shown with macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, AgI/II directly participates in dendritic cell activation and pro-inflammatory mediator production following recognition by the Toll-like receptor pathway, which may contribute to the exacerbated systemic inflammation responsible for host death. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the S. suis serotype 9 AgI/II is important for virulence during systemic infection and development of disease. In fact, this is the first study to describe a role of an AgI/II family member in systemic bacterial disease.","Molecular Characterization of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate Aldolase From Trichinella spiralis and Its Potential in Inducing Immune Protection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069178,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"Trichinella spiralis is a major food-borne parasite worldwide. Trichinellosis caused by T. spiralis is not only a public health problem, but also an economic hazard in food safety. The development of effective vaccines to prevent Trichinella infection in domestic animals and humans is urgently needed for controlling of this zoonosis. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA) is involved in energy production in glycolysis and is also associated with many non-glycolysis functions in the parasite, such as adhesion to host cells, plasminogen binding, and invasion. FBPA has been considered as a potential vaccine candidate or as a target for chemotherapeutic treatment. Here, we report for the first time the characterization of FBPA of T. spiralis and an evaluation of its potential as a vaccine candidate antigen against T. spiralis infection in mice. The results of qPCR and western blot analysis showed that the Ts-FBPA gene was expressed at various developmental stages of T. spiralis and was also detected in excretory-secretory products (ES) of T. spiralis muscle larvae (ML). Immunostaining with anti-Ts-FBPA mouse sera indicated that it localized principally to the surface and embryos of this parasitic nematode. Vaccination of mice with recombinant Ts-FBPA (rTs-FBPA) resulted in a Th1/Th2 mixed humoral and cellular immune response with Th2 predominant, as well as remarkably elevated IgE levels. Moreover, mice vaccinated with rTs-FBPA displayed a 48.7% reduction in adult worm burden and 52.5% reduction in muscle larval burden. These studies indicated that Ts-FBPA is a promising target for developing an effective vaccine to prevent and control Trichinella infection.",Physical Extraction and Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography for Purifying Flagella Filament From Uropathogenic Escherichia coli for Immune Assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069177,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"Flagella are expressed on the surface of a wide range of bacteria, conferring motility and contributing to virulence and innate immune stimulation. Host-pathogen interaction studies of the roles of flagella in infection, including due to uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), have used various methods to purify and examine the biology of the major flagella subunit protein, FliC. These studies have offered insight into the ways in which flagella proteins interact with host cells. However, previous methods used to extract and purify FliC, such as mechanical shearing, ultracentrifugation, heterologous expression in laboratory E. coli strains, and precipitation-inducing chemical treatments have various limitations; as a result, there are few observations based on highly purified, non-denatured FliC in the literature. This is especially relevant to host-pathogen interaction studies such as immune assays that are designed to parallel, as closely as possible, naturally-occurring interactions between host cells and flagella. In this study, we sought to establish a new, carefully optimized method to extract and purify non-denatured, native FliC from the reference UPEC strain CFT073 to be suitable for immune assays. To achieve purification of FliC to homogeneity, we used a mutant CFT073 strain containing deletions in four major chaperone-usher fimbriae operons (type 1, F1C and two P fimbrial gene clusters; CFT073Δ4). A sequential flagella extraction method based on mechanical shearing, ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, protein concentration and endotoxin removal was applied to CFT073Δ4. Protein purity and integrity was assessed using SDS-PAGE, Western blots with anti-flagellin antisera, and native-PAGE. We also generated a fliC-deficient strain, CFT073Δ4ΔfliC, to enable the concurrent preparation of a suitable carrier control to be applied in downstream assays. Innate immune stimulation was examined by exposing J774A.1 macrophages to 0.05-1 μg of purified FliC for 5 h; the supernatants were analyzed for cytokines known to be induced by flagella, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12; the results were assessed in the context of prior literature. Macrophage responses to purified FliC encompassed significant levels of several cytokines consistent with prior literature reports. The purification method described here establishes a new approach to examine highly purified FliC in the context of host-pathogen interaction model systems.",The Role of the Cell Surface Mucin MUC1 as a Barrier to Infection and Regulator of Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069176,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"The family of cell surface (cs-) mucins are constitutively expressed at the cell surface by nearly all epithelial cells, beneath the gel-mucin layer. All cs-mucin family members have structural features that enable them to act as a releasable decoy barrier to mucosal pathogens, by providing ligands for pathogen binding and the ability to shed the bound extracellular domain. Due to the towering structure of cs-mucins at the surface, binding of mucosal pathogens can also sterically block binding to underlying cellular receptors. The cytoplasmic tail domain of cs-mucins are capable of initiating signal transduction cascades and due to their conservation across species, may play an important biological role in cellular signaling. MUC1 is one of the most extensively studied of the cs-mucin family. With respect to its physiological function in the mucosal environment, MUC1 has been demonstrated to play a dynamic role in protection of the host from infection by a wide variety of pathogens and to regulate inflammatory responses to infection. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge and new findings regarding the structural features relating to the function of MUC1, its role as a protective barrier against pathogen invasion and mechanisms by which this cs-mucin regulates inflammation.",Human Macrophages Clear the Biovar Microtus Strain of Yersinia pestis More Efficiently Than Murine Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069175,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of the notorious plague that has claimed millions of deaths in history. Of the four known Y. pestis biovars (Antiqua, Medievalis, Orientalis, and Microtus), Microtus strains are unique for being highly virulent in mice but avirulent in humans. Here, human peripheral lymphocytes were infected with the fully virulent 141 strain or the Microtus strain 201, and their transcriptomes were determined and compared. The most notable finding was that robust responses in the pathways for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling and Jak-STAT signaling were induced at 2 h post infection (hpi) in the 201- but not the 141-infected lymphocytes, suggesting that human lymphocytes might be able to constrain infections caused by strain 201 but not 141. Consistent with the transcriptome results, much higher IFN-γ and IL-1β were present in the supernatants from the 201-infected lymphocytes, while inflammatory inhibitory IL-10 levels were higher in the 141-infected lymphocytes. The expressions of CSTD and SLC11A1, both of which are functional components of the lysosome, increased in the 201-infected human macrophage-like U937 cells. Further assessment of the survival rate of the 201 bacilli in the U937 cells and murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells revealed no viable bacteria in the U937 cells at 32 hpi.; however, about 5-10% of the bacteria were still alive in the RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that human macrophages can clear the intracellular Y. pestis 201 bacilli more efficiently than murine macrophages, probably by interfering with critical host immune responses, and this could partially account for the host-specific pathogenicity of Y. pestis Microtus strains.",Proteomic Analysis and Virulence Assessment of Granulicatella adiacens Secretome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069174,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"Despite reports on the occurrence of Granulicatella adiacens in infective endocarditis, few mechanistic studies on its virulence characteristics or pathogenicity are available. Proteins secreted by this species may act as determinants of host-microbe interaction and play a role in virulence. Our aim in this study was to investigate and functionally characterize the secretome of G. adiacens. Proteins in the secretome preparation were digested by trypsin and applied to nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. By using a combined mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approach, we identified 101 proteins. Bioinformatics tools predicting subcellular localization revealed that 18 of the secreted proteins possessed signal sequence. More than 20% of the secretome proteins were putative virulence proteins including serine protease, superoxide dismutase, aminopeptidase, molecular chaperone DnaK, and thioredoxin. Ribosomal proteins, molecular chaperones, and glycolytic enzymes, together known as ""moonlighting proteins,"" comprised fifth of the secretome proteins. By Gene Ontology analysis, more than 60 proteins of the secretome were grouped in biological processes or molecular functions. KEGG pathway analysis disclosed that the secretome consisted of enzymes involved in biosynthesis of antibiotics. Cytokine profiling revealed that secreted proteins stimulated key cytokines, such as IL-1β, MCP-1, TNF-α, and RANTES from human PBMCs. In summary, the results from the current investigation of the G. adiacens secretome provide a basis for understanding possible pathogenic mechanisms of G. adiacens.",Antibiotic-Induced Disruption of Gut Microbiota Alters Local Metabolomes and Immune Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069173,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 12,"Gut microbiome plays an essential role in modulating host immune responses. However, little is known about the interaction of microbiota, their metabolites and relevant inflammatory responses in the gut. By treating the mice with three different antibiotics (enrofloxacin, vancomycin, and polymixin B sulfate), we aimed to investigate the effects of different antibiotics exposure on gut microbiota, microbial metabolism, inflammation responses in the gut, and most importantly, pinpoint the underlying interactions between them. Although the administration of different antibiotics can lead to different effects on mouse models, the treatment did not affect the average body weight of the mice. A heavier caecum was observed in vancomycin treated mice. Treatment by these three antibiotics significantly up-regulated gene expression of various cytokines in the colon. Enrofloxacin treated mice seemed to have an increased Th1 response in the colon. However, such a difference was not found in mice treated by vancomycin or polymixin B sulfate. Vancomycin treatment induced significant changes in bacterial composition at phylum and family level and decreased richness and diversity at species level. Enrofloxacin treatment only induced changes in composition at family presenting as an increase in Prevotellaceae and Rikenellaceae and a decrease in Bacteroidaceae. However, no significant difference was observed after polymixin B sulfate treatment. When compared with the control group, significant metabolic shift was found in the enrofloxacin and vancomycin treated group. The metabolic changes mainly occurred in Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway and beta-Alanine metabolism in enrofloxacin treated group. For vancomycin treatment metabolic changes were mainly found in beta-Alanine metabolism and Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway. Moreover, modifications observed in the microbiota compositions were correlated with the metabolite concentrations. For example, concentration of pentadecanoic acid was positively correlated with richness of Rikenellaceae and Prevotellaceae and negatively correlated with Enterobacteriaceae. This study suggests that the antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota might contribute to the inflammation responses through the alternation of metabolic status, providing a novel insight regarding a complex network that integrates the different interactions between gut microbiota, metabolic functions, and immune responses in host.",Whole Exome Sequencing of Cell-Free DNA for Early Lung Cancer: A Pilot Study to Differentiate Benign From Malignant CT-Detected Pulmonary Lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069172,Frontiers in oncology,2019 05 12,"Introduction: Indeterminate pulmonary lesions (IPL) detected by CT pose a significant clinical challenge, frequently necessitating long-term surveillance or biopsy for diagnosis. In this pilot investigation, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of plasma cell free (cfDNA) and matched germline DNA in patients with CT-detected pulmonary lesions to determine the feasibility of somatic cfDNA mutations to differentiate benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Methods: 33 patients with a CT-detected pulmonary lesions were retrospectively enrolled (n = 16 with a benign nodule, n = 17 with a malignant nodule). Following isolation and amplification of plasma cfDNA and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patient blood samples, WES of cfDNA and PBMC DNA was performed. After genomic alignment and filtering, we looked for lung-cancer associated driver mutations and next identified high-confidence somatic variants in both groups. Results: Somatic cfDNA mutations were observed in both groups, with the cancer group demonstrating more variants than the benign group (1083 ± 476 versus 553 ± 519, p < 0.0046). By selecting variants present in >2 cancer patients and not the benign group, we accurately identified 82% (14/17) of cancer patients. Conclusions: This study suggests a potential role for cfDNA for the early identification of lung cancer in patients with CT-detected pulmonary lesions. Importantly, a substantial number of somatic variants in healthy patients with benign pulmonary nodules were also found. Such ""benign"" variants, while largely unexplored to date, have widespread relevance to all liquid biopsies if cfDNA is to be used accurately for cancer detection.",Endothelial Cell-Derived TGF-β Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition via CD133 in HBx-Infected Hepatoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069171,Frontiers in oncology,2019 05 12,"Background: Hepatitis B-X Protein (HBx) encoded in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to play a critical role in development and progression of HBV induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBx interacts with and activates various cells in HCC microenvironment to promote tumor initiation, progression and invasion. In this study, we investigated how surrounding stromal cells interact with HBx-infected hepatoma cells by a series of in vitro co-culture studies. Methods: Huh7 hepatoma cells were cultured and transfected with the mammalian expression vector pGFP-HBx. Co-culture assays were performed between HBx-transfected Huh7 cells and conditioned media (CM) from stromal cells [endothelial cell lines (HUVECs) and hepatic stellate cell lines (LX2 cells)]. The effect of these interactions was studied by a series of functional assays like chemotaxis, invasion, and wound healing scratch assays. Also, quantitative real time (RT)-PCRs of the mesenchymal genes was performed in the hepatoma cells with and without the co-cultures. Hep3B cells with an integrated HBV genome were taken as positive controls. Results: HBx-transfected Huh7 cells cultured in presence of CM from HUVECs illustrated enhanced migration and tube formation as compared to HBx-transfected cells cultured alone or co-cultured with LX2 cells. HBx-transfected hepatoma cells incubated with CM from HUVECs also expressed mesenchymal genes including Thy1, CDH2, TGFβR1, VIM, and CD133. ELISAs revealed increased levels of TGF-β in CM from HUVECs. In comparison to unstimulated HBx-transfected Huh7 cells, TGF-β stimulated cells displayed increased invasive properties and mesenchymal gene expression. RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that incubation with either CM from HUVECs or TGF-β significantly increased the expression of a stemness marker, CD133 in HBx-infected hepatoma cells. Gene inhibition experiments with CD133 siRNA showed a downregulation of mesenchymal gene expression and properties in TGF-β induced HBx-infected hepatoma cells as compared to that observed in control siRNA treated cells, indicating CD133 as one of the key molecules affecting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HBx-infected cells. Conclusion: The study indicates that secretory factors like TGF-β from neighboring endothelial cells may enhance expression of CD133 and impart an aggressive EMT phenotype to HBx-infected hepatoma cells in HBV induced HCC.",Chasing Zero Harm in Radiation Oncology: Using Pre-treatment Peer Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069170,Frontiers in oncology,2019 05 12,"Purpose: The Joint Commission has encouraged the healthcare industry to become ""High Reliability Organizations"" by ""Chasing Zero Harm"" in patient care. In radiation oncology, the time point of quality checks determines whether errors are prevented or only mitigated. Thus, to ""chase zero"" in radiation oncology, peer review has to be implemented prior to treatment initiation. A multidisciplinary group consensus peer review (GCPR) model is used pre-treatment at our institution and has been successful in our efforts to ""chase zero harm"" in patient care. Methods: With the GCPR model, policy-defined complex cases go through a treatment planning conference, which includes physicians, residents, physicists, and dosimetrists. Three major plan aspects are reviewed: target volumes, target and normal tissue dose coverage, and dose distributions. During the review, any team member can ask questions and afterwards a group consensus is taken regarding plan approval. Results: The GCPR model has been implemented through a commitment to peer review and creative conference scheduling. Automated analysis software is used to depict color-coded results for department approved target coverage and dose constraints. About 8% of plans required re-planning while about 23% required minor changes. The mean time for review of each plan was 8 min. Conclusions: Catching errors prior to treatment is the only way to ""chase zero"" in radiation oncology. Various types of errors may exist in treatment plans and our GCPR model succeeds in preventing many errors of all shapes and sizes in target definition, dose prescriptions, and treatment plans from ever reaching the patients."

T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) inhibits T-cell responses and is associated with human cancers and T cell exhaustion phenotypes, but its role in cancers remains unclear. TIGIT and programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 levels were detected in 441 human GC specimens using histochemistry. We used flow cytometry to evaluate percentage of TIGIT+ constituting CD8+ T cells of 23 patients with GC who underwent D2 gastrectomy and the S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) regimen. We investigated the influence of SOX regimen and TIGIT functional antibody on CD8 tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Results showed that PD-1 and TIGIT were significantly over expressed in GC and predicted poorer outcome, agreeing with bioinformatics analysis. Significantly reduced percentages of CD8+ TIGIT+ cells were observed in patients after D2 gastrectomy (pre- vs post-surgery, 38 ± 8.7% vs. 26.7% ± 5.2%, p < 0.0001). TIGIT expression on CD8+T cells was modulated by chemotherapeutics (pre- and post-chemotherapy, 31.3 ± 9% vs. 25.1 ± 4.5%, respectively, p = 0.0047) and higher TIGIT expression in post-chemotherapy group was associated with relapsed GC (p = 0.036). In vitro experiments revealed increased CD8+ TIL proliferation and interferon (IFN)-γ production following SOX regimen and TIGIT functional antibody treatments. In conclusion, TIGIT contributes to CD8+ TILs immune dysfunction in patients with GC. Combination of anti-TIGIT therapy and chemotherapy could be considered a therapy for GC.",Toll-like receptor 3 acts as a suppressor gene in breast cancer initiation and progression: a two-stage association study and functional investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069157,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a receptor recognizing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from viruses as well as from lytic mammalian cells. In the present study, we performed a two-stage association study (n = 3,551) and found that the minor alleles of two SNPs (the T-allele of rs5743312 and the T-allele of rs3775296) conferred increased risks of breast cancer incidence. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 2.281 (P = 7.01 × 10-5) and 2.086 (P = 8.69 × 10-5), respectively. Specifically, the susceptibility variants within TLR3 were significantly associated with larger tumor size (adjusted P-values: 0.004 for rs5743312 and 0.004 for rs3775296). Furthermore, we investigated the biological function of the TLR3 protein in breast cancer cell lines. Notably, the stable expression of TLR3 directly inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. We also verified that TLR3 conferred less invasive phenotypes on breast cancer cells by regulating the mRNA expression of a panel of genes. TLR3-mediated inhibition of proliferation was caused by downregulation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that common genetic changes in the TLR3 gene may influence breast cancer susceptibility and development, and TLR3 plays a negative regulatory role in the initiation and progression of human breast cancer cells, at least in part by downregulating the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway.",TCR sequencing analysis of cancer tissues and tumor draining lymph nodes in colorectal cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069156,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are located in the routes of lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor and have the highest risk of metastasis in various types of solid tumors. TDLNs are also considered as a tissue to activate the antitumor immunity, where antigen-specific effector T cells are generated. However, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in TDLNs have not been well characterized. We collected 23 colorectal cancer tumors with 203 lymph nodes with/without metastatic cancer cells (67 were metastasis-positive and the remaining 136 were metastasis-negative) and performed TCR sequencing. Metastasis-positive TDLNs showed a significantly lower TCR diversity and shared TCR clonotypes more frequently with primary tumor tissues compared to metastasis-negative TDLNs. Principal component analysis indicated that TDLNs with metastasis showed similar TCR repertoires. These findings suggest that cancer-reactive T cell clones could be enriched in the metastasis-positive TDLNs.",Autoantibody status in systemic sclerosis patients defines both cancer risk and survival with ANA negativity in cases with concomitant cancer having a worse survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069155,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Background: A higher rate of cancer in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is recognized but the role of SSc-linked autoantibodies status (positive/negative and autoantibody specificities) in the survival of SSc-patients with cancer remains poorly understood. Methods: We utilized the Clalit-Health-Services medical database in a case-control study to evaluate the autoantibody status and specificities of SSc-patients with age- and sex-matched controls with regard to the prevalence of different cancer-subtypes and their impact on mortality. SSc-linked autoantibodies (ANA, anti-centromere, anti-RNP, anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) and anti-Scl-70) status was assessed in terms of cancer risk and outcome. Results: 2,431 SSc-patients and 12,377 age- and sex-matched controls were included. SSc-patients had a relative risk of cancer of 1.90 (95%CI 1.62-2.24, p < 0.0001) and tended to develop malignancies earlier than controls. RNAPIII and Scl-70 autoantibody were associated with an increased overall cancer risk and after SSc diagnosis risk of cancer, respectively. As expected, SSc-patients with cancer had a risk of death of 2.15 (1.65-2.79) in comparison to SSc-patients without cancer. ANA-positive SSc-patients with cancer had a better prognosis than ANA-negative cases (p = 0.0001). Despite the benefit of ANA-positive status on survival, the anti-Scl-70-positive subgroup with cancer had a significant negative impact on the survival compared to Scl-70-positive cases without cancer, whereas anti-RNAPIII and anti-centromere had no significant impact. Conclusion: ANA positivity is an independent predictor of favorable prognosis in SSc-patients with cancer, possibly suggesting that humoral autoimmunity in SSc with cancer may have some benefit. However, no survival benefit was discernible with the common autoantibodies.",Localization-associated immune phenotypes of clonally expanded tumor-infiltrating T cells and distribution of their target antigens in rectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069154,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"The degree and type of T cell infiltration influence rectal cancer prognosis regardless of classical tumor staging. We asked whether clonal expansion and tumor infiltration are restricted to selected-phenotype T cells; which clones are accessible in peripheral blood; and what the spatial distribution of their target antigens is. From five rectal cancer patients, we isolated paired tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) and T cells from unaffected rectum mucosa (TUM) using 13-parameter FACS single cell index sorting. TCRαβ sequences, cytokine, and transcription factor expression were determined with single cell sequencing. TILs and TUM occupied distinct phenotype compartments and clonal expansion predominantly occurred within CD8+ T cells. Expanded TIL clones identified by paired TCRαβ sequencing and exclusively detectable in the tumor showed characteristic PD-1 and TIM-3 expression. TCRβ repertoire sequencing identified 49 out of 149 expanded TIL clones circulating in peripheral blood and 41 (84%) of these were PD-1- TIM-3-. To determine whether clonal expansion of predominantly tumor-infiltrating T cell clones was driven by antigens uniquely presented in tumor tissue, selected TCRs were reconstructed and incubated with cells isolated from corresponding tumor or unaffected mucosa. The majority of clones exclusively detected in the tumor recognized antigen at both sites. In summary, rectal cancer is infiltrated with expanded distinct-phenotype T cell clones that either i) predominantly infiltrate the tumor, ii) predominantly infiltrate the unaffected mucosa, or iii) overlap between tumor, unaffected mucosa, and peripheral blood. However, the target antigens of predominantly tumor-infiltrating TIL clones do not appear to be restricted to tumor tissue.",Neoantigens retention in patient derived xenograft models mediates autologous T cells activation in ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069153,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Ovarian cancer (OC) has an overall modest number of mutations that facilitate a functional immune infiltrate able to recognize tumor mutated antigens, or neoantigens. Although patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) can partially model the tumor mutational load and mimic response to chemotherapy, no study profiled a neoantigen-driven response in OC PDXs. Here we demonstrate that the genomic status of the primary tumor from an OC patient can be recapitulated in vivo in a PDX model, with the goal of defining autologous T cells activation by neoantigens using in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches. By profiling the PDX mutanome we discovered three main clusters of mutations defining the expansion, retraction or conservation of tumor clones based on their variant allele frequencies (VAF). RNASeq analyses revealed a strong functional conservation between the primary tumor and PDXs, highlighted by the upregulation of antigen presenting pathways. We tested in vitro a set of 30 neoantigens for recognition by autologous T cells and identified a core of six neoantigens that define a potent T cell activation able to slow tumor growth in vivo. The pattern of recognition of these six neoantigens indicates the pre-existence of anti-tumor immunity in the patient. To evaluate the breadth of T cell activation, we performed single cell sequencing profiling the TCR repertoire upon stimulation with neoantigenic moieties and identified sequence motifs that define an oligoclonal and autologous T cell response. Overall, these results indicate that OC PDXs can be a valid tool to model OC response to immunotherapy.",APC germline hepatoblastomas demonstrate cisplatin-induced intratumor tertiary lymphoid structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069152,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common liver cancer in children. We aimed to characterize HB related to APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) germline mutation (APC-HB). This French multicentric retrospective study included 12 APC-HB patients under 5 at diagnosis. Clinical features of APC-HB were compared to the French SIOPEL2-3 cohort of HB patients. Molecular and histopathological analyses of APC-HB were compared to 15 consecutive sporadic HB treated at Bicêtre hospital from 2013 to 2015 (non-APC-HB). APC-HB patients have a peculiar spectrum of germline APC mutations, with no events in the main hotspot of classical APC mutations at codon 1309 (P < .05). Compared to sporadic HB, they have similar clinical features including good prognosis since all patients are alive in complete remission at last follow-up. APC-HB are mostly well-limited tumors with fetal predominance and few mesenchymal components. All APC-HB have an activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway without CTNNB1 mutation, confirming that germline APC and somatic CTNNB1 mutations are mutually exclusive (P < .001). Pathological reviewing identified massive intratumor tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) containing both lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in all 11 APC-HB cases who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not in five pre-chemotherapy samples (four paired biopsies and one patient resected without chemotherapy), indicating that these TLS are induced by chemotherapy (P < .001). Conclusion: APC-HB show a good prognosis, they are all infiltrated by cisplatin-induced TLS, a feature only retrieved in a minority of non-APC-HB. This suggests that APC inactivation can synergize with cisplatin to induce an immunogenic cell death that initiates an anti-tumor immune response.",Fusobacterium nucleatum supresses anti-tumor immunity by activating CEACAM1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069151,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is an oral anaerobe found to be enriched in colorectal cancer (CRC). Presence of F. nucleatum in CRC has been correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. We previously demonstrated that the Fap2 outer-surface protein of F. nucleatum binds and activates the human inhibitory receptor TIGIT which is expressed by T and Natural Killer (NK) cells, and inhibits anti-tumor immunity. Here we show that F. nucleatum also binds and activates the human inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 leading to inhibition of T and NK cells activities. Our results suggest that using CEACAM1 and TIGIT inhibitors and specific targeting of fusobacteria should be considered for treating fusobacteria-colonized tumors.","Oncolytic viruses: how ""lytic"" must they be for therapeutic efficacy?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069150,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) preferentially target and kill cancer cells without affecting healthy cells through a multi-modal mechanism of action. While historically the direct killing activity of OVs was considered the primary mode of action, initiation or augmentation of a host antitumor immune response is now considered an essential aspect of oncolytic virotherapy. To improve oncolytic virotherapy, many studies focus on increasing virus replication and spread. In this article, we open for discussion the traditional dogma that correlates replication with the efficacy of OVs, pointing out several examples that oppose this principle.",Potentiating vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy through CSF-1R modulation of myeloid cells in a preclinical model of prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069149,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) induces rapid destruction of targeted tissues and is a promising therapy for prostate cancer. However, the resulting immune response, which may play an important role in either potentiating or blunting the effects of VTP, is still incompletely understood. Myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages are often found in tumors and are widely reported to be associated with cancer angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and immunosuppression. These cells are also known to play a critical role in wound-healing, which is induced by rapid tissue destruction. In this study, we investigated the effects of VTP on the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, specifically MDSCs and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in the Myc-Cap and TRAMP C2 murine prostate cancer models. We report that VTP increased the infiltration of myeloid cells into the tumors, as well as their expression of CSF1R, a receptor required for myeloid differentiation, proliferation, and tumor migration. As anti-CSF1R treatment has previously been used to deplete these cells types in other murine models of prostate cancer, we hypothesized that combining anti-CSF1R with VTP therapy would lead to decreased tumor regrowth and improved survival. Importantly, we found that targeting myeloid cells using anti-CSF1R in combination with VTP therapy decreased the number of tumor MDSCs and TAMs, especially M2 macrophages, as well as increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, decreased tumor growth and improved overall survival. These results suggest that targeting myeloid cells via CSF1R targeting is a promising strategy to potentiate the anti-tumor effects of VTP."

However, PD-1 inhibition may still play a role in combination immunotherapy with multiple agents. In this study, we evaluated anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in combination with multiple approaches, including vaccination and agonist anti-OX40 immunotherapy, as well as triple combination immunotherapy with each of the above agents in a murine glioma model. Treatments were delivered on days 3,6, and 9 after intracranial implantation of glioma cells in the right frontal lobes of the mice. Vaccination consisted of subcutaneous implantation of irradiated GL261 cells engineered to express GM-CSF. We harvested splenocytes and brain tissue 18 days after glioma implantation and analyzed them by ELISPOT and flow cytometry, respectively. Treated mice surviving for 120 days were challenged with implantation of large numbers of GL261 cells and either followed for survival or sacrificed for study of the memory response. Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Means were compared by the 2-tailed student's t-test. We report that combining anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with either vaccination or agonist anti-OX40 immunotherapy improves survival in GL261-bearing mice compared with any of the above as monotherapy. Triple combination immunotherapy with vaccination, anti-PD-1 antibody, and agonist anti-OX40 antibody results in long-term survival in all mice. Triple combination immunotherapy resulted in an elevated CD4+/CD8 + T lymphocyte ratio amongst tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a diminished fraction of regulatory T lymphocytes, likely reflective of a more vigorous Th1 antitumor response.",T cell repertoire to citrullinated self-peptides in healthy humans is not confined to the HLA-DR SE alleles; Targeting of citrullinated self-peptides presented by HLA-DP4 for tumour therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069134,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Post-translational modifications are induced in stressed cells which cause them to be recognised by the system. One such modification is citrullination where the positive charged arginine is modified to a neutral citrulline. We demonstrate most healthy donors show an oligoclonal CD4 response in vitro to at least one citrullinated vimentin or enolase peptide. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis patients, these T cell responses were not restricted by HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles, suggesting they could be presented by other MHC class II alleles. As HLA-DP is less polymorphic than HLA-DR, we investigated whether the common allele, HLA-DP4 could present citrullinated epitopes. The modification of arginine to citrulline enhanced binding of the peptides to HLA-DP4 and induced high-frequency CD4 responses in HLA-DP4 transgenic mouse models. Our previous studies have shown that tumours present citrullinated peptides restricted through HLA-DR4 which are good targets for anti-tumour immunity. In this study, we show that citrullinated vimentin and enolase peptides also induced strong anti-tumour immunity (100% survival, p < 0.0001) against established B16 tumours and against the LLC/2 lung cancer model (p = 0.034) both expressing HLA-DP4. Since most tumours do not constitutively express MHC class II molecules, models were engineered that expressed MHC class II under the control of an IFNγ inducible promoter. Immunisation with citrullinated peptides resulted in 90% survival (p < 0.001) against established B16 HHD tumour expressing IFNγ inducible DP4. These studies show that citrullinated peptides can be presented by a range of MHC class II molecules, including for the first time HLA-DP4, and are strong targets for anti-tumour immunity.",Microvesicles expressing adenosinergic ectoenzymes and their potential role in modulating bone marrow infiltration by neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069133,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"Metastatic diffusion of Neuroblastoma (NB) cells in the bone marrow (BM) represents the most negative prognostic factors for NB patients. Multiple immune escape mechanisms are postulated as responsible. Our working hypothesis is that adenosine (ADO), an immunosuppressive molecule along with the ectoenzymatic pathways (CD39-CD73 and CD38-CD203a/PC-1-CD73) controlling its production, are involved in the dynamics of NB cells in the BM. The results indicate that ectonucleotidases are expressed by i) NB cell lines, ii) metastatic NB cells isolated from NB patients' BM, iii) microvesicles (MV) derived from both NB cell types and iv) resident BM cell populations. BM infiltration by NB cells increased CD203a/PC-1 and CD73 expression on lymphoid and myeloid cells, respectively. Expressions of ectoenzymes and GD2 (NB-associated marker) were higher on MV from NB patients' BM than in controls. Moreover, CD203a/PC-1 expression on BM-derived MV provide a basis for distinguishing NB patients with high or low BM infiltration. ADO production and consumption of related by-products were significantly higher when assessed on NB patients' MV than those from controls. MV isolated from NB patients' BM significantly downregulated in vitro T cell proliferation. Lastly, NB patients with worse prognosis are identified by a high percentage of CD38+ or CD73+ MV in the BM. In conclusion, ectonucleotidases are present and functional on NB cells, as well as in NB-infiltrated BM and in MV derived from BM. It is reasonable that MV are involved in BM infiltration by NB cells. Therefore, targeting these molecules may widen the therapeutic armamentarium for metastatic NB patients.",Increased bone marrow SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET is associated with higher pelvic treatment failure in patients with cervical cancer treated by chemoradiotherapy and brachytherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069132,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"The aim of this study was to evaluate if bone marrow (BM) SUVmax measured on pre-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT predicts the clinical outcome of locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). We recruited retrospectively patients with LACC who underwent staging 18F-FDG PET/CT and had baseline blood tests, then treated by chemoradiation therapy (CRT), followed by image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT). BM SUVmax was calculated and correlated to inflammatory blood markers. Tumor size and pelvic lymph node involvement were evaluated on baseline MRI. Prognostic value of SUV uptake and blood markers regarding overall survival (OS), pelvic and extra-pelvic recurrence-free survival (PRFS and EPRFS respectively) was assessed using Cox models with adjusted p-values. 116 patients with FIGO stage Ib-IVa cervical cancer, treated between 2005 and 2014, were analyzed. The median follow-up was 75.5 months. BM SUVmax was significantly correlated to tumor SUVmax. In multivariate analysis, PRFS was significantly poorer in patients with high BM SUVmax (>2.8) and neutrophilia (p < .05). Tumor size (>5 vs ≤5 cm) could predict PRFS, EPRFS and OS (p < .05). In our cohort, FIGO stage (I-II vs III-IV), pelvic lymph node involvement and tumor SUVmax (>12 vs ≤12) were not prognostic for OS or pelvic and extra-pelvic relapses. Patients with LACC and high BM SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET have worse PFRS following CRT plus IGABT. These results can be potentially explained by the pro-inflammatory role of the tumor microenvironment and G-CSF expressed by tumor cells. These data support the role of PET as a potential indicator of disease aggressiveness beyond tumor staging.",A replication-incompetent CD154/40L recombinant vaccinia virus induces direct and macrophage-mediated antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069131,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"CD40 triggering may result in antitumor effects of potentially high clinical relevance. To gain insights important for patient selection and to identify adequate targeting techniques, we investigated CD40 expression in human cancer tissues and generated a replication-incompetent recombinant vaccinia virus expressing CD40 ligand (rVV40L). Its effects were explored in vitro and in vivo upon direct CD40 targeting on malignant cells or macrophage activation. CD40 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tumor and stromal cells in a multi-tumor array including 836 specimens from 27 different tumor types. Established tumor cell lines were used to explore the capacity of rVV40L to induce malignant cell apoptosis and modulate functional profiles of polarized macrophages. CD40 expression was detectable in significantly higher numbers of stromal as compared to malignant cells in lung and breast cancers. CD40 ligation following rVV40L infection induced apoptosis in CD40(+) cancer cells, but only in the presence of intact specific signal transduction chain. Importantly, rVV40L infection promoted the induction of TNF-α-dependent antitumor activity of M1-like macrophages directed against CD40(-) targets. CD40-activated M1-like macrophages also displayed enhanced ability to CXCL10-dependently recruit CD8+ T cells and to efficiently present cancer cell intracellular antigens through cross-priming. Moreover, rVV-driven CD40L expression partially ""re-educated"" M2-like macrophages, as suggested by detectable CXCL10 and IL-12 production. Most importantly, we observed that intra-tumoral injection of rVV40L-infected human macrophages inhibits progression of human CD40(-) tumors in vivo. First evidences of anticancer activity of rVV40L strongly encourage further evaluations.",Order of administration of combination cytokine therapies can decouple toxicity from efficacy in syngeneic mouse tumor models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069130,Oncoimmunology,2019 05 12,"In combination cancer immunotherapies, consideration should be given to designing treatment schedules that harmonize with the immune system's natural timing. An efficacious temporally programmed combination therapy of extended half-life interleukin 2 (eIL2), tumor targeting antibody, and interferon (IFN) α was recently reported; however, tumor-ablative efficacy was associated with significant toxicity. In the current work, altering the order and timing of the three agents is shown to decouple toxicity from efficacy. Delaying the administration of eIL2 to be concurrent with or after IFNα eliminates toxicity without affecting efficacy in multiple syngeneic tumor models and mouse strains. The toxicity resulting from eIL2 administration before IFNα is dependent on multiple systemic inflammatory cytokines including IL6, IL10, IFNγ, and tumor necrosis factor α. Natural killer (NK) cells are the main cellular contributor to toxicity, but are not essential for tumor control in this system. When pre-conditioned with eIL2, splenic NK cells became hyper-activated and upregulate IFNα signaling proteins that cause an excessive, toxic response to subsequent IFNα exposure. This work illustrates an example where accounting for the temporal dynamics of the immune system in combination therapy treatment schedule can favorably decouple efficacy and toxicity.",Broad consensus on the optimal sequence for the systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer: results from a survey of Spanish medical oncologists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069129,Journal of drug assessment,2019 05 12,"Objective: The aim of this survey conducted by 20 leading Spanish oncologists was to analyze the concurrence between Spanish clinical practice and the recently published definition of the optimal sequence for the systemic treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) according to patient profiles. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was developed, divided into five sections comprising 34 specific questions related to sequential treatments, plus three additional general questions. Respondents were asked to justify negative answers. Participants were recruited randomly by invitation out of a total of 619 oncologists. The questionnaire was sent and collected via e-mail between October 2015 and May 2016. A total of 191 completed questionnaires were received. Results: Overall, 70% of oncologists would keep the three patient profiles exactly as proposed (hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, HER2-positive, and triple negative breast cancer). Affirmative answers to questions regarding treatment sequences for these patient profiles (1-34) ranged from 77.8-99.5%, with an average of 90.9% of oncologists being in agreement with the recommended sequential treatments. The lowest degree of consensus was observed for endocrine treatments in pre-menopausal women and for chemotherapy options in hormone-resistant patients, whilst the highest degree of consensus was reached for targeted therapies in HER2-positive patients and for endocrine therapy in post-menopausal women. In their comments, participants revealed a number of economic constraints that prevented them from implementing some of the best treatment options. Conclusions: In conclusion, despite the complexity of MBC treatment, there is general agreement on the optimal treatment sequences.","Phase 2, randomized, open-label study on catheter-directed thrombolysis with plasmin versus rtPA and placebo in acute peripheral arterial occlusion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069128,Journal of drug assessment,2019 05 12,"Background: Patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion (aPAO) are candidates for operative thrombectomy, bypass, or catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) using a plasminogen activator. Human plasma-derived plasmin may offer another CDT option. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two intrathrombus delivery methods and two doses of plasmin compared with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and placebo in patients with aPAO. Patients/methods: This was a phase 2, randomized, open-label study of intra-arterial CDT of plasmin in patients with aPAO. The study used infusion catheters with or without balloon occlusion (BOC) to evaluate 150 mg plasmin (2 and 5 h post-infusion) and 250 mg plasmin (5 h post-infusion). The efficacy of plasmin, rtPA and placebo was assessed. Results: One hundred and seventy-four subjects were enrolled. Overall, the thrombolytic efficacy (>50% thrombolysis) was 59% (58/99) for 150 mg plasmin without BOC, which is comparable to 89% (8/9) for rtPA without BOC (p = 0.149) and 40% (2/5) for placebo control (p = 0.648). The thrombolytic efficacy was 33% of the 250 mg plasmin group. There was no difference (p > 0.999) in thrombolytic efficacy with BOC (59%, 58/99) or without BOC (59%, 17/29). Plasmin-treated groups experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at 71% (76/107) without BOC and 63% (24/38) with BOC; 78% (7/9) of the rtPA-treated group and 89% (8/9) of the placebo group had TEAEs. Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 29% (31/107) of the 150 mg plasmin group without BOC and 24% (9/38) with BOC. No SAEs occurred in the 250 mg plasmin group. Conclusions: Plasmin demonstrated less bleeding during catheter-directed administration at 150 mg and 250 mg doses compared to rtPA. BOC utilization did not improve efficacy. CDT with plasmin has a potential thrombolytic benefit in patients presenting with aPAO.

This accounts for different stress-response strategies, both specific (i.e., aimed at increasing the availability of stress-mitigating proteins) and systemic (such as large-scale changes in the use of metabolic pathways aimed at a more efficient exploitation of resources). Proteome re-allocation can, however, imply significant biosynthetic costs. Whether and how such costs impact the growth performance are largely open problems. Focusing on carbon-limited E. coli growth, we integrate genome-scale modeling and proteomic data to address these questions at quantitative level. After deriving a simple formula linking growth rate, carbon intake, and biosynthetic costs, we show that optimal growth results from the tradeoff between yield maximization and protein burden minimization. Empirical data confirm that E. coli growth is indeed close to Pareto-optimal over a broad range of growth rates. Moreover, we establish that, while most of the intaken carbon is diverted into biomass precursors, the efficiency of ATP synthesis is the key driver of the yield-cost tradeoff. These findings provide a quantitative perspective on carbon overflow, the origin of growth laws and the multidimensional optimality of E. coli metabolism.","Participatory Action Research as a Framework for Transdisciplinary Collaboration: A Pilot Study on Healthy, Sustainable, Low-Income Housing in Delhi, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069112,"Global challenges (Hoboken, NJ)",2019 05 12,"To tackle global challenges, research collaborations need to integrate multiple disciplinary perspectives and connect with local practices to find solutions that are sustainable and impactful.

By analyzing a transdisciplinary research collaboration investigating housing interventions for low-income settlements in Delhi, reflections and recommendations are provided for other projects wishing to use a similar methodology. It is found that the PAR framework has successfully guided the integration of contrasting methods and improved the impact of research outcomes, resulting in the emergence of new shared practices. However, it proves to be challenging and requires heightened communication and engagement to achieve understanding between all disciplines and practices.

This paper demonstrates an effective method to improve the bias warm-up time of a custom-designed MEMS gyroscope operating in split-mode based on open-loop readout scheme with active suppression of the coupling stiffness (ASCS). A semi-quantitative mathematical model for the temperature sensitivity of the bias is established that indicates the resonant frequency of the primary mode, the frequency difference and the coupling stiffness between the primary and sense modes together with the demodulation phase error, and these are the main factors that affect bias warm-up time. Of all these parameters, the stiffness coupling variation contributes the most to the start-up warm-up time, followed by the phase error drift. The experimental result shows that the bias warm-up time decreases from 2000 to 2 s under the condition that the bias stability (1σ) falls into about 10 deg/h within an hour of testing time using closed-loop control for the coupling stiffness, resulting in a reduction of three orders of magnitude. In addition, the bias instability of the gyroscope is improved two-fold from 4 to 2 deg/h with ASCS.","Multilayered skyscraper microchips fabricated by hybrid ""all-in-one"" femtosecond laser processing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069108,Microsystems & nanoengineering,2019 05 12,"Multilayered microfluidic channels integrated with functional microcomponents are the general trend of future biochips, which is similar to the history of Si-integrated circuits from the planer to the three-dimensional (3D) configuration, since they offer miniaturization while increasing the integration degree and diversifying the applications in the reaction, catalysis, and cell cultures. In this paper, an optimized hybrid processing technology is proposed to create true multilayered microchips, by which ""all-in-one"" 3D microchips can be fabricated with a successive procedure of 3D glass micromachining by femtosecond-laser-assisted wet etching (FLAE) and the integration of microcomponents into the fabricated microchannels by two-photon polymerization (TPP). To create the multilayered microchannels at different depths in glass substrates (the top layer was embedded at 200 μm below the surface, and the underlying layers were constructed with a 200-μm spacing) with high uniformity and quality, the laser power density (13~16.9 TW/cm2) was optimized to fabricate different layers. To simultaneously complete the etching of each layer, which is also important to ensure the high uniformity, the control layers (nonlaser exposed regions) were prepared at the upper ends of the longitudinal channels. Solvents with different dyes were used to verify that each layer was isolated from the others. The high-quality integration was ensured by quantitatively investigating the experimental conditions in TPP, including the prebaking time (18~40 h), laser power density (2.52~2.94 TW/cm2) and developing time (0.8~4 h), all of which were optimized for each channel formed at different depths.

Based on preoperative radiographs, femoral cortical index (FCI) and femoral canal-to-calcar ratio (FCC) were used as measures of CBT and used to classify patients using the Dorr classification. Linear and logistic regression was used to determine whether CBT was predictive of 2-year patient reported outoutcomes. Patients were stratified by sex and age (<45 or =45 years old) to determine whether variables were potential effect modifiers on the association between outcomes and CBT. A total of 108 patients were included in the study, with 27 patients in each of the following groups: females <45, females =45, males <45, and males =45 years. The results showed that at 2-year follow-up, all groups demonstrated significant improvements in reported outcomes (HOS-ADL, HOS-SS, and mHHS) (p<0.001). Females =45 scored significantly worse than other groups on all scores (p<0.05 for all). Chi-square test for trend showed a linear by linear association between Dorr classification type and gender/age group (p=0.018). Analysis of the whole study population showed a linear association between FCC and HOS-ADL and mHHS scores. However, CBT measures were not predictive of achieving MCID. In conclusion, patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAIS, older female patients had the worst patient-reported outcomes and lowest CBT measures. Furthermore, FCC is independently associated with the HOS-ADL and mHHS.",In the name of the rose: a roadmap for rose research in the genome era.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069087,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"The recent completion of the rose genome sequence is not the end of a process, but rather a starting point that opens up a whole set of new and exciting activities. Next to a high-quality genome sequence other genomic tools have also become available for rose, including transcriptomics data, a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array and software to perform linkage and quantitative trait locus mapping in polyploids. Rose cultivars are highly heterogeneous and diverse. This vast diversity in cultivated roses can be explained through the genetic potential of the genus, introgressions from wild species into commercial tetraploid germplasm and the inimitable efforts of historical breeders. We can now investigate how this diversity can best be exploited and refined in future breeding work, given the rich molecular toolbox now available to the rose breeding community. This paper presents possible lines of research now that rose has entered the genomics era, and attempts to partially answer the question that arises after the completion of any draft genome sequence: 'Now that we have ""the"" genome, what's next?'. Having access to a genome sequence will allow both (fundamental) scientific and (applied) breeding-orientated questions to be addressed. We outline possible approaches for a number of these questions.",Rootstock effects on scion phenotypes in a 'Chambourcin' experimental vineyard.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069086,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"Understanding how root systems modulate shoot system phenotypes is a fundamental question in plant biology and will be useful in developing resilient agricultural crops. Grafting is a common horticultural practice that joins the roots (rootstock) of one plant to the shoot (scion) of another, providing an excellent method for investigating how these two organ systems affect each other. In this study, we used the French-American hybrid grapevine 'Chambourcin' (Vitis L.) as a model to explore the rootstock-scion relationship. We examined leaf shape, ion concentrations, and gene expression in 'Chambourcin' grown ungrafted as well as grafted to three different rootstocks ('SO4', '1103P' and '3309C') across 2 years and three different irrigation treatments. We found that a significant amount of the variation in leaf shape could be explained by the interaction between rootstock and irrigation. For ion concentrations, the primary source of variation identified was the position of a leaf in a shoot, although rootstock and rootstock by irrigation interaction also explained a significant amount of variation for most ions. Lastly, we found rootstock-specific patterns of gene expression in grafted plants when compared to ungrafted vines. Thus, our work reveals the subtle and complex effect of grafting on 'Chambourcin' leaf morphology, ionomics, and gene expression.",Updated annotation of the wild strawberry Fragaria vesca V4 genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069085,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"The diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca serves as an ideal model plant for cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa, 8x) and the Rosaceae family. The F. vesca genome was initially published in 2011 using older technologies. Recently, a new and greatly improved F. vesca genome, designated V4, was published. However, the number of annotated genes is remarkably reduced in V4 (28,588 genes) compared to the prior annotations (32,831 to 33,673 genes). Additionally, the annotation of V4 (v4.0.a1) implements a new nomenclature for gene IDs (FvH4_XgXXXXX), rather than the previous nomenclature (geneXXXXX). Hence, further improvement of the V4 genome annotation and assigning gene expression levels under the new gene IDs with existing transcriptome data are necessary to facilitate the utility of this high-quality F. vesca genome V4. Here, we built a new and improved annotation, v4.0.a2, for F. vesca genome V4. The new annotation has a total of 34,007 gene models with 98.1% complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs). In this v4.0.a2 annotation, gene models of 8,342 existing genes are modified, 9,029 new genes are added, and 10,176 genes possess alternatively spliced isoforms with an average of 1.90 transcripts per locus. Transcription factors/regulators and protein kinases are globally identified. Interestingly, the transcription factor family FAr-red-impaired Response 1 (FAR1) contains 82 genes in v4.0.a2 but only two members in v4.0.a1. Additionally, the expression levels of all genes in the new annotation across a total of 46 different tissues and stages are provided. Finally, miRNAs and their targets are reanalyzed and presented. Altogether, this work provides an updated genome annotation of the F. vesca V4 genome as well as a comprehensive gene expression atlas with the new gene ID nomenclature, which will greatly facilitate gene functional studies in strawberry and other evolutionarily related plant species.",Quantitative trait loci controlling Phytophthora cactorum resistance in the cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069084,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"The cultivated strawberry, Fragaria × ananassa  (Fragaria spp.) is the most economically important global soft fruit. Phytophthora cactorum, a water-borne oomycete causes economic losses in strawberry production globally. A bi-parental cross of octoploid cultivated strawberry segregating for resistance to P. cactorum, the causative agent of crown rot disease, was screened using artificial inoculation. Multiple putative resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified and mapped. Three major effect QTL (FaRPc6C, FaRPc6D and FaRPc7D) explained 37% of the variation observed. There were no epistatic interactions detected between the three major QTLs. Testing a subset of the mapping population progeny against a range of P. cactorum isolates revealed no significant interaction (p = 0.0593). However, some lines showed higher susceptibility than predicted, indicating that additional undetected factors may affect the expression of some quantitative resistance loci. Using historic crown rot disease score data from strawberry accessions, a preliminary genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 114 individuals revealed an additional locus associated with resistance to P. cactorum. Mining of the Fragaria vesca Hawaii 4 v1.1 genome revealed candidate resistance genes in the QTL regions.",Optimization and standardization of transient expression assays for gene functional analyses in strawberry fruits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069083,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"Strawberry is increasingly used as a model plant for research on fruit growth and development. The transient gene manipulation (TGM) technique is widely used to determine the function of plant genes, including those in strawberry fruits. However, its reliable application for the precise identification of gene function has been difficult owing to the lack of conditional optimization. In this study, we found that successful transient gene manipulation requires optimization, with the vector type, temperature, and fruit developmental stage being three major factors determining success. Notably, we found that transient gene manipulation was feasible only from the large green fruit stage onwards, making it especially suitable for identifying genes involved in strawberry fruit ripening. Furthermore, we established a method called percentage difference of phenotype (PDP), in which the functional effect of a gene could be precisely and efficiently identified in strawberry fruits. This method can be used to estimate the functional effect of a gene as a value from 0 to 100%, such that different genes can be quantitatively compared for their relative abilities to regulate fruit ripening. This study provides a useful tool for accelerating research on the molecular basis of strawberry fruit ripening.",Transcriptomic analysis of interstock-induced dwarfism in Sweet Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069082,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"Growth monitoring indicated that the height of 'Kanshu' plants with 'Nantong-xiaofangshi' as an interstock was significantly shorter than that of 'Kanshu' plants with no interstock. A transcriptome analysis of the two graft combinations ('Kanshu'/Diospyros lotus and 'Kanshu'/'Nantong-xiaofangshi'/Diospyros lotus) was conducted to explore the dwarfing genes related to the use of the 'Nantong-xiaofangshi' interstock. Hormone levels and water conductance were also measured in these two graft combinations. The results indicated that the levels of both IAA and GA were lower in 'Kanshu' that had been grafted onto the 'Nantong-xiaofangshi' interstock than in 'Kanshu' with no interstock; additionally, the water conductance was lower in grafts with interstocks than in grafts without interstocks. The expression of AUX/IAA and auxin-responsive GH3 genes was enhanced in scions grafted on the interstock and was negatively correlated with the IAA content and growth of scions. The expression of GA2ox, DELLA, and SPINDLY genes were also upregulated and associated with a decrease in the level of GA in scions grafted on the interstock. Since one of the GA2ox unigenes was annotated as DkGA2ox1 in Diospyros kaki, but was not functionally validated, a functional analysis was conducted in transgenic tobacco. Overexpression of DkGA2ox1 in transgenic plants resulted in a dwarf phenotype that could be recovered by the exogenous application of GA3. We conclude that the 'Nantong-xiaofangshi' interstock affects the water conductance and expression of genes related to the metabolism and transduction of IAA and GA in the grafted scion and thus regulates phytohormone levels, producing dwarfing.",MicroRNA396-mediated alteration in plant development and salinity stress response in creeping bentgrass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069081,Horticulture research,2019 05 12,"The conserved microRNA396 (miR396) is involved in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress response in multiple plant species through regulating its targets, Growth Regulating Factor (GRF) transcription factor genes. However, the role of miR396 has not yet been characterized in perennial monocot species. In addition, the molecular mechanism of miR396-mediated abiotic stress response remains unclear. To elucidate the role of miR396 in perennial monocot species, we generated transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing Osa-miR396c, a rice miRNA396 gene. Transgenic plants exhibited altered development, including less shoot and root biomass, shorter internodes, smaller leaf area, fewer leaf veins, and epidermis cells per unit area than those of WT controls. In addition, transgenics showed enhanced salt tolerance associated with improved water retention, increased chlorophyll content, cell membrane integrity, and Na+ exclusion during high salinity exposure. Four potential targets of miR396 were identified in creeping bentgrass and up-regulated in response to salt stress. RNA-seq analysis indicates that miR396-mediated salt stress tolerance requires the coordination of stress-related functional proteins (antioxidant enzymes and Na+/H+ antiporter) and regulatory proteins (transcription factors and protein kinases). This study establishes a miR396-associated molecular pathway to connect the upstream regulatory and downstream functional elements, and provides insight into the miRNA-mediated regulatory networks.",Knowledge and practice of radiation safety among health professionals in Trinidad.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069080,SAGE open medicine,2019 05 12,To determine the practices and knowledge of radiation safety measures among health care providers in tertiary institutions in Trinidad.,Modeling the communication-satisfaction relationship in hospital patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069079,SAGE open medicine,2019 05 12,"Although it has long been known that communication with medical professionals presents a strong relationship with patient satisfaction, research on this topic has been hindered by conceptual and methodological issues (e.g. single-item measures, inclusion of idiosyncratic patient characteristics, etc.). Using a more comprehensive and integrated approach, this study had two objectives: to document the multidimensional structure of the Picker Patient Experience-15, and to test a patient communication/satisfaction model that organizes its dimensions in a conceptually logical array of relationships. First, the factorial structure of the Picker Patient Experience-15 was hypothesized to comprise five dimensions: communication with patient, with family, addressing fears/concerns, preparation for discharge, and patient satisfaction. Second, the hypothesized model included positive relationships between all four communications dimensions, on the one hand, and patient satisfaction, on the other. Within communication dimensions, communication with patient was hypothesized to be the incipient factor for other dimensions, and thus to be positively associated with the other three forms of communication."

Although current therapies are mostly effective and can reduce disease transmission, cholera outbreaks remain deadly, as was seen during recent outbreaks in Haiti, Ethiopia, and Yemen. This is due to significant underlying political and socioeconomic complications, including shortages of vaccines and clean food and water and a lack of health surveillance. In this review, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of current cholera therapies, discuss emerging technologies, and argue that a multi-pronged, flexible approach is needed to continue to reduce the worldwide burden of cholera.",Recent advances in understanding breast cancer and emerging therapies with a focus on luminal and triple-negative breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069063,F1000Research,2019 05 12,"Breast cancer is a global health issue. For decades, breast cancer was classified into many histological subtypes on the basis of microscopic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The discovery of many key genomic driver events involved in breast cancer carcinogenesis resulted in a better understanding of the tumor biology, the disease heterogeneity and the prognosis leading to the discovery of new modalities of targeted therapies and opening horizons toward a more personalized medicine. In recent years, many therapeutic options emerged in the field of metastatic breast carcinoma, especially for the luminal subtypes. They were able to transform the course of the disease while maintaining quality of life.

Neutrophils and their products are thought to be key mediators of the inflammatory changes in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and have been shown to cause many of the pathological features associated with disease, including emphysema and mucus hypersecretion. Patients with COPD also have high rates of bacterial colonisation and recurrent infective exacerbations, suggesting that neutrophil host defence mechanisms are impaired, a concept supported by studies showing alterations to neutrophil migration, degranulation and reactive oxygen species production in cells isolated from patients with COPD. Although the role of neutrophils is best described in COPD, many of the pathological features of this disease are not unique to COPD and also feature in other chronic inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and bronchiectasis. There is increasing evidence for immune cell dysfunction contributing to inflammation in many of these diseases, focusing interest on the neutrophil as a key driver of pulmonary inflammation and a potential therapeutic target than spans diseases. This review discusses the evidence for neutrophilic involvement in COPD and also considers their roles in alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. We provide an in-depth assessment of the role of the neutrophil in each of these conditions, exploring recent advances in understanding, and finally discussing the possibility of common mechanisms across diseases.",Recent developments in psychosocial interventions for borderline personality disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069059,F1000Research,2019 05 12,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects multiple symptomatic domains and is associated with an increased risk of suicidality.

More recent work has focused on tailoring or applying (or both) these existing treatments to specific patient populations, including patients with certain types of comorbidity (for example, BPD and post-traumatic stress disorder or antisocial personality disorder) and younger patients. Other work has involved developing treatments and models of treatment delivery that address concerns related to access of care.

Recent studies indicated that PCOS is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and that women with PCOS are at increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The inflammatory and metabolic derangements associated with PCOS are explained in part by the coexistence of insulin resistance and obesity but are further fueled by the androgen excess. New insights into the regulation of hormones and cytokines in muscle and fat tissue support the concept that PCOS is a systemic syndrome. The therapeutic plan should be tailored to the patient phenotype, complaints, and reproductive desire. Of note, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole seems to be more effective than the reference drug clomiphene citrate to treat infertility due to PCOS.

We discuss critical aspects of ICU-AW that have not been completely defined or that are still under discussion. Critical illness polyneuropathy, myopathy, and muscle atrophy contribute in various proportions to ICU-AW. Diagnosis of ICU-AW is clinical and is based on Medical Research Council sum score and handgrip dynamometry for limb weakness and recognition of a patient's ventilator dependency or difficult weaning from artificial ventilation for diaphragmatic weakness (DW). ICU-AW can be caused by a critical illness polyneuropathy, a critical illness myopathy, or muscle disuse atrophy, alone or in combination. Its diagnosis requires both clinical assessment of muscle strength and complete electrophysiological evaluation of peripheral nerves and muscles. The peroneal nerve test (PENT) is a quick simplified electrophysiological test with high sensitivity and good specificity that can be used instead of complete electrophysiological evaluation as a screening test in non-cooperative patients. DW, assessed by bilateral phrenic nerve magnetic stimulation or diaphragm ultrasound, can be an isolated event without concurrent limb muscle involvement. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether DW and limb weakness are different manifestations of the same syndrome or are two distinct entities. Delirium is often associated with ICU-AW but a clear correlation between these two entities requires further studies. Artificial nutrition may have an impact on ICU-AW, but no study has assessed the impact of nutrition on ICU-AW as the primary outcome. Early mobilization improves activity limitation at hospital discharge if it is started early in the ICU, but beneficial long-term effects are not established. Determinants of ICU-AW can be many and can interact with each other. Therefore, future studies assessing early mobilization should consider a holistic patient approach with consideration of all components that may lead to muscle weakness."

However, discrepancies and controversies about the biology, functions, and potency of MSC-sEVs have arisen due to several factors: the diversity of MSCs and their preparation; various methods of sEV production and separation; a lack of standardized quality assurance assays; and limited reproducibility of in vitro and in vivo functional assays. To address these issues, members of four societies (SOCRATES, ISEV, ISCT and ISBT) propose specific harmonization criteria for MSC-sEVs to facilitate data sharing and comparison, which should help to advance the field towards clinical applications. Specifically, MSC-sEVs should be defined by quantifiable metrics to identify the cellular origin of the sEVs in a preparation, presence of lipid-membrane vesicles, and the degree of physical and biochemical integrity of the vesicles. For practical purposes, new MSC-sEV preparations might also be measured against a well-characterized MSC-sEV biological reference. The ultimate goal of developing these metrics is to map aspects of MSC-sEV biology and therapeutic potency onto quantifiable features of each preparation.",Moving beyond size and phosphatidylserine exposure: evidence for a diversity of apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069027,Journal of extracellular vesicles,2019 05 12,"Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that occurs throughout life as part of normal development as well as pathologic processes including chronic inflammation and infection. Although the death of a cell is often considered as the only biological outcome of a cell committed to apoptosis, it is becoming increasingly clear that the dying cell can actively communicate with other cells via soluble factors as well as membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) to regulate processes including cell clearance, immunity and tissue repair. Compared to EVs generated from viable cells such as exosomes and microvesicles, apoptotic cell-derived EVs (ApoEVs) are less well defined and the basic criteria for ApoEV characterization have not been established in the field. In this study, we will examine the current understanding of ApoEVs, in particular, the ApoEV subtype called apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs). We described that a subset of ApoBDs can be larger than 5 μm and smaller than 1 μm based on flow cytometry and live time-lapse microscopy analysis, respectively. We also described that a subset of ApoBDs can expose a relatively low level of phosphatidylserine on its surface based on annexin A5 staining. Furthermore, we characterized the presence of caspase-cleaved proteins (in particular plasma membrane-associated or cytoplasmic proteins) in samples enriched in ApoBDs. Lastly, using a combination of biochemical-, live imaging- and flow cytometry-based approaches, we characterized the progressive lysis of ApoBDs. Taken together, these results extended our understanding of ApoBDs.",Proteomic characterisation of leech microglia extracellular vesicles (EVs): comparison between differential ultracentrifugation and Optiprep™ density gradient isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069026,Journal of extracellular vesicles,2019 05 12,"In Mammals, microglial cells are considered as the resident immune cells in central nervous system (CNS). Many studies demonstrated that, after injury, these cells are activated and recruited at the lesion site. Leech microglia present a similar pattern of microglial activation and migration upon experimental lesion of CNS. This activation is associated with the release of a large amount of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We collected EVs released by microglia primary culture and compared two different protocols of isolation: one with differential ultracentrifugation (UC) and one using an additional Optiprep™ Density Gradient (ODG) ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to assess vesicles size and morphology. The protein content of isolated EVs was assessed by mass spectrometry approaches. Results showed the presence of EV-specific proteins in both procedures. The extensive proteomic analysis of each single ODG fractions confirmed the efficiency of this protocol in limiting the presence of co-isolated proteins aggregates and other membranous particles during vesicles isolation. The present study permitted for the first time the characterisation of microglial EV protein content in an annelid model. Interestingly, an important amount of proteins found in leech vesicles was previously described in EV-specific databases. Finally, purified EVs were assessed for neurotrophic activity and promote neurites outgrowth on primary cultured neurons.",Trajectories of stress biomarkers and anxious-depressive symptoms from pregnancy to postpartum period in women with a trauma history.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069025,European journal of psychotraumatology,2019 05 12,"Background: Cross-sectional studies have found that a trauma history can be associated with anxious-depressive symptomatology and physiological stress dysregulation in pregnant women. Methods: This prospective study examines the trajectories of both anxiety and depressive symptoms and salivary cortisol and α-amylase biomarkers from women with (n = 42) and without (n = 59) a trauma history at (i) 38th week of gestation (T1), (ii) 48 hours after birth (T2), and (iii) three months after birth (T3). Results: The quantile regression model showed that trauma history was associated with higher cortisol levels at T1 and this difference was sustained along T2 and T3. Conversely, there were no significant differences in α-amylase levels between groups across the three time points and both groups showed an increase in α-amylase levels from T2 to T3. The ordinal mixed model showed that trauma history was associated with higher anxiety symptoms at T1 and this remained constant from T1 to T2 but was reversed from T2 to T3. In contrast, both groups showed similar depressive symptoms across the three time points. Conclusions: Whereas physiological stress dysregulation (in terms of higher cortisol levels) was maintained from pregnancy to postpartum period, pregnancy and childbirth were the most vulnerable stages for developing anxious symptoms in mothers with trauma history."

Safer and more effective diagnostic methods for liver cancer are desirable, and biomarkers represent a potentially alternative method for diagnosis. The present study was designed to identify liver cancer biomarkers. We quantified the changes in serum protein levels between liver transplantation and healthy (control) females using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) as well as proteomic analysis. A total of 1399 proteins were identified; of these, three proteins showed significantly different concentrations between the before transplantation group and the control group. These proteins may thus be relevant to liver cancer and constitute potential liver cancer biomarkers.","The triacylglycerol, hydroxytriolein, inhibits triple negative mammary breast cancer cell proliferation through a mechanism dependent on dihydroceramide and Akt.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069012,Oncotarget,2019 05 12,"The plasma membrane is an attractive target for new anticancer drugs, not least because regulating its lipid structure can control multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Accordingly, the novel anticancer drug hydroxytriolein (HTO) was designed to interact with and regulate the composition and structure of the membrane, which in turn controls the interaction of amphitropic signaling membrane proteins with the lipid bilayer. Changes in signaling provoked by HTO impair the growth of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, aggressive breast tumor cells that have a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancers and for which there is as yet no effective targeted therapy. HTO alters the lipid composition and structure of cancer cell membranes, inhibiting the growth of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 TNBC cells in vitro. Depending on the cellular context, HTO could regulate two pathways involved in TNBC cell proliferation. On the one hand, HTO might stimulate ERK signaling and induce TNBC cell autophagy, while on the other, it could increase dihydroceramide and ceramide production, which would inhibit Akt independently of EGFR activation and provoke cell death. In vivo studies using a model of human TNBC show that HTO and its fatty acid constituent (2-hydroxyoleic acid) impair tumor growth, with no undesired side effects. For these reasons, HTO appears to be a promising anticancer molecule that targets the lipid bilayer (membrane-lipid therapy). By regulating membrane lipids, HTO controls important signaling pathways involved in cancer cell growth, the basis of its pharmacological efficacy and safety.",Plasma RANKL levels are not associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069010,Oncotarget,2019 05 12,"Aberrant progesterone/receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ (RANK) signaling has been implicated in BRCA1 breast cancer development.

This study describes LuPRLT, either LuPSMA I&T or LuPSMA RLT-617, for 45 patients with predominant lymph node metastatic prostate cancer (LNM PC). Thirty-five patients had LNM and ten patients had LNM and one or two bone metastases. Before LuPRLT, the patients had prostate specific antigen (PSA) of median 18 µg/l (interquartile range (IQR): 3.3-39). LuPRLT was given with a cumulative injected 177Lu activity of median 14.5 GBq (IQR: 12.2-20.4). Maximum percentage decline of PSA was median 92% (IQR: 70-99). Thirty-five patients with only LNM had a better overall survival (OS) than ten patients with LNM and one or two bone metastases. Thirty-three docetaxel-naïve patients had a longer PSMA PET/CT progression-free survival than twelve patients who were resistant to docetaxel. Twenty-two patients who received LuPRLT with a cumulative injected 177Lu activity ≥ 14.8 GBq had a better PSMA PET/CT progression-free survival than 23 patients who received LuPRLT with a lower cumulative injected 177Lu activity. Seventeen patients with relapse after LuPRLT who received rechallenge LuPRLT or ActPRLT had a better OS than five patients who received other forms for relapse treatment. LuPRLT gave mild and transitory adverse effects. The findings of the present study suggest that LuPRLT of patients with LNM may be effective and safe. The promising results motivate randomized phase II trials to further quantify the impact of LuPRLT as treatment of patients with LNM.",Development and characterization of a cancer cachexia model employing a rare human duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma-originating cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069007,Oncotarget,2019 05 12,"Cancer cachexia interferes with therapy and worsens patients' quality of life. Therefore, for a better understanding of cachexia, we aimed to establish a reliable cell line to develop a cachexia model. We recently established and characterized the TCC-NECT-2 cell line, derived from a Japanese patient with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the duodenum (D-NEC). Subcutaneous xenograft of TCC-NECT-2 cells in mice resulted in tumor formation, angiogenesis, and 20% incidence of body weight (BW)-loss. Subsequently, we isolated a potent cachexia-inducing subline using stepwise selection and designated as AkuNEC. Orthotopic and s.c. implantation of AkuNEC cells into mice led to diminished BW, anorexia, skeletal muscle atrophy, adipose tissue loss, and decreased locomotor activity at 100% incidence. Additionally, orthotopic implantation of AkuNEC cells resulted in metastasis and angiogenesis. Serum IL-8 overproduction was observed, and levels were positively correlated with BW-loss and reduced adipose tissue and muscle volumes in tumor-bearing mice. However, shRNA knockdown of the IL-8 gene did not suppress tumor growth and cachexia in the AkuNEC model, indicating that IL-8 is not directly involved in cachexia induction. In conclusion, AkuNEC cells may serve as a useful model to study cachexia and D-NEC.",Prediction of onset of remnant gastric cancer by promoter DNA methylation of CDO1/HOPX/Reprimo/E-cadherin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069006,Oncotarget,2019 05 12,"Early detection of remnant gastric cancer (RGC) is required to reduce the risk of death, but long-term endoscopic surveillance is difficult after gastrectomy.

However, the selectivity to benzaldehyde was significantly improved with increasing presence of Zn. The effect of reduction temperature on catalyst activity was investigated for the catalyst having a Pd to Zn metal molar ratio of 9:1. It was found that lower reduction temperature leads to the formation of PdZn nanoparticles with a wide particle size distribution.

This system already represents a highly CO2-selective MSR catalyst with ~93% selectivity, but only 56% methanol conversion and a maximum H2 formation rate of 1.3 µmol gCu-1 s-1. After reduction at 400 °C, the system enters an In2O3-supported intermetallic compound state with Cu2In as the majority phase.

However, in recent clinical contexts, biopharmaceuticals' effects on immune responses have come to light, requiring that researchers substantively explore the potential negative side effects of nanocarrier systems and of therapeutic proteins in order to develop nanocarrier systems suitable for clinical use. The present review describes current insights into both toxicological and immunological issues regarding polymeric-micelle carrier systems.

Due to the low frequency of colleters and lack of visible secretion in E. crinipes, histochemical tests and chemical analyses were not performed for this species. Colleters are of a brush type and their secretion has, at the same time, hydrophilic and lipophilic components. Histochemical tests further revealed the presence of pectin, mucilage, lipids, terpenes, phenolic compounds, and proteins. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of γ-sitosterol and palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids in the secretion of E. brasiliensis. Infrared analysis indicated the possible presence of polysaccharides in the secretion. The occurrence of colleters in both species studied and in other orchids described in the literature suggests that these structures are common in the inflorescences of tropical orchids. In these environments, the hydrated polysaccharides in the secretion form a dense matrix that can act as a physical barrier, and terpenes may help to protect against herbivores and pathogenic microorganisms. This information broadens our knowledge of the morphological and chemical diversity of the secretions produced by orchid colleters.",Gamete Nuclear Migration in Animals and Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068960,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"The migration of male and female gamete nuclei to each other in the fertilized egg is a prerequisite for the blending of genetic materials and the initiation of the next generation. Interestingly, many differences have been found in the mechanism of gamete nuclear movement among animals and plants. Female to male gamete nuclear movement in animals and brown algae relies on microtubules. By contrast, in flowering plants, the male gamete nucleus is carried to the female gamete nucleus by the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. As techniques have developed from light, electron, fluorescence, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy to live-cell time-lapse imaging using fluorescently labeled proteins, details of these differences in gamete nuclear migration have emerged in a wide range of eukaryotes. Especially, gamete nuclear migration in flowering plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize, and tobacco has been further investigated, and showed high conservation of the mechanism, yet, with differences among these species. Here, with an emphasis on recent developments in flowering plants, we survey gamete nuclear migration in different eukaryotic groups and highlight the differences and similarities among species.",Pinus Susceptibility to Pitch Canker Triggers Specific Physiological Responses in Symptomatic Plants: An Integrated Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068959,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"Fusarium circinatum, the causal agent of pine pitch canker (PPC), is an emergent and still understudied risk that threatens Pinus forests worldwide, with potential production and sustainability losses. In order to explore the response of pine species with distinct levels of susceptibility to PPC, we investigated changes in physiology, hormones, specific gene transcripts, and primary metabolism occurring in symptomatic Pinus pinea, Pinus pinaster, and Pinus radiata upon inoculation with F. circinatum. Pinus radiata and P. pinaster exhibiting high and intermediate susceptibility to PPC, respectively, suffered changes in plant water status and photosynthetic impairment. This was associated with sink metabolism induction, a general accumulation of amino acids and overexpression of pathogenesis-related genes. On the other hand, P. pinea exhibited the greatest resistance to PPC and stomatal opening, transpiration increase, and glycerol accumulation were observed in inoculated plants. A stronger induction of pyruvate decarboxylase transcripts and differential hormones regulation were also found for inoculated P. pinea in comparison with the susceptible Pinus species studied. The specific physiological changes reported herein are the first steps to understand the complex Pinus-Fusarium interaction and create tools for the selection of resistant genotypes thus contributing to disease mitigation.",Leveraging Image Analysis for High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068958,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"The complex interaction between a genotype and its environment controls the biophysical properties of a plant, manifested in observable traits, i.e., plant's phenome, which influences resources acquisition, performance, and yield. High-throughput automated image-based plant phenotyping refers to the sensing and quantifying plant traits non-destructively by analyzing images captured at regular intervals and with precision. While phenomic research has drawn significant attention in the last decade, extracting meaningful and reliable numerical phenotypes from plant images especially by considering its individual components, e.g., leaves, stem, fruit, and flower, remains a critical bottleneck to the translation of advances of phenotyping technology into genetic insights due to various challenges including lighting variations, plant rotations, and self-occlusions. The paper provides (1) a framework for plant phenotyping in a multimodal, multi-view, time-lapsed, high-throughput imaging system; (2) a taxonomy of phenotypes that may be derived by image analysis for better understanding of morphological structure and functional processes in plants; (3) a brief discussion on publicly available datasets to encourage algorithm development and uniform comparison with the state-of-the-art methods; (4) an overview of the state-of-the-art image-based high-throughput plant phenotyping methods; and (5) open problems for the advancement of this research field.",Closing the Yield Gap for Cannabis: A Meta-Analysis of Factors Determining Cannabis Yield.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068957,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"Until recently, the commercial production of Cannabis sativa was restricted to varieties that yielded high-quality fiber while producing low levels of the psychoactive cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In the last few years, a number of jurisdictions have legalized the production of medical and/or recreational cannabis with higher levels of THC, and other jurisdictions seem poised to follow suit. Consequently, demand for industrial-scale production of high yield cannabis with consistent cannabinoid profiles is expected to increase. In this paper we highlight that currently, projected annual production of cannabis is based largely on facility size, not yield per square meter. This meta-analysis of cannabis yields reported in scientific literature aimed to identify the main factors contributing to cannabis yield per plant, per square meter, and per W of lighting electricity. In line with previous research we found that variety, plant density, light intensity and fertilization influence cannabis yield and cannabinoid content; we also identified pot size, light type and duration of the flowering period as predictors of yield and THC accumulation. We provide insight into the critical role of light intensity, quality, and photoperiod in determining cannabis yields, with particular focus on the potential for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve growth and reduce energy requirements. We propose that the vast amount of genomics data currently available for cannabis can be used to better understand the effect of genotype on yield. Finally, we describe diversification that is likely to emerge in cannabis growing systems and examine the potential role of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) for growth promotion, regulation of cannabinoid biosynthesis, and biocontrol.",Flower and Pod Source Influence on Pea Weevil (Bruchus pisorum) Oviposition Capacity and Preference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068956,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"Bruchus pisorum is an insect pest causing major damage to pea seeds worldwide. Control is difficult and limited resistance is available. In this work we studied the effects of pollen and pod source on insect fecundity and oviposition by comparing resistant and susceptible Pisum spp. accessions and non-host (Lathyrus sativus and Vicia faba) species. A first no-choice assay revealed that the source of flower offered to adults for feeding might retard oviposition (the case of V. faba), reduce fertility (Pisum sativum ssp. syriacum, P. fulvum, and V. faba) or increase adult mortality (V. faba and P. sativum ssp. syriacum). A second no-choice assay with all adults fed with pollen of the same pea cultivar showed significant effect of the source of pods offered. Oviposition was reduced on pods of some resistant Pisum accessions, but particularly low on pods of the non-hosts, being retarded if ever happening and coupled with high mortality of adults. This was confirmed in a third experiment consisting on dual-choice assays showing reduced egg laying in V. faba, L. sativus, P. fulvum, and P. sativum ssp. syriacum compared to the commercial variety pea used as a control (Messire).",Detoxification of Reactive Carbonyl Species by Glutathione Transferase Tau Isozymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068955,Frontiers in plant science,2019 05 12,"Oxidative stimuli to living cells results in the formation of lipid peroxides, from which various aldehydes and ketones (oxylipin carbonyls) are inevitably produced. Among the oxylipin carbonyls, those with an α,β-unsaturated bond are designated as reactive carbonyl species (RCS) because they have high electrophilicity and biological activity. Plants have arrays of dehydrogenases and reductases to metabolize a variety of RCS that occur in the cells, but these enzymes are not efficient to scavenge the most toxic RCS (i.e., acrolein) because they have only low affinity. Two glutathione transferase (GST) isozymes belonging to the plant-specific Tau class were recently observed to scavenge acrolein with KM values at a submillimolar level. This suggests that GST could also be involved in the defense system against RCS. We tested the activities of 23 Tau isozymes of Arabidopsis thaliana for five types of RCS, and the results revealed that 11 isozymes recognized either acrolein or 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal or both as a substrate(s). Such RCS-scavenging activities indicate the potential contribution of GST to RCS scavenging in plants, and they may account for the stress tolerance conferred by several Tau isozymes. RCS are therefore a strong candidate for endogenous substrates of plant GSTs.",Dynamics of the Type I Interferon Response During Immunosuppressive Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068954,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Objective: The type I interferon (IFN) response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been extensively studied in relation to therapy with biological DMARDs (bDMARDs). However, the effect of conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs and glucocorticoids (GCs) on IFN response gene (IRG) expression remains largely unknown, even though csDMARDS are used throughout all disease phases, including simultaneously with biologic therapy. This study was aimed to determine the dynamics of IFN response upon immunosuppressive treatment. Methods: Whole blood was collected in PAXgene tubes from 35 RA patients who received either COBRA therapy (combination of prednisone, initially 60 mg, methotrexate and sulfasalazine) (n = 14) or COBRA-light therapy (prednisone, initially 30 mg, and methotrexate) (n = 21). Expression of 10 IRGs was determined by real-time PCR at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T4), and 13 weeks (T13) of treatment. IRG selection was based on the differential presence of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), in order to study the therapy effect on different pathway components involved in IFN signaling. Results: Seven of the 10 IRGs displayed significant changes during treatment (p ≤ 0.016). These 7 IRGs all displayed a particularly pronounced decrease between T0 and T4 (≥1.6-fold, p ≤ 0.0059). The differences between IRG sensitivity to the treatment appeared related to the presence of TFBS for STAT1 and IRF proteins within the genes. The extent of the decreases between T0 and T4 was similar for the COBRA- and COBRA-light-treated group, despite the differences in drug combination and doses in those groups. Between T4 and T13, however, IRG expression in the COBRA-light-treated group displayed a significant increase, whereas it remained stable or decreased even further in most COBRA-treated patients (comparison of mean fold changes, p = 0.011). A significant association between IRG dynamics and clinical response to therapy was not detected. Conclusions: Immunosuppressive treatment with csDMARDs, in this case a combination of prednisolone, methotrexate and sulfasalazine, substantially downregulates the IFN response in RA patients. The dynamics of this downregulation were partly dependent on the presence of TFBS within the IRGs and the combination and dosages of agents, but they were irrespective of the clinical response to therapy."

The canonical TRC repertoire (TRAC, TRBC, TRGC, and TRDC) codes C regions of T cell receptor chains that form the primary antigen receptors involved in the activation of cellular immunity. At present, little is known about the correlation between the evolution of mammalian TRC genes and ecological factors. In this study, four types canonical of TRC genes were identified from 37 mammalian species. Phylogenetic comparative methods (phyANOVA and PGLS) and selective pressure analyses among different groups of ecological factors (habitat, diet, and sociality) were carried out. The results showed that habitat was the major ecological factor shaping mammalian TRC repertoires. Specifically, trade-off between TRGC numbers and positive selection of TRAC and the balanced evolutionary rates between TRAC and TRDC genes were speculated as two main mechanisms in adaption to habitat and sociality. Overall, our study suggested divergent mechanisms for the evolution of TRCs, prompting mammalian immunity adaptions within diverse niches.",Increased Akt-Driven Glycolysis Is the Basis for the Higher Potency of CD137L-DCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068941,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"CD137 ligand-induced dendritic cells (CD137L-DCs) are a new type of dendritic cells (DCs) that induce strong cytotoxic T cell responses. Investigating the metabolic activity as a potential contributing factor for their potency, we find a significantly higher rate of glycolysis in CD137L-DCs than in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 4 induced monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Using unbiased screening, Akt-mTORC1 activity was found to be significantly higher throughout the differentiation and maturation of CD137L-DCs than that of moDCs. Furthermore, this higher activity of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway is responsible for the significantly higher glycolysis rate in CD137L-DCs than in moDCs. Inhibition of Akt during maturation or inhibition of glycolysis during and after maturation resulted in suppression of inflammatory DCs, with mature CD137L-DCs being the most affected ones. mTORC1, instead, was indispensable for the differentiation of both CD137L-DCs and moDCs. In contrast to its role in supporting lipid synthesis in murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), the higher glycolysis rate in CD137L-DCs does not lead to a higher lipid content but rather to an accumulation of succinate and serine. These data demonstrate that the increased Akt-driven glycolysis underlies the higher activity of CD137L-DCs.",CD28 Individual Signaling Up-regulates Human IL-17A Expression by Promoting the Recruitment of RelA/NF-κB and STAT3 Transcription Factors on the Proximal Promoter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068940,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"CD28 is an important co-stimulatory receptor for T lymphocytes that, in humans, delivers TCR-independent signal leading to the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have recently reported that CD28 autonomous signaling induces the expression of IL-17A in peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes patients. Due to the relevance of IL-17A in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, we characterized the mechanisms and signaling mediators responsible for CD28-induced IL-17A expression. Here we show that CD28-mediated up-regulation of IL-17A gene expression depends on RelA/NF-κB and IL-6-associated STAT3 transcriptions factors. In particular, we found that CD28-activated RelA/NF-κB induces the expression of IL-6 that, in a positive feedback loop, mediates the activation and nuclear translocation of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). pSTAT3 in turn cooperates with RelA/NF-κB by binding specific sequences within the proximal promoter of human IL-17A gene, thus inducing its expression. Finally, by using specific inhibitory drugs, we also identified class 1A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as a critical upstream regulator of CD28-mediated RelA/NF-κB and STAT3 recruitments and trans-activation of IL-17A promoter. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which human CD28 may amplify IL-17A expression in human T lymphocytes and provide biological bases for immunotherapeutic approaches targeting CD28-associated class 1A PI3K to dampen IL-17A-mediated inflammatory response in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders.",Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37 Facilitates Intracellular Uptake of RNA Aptamer Apt 21-2 Without Inducing an Inflammatory or Interferon Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068939,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"RNA aptamers are synthetic single stranded RNA oligonucleotides that function analogously to antibodies. Recently, they have shown promise for use in treating inflammatory skin disease as, unlike antibody-based biologics, they are able to enter the skin following topical administration. However, it is important to understand the inflammatory milieu into which aptamers are delivered, as numerous immune-modulating mediators will be present at abnormal levels. LL-37 is an important immune-modifying protein upregulated in several inflammatory skin conditions, including psoriasis, rosacea and eczema. This inflammatory antimicrobial peptide is known to complex nucleic acids and induce both inflammatory and interferon responses from keratinocytes. Given the attractive notion of using RNA aptamers in topical medication and the prevalence of LL-37 in these inflammatory skin conditions, we examined the effect of LL-37 on the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A RNA aptamer, Apt 21-2. LL-37 was demonstrated to complex with the RNA aptamer by electrophoretic mobility shift and filter binding assays. In contrast to free Apt 21-2, LL-37-complexed Apt 21-2 was observed to efficiently enter both keratinocytes and fibroblasts by confocal microscopy. Despite internalization of LL-37-complexed aptamers, measurement of inflammatory mediators and interferon stimulated genes showed LL-37-complexed Apt 21-2 remained immunologically inert in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells including infiltrating dendritic cells and monocytes. The findings of this study suggest RNA aptamers delivered into an inflammatory milieu rich in LL-37 may become complexed and subsequently internalized by surrounding cells in the skin. Whilst the results of this study indicate delivery of RNA aptamers into tissue rich in LL-37 should not cause an unwarranted inflammatory of interferon response, these results have significant implications for the efficacy of aptamers with regards to extracellular vs. intracellular targets that should be taken into consideration when developing treatment strategies utilizing RNA aptamers in inflamed tissue.",Methylglyoxal-Derived Advanced Glycation Endproducts Accumulate in Multiple Sclerosis Lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068938,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease in which innate and adaptive immune cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) and damage the myelin sheaths surrounding the axons. Upon activation, infiltrated macrophages, CNS-resident microglia, and astrocytes switch their metabolism toward glycolysis, resulting in the formation of α-dicarbonyls, such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO). These potent glycating agents lead to the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) after reaction with amino acids. We hypothesize that AGE levels are increased in MS lesions due to the inflammatory activation of macrophages and astrocytes. First, we measured tissue levels of AGEs in brain samples of MS patients and controls. Analysis of MS patient and non-demented control (NDC) specimens showed a significant increase in protein-bound Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine (MG-H1), the major AGE, compared to white matter of NDCs (107 ± 11 vs. 154 ± 21, p < 0.05). In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that MGO-derived AGEs were specifically present in astrocytes, whereas the receptor for AGEs, RAGE, was detected on microglia/macrophages. Moreover, in cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients, α-dicarbonyls and free AGEs correlated with their respective levels in the plasma, whereas this was not observed for protein-bound AGEs. Taken together, our data show that MG-H1 is produced by astrocytes. This suggests that AGEs secreted by astrocytes have paracrine effects on RAGE-positive macrophages/microglia and thereby contribute to the pathology of MS.",The Differentiation in vitro of Human Tonsil B Cells With the Phenotypic and Functional Characteristics of T-bet+ Atypical Memory B Cells in Malaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068937,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Malaria is a deadly infectious disease associated with fundamental changes in the composition of the memory B cell (MBC) compartment, most notably a large expansion of T-bet+ MBCs, termed atypical MBCs. However, we know little about the precursors of atypical MBCs and the conditions that drive their differentiation. We compared the responses of human tonsil naïve B cells, MBCs, and germinal center B cells to a variety of stimulatory conditions. We determined that prolonged antigen presentation in the presence of CpG and IFN-γ induced maximal expression of T-bet and other phenotypic markers of malaria-associated atypical MBCs primarily in naïve B cells in vitro. Importantly T-bet+ naïve-derived B cells resembled atypical MBCs in their hypo-responsiveness to signaling through their B cell receptors. Thus, naïve B cells can be induced to differentiate into phenotypically and functionally atypical-like MBCs in vitro under conditions that may prevail in chronic infectious diseases in vivo.",A Novel Triple-Cell Two-Dimensional Model to Study Immune-Vascular Interplay in Atherosclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068936,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory pathology underpinning cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. The interplay between vascular stromal cells and immune cells is fundamental to the progression and outcome of atherosclerotic disease, however, the majority of in vitro studies do not consider the implications of these interactions and predominantly use mono-culture approaches. Here we present a simple and robust methodology involving the co-culture of vascular endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) alongside an inflammatory compartment, in our study containing THP-1 macrophages, for studying these complex interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the interaction between vascular stromal and immune cells produces unique cellular phenotypes and soluble mediator profiles not observed in double-cell 2D cultures. Our results highlight the importance of cellular communication and support the growing idea that in vitro research must evolve from mono-culture systems to provide data more representative of the multi-cellular environment found in vivo. The methodology presented, in comparison with established approaches, has the advantage of being technically simple whilst enabling the isolation of pure populations of ECs, SMCs and immune cells directly from the co-culture without cell sorting. The approach described within would be applicable to those studying mechanisms of vascular inflammation, particularly in relation to understanding the impact cellular interaction has on the cumulative immune-vascular response to atherogenic or inflammatory stimuli.",Human Pancreatic Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Expression of Co-inhibitory Markers on CD4+ and CD8+ T-Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068935,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Carcinoma-associated pancreatic fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major type of cells in the stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and besides their pathological release of extracellular matrix proteins, they are also perceived as key contributors to immune evasion. Despite the known relevance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in cancers, the interactions between T-cells and CAFs remain largely unexplored. Here, we found that CAFs isolated from tumors of pancreatic cancer patients undergoing surgical resection (n = 15) expressed higher levels of the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 compared to primary skin fibroblasts from healthy donors. CAFs strongly inhibited T-cell proliferation in a contact-independent fashion. Blocking the activity of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by indomethacin partially restored the proliferative capacity of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. After stimulation, the proportion of proliferating T-cells expressing HLA-DR and the proportion of memory T-cells were decreased when CAFs were present compared to T-cells proliferating in the absence of CAFs. Interestingly, CAFs promoted the expression of TIM-3, PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in proliferating T-cells. Immunohistochemistry stainings further showed that T-cells residing within the desmoplastic stromal compartment express PD-1, indicating a role for CAFs on co-inhibitory marker expression also in vivo. We further found that PGE2 promoted the expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on T-cells. Functional assays showed that proliferating T-cells expressing immune checkpoints produced less IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CD107a after restimulation when CAFs had been present. Thus, this indicates that CAFs induce expression of immune checkpoints on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, which contribute to a diminished immune function.",Clinical Advances in Immunonutrition and Atherosclerosis: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068933,Frontiers in immunology,2019 05 12,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disease that affects large and medium-sized arteries and is considered to be a major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The high risk of mortality by atherosclerosis has led to the development of new strategies for disease prevention and management, including immunonutrition.

However, many of these correlations have been obtained in vitro and in experimental animals' models. On one hand, the present review focuses on the evidence obtained from epidemiological, dietary intervention and supplementation studies in humans supporting the role of immunonutrient supplementation and its effect on anti-inflammatory response in atherosclerotic disease. On the other hand, this review also analyzes the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the protective action of these supplements, which may lead a novel therapeutic approach to prevent or attenuate diet-related disease, such as atherosclerosis.",Emerging Role of Lymphocyte Antigen-6 Family of Genes in Cancer and Immune Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068932,Frontiers in immunology,2019 06 10,"Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1/Ly6A) was the first identified member of the Lymphocyte antigen-6 (Ly6) gene family. Sca-1 serves as a marker of cancer stem cells and tissue resident stem cells in mice. The Sca-1 gene is located on mouse chromosome 15. While a direct homolog of Sca-1 in humans is missing, human chromosome 8-the syntenic region to mouse chromosome 15-harbors several genes containing the characteristic domain known as LU domain. The function of the LU domain in human LY6 gene family is not yet defined. The LY6 gene family proteins are present on human chromosome 6, 8, 11, and 19. The most interesting of these genes are located on chromosome 8q24.3, a frequently amplified locus in human cancer. Human LY6 genes represent novel biomarkers for poor cancer prognosis and are required for cancer progression in addition to playing an important role in immune escape. Although the mechanism associated with these phenotype is not yet clear, it is timely to review the current literature in order to address the critical need for future advancements in this field. This review will summarize recent findings which describe the role of human LY6 genes-LY6D, LY6E, LY6H, LY6K, PSCA, LYPD2, SLURP1, GML, GPIHBP1, and LYNX1; and their orthologs in mice at chromosome 15."
