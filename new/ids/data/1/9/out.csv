Craniofacial malformations belong to the broad spectrum of the OI phenotype. The introduction of bisphosphonate medications was intended to counteract the significant brittleness of the bones of OI patients. In connection with the application of bisphosphonates, drug-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw has become known as an undesirable effect of the therapeutically intended reduction of osteoclast activity. Originally, the pharmacological inhibition of bone loss was mainly used in oncological therapy. For some time now, osteoporosis has also been treated with substances that inhibit bone resorption. In OI, malposition of the jaws is relatively common, in particular retrognathia of the maxilla and progeny of the mandible. The literature discloses complications of orthognathic surgery in OI patients. Previous literature reviews suggest that bisphosphonate medication has no significant impact on the performance of and healing after oral surgery in OI patients. Materialandmethods: An essential prerequisite of a therapy adapted to the patient's condition is the knowledge of the patient's medical history. This case report describes the orthodontic-surgical treatment of an OI patient and the treatment experience derived in dealing with the condition. The unusual circumstance of this case is that the patient had concealed both his underlying disease and his medication during the current treatment period. In addition, the relevant literature is evaluated for combining the keywords OI, orthodontic therapy, bisphosphonates, and orthognathic surgery. Results: Based on the literature and our own experience, it is concluded that orthodontic treatment with bisphosphonate medication can also be carried out in OI patients. However, considerably greater forces and longer time intervals should be scheduled for each treatment. Orthognathic surgery with bisphosphonate medication turned out to be uncomplicated in our own case, considering the underlying disease in the planning of surgical procedures. However, there have been very few reports of OI patients in whom orthodontic-surgical treatment of jaw malformation has been performed with bisphosphonate medication. Conclusion: Taking into account the reported experience of severe complications of orthognathic surgery, the multiple documented adjustments to the treatment strategy of OI patients should be taken seriously. The basic condition of therapy adapted to the disease is that the patient informs the practitioner in an appropriate manner about his or her state of health.",Systematic review of case reports of Japanese esophageal neuroendocrine cell carcinoma in the Japanese literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149547,International cancer conference journal,2019 06 10,"Esophageal neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (NEC) is extremely rare, and its treatment strategy has not been established. Systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to assess the treatment and prognosis of patients with esophageal NEC in Japan. The Ichushi-Web database was searched from January 1964 to May 2018. In total, 141 cases of esophageal NEC were included in the analysis. The survival of the chemotherapy group with stage II/III esophageal NEC was better than that of the surgery group. Meanwhile, the survival of the adjuvant treatment group with stage II/III esophageal NEC was significantly better than that of the surgery alone group. In patients with stage IV esophageal NEC, no significant differences were observed in terms of treatment response from the three regimens: irinotecan/platinum and etoposide/platinum compared with 5-fluorouracil/platinum. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the survival of patients who received the chemotherapy regimens. However, the 2-year survival rates of the irinotecan/platinum (26%) group and etoposide/platinum (27%) group were higher than that of the 5-fluorouracil/platinum (0%) group. In esophageal NEC, chemotherapy may be used as the first-line treatment. Irinotecan/platinum or etoposide/platinum can be the first-line regimen for chemotherapy. However, the additive effects of surgery remain unclear.",Mesenteric excision for esophageal cancer surgery: based on the concept of mesotracheoesophagus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149528,International cancer conference journal,2019 06 10,"The fundamental principle of surgery for intestinal cancer is mesenteric excision. It has been widely accepted as radical surgery for colorectal cancer, and it comprises procedures such as complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. So far, the concept of mesenteric excision of the esophagus has not been well documented, but our surgical experience with a magnified view using a thoracoscope and understanding of the surgical anatomy based on embryologic foregut development has led us to introduce the concept of mesotracheoesophagus. Using this concept, our technique is reproducible, effective, and safe for lymph node dissection along the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Here we report our concept, procedure, and results of thoracoscopic esophageal cancer surgery.","Evidence for low prevalence of ranaviruses in Ontario, Canada's freshwater turtle population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149410,PeerJ,2019 06 10,"Ontario, Canada is home to eight native species of turtles; all eight are federally listed as Species At Risk, due to anthropogenic threats. However, until recently, reports of infectious disease have been lacking. Ranavirus is seen as an emerging threat for ectotherms globally, with mass die-offs most often reported in amphibians. Ranavirus has been detected in Ontario's amphibian populations, can be transmitted via water, and can be transmitted from amphibians to turtles. However, no studies on the prevalence of this virus in Ontario's turtles have previously been carried out. With recent reports of two confirmed positive case of ranavirus in turtles in Ontario, a knowledge of the ecology of ranavirus in Ontario's turtles has become even more important. This study estimates the prevalence of ranavirus in Ontario's turtles, and investigates the hypothesis that this is a newly emergent disease.",Actuopaleoichnology of a modern Bay of Fundy macro-tidal flat: analogy with a Mississippian tidal flat deposit (Hartselle Sandstone) from Alabama.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149409,PeerJ,2019 06 10,"Trace fossil zonation in the Hartselle Sandstone of Mississippian age (Chesterian: Visean-Serpukhovian) exposed on Fielder Ridge, Alabama is compared with modern macro-tidal flat ichnocoenoses on the Bay of Fundy at Lubec, Maine, and demonstrated to be analogous by sedimentologic and ichnotaxonomic criteria. The modern flat has minimal influence from either waves or freshwater influx, and can be divided into five distinct ichnocoenoses, characterized by surface traces (epichnia) and four sedimentologic facies defined by gross grain texture or hydrodynamic characteristics, but lacking significant surface traces. Several characteristics of tidal flat deposits in a fetch-limited, marine (i.e., non-estuarine), meso- to macro-tidal regime can be used to recognize similar environments as old as the late Paleozoic. These criteria include (1) limited influence of wind and waves on the depositional environment, (2) lack of significant freshwater influence and therefore any persistent brackish environments, (3) a distinct spatial distribution of microenvironments defined by substrate and exposure period, (4) high diversity of epichnial traces directly associated with microenvironments across the tidal flat, (5) generally low degree of reworking of traces by bioturbation but high degree of reworking by tidal currents, and (6) preservation of traces of predation and scavenging behavior on an exposed surface. These features, together with the regional depositional pattern of the Hartselle Sandstone interpreted as tide-influenced bars and shoals, support a meso- to macro-tidal interpretation of the depositional environment.",Retrospective study on the impact of ulnar nerve dislocation on the pathophysiology of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149408,PeerJ,2019 06 10,High resolution ultrasonography (US) has been used for diagnosis and evaluation of entrapment peripheral neuropathy. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common focal entrapment neuropathy. The ulnar nerve tends to move to the anteromedial side and sometimes subluxates or dislocates over the medial epicondyle as the elbow is flexed. Dislocation of the ulnar nerve during elbow flexion may contribute to friction injury. We aimed to investigate the effects which the dislocation of ulnar nerve at the elbow could have on the electrophysiologic pathology of UNE.,Spatial variations of microbial communities in abyssal and hadal sediments across the Challenger Deep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149407,PeerJ,2019 06 10,"Microbial communities in hadal sediments are least explored in hadal zone (>6,000 m), especially in the Challenger Deep with high pressure (∼110 M pa at the bottom). In this study, we investigated the microbial communities in the sediments of the slope and trench-axis bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. Classification of the reads of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons showed vertical distribution of prokaryotic microbial inhabitants from the surface to up to 60 centimeter below surface floor (cmbsf). The most dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes and candidate phyla Patescibacteria and Marinimicrobia. Distinct dominant groups in the microbial communities were observed in trench-axis sediment (water depth >8,600 m), compared to the slopes of the Challenger Deep. A sampling site at the northern slope was enriched with archaea from mesophilic Euryarchaeota Marine Group II (MGII) as a biomarker of specific geochemical setting. Among archaeal community, Thaumarchaeota represented by Nitrosopumilus were dominant in the upper layers and diminished drastically in the deeper layers. ""Ca. Woesearchaeota"", however, became the dominant group in the deeper layers. Overall, our study provides a better understanding on the pattern of the microbial communities in the deepest hadal sediments on Earth, and highlights the extraordinary diversity still waiting to be discovered.",Genotypic analyses and virulence characterization of Glaesserella parasuis isolates from Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149406,PeerJ,2019 06 10,"Glaesserella (Haemophilus) parasuis (G. parasuis) causes severe economic losses in the swine industry.

Additionally, the landscape is characterized by a series of potential barriers to gene flow, such as the Chacao Channel, Cordillera de Piuche in Chiloé and both the Ancud and the Corcovado gulfs. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite data across several populations to evaluate the genetic variability and structure of the sigmodontine rodent Abrothrix olivacea brachiotis, one of the most common species of small mammals and an inhabitant of these biodiverse forests. Sequencing data showed that along with the recovery of high haplotype variation for this species, there was a low nucleotide diversity between haplotypes, showing no genetic differences between the Chiloé Island and continental populations in southern Chile or through any other geographic barrier in the study area. However, microsatellite data exhibited some level of population structuring. The most evident clusterings were those of the Chiloé Island and that of North Patagonia. These findings are corroborated by a barrier analysis that showed a genetic barrier in the latter areas, whereas the Chacao Channel was not a significant barrier for this rodent. Overall, the genetic variability and structure of A. o. brachiotis was concordant with historical factors, such as the Last Glacial Maximum and the presence of geographic elements that isolate populations.",Enzyme characterization and biological activities of a resuscitation promoting factor from an oil degrading bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis KB1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149404,PeerJ,2019 06 10,"Resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpf) are a class of muralytic enzymes, which participate in recovery of dormant cells and promoting bacteria growth in poor media. In the present study the expression vector of the rpf-1 gene from an oil-degrading bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis KB1 was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography, and showed muralytic activity when measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-N,N',N″-triacetyl chitotrioside as substrate. Addition of purified Rpf-1 to R. erythropolis culture efficiently improved bacterial cell growth. The purified protein also increased resuscitation of viable but nonculturable cells of R. erythropolis to culturable state. The conserved amino acid residues including Asp45, Glu51, Cys50, Thr60, Gln69, Thr74, Trp75 and Cys114 of the Rpf-1 were replaced with different amino acids. The mutant proteins were also expressed and purified with Ni2+-affinity chromatography. The muralytic activities of the mutant proteins decreased to different extents when compared with that of the wild type Rpf-1. Gln69 was found to play the most important role in the enzyme activity, substitution of Gln69 with lysine (Q69K) resulted in the greatest decrease of muralytic activity. The other amino acid residues such as Asp45, Glu51, Cys50 and Cys114 were also found to be very important in maintaining muralytic activity and biological function of the Rpf-1. Our results indicated that Rpf-1 from R. erythropolis showed muralytic activities and weak protease activity, but the muralytic activity was responsible for its growth promotion and resuscitation activity."

The aim of this review is to evaluate effects of invasive monitoring for major burns patients (>20% total body surface area) to prevent early organ dysfunction. Five databases were searched for randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated invasive monitoring within the acute phase (first 24 hours). Invasive monitoring included transesophageal echocardiogram, central venous pressure measurement, and pulmonary artery catheterisation. Primary outcomes included multiple organ failure scores, renal and cardiac dysfunction measurements, compartment syndrome and lactate at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included mortality and intensive care unit stay. Ten studies involving 401 major burns patients were included. Data pooled from four studies demonstrated significantly improved cardiac index at 24 hours compared to non-invasive endpoints (MD: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.82, P=0.00001). Five studies pooled showed significantly increased urine output with invasive monitoring (MD: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.03-0.34, P=0.02), whereas there was no difference in blood lactate levels (MD: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.44-0.22, P=0.43). There was a trend for lower mortality in invasive monitoring groups compared with non-invasive controls; however, the difference was not significant. There remains insufficient evidence to determine whether invasive monitoring to guide fluid resuscitation improves patient outcomes after major burn trauma. Although meta-analysis determined significantly improved cardiac index and urine output, further studies are required.","Human tissue banking in Bangladesh: hope for the patients of massive burns, surgical wound and bone associated complications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149389,International journal of burns and trauma,2019 06 10,"Each year throughout Bangladesh, thousands of people suffering from massive burns and surgical wounds require amniotic grafts for transplantation. Additionally, the stricken persons of the country have to embrace bone associated disability for the whole life due to traumatic complications need bone graft to treat. As a result, these two problems are the largest financial burden as this situation not only affect the family of patients but also cripple down national economy. However, institute of tissue banking in Bangladesh has undertaken the service program on the processing, preservation and clinical applications of amnion membrane and bone graft for rehabilitative surgery. Importantly, in recent years, this institute has started cranial bone autograft processing and transplantation. In accidental cases such as head injury, it is difficult to provide suitable cranial bone allograft according to demand. In this situation, injured cranial bone of the patient is being transported to the lab of the institute, where the scientist, tissue banker and medic work together immediately to process the cranial bone and sterilize by gamma radiation; and after quality assurance, the processed cranial bone autograft is being supplied for replacement surgery. The use of irradiated amnion and bone allografts and cranial bone autograft in reconstructive surgery restore normalcy to lives of many patients from disabilities. This tissue bank is based on finding and obtaining qualified donors from the community and a demand for tissue grafts from the hospitals. Although growing needs for tissue transplantation but raw and processed tissue grafts preservation and banking braces enormous logistical limitations. The only human tissue bank in Bangladesh, however, ensures the availability of tissue allografts of high quality and acceptability to the recipients for rehabilitative surgery for a decade, regardless patients' socio-economic status.",Oxytocin and Oxytocinase in the Obese and Nonobese Parturients during Induction and Augmentation of Labor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149388,AJP reports,2019 06 10,"Objective  To investigate differences in oxytocin (OXT) biodistribution between nonobese and obese parturients during labor.

Blood samples were collected at baseline (T 0 ), and 20 minutes after maximal OXT augmentation or adequate uterine contractions (T 1 ) for OXT and oxytocinase assays. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test for group versus time interaction and analysis of covariance to detect a difference in OXT level at T 1 . Data presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), with p  < 0.05 considered significant. Results  The mean BMIs (kg/m 2 ) were 22.1 ± 1.6 and 35.9 ± 5.1 in the nonobese and obese groups, respectively. No differences were observed in either the duration of OXT infusion, total dose of OXT, or plasma OXT (pg/mL) either at T 0 or T 1 .

However, time-resolved instruments require an accurate characterization by measuring the instrument response function in order to decouple the contribution of the instrument itself from the measurement. In this work, a new approach to the methodology of analysing time-resolved data is presented where the influence of instrument response function is eliminated from the data and a self-calibrating analysis is proposed. The proposed methodology requires an instrument to provide at least two wavelengths and allows spectral parameters recovery (optical properties or constituents concentrations and reduced scatter amplitude and power). Phantom and in-vivo data from two different time-resolved systems are used to validate the accuracy of the proposed self-calibrating approach, demonstrating that parameters recovery compared to the conventional curve fitting approach is within 10% and benefits from introducing a spectral constraint to the reconstruction problem. It is shown that a multi-wavelength time-resolved data can be used for parameters recovery directly without prior calibration (instrument response function measurement).",Joint retina segmentation and classification for early glaucoma diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149385,Biomedical optics express,2019 06 10,"We propose a joint segmentation and classification deep model for early glaucoma diagnosis using retina imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Our motivation roots in the observation that ophthalmologists make the clinical decision by analyzing the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) from OCT images. To simulate this process, we propose a novel deep model that joins the retinal layer segmentation and glaucoma classification. Our model consists of three parts. First, the segmentation network simultaneously predicts both six retinal layers and five boundaries between them. Then, we introduce a post processing algorithm to fuse the two results while enforcing the topology correctness. Finally, the classification network takes the RNFL thickness vector as input and outputs the probability of being glaucoma. In the classification network, we propose a carefully designed module to implement the clinical strategy to diagnose glaucoma. We validate our method both in a collected dataset of 1004 circular OCT B-Scans from 234 subjects and in a public dataset of 110 B-Scans from 10 patients with diabetic macular edema. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art methods both in our collected dataset and in public dataset with severe retina pathology. For glaucoma classification, our model achieves diagnostic accuracy of 81.4% with AUC of 0.864, which clearly outperforms baseline methods.",On-line optical clearing method for whole-brain imaging in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149384,Biomedical optics express,2019 06 10,"The combination of optical clearing with light microscopy has a number of applications in the whole-brain imaging of mice.

 sparse regularization for improving DOT reconstruction by incorporating a priori lesion depth and shape information from the co-registered US image. Our method iteratively solves the inverse problem by updating the photon-density wave using the finite difference method, computing the weight matrix based on Born approximation, and reconstructing the absorption map using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding optimization algorithm (FISTA). We validate our method using both phantom and patient data and compare the results with those using the first order linear Born method. Phantom experiments demonstrate that the non-linear Born method provides more accurate target absorption reconstruction and better resolution than the linear Born method. Clinical studies on 20 patients show that non-linear Born reconstructs more realistic tumor shapes than linear Born, and improves the malignant-to-benign lesion contrast ratio from

In this work, a deep fusion method based on convolutional neural networks has been proposed as an alternative to the guided filter based approach. It has the combined benefit of using less data for training without the need for the careful choice of any parameters and is a fully data-driven approach. The proposed deep fusion approach outperformed the contemporary fusion method, which was proved using experimental, numerical phantoms and in-vivo studies. The improvement obtained in the reconstructed images was as high as 95.49% in root mean square error and 7.77 dB in signal to noise ratio (SNR) in comparison to the guided filter approach.

Within the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes persistent biofilm infection that is commonly treated with aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin. However, sublethal concentrations of this aminoglycoside were previously shown to increase biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, but the underlying adaptive mechanisms still remain elusive. Herein, we combined confocal laser scanning microscope analyses, proteomics profiling, gene expression assays and phenotypic studies to unravel P. aeruginosa potential adaptive mechanisms in response to tobramycin exposure during biofilm growth. Under this condition, we show that the modified biofilm architecture is related at least in part to increased extracellular DNA (eDNA) release, most likely as a result of biofilm cell death. Furthermore, the activity of quorum sensing (QS) systems was increased, leading to higher production of QS signaling molecules. We also demonstrate upon tobramycin exposure an increase in expression of the PrrF small regulatory RNAs, as well as expression of iron uptake systems. Remarkably, biofilm biovolumes and eDNA relative abundances in pqs and prrF mutant strains decrease in the presence of tobramycin. Overall, our findings offer experimental evidences for a potential adaptive mechanism linking PrrF sRNAs, QS signaling, biofilm cell death, eDNA release, and tobramycin-enhanced biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. These specific adaptive mechanisms should be considered to improve treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa biofilm establishment in CF patients' lungs.",A novel missense PTEN mutation identified in a patient with macrocephaly and developmental delay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149344,Human genome variation,2019 06 10,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) plays an important role in tumor suppression.

In studies with atorvastatin (ATV) the metabolite profiles were similar in bile obtained through UCC and from bile duct-cannulated (BDC) dogs. Similar results were observed in UCC and BDC monkeys as well. In both monkey and dog, the primary metabolic pathway observed for ATV was oxidative metabolism. The 2-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin metabolites were the major oxidation products, which is consistent with previously published metabolite profiles. S-cysteine and glucuronide conjugates were also observed. UCC offers a viable alternative to bile duct cannulation for collection of bile for metabolite profiling of compounds that undergo biliary excretion, given the similar metabolite profiles in bile obtained via each method.

While LPI activates multiple signaling pathways, little is known about which ones are important in cardiomyocytes. In this study we explored whether activation of the Rho kinase/ROCK/p38 MAPK pathway is responsible for LPI-induced extension of I/R injury. Using a high-throughput screening method (dynamic mass redistribution; DMR), mouse- and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cardiomyocytes exposed to LPI were shown to exhibit a rapid, sustained, and concentration-dependent (1 nmol L-1-30 μmol L-1) cellular response. Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; 10 & 50 μmol L-1) and CBD (1 μmol L-1) both abolished the DMR response to LPI (10 μmol L-1). In murine iPSC cardiomyocytes, LPI-induced ROCK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, both of which were prevented by Y-27632 and CBD, but did not induce JNK activation or cleavage of caspase-3. In hearts isolated from wild type (WT) mice subjected to 30 minutes global I/R, LPI (10 μmol L-1) administered via the coronary circulation increased infarct size when applied prior to ischemia onset, but not when given at the time of reperfusion. The exacerbation of tissue injury by LPI was not seen in hearts from GPR55-/- mice or in the presence of Y-27632, confirming that injury is mediated via the GPR55/ROCK/p38 MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that raised levels of LPI in the vicinity of a developing infarct may worsen the outcome of AMI.",A structured literature review of interventions used in the management of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149341,Pharmacology research & perspectives,2019 06 10,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic, progressive disease, that can advance to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

However, LRRK2 kinase inhibitors may have manifold actions, affecting not only pathological mechanisms in dopaminergic neurons but also physiological functions in nondopaminergic neurons. Therefore, we investigated whether LRRK2 kinase inhibitors differentially modulate dopamine and glutamate release from the mouse striatum and cerebral cortex. Spontaneous and KCl-evoked [3H]-dopamine and glutamate release from superfused synaptosomes obtained from wild-type and LRRK2 knock-out, kinase-dead or G2019S knock-in mice was measured. Two structurally unrelated inhibitors, LRRK2-IN-1 and GSK2578215A, were tested. LRRK2, phosphoSerine1292 and phosphoSerine935 LRRK2 levels were measured in all genotypes, and target engagement was evaluated by monitoring phosphoSerine935 LRRK2. LRRK2-IN-1 inhibited striatal glutamate but not dopamine release; GSK2578215A inhibited striatal dopamine and cortical glutamate but enhanced striatal glutamate release. LRRK2-IN-1 reduced striatal and cortical phosphoSerine935 levels whereas GSK2578215A inhibited only the former. Neither LRRK2 inhibitor affected neurotransmitter release in LRRK2 knock-out and kinase-dead mice; however, they facilitated dopamine without affecting striatal glutamate in G2019S knock-in mice. GSK2578215A inhibited cortical glutamate release in G2019S knock-in mice. We conclude that LRRK2-IN-1 and GSK2578215A modulate exocytosis by blocking LRRK2 kinase activity, although their effects vary depending on the nerve terminal examined. The G2019S mutation unravels a dopamine-promoting action of LRRK2 inhibitors while blunting their effects on glutamate release, which highlights their positive potential for the treatment of PD, especially of LRRK2 mutation carriers.",Foraging for high caloric anthropogenic prey is energetically costly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149339,Movement ecology,2019 06 10,"Several generalist species benefit from food provided by human activities.

So far, most of the microfluidic-based single cell genomic studies have been focused on lab-cultured species or cell lines that are relatively easy to handle following standard microfluidic-based protocols without additional adjustments. The major challenges for performing single cell sequencing on clinical samples is the complex nature of the samples which requires additional sample processing steps to obtain intact single cells of interest without using amplification-inhibitive agents. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting is a common option to obtain single cells from clinical samples for single cell applications but requires >100 000 viable cells in suspension and the need for specialized laboratory and personnel. In this work, we present a protocol that can be used to obtain intact epithelial cells from snap-frozen postsurgical human endometrial tissues for single cell whole genome amplification. Our protocol includes sample thawing, cell dissociation, and labeling for genome amplification of targeted cells.

Incentive salience theory, used widely to describe reward processing, divides this processing into ""liking"" (reward-induced hedonic sensory impact) and ""wanting"" (reward-induced motivation) components. It has been employed to explain pathological changes in reward processing induced by psychiatric disorders. In this review, we summarize the findings of studies of reward processing under chronic pain and examine the effects of chronic pain on ""liking"" and ""wanting."" Evidence indicates that chronic pain compromises the ""wanting"" component of reward processing; we also discuss the neural mechanisms that may mediate this effect. We hope that this review aids the development of therapies to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic pain.",Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Plasma Containing Xenogenic Adipose Tissue-Derived Stromal Cells on Restoring Intervertebral Disc Degeneration: A Preclinical Study in a Rabbit Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149318,Pain research & management,2019 06 10,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) containing multiple growth factors is a promising strategy for disc degeneration.

A temptation in transdisciplinary work is to focus on improving scientific practices rather than engage research partners in spaces that mutually respect how we learn from each other and set the stage for change. We used the concept of Nicolescu's ""Hidden Third"" to identify and operationalize this transformative space, because it focused on bridging ""objective"" and ""subjective"" worldviews through art. Between 2014 and 2017, we explored the engagement of indigenous peoples from three inland delta regions in Canada and as a team of interdisciplinary scholars and students who worked together to better understand long-term social-ecological change in those regions. In working together, we identified five characteristics associated with respectful, transformative transdisciplinary space. These included (1) establishing an unfiltered safe place where (2) subjective and objective experiences and (3) different world views could come together through (4) interactive and (5) multiple sensory experiences. On the whole, we were more effective in achieving characteristics 2-5-bringing together the subjective and objective experiences, where different worldviews could come together-than in achieving characteristic 1-creating a truly unfiltered and safe space for expression. The novelty of this work is in how we sought to change our own engagement practices to advance sustainability rather than improving scientific techniques.

Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of premature mortality in patients with acromegaly, accounting for about 60% of deaths. GH and/or IGF-I exert direct cardiac effects: enhance cardiac contractility, stimulate cardiomyocyte growth, influence calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Cardiac remodelling is influenced by hypertension and insulin resistance. Among cardiovascular risk factors arterial hypertension, reported in 35% of patients with acromegaly, ranks among most important negative prognostic factors for mortality. Hypertension plays significant role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, especially in older acromegalic patients and diastolic blood pressure is best predictive factor for cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, early and aggressive hypertension treatment is essential for prognosis in acromegaly. Other important risk factors are: valvular defects, arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction, heart failure, lipid abnormalities and coronary artery disease. Numerous studies suggest that patients with acromegaly are under threat of arrhythmias, especially those with structural heart abnormalities. Congestive heart failure as end-stage acromegalic cardiomyopathy occurs usually in older patients, with long-term uncontrolled disease and other cardiovascular and metabolic complications.

Methods: In the present study, we developed an injectable PEG-b-poly(L-alanine) hydrogel for co-delivery of a tumor vaccine and dual immune checkpoint inhibitors to increase tumor immunotherapy efficacy. Tumor cell lysates, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 antibody) were readily encapsulated in the porous hydrogel during the spontaneous self-assembly of polypeptide in aqueous solution. Results: Sustained release of tumor antigens and GM-CSF persistently recruited and activated dendritic cells (DCs) and induced a strong T-cell response in vivo, which was further enhanced by the immune checkpoint therapy. The hydrogel vaccine also upregulated the production of IgG and the secretion of cytokines including IFN-γ, IL-4, and TNF-α. Importantly, the hydrogel-based combination therapy had superior immunotherapy effects against melanoma and 4T-1 tumor in comparison with the vaccine alone or in addition with a single immune checkpoint blockade. In studying the underlying mechanism, we found that the hydrogel-based combinatorial immunotherapy not only significantly increased the activated effector CD8+ T cells within the spleens and tumors of vaccinated mice, but also reduced the ratio of Tregs. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the polypeptide hydrogel can be used as an effective sustained delivery platform for vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors, providing an advanced combinatorial immunotherapy approach for cancer treatment.",Inhibition of protein disulfide isomerase in glioblastoma causes marked downregulation of DNA repair and DNA damage response genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149044,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Aberrant overexpression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident oxidoreductase protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) plays an important role in cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that PDI promotes glioblastoma (GBM) cell growth and describe a class of allosteric PDI inhibitors that are selective for PDI over other PDI family members. Methods: We performed a phenotypic screening triage campaign of over 20,000 diverse compounds to identify PDI inhibitors cytotoxic to cancer cells. From this screen, BAP2 emerged as a lead compound, and we assessed BAP2-PDI interactions with gel filtration, thiol-competition assays, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. To assess selectivity, we compared BAP2 activity across several PDI family members in the PDI reductase assay. Finally, we performed in vivo studies with a mouse xenograft model of GBM combining BAP2 and the standard of care (temozolomide and radiation), and identified affected gene pathways with nascent RNA sequencing (Bru-seq). Results: BAP2 and related analogs are novel PDI inhibitors that selectively inhibit PDIA1 and PDIp. Though BAP2 contains a weak Michael acceptor, interaction with PDI relies on Histidine 256 in the b' domain of PDI, suggesting allosteric binding. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo, BAP2 reduces cell and tumor growth. BAP2 alters the transcription of genes involved in the unfolded protein response, ER stress, apoptosis and DNA repair response. Conclusion: These results indicate that BAP2 has anti-tumor activity and the suppressive effect on DNA repair gene expression warrants combination with DNA damaging agents to treat GBM.",Using near-infrared enhanced thermozyme and scFv dual-conjugated Au nanorods for detection and targeted photothermal treatment of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149043,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Investigation of targeting inhibitors of Aβ aggregation, heme-Aβ peroxidase-like activity and efficient detectors of Aβ aggregation, are of therapeutic value and diagnostics significance for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to the complex pathogenesis of AD, theranostics treatment with multiple functions are necessary. Herein we constructed the NIR absorption property of gold nanorods (GNRs) loaded with single chain variable fragment (scFv) 12B4 and thermophilic acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) ST0779 as a smart theranostic complex (GNRs-APH-scFv, GAS), which possesses both rapid detection of Aβ aggregates and NIR photothermal treatment that effectively disassembles Aβ aggregates and inhibits Aβ-mediated toxicity. Methods: We screened targeting anti-Aβ scFv 12B4 and thermophilic acylpeptide hydrolase as amyloid-degrading enzyme, synthesized GAS gold nanorods complex. The GAS was evalued by Aβ inhibition and disaggregation assays, Aβ detection assays, Aβ mediated toxicity assays in vitro. In vivo, delaying Aβ-induced paralysis in AD model of Caenorhabditis elegans was also tested by GAS. Results: In vitro, GAS has a synergistic effect to inhibit and disassociate Aβ aggregates, in addition to decrease heme-Aβ peroxidase-like activity. In cultured cells, treatment with GAS reduces Aβ-induced cytotoxicity, while also delaying Aβ-mediated paralysis in CL4176 C.elegans model of AD. Furthermore, the photothermal effect of the GAS upon NIR laser irradiation not only helps disassociate the Aβ aggregates but also boosts APH activity to clear Aβ. The GAS, as a targeting detector and inhibitor, allows real-time detection of Aβ aggregates. Conclusion: These results firstly highlight the combination of scFv, APH and nanoparticles to be theranostic AD drugs. Taken together, our strategy provides a new thought into the design of smart compounds for use as efficiently therapeutic and preventive agents against AD. Moreover, our design provides broad prospects of biomedical strategy for further theranostics application in those diseases caused by abnormal protein.",Progerin accumulation in nucleus pulposus cells impairs mitochondrial function and induces intervertebral disc degeneration and therapeutic effects of sulforaphane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149042,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Progerin, a truncated unprocessed lamin A protein, causes tissue aging and degeneration. In this study we explored the role of progerin in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). We also examined the effect of sulforaphane (SFN) on progerin accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in IDD. Methods: The role of progerin in IDD was explored using human nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues, rat NP cells, and Lmna G609G knock-in mice. Immunostaining, X-ray imaging, and Western blotting were performed to assess the phenotypes of intervertebral discs. Alterations in senescence and apoptosis were evaluated by SA-β-galactosidase, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assays. Mitochondrial function was investigated by JC-1 staining, transmission electron microscopy, and determination of the level of ATP and the activities of mitochondrial enzymes. Results: The progerin level was elevated in degenerated human NP tissues. Lmna G609G/G609G mice displayed IDD, as evidenced by increased matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression and decreased collagen II and aggrecan expression and disc height. Furthermore, progerin overexpression in rat NP cells induced mitochondrial dysfunction (decreased ATP synthesis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and activities of mitochondrial complex enzymes), morphologic abnormalities, and disrupted mitochondrial dynamic (abnormal expression of proteins involved in fission and fusion), resulting in apoptosis and senescence. SFN ameliorated the progerin-induced aging defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in NP cells and IDD in Lmna G609G/G609G mice. Conclusions: Progerin is involved in the pathogenesis of IDD. Also, SFN alleviates progerin‑induced IDD, which is associated with amelioration of aging defects and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, SFN shows promise for the treatment of IDD.",Sonic hedgehog pathway activation is associated with cetuximab resistance and EPHB3 receptor induction in colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149041,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"A major problem of colorectal cancer (CRC) targeted therapies is relapse caused by drug resistance. In most cases of CRC, patients develop resistance to anticancer drugs. Cetuximab does not show many of the side effects of other anticancer drugs and improves the survival of patients with metastatic CRC. However, the molecular mechanism of cetuximab resistance is not fully understood. Methods: EPHB3-mediated cetuximab resistance was confirmed by in vitro western blotting, colony-forming assays, WST-1 colorimetric assay, and in vivo xenograft models (n = 7 per group). RNA-seq analysis and receptor tyrosine kinase assays were performed to identify the cetuximab resistance mechanism of EPHB3. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The expression of EFNB3, which upregulates the EPHB3 receptor, was shown to be increased via microarray analysis. When resistance to cetuximab was acquired, EPHB3 protein levels increased. Hedgehog signaling, cancer stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling proteins were also increased in the cetuximab-resistant human colon cancer cell line SW48R. Despite cells acquiring resistance to cetuximab, STAT3 was still responsive to EGF and cetuximab treatment. Moreover, inhibition of EPHB3 was associated with decreased STAT3 activity. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that EGFR and EPHB3 bind to each other and this binding increases upon resistance acquisition, suggesting that STAT3 is activated by the binding between EGFR and EPHB3. Protein levels of GLI-1, SOX2, and Vimentin, which are affected by STAT3, also increased. Similar results were obtained in samples from patients with CRC. Conclusion: EPHB3 expression is associated with anticancer drug resistance.",Soluble EMMPRIN levels discriminate aortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149040,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by a matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) dysregulation that leads to extracellular matrix degradation. Consequently, MFS patients are prone to develop progressive thoracic aortic enlargement and detrimental aneurysm. Since MMPs are activated by the extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN) protein, we determined whether its plasmatic soluble form (sEMMPRIN) may be considered a marker of thoracic aortic ectasia (AE). Methods: We compared plasma sEMMPRIN levels of 42 adult Caucasian MFS patients not previously subjected to aortic surgery with those of matched healthy controls (HC) by ELISA. In the MFS cohort we prospectively evaluated the relationship between plasma sEMMPRIN levels and the main MFS-related manifestations. Results: MFS patients had lower plasma sEMMPRIN levels (mean±SD: 2071±637 pg/ml) than HC (2441±642 pg/ml, p=0.009). Amongst all considered MFS-related clinical features, we found that only aortic root dilatation associated with circulating sEMMPRIN levels. Specifically, plasma sEMMPRIN levels negatively correlated with aortic Z-score (r=-0.431, p=0.004), and were significantly lower in patients with AE (Z-score≥2, 1788±510 pg/ml) compared to those without AE (Z-score<2, 2355±634 pg/ml; p=0.003). ROC curve analysis revealed that plasma sEMMPRIN levels discriminated patients with AE (AUC [95%CI]: 0.763 [0.610-0.916], p=0.003) with 85.7% sensitivity, 76.2% specificity, and 81% accuracy. We defined plasma sEMMPRIN levels ≤2246 pg/ml as the best threshold discriminating the presence of AE in MFS patients with an odds ratio [95%CI] of 19.2 [3.947-93.389] (p<0.001). Conclusions: MFS patients are characterized by lower sEMMPRIN levels than HC. Notably, plasma sEMMPRIN levels are strongly associated with thoracic AE.",Myeloid cell-derived LL-37 promotes lung cancer growth by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149039,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Rationale: Antimicrobial peptides, such as cathelicidin LL-37/hCAP-18, are important effectors of the innate immune system with direct antibacterial activity. In addition, LL-37 is involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of LL-37 in promoting lung cancer are not fully understood. Methods: The expression of LL-37 in the tissues and sera of patients with non-small cell lung cancer was determined through immunohistological, immunofluorescence analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The animal model of wild-type and Cramp knockout mice was employed to evaluate the tumorigenic effect of LL-37 in non-small cell lung cancer. The mechanism of LL-37 involving in the promotion of lung tumor growth was evaluated via microarray analyses, recombinant protein treatment approaches in vitro, tumor immunohistochemical assays, and intervention studies in vivo. Results: LL-37 produced by myeloid cells was frequently upregulated in primary human lung cancer tissues. Moreover, its expression level correlated with poor clinical outcome. LL-37 activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inducing the phosphorylation of protein kinase B and subsequent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β mediated by the toll-like receptor-4 expressed in lung tumor cells. LL-37 treatment of tumor cells also decreased the levels of Axin2. In contrast, it elevated those of an RNA-binding protein (tristetraprolin), which may be involved in the mechanism through which LL-37 induces activation of Wnt/β-catenin. Conclusion: LL-37 may be a critical molecular link between tumor-supportive immune cells and tumors, facilitating the progression of lung cancer.",Long noncoding RNA TUG1 inhibits osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via Smad5 after irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149038,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Irradiation can greatly inhibit osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs).

Functional analyses (in vitro) were performed to confirm the role of TUG1 in the osteogenic inhibition induced by irradiation. A RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation) assay was performed to detect the interaction of TUG1 and Smad5. Smad5 and the phosphorylated Smad5 (p-Smad5) were tested by western blot. The nuclear translocation of p-Smad5 were tested by immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, a series of Smad5 deletions was constructed to identify the TUG1 binding site of Smad5. Results: We found that numerous lncRNAs, including TUG1, exhibit significant expression differences after irradiation. After irradiation TUG1 was significantly increased in BM-MSCs and inhibited osteogenesis. Furthermore, TUG1 directly bound to Smad5, an osteogenic enhancer. Although the phosphorylation level of Smad5 was increased following irradiation, osteogenesis of BM-MSCs was decreased. Mechanistically, TUG1 interacting with the 50-90 aa region of Smad5 and blocks the nuclear translocation of p-Smad5, abolishing osteogenic signalling after irradiation. Conclusion: These results indicate that TUG1 is a negative regulator of Smad5 signalling and suppresses osteogenesis of BM-MSCs after irradiation.",High OGT activity is essential for MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149037,Theranostics,2019 06 11,"O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer. OGT modifies intra-cellular proteins via single sugar conjugation (O-GlcNAcylation) to alter their activity. We recently discovered the first fast-acting OGT inhibitor OSMI-2. Here, we probe the stability and function of the chromatin O-GlcNAc and identify transcription factors that coordinate with OGT to promote proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Methods: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to sequencing (seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements, RNA-seq and reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) were used to study the importance of OGT for chromatin structure and transcription. Mass spectrometry, western blot, RT-qPCR, cell cycle analysis and viability assays were used to establish the role of OGT for MYC-related processes. Prostate cancer patient data profiled for both mRNA and protein levels were used to validate findings. Results: We show for the first time that OGT inhibition leads to a rapid loss of O-GlcNAc chromatin mark. O-GlcNAc ChIP-seq regions overlap with super-enhancers (SE) and MYC binding sites. OGT inhibition leads to down-regulation of SE-dependent genes. We establish the first O-GlcNAc chromatin consensus motif, which we use as a bait for mass spectrometry. By combining the proteomic data from oligonucleotide enrichment with O-GlcNAc and MYC ChIP-mass spectrometry, we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as an interaction partner of MYC. Inhibition of OGT disrupts this interaction and compromises MYC's ability to confer androgen-independent proliferation to prostate cancer cells. We show that OGT is required for MYC-mediated stabilization of mitotic proteins, including Cyclin B1, and/or the increased translation of their coding transcripts. This implies that increased expression of mRNA is not always required to achieve increased protein expression and confer aggressive phenotype. Indeed, high expression of Cyclin B1 protein has strong predictive value in prostate cancer patients (p=0.000014) while mRNA does not. Conclusions: OGT promotes SE-dependent gene expression. OGT activity is required for the interaction between MYC and HCF-1 and expression of MYC-regulated mitotic proteins. These features render OGT essential for the androgen-independent, MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Androgen-independency is the major mechanism of prostate cancer progression, and our study identifies OGT as an essential mediator in this process.",GRP78-targeted ferritin nanocaged ultra-high dose of doxorubicin for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149036,Theranostics,2019 06 10,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, primarily due to its high incidence of recurrence and metastasis. Considerable efforts have therefore been undertaken to develop effective therapies; however, effective anti-HCC therapies rely on identification of suitable biomarkers, few of which are currently available for drug targeting. Methods: GRP78 was identified as the membrane receptor of HCC-targeted peptide SP94 by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrum analysis. To develop an effective anti-HCC drug nanocarrier, we first displayed GRP78-targeted peptide SP94 onto the exterior surface of Pyrococcus furiosus ferritin Fn (HccFn) by genetic engineering approach, and then loaded doxorubicin (Dox) into the cavities of HccFn via urea-based disassembly/reassembly method, thereby constructing a drug nanocarrier called HccFn-Dox. Results: We demonstrated that HccFn nanocage encapsulated ultra-high dose of Dox (up to 400 molecules Dox/protein nanocage). In vivo animal experiments showed that Dox encapsulated in HccFn-Dox was selectively delivered into HCC tumor cells, and effectively killed subcutaneous and lung metastatic HCC tumors. In addition, HccFn-Dox significantly reduced drug exposure to healthy organs and improved the maximum tolerated dose by six-fold compared with free Dox. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings clearly demonstrate that GRP78 is an effective biomarker for HCC therapy, and GRP78-targeted HccFn nanocage is effective in delivering anti-HCC drug without damage to healthy tissue."

Less is known about the role of social support and family cohesion in ART adherence among children below 18 years. This paper focuses on HIV-infected adolescents as they transition through the vulnerable developmental stage of adolescence to examine the association between family cohesion and social support, and ART adherence in southern Uganda. We utilized baseline data from Suubi+Adherence study, a five-year randomized longitudinal clinical trial with the overall goal of examining the impact and cost associated with an innovative asset-based social intervention to increase adherence to HIV treatment for HIV-infected adolescents in Uganda. This study employed self-reports to measure social support, family cohesion and ART adherence to treatment from 702 participants in 39 clinics situated in southern Uganda. Regression results indicated that after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics that family cohesion and social support from caregivers/family were associated with self-reported adherence to ART among HIV-infected adolescents. Social support from classmates, teachers, and friends were not associated with ART adherence. Study results suggest that strengthening family relationships and promoting social support within families caring for adolescents living with HIV can be crucial in addressing ART adherence challenges among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.",High-density lipoprotein ameliorates palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity and oxidative dysfunction in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells via ROS suppression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149020,Nutrition & metabolism,2019 06 10,"High levels circulating saturated fatty acids are associated with diabetes, obesity and hyperlipidemia.

Cartilage engineering grafts combining chondrogenic cells, scaffold materials, and microenvironmental factors are emerging as promissory alternatives. The design of an adequate scaffold resembling the physicochemical features of natural cartilage and able to support chondrogenesis in the implants is a crucial topic to solve. This study reports the development of an implant constructed with IGF1-transduced adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (immunophenotypes: CD105+, CD90+, CD73+, CD14-, and CD34-) embedded in a scaffold composed of a mix of alginate/milled bovine decellularized knee material which was cultivated in vitro for 28 days (3CI). Histological analyses demonstrated the distribution into isogenous groups of chondrocytes surrounded by a de novo dense extracellular matrix with balanced proportions of collagens II and I and high amounts of sulfated proteoglycans which also evidenced adequate cell proliferation and differentiation. This graft also shoved mechanical properties resembling the natural knee cartilage. A modified Bern/O'Driscoll scale showed that the 3CI implants had a significantly higher score than the 2CI implants lacking cells transduced with IGF1 (16/18 vs. 14/18), representing high-quality engineering cartilage suitable for in vivo tests. This study suggests that this graft resembles several features of typical hyaline cartilage and will be promissory for preclinical studies for cartilage regeneration.",The Different Effects of IFN-β and IFN-γ on the Tumor-Suppressive Activity of Human Amniotic Fluid-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149015,Stem cells international,2019 06 10,"Current studies have shown that type I or II interferon-modified mesenchymal stem cells have great potential for the application of tumor-targeted therapy, but the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we compared the different effects of IFN-β and IFN-γ on the antitumor activity of human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) and revealed the potential mechanism. In detail, AFMSCs primed with IFN-β or IFN-β plus IFN-γ, not IFN-γ, inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in an immunocompetent mouse H460 subcutaneous model, although they all inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in an immunocompromised mouse H460 subcutaneous model. TRAIL expressed by IFN-β- or IFN-γ-primed AFMSCs specifically exerted the antitumor effect of AFMSCs. AFMSCs primed with IFN-γ highly expressed immunosuppressive molecule IDO1, but IFN-β counteracted the IFN-γ-initiated IDO1 expression. 1-MT (IDO1 inhibitor) decreased TRAIL, but increased IDO1 expression in AFMSCs primed with interferon. As a result, AFMSCs primed with IFN-β or IFN-γ had the antitumor activity, and 1-MT failed to enhance the antitumor effect of IFN-γ-primed AFMSC in vitro and in the immunocompromised mouse H460 subcutaneous model. Furthermore, the expression of TRAIL in AFMSCs was upregulated by apoptotic cancer cells and this positive feedback intensified the antitumor effects of IFNs-primed AFMSCs. The different target gene expression profiles of AFMSCs regulated by IFN-β and IFN-γ determined the different antitumor effects of IFN-β- and IFN-γ-primed AFMSCs on tumor cells. Our finding may help to explore a clinical strategy for cancer intervention by understanding the antitumor mechanisms of MSCs and interferon.",Design Principles for Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Organoid Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149014,Stem cells international,2019 06 10,"Human morphogenesis is a complex process involving distinct microenvironmental and physical signals that are manipulated in space and time to give rise to complex tissues and organs.

Based on the ""self-organization"" capacity of stem cells, different PSC-derived organoids have been created; however, considerable differences between in vitro-generated PSC-derived organoids and their in vivo counterparts have been reported. Advances in the bioengineering field have allowed the manipulation of different components, including cellular and noncellular factors, to better mimic the in vivo microenvironment. In this review, we focus on different examples of bioengineering approaches used to promote the self-organization of stem cells, including assembly, patterning, and morphogenesis in vitro, contributing to tissue-like structure formation."

Lay-led self-management programs aim to improve self-management skills and might enable patients to make appropriate decisions as to when to use health care services. Contrary to the general attitude that self-management programs reduce health care utilisation, we suspect that better self-management skills lead to increased or possibly more appropriate health care utilisation. Our review and meta-analysis sheds light on the relationship between lay-led self-management programs and health care utilisation. Methods: In March 2017, we searched 7 databases (CDSR, DARE, HTA, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and SSCI) to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify studies that reported empirical data on lay-led self-management programs and health care utilisation. We extracted the characteristics of all primary studies and the data of four indicators of utilisation (physician visits, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and length of stay in hospital), and analysed the role of health care utilisation in these studies. We present the results in frequency tables and as a conventional meta-analysis with the standardized mean difference (SMD), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled overall effect sizes using RevMan 5.3.5. The manuscript follows the PRISMA checklist. Results: Overall, we include 49 primary studies; 10 studies provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. Health care utilisation played a different role in the studies; 15 studies reported a clear explicit hypothesis on the influence of a lay-led self-management program on health care utilisation, and 17 studies assumed an implicit assumption. 8 studies discussed the possibility that a lay-led self-management program could lead to more appropriate health care utilisation. The meta-analysis showed mixed results, and many effect sizes were not statistically significant. The participants of a lay-led self-management program had fewer emergency department visits (SMD: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.15 to -0.01; p=0.02) than the control group. Conclusion: Although the statistically significant effects of the meta-analysis are low, our overall findings show that only a small number of the included studies tackled the task of comprehensively investigating self-management skills in the context of health care utilisation. This fails to do justice to the potential of self-management programs. It is essential to consider the appropriateness of health care utilisation. We propose the term self-management-sensitive utilisation for this purpose.",Polymorphism of the PPARD Gene and Dynamic Balance Performance in Han Chinese Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148953,Hereditas,2019 06 10,"Athletic performances are complex traits with heritability of ~66%. Dynamic balance is one of the most important athletic performances, and there has been little studies for it in sports genomics. The candidate PPARD gene was reported to be able to affect muscle development for balance predisposition and influence the athletic performance including skiing triumph in the Caucasian population. This study aims to investigate whether the PPARD gene is a susceptibility gene for dynamic balance performance in Han Chinese children.",Temporal variations in turbidity in an oil sands pit lake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148952,"Environmental fluid mechanics (Dordrecht, Netherlands : 2001)",2019 05 31,"We investigated temporal variations in turbidity in Base Mine Lake, an oil sands pit lake, located in northeast Alberta, Canada. The lake has a surface area of 7.8 km2, is 9 m deep, and exhibits seasonal thermal stratification similar to that of natural dimictic lakes. Water turbidity was measured continuously throughout the year with moored sensors, supplemented with turbidity profiles and bottle samples, from sites on the lake. During summer there was a gradual exponential (e-folding time of 25 days) decrease in epilimnetic turbidity due to relatively steady settling of solids from the epilimnion through the thermocline to the hypolimnion. Rapid oscillations (periods of approximately 1 day) in turbidity during summer were due to wind driven internal waves. Convective cooling and wind-shear driven stirring during fall storm events increased the turbidity to an annual high just before ice-on. During these storm events, similarity scaling indicated wind shear imparted greater energy than convective cooling to the turbulence at the base of the water column. Ice suppressed wind forcing and resulted in a rapid decrease in turbidity. The rate of decrease in turbidity following ice-on was initially greater than the rate of decrease in the epilimnion during summer, and then slowed until the under-ice turbidity was a relatively constant value which was sustained during the latter half of the ice-on period. The minimum turbidity during winter was greater than the minimum during summer. Following ice-melt in spring, wind driven stirring increased turbidity until summer stratification began.",Evidence for the important role of inflammation in xenotransplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148951,"Journal of inflammation (London, England)",2019 06 10,"There is increasing evidence of a sustained state of systemic inflammation after pig-to-nonhuman primate (NHP) xenotransplantation (that has been termed systemic inflammation in xenograft recipients [SIXR]). Increases in inflammatory markers, e.g., C-reactive protein, histones, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, cytokines, chemokines, and a decrease in free triiodothyronine, have been demonstrated in the recipient NHPs. The complex interactions between inflammation, coagulation, and the immune response are well-recognized, but the role of inflammation in xenograft recipients is not fully understood. The evidence suggests that inflammation can promote the activation of coagulation and the adaptive immune response, but the exact mechanisms remain uncertain. If prolonged xenograft survival is to be achieved, anti-inflammatory strategies (e.g., the administration of anti-inflammatory agents, and/or the generation of genetically-engineered organ-source pigs that are protected from the effect of inflammation) may be necessary to prevent, control, or negate the effect of the systemic inflammation that develops in xenograft recipients. This may allow for a reduction in the intensity of exogenous immunosuppressive therapy. If immunological tolerance to a xenograft is to be obtained, then control of inflammation may be essential."

Both species are able to survive year-round in northern Vietnam's Red River Delta, which includes a large rice-producing region. This study aimed to evaluate insecticide use by farmers and its effect on the density of planthoppers in the region. Through interviews conducted with farmers in study sites in Nam Dinh (ND) and Vinh Phuc (VP) Provinces, we learned that farmers frequently used imidacloprid, fipronil, and emamectin-benzoate in ND and pymetrozine and thiamethoxam in VP. Farmers applied insecticides when the local government announcements regarding plant protection were broadcast. Generalized linear model analysis indicated that the selective insecticides applied did not contribute to reducing the densities of planthoppers in the farmers' fields. Our results indicate the possible development of insecticide resistance by planthoppers or improper insecticide application by farmers.","Discovery of broflanilide, a novel insecticide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148938,Journal of pesticide science,2019 06 10,"Broflanilide (1), discovered by Mitsui Chemicals Agro, Inc., has a unique chemical structure characterized as a meta-diamide and exhibits high activity against various pests, including Lepidopteran, Coleopteran, and Thysanopteran pests. Because broflanilide has a novel mode of action, the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) categorized it as a member of a new group: Group 30. The meta-diamide structure was generated via drastic structural modification of a lead compound, flubendiamide (2), and the subsequent structural optimization of meta-diamides on each of its three benzene rings led to the discovery of broflanilide. In the present study, the details of the generation of meta-diamides from the lead compound and the structural optimization of meta-diamides are described.",Compatibility of entomopathogenic fungi with insecticides and their efficacy for IPM of Bemisia tabaci in cotton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148937,Journal of pesticide science,2019 06 10,"Bemisia tabaci, a vector of cotton leaf curl virus disease, is among the most devastating pests causing huge economic losses due to reduced cotton yield and quality. The excessive use of chemical pesticides causes insecticide resistance. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) have a role as mycoinsecticides. The combined use of these insecticides is a promising pest-control option to minimize adverse chemical effects. Thus, we have evaluated 10 EPFs under polyhouse conditions for their virulence against whitefly nymphs and their compatibility with chemical and botanical insecticides. The highest overall biological efficacy index was recorded with Ij-102, followed by Bb-4511, and Ij-089. An in vitro compatibility study was conducted to evaluate the effect of botanical and chemical pesticides on mycelial growth and spore production using the poisoned food technique. The effect of pesticides on the reduction of mycelial growth and conidial production ranged from -169 to 94.1% and -25.6 to 87.6%, respectively. However, Ij-089, Ij-102, Ma-1299, and Bb-4511 were found to be the most compatible with the chemical and botanicals evaluated. Comparatively, spiromesifen, diafenthiuron, buprofezin, pyriproxyfen, and flonicamid were more compatible with EPFs at half doses, as compared to the other chemical pesticides, namely imidacloprid, fipronil, profenophos, and triazophos. These results might provide the basis for future work and indicate that applications of EPFs showing the best virulence and compatibility have the maximum likelihood for the management of B. tabaci in the field in an integrated pest management system.",Induction of defense responses by extracts of spent mushroom substrates in rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148936,Journal of pesticide science,2019 06 10,"We investigated the effect of treatment with hot water extracts from the spent mushroom substrates (SMSs) of Lentinula edodes and Hypsizygus marmoreus on the resistance of rice leaves to Pyricularia oryzae infection. The spraying of the SMS extracts clearly suppressed the development of lesions caused by Py. oryzae infection. The accumulation of phytoalexins momilactones A and B, oryzalexin A, and sakuranetin was markedly induced by the spraying of extracts. The enhanced expression of defense related genes PR1b and PBZ was also found in leaves sprayed with the extracts. Treatments with the extracts also affected phytohormone levels. The levels of N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenine and trans-zeatin markedly increased in response to treatment, whereas the levels of salicylic and jasmonic acids were largely unchanged.","Recognition of Mycenasect.Amparoina sect. nov.

The species possesses a number of morphological traits that exclude it from all extant suborders, and Burmanopetalidea suborder nov. and Burmanopetalidae fam. nov. are here erected to accommodate it. The new suborder can be recognized by the following unique characters: pleurotergal setae absent; telson with a specific spatulate shape twice the size of the penultimate body ring; hypoproct devoid of setae; and eyes composed of five well-separated ommatidia. While the callipodidan habitus seems to have remained generally unchanged for at least 99 million years, pleurotergal and hypoproctal setation, as well as the complexity of eyes in ground-dwelling forms may have evolved recently in the order.

Aimed at filling this gap, we investigate two key mathematical properties of representations: equivariance and equivalence. Equivariance studies how transformations of the input image are encoded by the representation, invariance being a special case where a transformation has no effect. Equivalence studies whether two representations, for example two different parameterizations of a CNN, two different layers, or two different CNN architectures, share the same visual information or not. A number of methods to establish these properties empirically are proposed, including introducing transformation and stitching layers in CNNs. These methods are then applied to popular representations to reveal insightful aspects of their structure, including clarifying at which layers in a CNN certain geometric invariances are achieved and how various CNN architectures differ.

Despite the prevalence of HFpEF, the understanding of its pathophysiology is still incomplete, and optimal treatment remains largely undefined. The net clinical benefit of medical treatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs and beta-blockers has led to the incorporation of these drugs into HF clinical practice guidelines. However, little or no progress has been done for patients with HFpEF and there are no convincing and validated therapies able to reduce mortality or morbidity. HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome embracing varieties of phenotypes and could benefit from a phenotype-specific approach. In the era of precision medicine, targeted approaches have proved effective in various disciplinary medical settings and for this reason this modern approach should be encouraged also in cardiology. In elderly patients, multi-level strategies and interventions aimed at improving adherence to guidelines and tailoring therapy, could be the key to improving outcome, and to reducing costs related to HF-related re-admissions.

A reliable label-free collection approach that can viably and appropriately isolate PBLs to establish in vitro culture systems is crucial for basic research and clinical requirements. However, isolation of PBLs from whole blood is difficult, and so the development of a rapid and safe method to perform this task is required. Microfluidic technology offers opportunities that challenge the performance of macroscale methods. In this study, we proposed a simple spiral microfluidic chip for efficient and high-throughput isolation of lymphocytes from a sample with prelysed RBCs. This spiral microfluidic platform does not rely on antibodies or biological markers for labeling cells of interest while isolating lymphocytes but rather enriches B and T lymphocytes through the different physical properties that are intrinsic to lymphocytes and other blood cells. The device was used to achieve high-throughput (~1.3 × 105 cells/min) separation of lymphocytes with high viability (>95%).

In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for benign hematological conditions including primary immune deficiency, mixed chimerism is seen with the use of reduced intensity conditioning. DLI can help prevent graft rejection by boosting the existing graft in these situations. There is scant data on the use of DLI in children who have undergone HSCT for benign hematological disorders. We present our case series with early withdrawal of immunosuppression and DLI as a means to mitigate relapse of leukemia and prevent graft rejection in mixed chimerism in children transplanted for benign hematological disorders. Donor lymphocyte infusion was given in a graded regimen with the cell dose of 1 × 105 CD3 cells/kg (1 × 104/kg in haploidentical transplant), 5 × 105 CD3 cells/kg, 1 × 106 CD3 cells/kg depending on the graft kinetics and the clinical status of the children.

We also show that the glioblastoma-on-a-chip reproduces clinically observed patient-specific resistances to treatment with concurrent chemoradiation and temozolomide, and that the model can be used to determine drug combinations associated with superior tumour killing.

However, investigations on its internal phylogeny are still limited. In this study, we used whole Y-chromosome sequencing to update its phylogenetic tree. In the revised tree, C2b1a3a2-F8951 and C2*-Star Cluster differentiated 3852 years ago (95% CI = 3295-4497). Approximately 3558 years ago (95% CI = 3013-4144), C2b1a3a2-F8951 was divided into two main subclades, C2b1a3a2a-F14753 and C2b1a3a2b-F5483. Currently, samples of C2b1a3a2-F8951 were mainly from the House of Aisin Gioro clan, the Ao family from Daur and some individuals mainly from northeast China. Although other haplogroups are also found in the Ao family, including C2b1a2-M48, C2b1a3a1-F3796, C2a1b-F845, and N1c-M178, the haplogroup C2b1a3a2-F8951 is still the most distinct genetic component. For haplogroup C2b1a3a2-F8951, the time of the most recent common ancestor of the House of Aisin Gioro clan and the Ao family were both very late, just a few hundred years ago. Some family-specific Y-SNPs of the House of Aisin Gioro and the Ao family were also discovered. This revision evidently improved the resolving power of Y-chromosome phylogeny in northeast Asia, deepening our understanding of the origin of these two families, even the Mongolic-speaking population.",Preferential expression of sialyl 6'-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine-capped O-glycans on high endothelial venules in human peripheral lymph nodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148596,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 05 31,"Lymphocyte ""homing"", the physiologic trafficking of lymphocytes from the circulation to secondary lymphoid organs, is regulated by sequential adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and endothelial cells that constitute high endothelial venules (HEVs). Initial lymphocyte ""rolling"" is mediated by relatively weak, transient adhesive interactions between L-selectin expressed on lymphocytes and sulfated mucin-type O-glycans expressed on HEVs. Keratan sulfate galactose (Gal)-6-O-sulfotransferase (KSGal6ST) catalyzes 6-O-sulfation of Gal in keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains but also transfers sulfate to Gal in much shorter glycan chains, such as sialylated N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc)-capped O-glycans. In mice, KSGal6ST is reportedly expressed in HEVs and functions in synthesizing 6-sulfo Gal-containing O-glycans on HEVs. However, in humans, the presence of 6-sulfo Gal-containing O-glycans on HEVs is not reported. Employing the newly developed monoclonal antibody 297-11A, which recognizes non-sialylated terminal 6'-sulfo LacNAc, we demonstrate that sialyl 6'-sulfo (and/or 6,6'-disulfo) LacNAc-capped O-glycans are preferentially displayed on HEVs in human peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) and to a lesser extent in mesenteric LNs (MLNs) but not in Peyer's patches (PPs). We also found that the scaffold protein mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), which is expressed on HEVs in PPs and MLNs but not PLNs, was modified by 297-11A-positive sulfated glycans less efficiently than was CD34. Moreover, 297-11A-positive sulfated glycans were also displayed on HEV-like vessels induced in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) aggregates formed in various cancers. These findings collectively indicate that 297-11A-positive sulfated glycans potentially play a role in physiologic lymphocyte homing as well as in lymphocyte recruitment under pathologic conditions.",Multimodal analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue by MALDI imaging and fluorescence in situ hybridization for combined genetic and metabolic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148595,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 05 31,"Multimodal tissue analyses that combine two or more detection technologies provide synergistic value compared to single methods and are employed increasingly in the field of tissue-based diagnostics and research. Here, we report a technical pipeline that describes a combined approach of HER2/CEP17 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with MALDI imaging on the very same section of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. FFPE biopsies and a tissue microarray of human gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were analyzed by MALDI imaging. Subsequently, the very same section was hybridized by HER2/CEP17 FISH. We found that tissue morphology of both, the biopsies and the tissue microarray, was unaffected by MALDI imaging and the HER2 and CEP17 FISH signals were analyzable. In comparison with FISH analysis of samples without MALDI imaging, we observed no difference in terms of fluorescence signal intensity and gene copy number. Our combined approach revealed adenosine monophosphate, measured by MALDI imaging, as a prognostic marker. HER2 amplification, which was detected by FISH, is a stratifier between good and poor patient prognosis. By integrating both stratification parameters on the basis of our combined approach, we were able to strikingly improve the prognostic effect. Combining molecules detected by MALDI imaging with the gene copy number detected by HER2/CEP17 FISH, we found a synergistic effect, which enhances patient prognosis. This study shows that our combined approach allows the detection of genetic and metabolic properties from one very same FFPE tissue section, which are specific for HER2 and hence suitable for prognosis. Furthermore, this synergism might be useful for response prediction in tumors.","Trp53 null and R270H mutant alleles have comparable effects in regulating invasion, metastasis, and gene expression in mouse colon tumorigenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148594,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 05 31,"Somatic APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), TP53, KRAS mutations are present in roughly 80%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, of human colorectal cancers (CRCs). Most TP53 mutant alleles in CRCs encode missense mutant proteins with loss-of-function (LOF) of p53's transcriptional activity and dominant negative (DN) effects on wild-type p53 function. Missense mutant p53 proteins have been reported to exert gain-of-function (GOF) effects in cancer. We compared the phenotypic effects of the common human cancer-associated TP53 R273H missense mutation to p53 null status in a genetically engineered mouse CRC model. Inactivation of one allele of Apc together with activation of a Kras mutant allele in mouse colon epithelium instigated development of serrated and hyperplastic epithelium and adenomas (AK mice). Addition of a Trp53R270H or Trp53null mutant allele to the model (AKP mice) led to markedly shortened survival and increased tumor burden relative to that of AK mice, including adenocarcinomas in AKP mice. Comparable life span and tumor burden were seen in AKP mice carrying Trp53R270H or Trp53null alleles, along with similar frequencies of spontaneous metastasis to lymph nodes, lung, and liver. The fraction of adenocarcinomas with submucosa or deeper invasion was higher in AKP270/fl mice than in AKPfl/fl mice, but the incidence of adenocarcinomas per mouse did not differ significantly between AKPfl/fl and AKP270/fl mice. In line with their comparable biological behaviors, mouse primary tumors and tumor-derived organoids with the Trp53R270H or Trp53null alleles had highly similar gene expression profiles. Human CRCs with TP53 R273 missense mutant or null alleles also had essentially homogeneous gene expression patterns. Our findings indicate the R270H/R273H p53 mutant protein does not manifest definite GOF biological effects in mouse and human CRCs, suggesting possible GOF effects of mutant p53 in cancer phenotypes are likely allele-specific and/or context-dependent.",Graphene Oxide increases mammalian spermatozoa fertilizing ability by extracting cholesterol from their membranes and promoting capacitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148593,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Graphene Oxide (GO) is a widely used biomaterial with an amazing variety of applications in biology and medicine. Recently, we reported the ability of GO to improve the in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in swine, a validated animal model with a high predictive value for human fertility. For that reason, here we characterized the mechanisms involved in this positive interaction by adopting an experimental approach combining biological methods (confocal microscopy analysis on single cell, flow cytometry on cell populations and co-incubation with epithelial oviductal cells), physical-chemical techniques (Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis), and chemical methods (mass spectrometry and lipid measurement). As a result, we propose a model in which GO is able to extract cholesterol from the spermatozoa membrane without causing any detrimental effect. In this way, the cholesterol extraction promotes a change in membrane chemical-physical properties that could positively affect male gamete function, modulating sperm signalling function and increasing in this way the fertilizing potential, without losing the ability to physiologically interact with the female environment. In conclusion, these data seem to suggest new intriguing possibilities in engineering sperm membrane for improving assisted reproduction technologies outcomes, even in human medicine."

In total, 32 alveolar bone defects and 14 teeth without periodontal defects were used. CBCT images were acquired with the use of three different voxel sizes: 0.125-mm, 0.2-mm and 0.4-mm. The scan data were 3D-reconstructed in Mimics software and evaluated by two observers with more than 5 years of experience in CBCT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and diagnostic values were obtained. Pairwise comparison of ROC curves was made for evaluation of the diagnostic values of different voxel sizes. Kappa statistics assessed the observer reliability. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05. It showed no statistically significant difference between 0.125-mm group and 0.2-mm group, but 0.4-mm group had lower Az values that differed significantly from 0.125-mm and 0.2-mm groups (P < 0.05). Based on diagnostic value and radiation protection, 0.2-mm voxel size may be a good choice for the detection of bone defects with CBCT.",Catastrophic shear-removal of subcontinental lithospheric mantle beneath the Colorado Plateau by the subducted Farallon slab.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148580,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The causes of Cenozoic uplift of the Colorado Plateau, southwestern USA, are strongly debated, though most hypotheses acknowledge the importance of northwest-directed subduction of the Farallon oceanic plate beneath North America since c. 100 Ma. Existing thermomechanical models suggest that the Farallon slab underthrust the proto-plateau region at ~200 km depth, removing the basal portions of its subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) root, although such small-volume subduction erosion cannot fully account for the degree of uplift observed today. Here we show via petrological modeling of lawsonite-bearing eclogite xenoliths exposed in diatremes in the center of the plateau that the Farallon slab surface penetrated through the proto-plateau SCLM at much shallower depths (~120 km) than these previous estimates, allowing shear-removal of ~80 km of SCLM - a volume up to three-times greater than previously suggested. This removal led to asthenospheric upwelling and isostatic rebound of the plateau region during the late Cretaceous to the Eocene. We posit that similar shear-removal of SCLM likely played a major role in inhibiting cratonic growth and stabilization in the Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic - when low-angle subduction of oceanic lithosphere was more prevalent than today - accounting for the atypically thin roots existing below many ancient cratons worldwide.",CSN5 inhibition triggers inflammatory signaling and Rho/ROCK-dependent loss of endothelial integrity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148579,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"RhoGTPases regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, migration and cell-cell adhesion in endothelial cells. Besides regulation at the level of guanine nucleotide binding, they also undergo post-translational modifications, for example ubiquitination. RhoGTPases are ubiquitinated by Cullin RING ligases which are in turn regulated by neddylation. Previously we showed that inhibition of Cullin RING ligase activity by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 is detrimental for endothelial barrier function, due to accumulation of RhoB and the consequent induction of contractility. Here we analyzed the effect of pharmacological activation of Cullin RING ligases on endothelial barrier integrity in vitro and in vivo. CSN5i-3 induced endothelial barrier disruption and increased macromolecule leakage in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CSN5i-3 strongly induced the expression and activation of RhoB and to lesser extent of RhoA in endothelial cells, which enhanced cell contraction. Elevated expression of RhoGTPases was a consequence of activation of the NF-κB pathway. In line with this notion, CSN5i-3 treatment decreased IκBα expression and increased NF-κB-mediated ICAM-1 expression and consequent adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells. This study shows that sustained neddylation of Cullin RING-ligases leads to activation the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells, elevated expression of RhoGTPases, Rho/ROCK-dependent activation of MLC and disruption of the endothelial barrier.",Impaired memory-guided attention in asymptomatic APOE4 carriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148578,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Attention and memory may be impaired in individuals at-risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though standard cognitive assessments typically study the two in parallel. In reality, attention and memory interact to facilitate information processing, and thus a more integrative approach is required. Here, we used a novel auditory paradigm to assess how long-term memory for auditory scenes facilitates detection of an auditory target in asymptomatic carriers of Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the principle risk gene for late-onset AD. We tested 60 healthy middle-aged adults with varying doses of APOE4 - 20 APOE4 homozygotes (E4/E4), 20 heterozygotes (E3/E4) and 20 non-carriers (E3/E3) - to determine effect on memory-guided attention. While explicit memory was unaffected by genotype, APOE4 dose significantly impaired memory-guided attention. A relationship between explicit memory and memory-guided attention was observed in non-carriers, but this correlation was not significant in E3/E4 and E4/E4 carriers, suggesting that APOE4 carriers rely less on explicit memory to facilitate attention. Since memory-guided attention declined with age in APOE4 homozygotes, this impairment may reflect early disease rather than being a life-long trait. In sum, asymptomatic individuals at increased genetic risk of AD show an age-dependent decline in attention-memory interaction when memory alone is not impaired.",Response of an actin network in vesicles under electric pulses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148577,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"We study the role of a biomimetic actin network during the application of electric pulses that induce electroporation or electropermeabilization, using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model system. The actin cortex, a subjacently attached interconnected network of actin filaments, regulates the shape and mechanical properties of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, and is a major factor influencing the mechanical response of the cell to external physical cues. We demonstrate that the presence of an actin shell inhibits the formation of macropores in the electroporated GUVs. Additionally, experiments on the uptake of dye molecules after electroporation show that the actin network slows down the resealing process of the permeabilized membrane. We further analyze the stability of the actin network inside the GUVs exposed to high electric pulses. We find disruption of the actin layer that is likely due to the electrophoretic forces acting on the actin filaments during the permeabilization of the GUVs. Our findings on the GUVs containing a biomimetic network provide a step towards understanding the discrepancies between the electroporation mechanism of a living cell and its simplified model of the empty GUV.",Plasmodium pseudo-Tyrosine Kinase-like binds PP1 and SERA5 and is exported to host erythrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148576,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Pseudokinases play key roles in many biological processes but they are poorly understood compared to active kinases. Eight putative pseudokinases have been predicted in Plasmodium species. We selected the unique pseudokinase belonging to tyrosine kinase like (TKL) family for detailed structural and functional analysis in P. falciparum and P. berghei. The primary structure of PfpTKL lacks residues critical for kinase activity, supporting its annotation as a pseudokinase. The recombinant pTKL pseudokinase domain was able to bind ATP, but lacked catalytic activity as predicted. The sterile alpha motif (SAM) and RVxF motifs of PfpTKL were found to interact with the P. falciparum proteins serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) and protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) respectively, suggesting that pTKL has a scaffolding role. Furthermore, we found that PP1c activity in a heterologous model was modulated in an RVxF-dependent manner. During the trophozoite stages, PbpTKL was exported to infected erythrocytes where it formed complexes with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization or host cell maturation and homeostasis. Finally, genetic analysis demonstrated that viable strains obtained by genomic deletion or knocking down PbpTKL did not affect the course of parasite intra-erythrocytic development or gametocyte emergence, indicating functional redundancy during these parasite stages.",Human mid-trimester amniotic fluid (stem) cells lack expression of the pluripotency marker OCT4A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148575,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Expression of OCT4A is one of the hallmarks of pluripotency, defined as a stem cell's ability to differentiate into all the lineages of the three germ layers. Despite being defined as non-tumorigenic cells with high translational potential, human mid-trimester amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) are often described as sharing features with embryonic stem cells, including the expression of OCT4A, which could hinder their clinical potential. To clarify the OCT4A status of hAFSCs, we first undertook a systematic review of the literature. We then performed extensive gene and protein expression analyses to discover that neither frozen, nor fresh hAFSCs cultivated in multipotent stem cell culture conditions expressed OCT4A, and that the OCT4A positive results from the literature are likely to be attributed to the expression of pseudogenes or other OCT4 variants. To address this issue, we provide a robust protocol for the assessment of OCT4A in other stem cells.",Extraction of gray-scale intensity distributions from micro computed tomography imaging for femoral cortical bone differentiation between low-magnesium and normal diets in a laboratory mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148574,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Previous studies have shown that the geometric development of femoral trabecular bone is affected by insufficient dietary intake of magnesium. However, it is not clear whether the development of femoral cortical bone can be quantitatively evaluated according to a diet with inadequate magnesium supplementation. Therefore, we used a micro computed tomography (CT) imaging approach with a laboratory mouse model to explore the potential application of texture analysis for the quantitative assessment of femoral cortical bones. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into two groups, where one group was fed a normal diet and the other group was fed a low-magnesium diet. We used a micro CT scanner for image acquisition, and the subsequent development of cortical bone was examined by texture analysis based on the statistical distribution of gray-scale intensities in which seven essential parameters were extracted from the micro CT images. Our calculations showed that the mean intensity increased by 7.20% (p = 0.000134), sigma decreased by 29.18% (p = 1.98E-12), skewness decreased by 19.52% (p = 0.0000205), kurtosis increased by 9.62% (p = 0.0877), energy increased by 24.19% (p = 3.32E-09), entropy decreased by 6.14% (p = 3.00E-10), and the Nakagami parameter increased by 104.32% (p = 4.13E-12) in the low-magnesium group when compared to the normal group. We found that the statistical parameters extracted from the gray-scale intensity distribution were able to differentiate between femoral cortical bone developments in the two different diet groups.",Elemental and Mineralogical Composition of the Western Andean Snow (18°S-41°S).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148573,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The snowpack is an important source of water for many Andean communities. Because of its importance, elemental and mineralogical composition analysis of the Andean snow is a worthwhile effort. In this study, we conducted a chemical composition analysis (major and trace elements, mineralogy, and chemical enrichment) of surface snow sampled at 21 sites across a transect of about 2,500 km in the Chilean Andes (18-41°S). Our results enabled us to identify five depositional environments: (i) sites 1-3 (in the Atacama Desert, 18-26°S) with relatively high concentrations of metals, high abundance of quartz and low presence of arsenates, (ii) sites 4-8 (in northern Chile, 29-32°S) with relatively high abundance of quartz and low presence of metals and arsenates, (iii) sites 9-12 (in central Chile, 33-35°S) with anthropogenic enrichment of metals, relatively high values of quartz and low abundance of arsenates, (iv) sites 13-14 (also in central Chile, 35-37°S) with relatively high values of quartz and low presence of metals and arsenates, and v) sites 15-21 (in southern Chile, 37-41°S) with relatively high abundance of arsenates and low presence of metals and quartz. We found significant anthropogenic enrichment at sites close to Santiago (a major city of 6 million inhabitants) and in the Atacama Desert (that hosts several major copper mines).",NOMePlot: analysis of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy at the single molecule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148571,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Recent technical advances highlight that to understand mammalian development and human disease we need to consider transcriptional and epigenetic cell-to-cell differences within cell populations. This is particularly important in key areas of biomedicine like stem cell differentiation and intratumor heterogeneity. The recently developed nucleosome occupancy and methylome (NOMe) assay facilitates the simultaneous study of DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning on the same DNA strand. NOMe-treated DNA can be sequenced by sanger (NOMe-PCR) or high throughput approaches (NOMe-seq). NOMe-PCR provides information for a single locus at the single molecule while NOMe-seq delivers genome-wide data that is usually interrogated to obtain population-averaged measures. Here, we have developed a bioinformatic tool that allow us to easily obtain locus-specific information at the single molecule using genome-wide NOMe-seq datasets obtained from bulk populations. We have used NOMePlot to study mouse embryonic stem cells and found that polycomb-repressed bivalent gene promoters coexist in two different epigenetic states, as defined by the nucleosome binding pattern detected around their transcriptional start site."

A neural network is used to extract the desired information from the images of the droplets. We demonstrate the method in two applications: measurement of the concentration of each component of a water/alcohol mixture, and measurement of the flow rate of the same mixture. A large number of droplet images are recorded and used to train deep neural networks (DNN) to predict the flow rate or the concentration. It is shown that this method can be used to quantify the concentrations of each component with a 0.5% accuracy and the flow rate with a resolution of 0.05 ml/h. The proposed method can in principle be used to measure other properties of the fluid such as surface tension and viscosity.","Development of a DNA isolation device using poly(3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine)-coated swab for on-site molecular diagnostics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148558,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"For on-site molecular diagnostics, a pre-treatment step for isolation of nucleic acid from clinical samples on site is desired.

In this study, we developed a poly(3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) (L-DOPA)-coated swab that can absorb and desorb DNA depending on pH of buffers and a portable integrated DNA isolation device that comprises integrated chambers containing DNA isolation buffers. The poly(L-DOPA)-coated swab interacts with each buffer by passing through the membrane between the integrated chambers. Our device involves a simple operation and does not require any large equipment or skilled experts. By connecting the device with an automated polymerase chain reaction system, an isothermal amplification system, or a non-amplified DNA detection method, on-site molecular diagnosis of various diseases can be quickly realized.",Altered functional connectivity associated with time discounting in chronic pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148557,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Chronic pain (CP) is a global problem extensively associated with an unhealthy lifestyle. Time discounting (TD), a tendency to assign less value to future gains than to present gains, is an indicator of the unhealthy behaviors. While, recent neuroimaging studies implied overlapping neuro mechanisms underlying CP and TD, little is known about the specific relationship between CP and TD in behavior or neuroscience. As such, we investigated the association of TD with behavioral measures in CP and resting-state brain functional network in both CP patients and healthy subjects. Behaviorally, TD showed a significant correlation with meaningfulness in healthy subjects, whereas TD in patients only correlated with pain intensity. We identified a specific network including medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in default mode network (DMN) associated with TD in healthy subjects that showed significant indirect mediation effect of meaningfulness on TD. In contrast, TD in patients was correlated with functional connectivity between dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and temporal lobe that mediated the effect of pain intensity on TD in patients. These results imply that TD is modulated by pain intensity in CP patients, and the brain function associated to TD is shifted from a medial to lateral representation within the frontal regions.",Molecular basis of natural tolerance to glyphosate in Convolvulus arvensis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148556,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Convolvulus arvensis is a troublesome weed that is naturally tolerant to glyphosate. This weed tolerates glyphosate at a rate 5.1 times higher than that of glyphosate-susceptible Calystegia hederacea. Glyphosate-treated C. arvensis plants accumulated less shikimic acid than C. hederacea plants. The overexpression of EPSPS genes from the two species in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in similar glyphosate tolerance levels. qPCR of genomic DNA revealed that the EPSPS copy number in C. arvensis was approximately 2 times higher than that in C. hederacea. Moreover, glyphosate treatment caused a marked increase in EPSPS mRNA in C. arvensis compared to C. hederacea. GUS activity analysis showed that the promoter of CaEPSPS (CaEPSPS-P) highly improved GUS expression after glyphosate treatment, while no obvious differential GUS expression was observed in ChEPSPS-P transgenic A. thaliana in the presence or absence of glyphosate. Based on the obtained results, two coexisting mechanisms may explain the natural glyphosate tolerance in C. arvensis: (i) high EPSPS copy number and (ii) specific promoter-mediated overexpression of EPSPS after glyphosate treatment.",Physical Radiation Enhancement Effects Around Clinically Relevant Clusters of Nanoagents in Biological Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148555,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Here we show that the determining factor for physical radiation enhancement effects for a clinically realistic cluster of heavy-atom bearing nanoparticles is the total number of heavy atoms packed into the cluster. We do this through a multiscale Monte Carlo approach which permits the consideration of radiation transport through clusters of millions of nanoparticles. The finding is in contrast to that predicted when isolated nanoparticles are considered and is a direct consequence of the Auger electrons playing less of a role for clusters compared to isolate nanoparticles. We further show that this result is agnostic to selection of the subcellular region considered to be sensitive to the effects of radiation, provided the inside the cluster of nanoparticles is not considered to be biologically active.",A Landsat-based vegetation trend product of the Tibetan Plateau for the time-period 1990-2018.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148554,Scientific data,2019 06 10,"The Tibetan Plateau is a unique, biodiverse ecosystem with an important role in the climate and hydrological system of Asia. Its vegetation supports important functions including fodder provision, erosion prevention and water retention. Assessing vegetation trends of the Tibetan Plateau is crucial to understand effects of recent climate and land-use changes. Most existing vegetation trend products covering the entire Tibetan Plateau have a coarse spatial grain and cover short temporal ranges. This hampers their applicability in studies conducted at local scales where land-use decisions take place and at time scales where climate changes become apparent. Here, we present vegetation trend products for the entire Tibetan Plateau at a spatial resolution of 30 m for the time period 1990-2018. These products include results of a modified Mann-Kendall trend test applied to annual Landsat-based NDVI mosaics, composed from all satellite observations acquired during the vegetation periods as well as NDVI difference images. These data can be valuable to many researchers including for example wildlife ecologists, rangeland experts and climate change researchers.",Human genes influence the interaction between Streptococcus mutans and host caries susceptibility: a genome-wide association study in children with primary dentition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148553,International journal of oral science,2019 06 10,"Streptococcus mutans is a well-known cause of dental caries, due to its acidogenicity, aciduricity, and ability to synthesize exopolysaccharides in dental plaques. Intriguingly, not all children who carry S. mutans manifest caries, even with similar characteristics in oral hygiene, diet, and other environmental factors. This phenomenon suggests that host susceptibility potentially plays a role in the development of dental caries; however, the association between host genetics, S. mutans, and dental caries remains unclear. Therefore, this study examined the influence of host gene-by-S. mutans interaction on dental caries. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted in 709 US children (<13 years old), using the dbGap database acquired from the center for oral health research in appalachia (COHRA) and the Iowa Head Start programmes (GEIRS). A generalized estimating equation was used to examine the gene-by-S. mutans interaction effects on the outcomes (decayed and missing/filled primary teeth due to caries). Sequentially, the COHRA and GEIRS data were used to identify potential interactions and replicate the findings. Three loci at the genes interleukin 32 (IL32), galactokinase 2 (GALK2), and CUGBP, Elav-like family member 4 (CELF4) were linked to S. mutans carriage, and there was a severity of caries at a suggestive significance level among COHRA children (P < 9 × 10-5), and at a nominal significance level among GEIRS children (P = 0.047-0.001). The genetic risk score that combined the three loci also significantly interacted with S. mutans (P < 0.000 1). Functional analyses indicated that the identified genes are involved in the host immune response, galactose carbohydrate metabolism, and food-rewarding system, which could potentially be used to identify children at high risk for caries and to develop personalized caries prevention strategies.",Beaver-generated disturbance extends beyond active dam sites to enhance stream morphodynamics and riparian plant recruitment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148552,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Given the direct effects of their dams on hydrology, sediment storage, and vegetation, beaver are widely acknowledged as ecosystem engineers. Here we explore the effects of beaver activity on channel processes and riparian plant recruitment beyond those dams and after dam abandonment in southwestern Montana, USA. Willow cuttings from beaver herbivory are commonly deposited along point bars, adding roughness and promoting sediment accumulation. Most cuttings are found <1 km downstream of an active dam. These cuttings often sprout, aiding in willow colonization and bar stabilization. Thirty-four radiocarbon ages show that beaver cuttings have accumulated by similar processes over thousands of years, adding to floodplain carbon storage. Breached dams can initiate meanders, increasing channel and riparian habitat diversity. Beaver activity thus generates a cycle of frequent disturbance, from dam building and riparian plant browsing through dam failure and abandonment, with each phase influencing channel and floodplain evolution and riparian plant recruitment.",Clinical characteristics of liver failure with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148551,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Liver failure with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening syndrome with high mortality. The aim of this study was to decipher clinical and laboratory characteristics of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after definite diagnosis of liver failure and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of HLH in patients with liver failure. Eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH were retrospectively investigated in this study. All patients presented with jaundice, persistent high-grade fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, evidence of hemophagocytes in the bone marrow and laboratory abnormalities indicating HLH. The average interval from the earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days. Six (54.55%) patients died during follow-up. For patients with liver failure after admission and subsequently definitively diagnosed with HLH, bilirubin and INR were significantly decreased. HLH is definitely diagnosed at an intermediate or late stage when patients have already suffered from liver failure. The initial dose of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) was decreased to 1-1.5 mg/kg/d and gradually reduced thereafter. In conclusion, for patients with liver failure, HLH should be screened as early as possible upon persistent fever, splenomegaly and unexplained pancytopenia. For patients with liver failure and HLH, the dosage of glucocorticoid should be reduced to avoid serious side effects.",Biomechanical System Versus Observational Rating Scale for Parkinson's Disease Tremor Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148550,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"There is a lack of evidence that either conventional observational rating scale or biomechanical system is a better tremor assessment tool. This work focuses on comparing a biomechanical system and the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in terms of test-retest reliability. The Parkinson's disease tremors were quantified by biomechanical system in joint angular displacement and predicted rating, as well as assessed by three raters using observational ratings. Qualitative comparisons of the validity and function are made also. The observational rating captures the overall severity of body parts, whereas the biomechanical system provides motion- and joint-specific tremor severity. The tremor readings of the biomechanical system were previously validated against encoders' readings and doctors' ratings; the observational ratings were validated with previous ratings on assessing the disease and combined motor symptoms rather than on tremor specifically. Analyses show that the predicted rating is significantly more reliable than the average clinical ratings by three raters.

However, in fishes, chromosome ploidy is diversiform, which may provide natural parental resources for triploid and pentaploid breeding. Both tetraploid and hexaploid exist in Schizothorax fishes, which were thought to belong to different subfamilies with tetraploid Percocypris fishes in morphology, but they are sister genera in molecule. Fortunately, the pentaploid hybrid fishes have been successfully obtained by hybridization of Schizothorax wangchiachii (♀, 2n = 6X = 148) × Percocypris pingi (♂, 2n = 4X = 98). To understand the genetic and morphological difference among the hybrid fishes and their parents, four methods were used in this study: morphology, karyotype, red blood cell (RBC) DNA content determination and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR). In morphology, the hybrid fishes were steady, and between their parents with no obvious preference. The chromosome numbers of P. pingi have been reported as 2n = 4X = 98. In this study, the karyotype of S. wangchiachii was 2n = 6X = 148 = 36m + 34sm + 12st + 66t, while that the hybrid fishes was 2n = 5X = 123 = 39m + 28sm + 5st + 51t. Similarly, the RBC DNA content of the hybrid fishes was intermediate among their parents. In ISSR, the within-group genetic diversity of hybrid fishes was higher than that of their parents. Moreover, the genetic distance of hybrid fishes between P. pingi and S.wangchiachii was closely related to that of their parental ploidy, suggesting that parental genetic material stably coexisted in the hybrid fishes. This is the first report to show a stable pentaploid F1 hybrids produced by hybridization of a hexaploid and a tetraploid in aquaculture.",Why we need to take personality disorder out of the doghouse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148538,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2019 05 31,SummaryThe diagnosis of personality disorder is sometimes tolerated but often reviled as a label to attach to people we do not like. This is hardly surprising when we consider that problems in interpersonal relationships constitute the main feature of the disorder. But we cannot escape the fact that personality problems are extremely common and rejection on grounds of perceived undesirability is doltish. Both the DSM-5 (2013) alternative model and new ICD-11 classification of personality may help understanding as they are more in tune with science. Most of the previous classifications have failed to help practitioners or patients.Declaration of interestThe author was the chair of the ICD-11 Revision Group for the Classification of Personality Disorders of the World Health Organization between 2010 and 2017.,Belief in a Just World and Emotional Intelligence in Subjective Well-Being of Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148537,The Spanish journal of psychology,2019 05 31,"The study of coping strategies has provided valuable insights about the process of helping cancer patients adapt to their disease. However, new approaches must be explored to increase the knowledge of this adjustment. In this study, we will analyze the relationship between patients' psychological well-being and quality of life and less well-studied constructs such as the belief in a just world (BJW) and emotional intelligence (EI). Sixty-eight cancer patients (35 men, 33 women; mean age 53.5 years; range: 20-86) were asked about their personal and general BJW, EI, Perception of Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Depression. Different multiple regression analyses showed that patients' personal BJW negatively predicted their anxiety (p &lt; .05) and a trend to a better quality of life. In addition, patients with high scores in the Mood Repair subfactor of EI showed better quality of life (p &lt; .05), and those with higher Attention to Feelings exhibited more Anxiety (p &lt; .01) and a trend to more Depression. These results underline the need to take into consideration new factors, such as BJW and EI, in clinical interventions for cancer patients.",Conjugated linoleic acid and betaine affect lipolysis in pig adipose tissue explants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148536,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 31,"Consumers' demand of leaner meat products is a challenge. Although betaine and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) have the potential to decrease porcine adipose tissue, their mode of action is poorly understood. The aim of the study was to determine the lipolytic effect of betaine and CLA in the adipose tissue of Iberian pigs. Adipose tissue explants from five pigs (38 kg BW) were prepared from dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissue samples and cultivated for 2 h (acute experiments) or 72 h (chronic experiments). Treatments included 100 µM linoleic acid (control), 100 µM trans-10, cis-12 CLA, 100 µM linoleic acid + 1 mM betaine and 100 µM trans-10, cis-12 CLA + 1 mM betaine (CLABET). To examine the ability of betaine or CLA to inhibit insulin's suppression of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, test medium was amended with 1 µM isoproterenol ±10 nM insulin. Media glycerol was measured at the end of the incubations. Acute lipolysis (2 h) was increased by CLA and CLABET (85% to 121%; P 0.10). When lipolysis was stimulated by isoproterenol (125% increase in rate compared with basal), CLA and CLABET decreased glycerol release (27%; P 0.10). CLA decreased leptin release (25%; P &lt; 0.001) when insulin was present in the media, partially inhibiting insulin stimulation of leptin release. In conclusion, betaine and CLA produced a biphasic response regarding lipolysis so that glycerol release was increased in acute conditions, while CLA decreased glycerol release and betaine had no effect in chronic conditions. Furthermore, CLA and CLABET indirectly increased lipolysis by reducing insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis during acute conditions.",Automated Reconstruction of Spherical Kikuchi Maps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148535,"Microscopy and microanalysis : the official journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada",2019 05 31,"An automated approach to fully reconstruct spherical Kikuchi maps from experimentally collected electron backscatter diffraction patterns and overlay each pattern onto its corresponding position on a simulated Kikuchi sphere is presented in this study. This work demonstrates the feasibility of warping any Kikuchi pattern onto its corresponding location of a simulated Kikuchi sphere and reconstructing a spherical Kikuchi map of a known phase based on any set of experimental patterns. This method consists of the following steps after pattern collection: (1) pattern selection based on multiple threshold values; (2) extraction of multiple scan parameters and phase information; (3) generation of a kinematically simulated Kikuchi sphere as the ""skeleton"" of the spherical Kikuchi map; and (4) overlaying the inverse gnomonic projection of multiple selected patterns after appropriate pattern center calibration and refinement. The proposed method is the first automated approach to reconstructing spherical Kikuchi maps from experimental Kikuchi patterns.

The 10-item scale was applied to a sample of 248 adolescents (128 boys) aged 13 to 14 years. Semi-confirmatory factor analysis supported the original two-factor structure: Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression (SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .96). These two factors demonstrate adequate internal consistency and evidence for convergent validity with other scales that refer to emotional intelligence, affect, and behavior. Thus, Cognitive Reappraisal scores were associated with higher self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect and personal adjustment (ps &lt; .05). Conversely, Expressive Suppression scores were associated with lower self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect, and personal adjustment (ps &lt; .01), with higher scores on negative affect, school and clinical maladjustment (ps &lt; .01), as well as stress and depression symptoms (ps &lt; .001). Overall, these findings suggest that the questionnaire may be a useful and reliable instrument for the assessment of emotion regulation strategies in early adolescents for future research in Spanish speaking countries.",Naturally Occurring Expressive Suppression is Associated with Lapses in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148529,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,2019 05 31,"Expressive suppression (i.e., effortful regulation of overt affect) has a deleterious impact on executive functioning (EF).

Such approaches have been suggested several times in plant pathology contexts but rarely have been implemented, in part because the institutional structures that enable successful collective action are poorly understood. In this research, we conducted in-depth interviews with hop producers in Oregon and Washington State to identify their motivations for and barriers to collective action regarding communication of disease levels, coordination of management practices, and sharing of best management practices and other data for powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera macularis). Growers were generally open to and engaged in communication with neighbors and others on disease status in their hop yards and some evidence of higher levels of information sharing on management practices was found. However, growers who had developed extensive knowledge and databases were reluctant to share information viewed as proprietary. Relationships, trust, and reciprocity were facilitating factors for communication and information sharing, whereas lack of these factors and social norms of independence and pride in portions of the grower community were identified as impediments. Given the heterogeneity of trust, lack of confidence in reciprocity, and weak shared norms, communication of disease risk and coordinated management may be most successful if directed at a smaller scale as a series of neighborhood-based partnerships of growers and their immediate neighbors. Developing a disease reporting system and coordinated disease management efforts with more producers and at larger spatial extents would require formalized structures and rules that would provide assurance that there is consistency in disease data collection and reporting, reciprocation, and sanctions for those who use the information for marketing purposes against other growers. Given the analyses presented here, we believe there is potential for collective action in disease management but with limitations on the scope and nature of the actions.",Ultrasound-guided central venous vascular access-novel needle navigation technology compared with conventional method: A randomized study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148509,The journal of vascular access,2019 05 31,"Central venous catheter insertion is a common procedure in the intensive care setting.

Here, we introduce a molecular dynamics-based approach to capture a diverse conformational ensemble of the CDR-H3 loop in solution. The results clearly indicate that the inherently flexible CDR-H3 loop indeed needs to be characterized as a conformational ensemble. The conformational changes of the CDR-H3 loop in all antibodies investigated follow the paradigm of conformation selection, because we observe the experimentally determined binding competent conformation without the presence of the antigen within the ensemble of pre-existing conformational states in solution before binding. We also demonstrate for several examples that the conformation observed in the antibody crystal structure without antigen present is actually selected to bind the carboxyterminal tail region of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab). Thus, special care must be taken when characterizing antibody CDR-H3 loops by Fab X-ray structures, and the possibility that pre-existing conformations are present should always be considered.",Barriers to and Facilitators of Weight Management in Adults Using a Meal Replacement Program That Includes Health Coaching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148506,Journal of primary care & community health,2019 05 31,"The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics supports meal replacement (MR) programs as an effective diet-related weight management strategy.

The aim of the study is to prospectively analyze QoL after RALP according to the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire prostate cancer-specific module (EORTC-QLQ-PR25) and C30 and explore risk factors for the deterioration of QoL after surgery. A total of 584 patients undergoing RALP were prospectively enrolled. QoL was assessed with the validated EORTC-QLQ-PR25 and C30. Differences across QoL items were assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum test and associations between risk factors and QoL scores were tested via univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. All items of the PR25 questionnaire showed a significant deterioration at 1 month after RALP and began to normalize 3 months after surgery. At 24 months follow-up, urinary, bowel, and sexual activity scores were not significantly different from preoperative scores, while incontinence aid, treatment-related symptoms, and sexual functioning remained significantly worse. Preoperative sexual activity was more important in determining 3-month sexual outcomes than preoperative 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) or nerve-sparing approach. An overall return to preoperative QoL was registered at 3 months after RALP in global and physical QoL, and most important, global, physical, social, and role-functioning QoL scores were improved at 12 and 24 months compared to preoperative scores. In this prospective study, detailed data on QoL are reported via the EORTC-PR25 and C30 questionnaires.

Greater exercise motivation, greater social support for exercise, and more favorable environmental perceptions were hypothesized to be associated with higher MVPA, and greater social support and environmental perceptions were hypothesized to be associated with higher exercise motivation. This secondary analysis used baseline data from the Positive Action for Today's Health (PATH) trial. African American men ( n = 166, aged 48 ± 15 years) completed surveys that assessed cognitive, social, and environmental factors theoretically relevant to MVPA. Accelerometers were used to obtain a 7-day estimate of MVPA. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that exercise motivation was positively associated with MVPA ( B = 1.15, SE = .41, p = .006). Exercise attitudes ( B = .16, SE = .07, p = .037), exercise self-concept ( B = .28, SE = .06, p < .001), exercise support from friends ( B = .12, SE = .06, p = .048), and places for walking and cycling ( B = .13, SE = .06, p = .032) were positively associated with exercise motivation.

First-line treatment with a combination of platinum agents and topoisomerase inhibitors has been the standard of care for over 30 years, with disappointing clinical outcome caused by early-acquired chemoresistance. In this disheartening scenario, novel treatment strategies are being implemented in order to either revert or bypass resistance mechanisms. Areas covered: The general mechanism of action of the standard frontline treatment regimens for SCLC, as well as the known resistance mechanisms to these drugs, is reviewed. Moreover, we focus on the current preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential role of PARP inhibitors and rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) to tackle chemoresistance in SCLC. Expert opinion: Preliminary evidence supports PARP inhibitors and Rova-T as two promising approaches to either revert or bypass chemoresistance in SCLC, respectively. The identification of potential predictive biomarkers of response to these innovative treatments (SLFN11 and DLL3) has shortened the gap between SCLC and personalized targeted therapy.

Glassman leaves and fruits via UPLC-QTOF-PDA-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148478,Natural product research,2019 05 31,"The purpose of this study is to provide a complete metabolic profile of the hydroalcoholic extracts of the leaves and fruits of Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman via UPLC-QTOF-PDA-MS and to evaluate their anticholinesterase activities in a model of Alzheimer disease. The current study has identified 39 metabolites belonging to various chemical classes (i.e. flavonols, phenolic acids, fatty acids, stilbenoids and lignans). While the fatty acids predominated in both leaves and fruits, the stilbenoids were more predominant in leaves. Their neuroprotective effect was comparable to Aricept; the standard drug used in treatment of Alzheimer disease. Both extracts significantly decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity and improved the histopathological changes in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of rat model of aluminium chloride-induced Alzheimer disease. In light of the current study, Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.) Glassman is recommended as promising candidate for palliative treatment in Alzheimer disease through inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity.",Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols from Hypericum choisianum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148477,Natural product research,2019 05 31,"Twenty-one polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols, including three new compounds named as hyperichoisins A (3), B (14) and C (21), were isolated from the aerial parts of Hypericum choisianum.

Some evidence has shown that a simple and home-based programme of inspiratory muscle training offers promising results in terms of aerobic capacity improvement in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This study aimed to investigate whether the baseline inspiratory muscle function predicts the changes in aerobic capacity (measured as peak oxygen uptake; peak VO2) after a 12-week home-based programme of inspiratory muscle training in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.,Anomalous Electron Dynamics Induced through the Valley Magnetic Domain: A Pathway to Valleytronic Current Processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148458,Nano letters,2019 06 16,"An interplay between an applied strain and the Berry curvature reconstruction in the uniaxially strained monolayer MoS2 is explored that leads to the unbalanced Berry curvatures centered at K and -K points and, eventually, the valley magnetization under an external electric field. This is shown to explain a recent experimental observation of the valley magnetoelectric effect and develop a novel concept of the valley magnetic domain (VMD), i.e., a real-space homogeneous distribution of the valley magnetization. A realization of VMD guarantees a sufficient number of stable valley-polarized carriers, one of the most essential prerequisites of the valleytronics. Furthermore, we discover the anomalous electron dynamics through the VMD activation and achieve a manipulation of the anomalous transverse current perpendicular to the electric field, directly accessible to the signal processing [for instance, the current modulation under the VMD (i.e., the VMD wall) moving and the terahertz current rectification under the VMD switching]. This suggests a concept of VMD for use in providing new physical insight into the valleytronic functionality and its manipulation as a key ingredient of potential device applications.",PDMS-Infused Poly(High Internal Phase Emulsion) Templates for the Construction of Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces with Self-cleaning and Self-repairing Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148457,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 12,"Advanced liquid-repelling materials that resist both water-based and oil-based contaminants have significant applications in many fields. Herein, a novel protocol for the fabrication of a robust poly(high internal phase emulsion) (polyHIPE)-based slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) system with combined self-repairing and self-cleaning properties is developed. Specifically, polystyrene-based polyHIPE (PS-HIPE) membranes with an interconnected porous structure were prepared from polymerization of the continuous oil phase in the water-in-oil HIPE templates. These polyHIPE membranes were used, for the first time, as porous substrates for loading low surface tension silicone oils as lubricating liquids for the fabrication of polyHIPE-based SLIPS membranes. These polyHIPE-based SLIPS membranes could easily repel both water- and oil-based contaminants (e.g., ink, milk, and coffee) with very low sliding angles (3.0 ± 1.3°) and could even repel solid contaminants (e.g., dust) upon washing with water. Meanwhile, such membranes exhibit excellent self-repairing properties so that physical scratching damage, such as cutting a trench, does not affect the liquid-repelling performance. The liquid-repelling ability could be recovered completely within 10 s. More significantly, such a SLIPS membrane shows excellent durability so that the water sliding angle of the SLIPS could be maintained at less than 5.0° for about 80 cycles owing to the regenerated poly(dimethylsiloxane) layer on the surface. This work represents a robust methodology to enrich the development of hydrophobic and oleophobic slippery surfaces, which is promising for many areas, such as biomedical, self-cleaning, antifouling, and self-repairing materials.",An Improved Strategy for High-Quality Cesium Bismuth Bromine Perovskite Quantum Dots with Remarkable Electrochemiluminescence Activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148456,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 13,"Low-toxic trivalent bismuth, with an isoelectronic structure (6s26p0) and a similar ionic radius to divalent lead, represents a promising candidate for constructing lead-free perovskites. Herein, cesium bismuth halide perovskite quantum dots (Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs) were synthesized via a comprehensively improved ligand-assisted reprecipitation method with the addition of γ-butyrolactone, trace distilled water, and tetrabutylammonium bromide, as well as the aid of ultrasonic technology. The as-prepared QDs displayed remarkable monodispersity, outstanding stability, and highly passivated surfaces with a near-single-component PL decay, thus affording superb optical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield up to 37%, outperforming all the reported bismuth-based perovskites. Furthermore, Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs were first attempted for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and exhibited a stable and efficient ECL response following either an annihilation or a coreaction ECL mechanism.

Without damage to the cell biological properties, single-cell-derived tumor-sphere is encouraging options for CSCs identification and studies. Although several single cell-based microfluidic methods have been developed for CSCs studies, clarifying liaison between the biomechanics of cells (such as size and deformability) and stem (such as tumor-sphere formation and drug resistance) remains challenging. Herein, we present a platform of integrated microfluidics for the analysis of single-cell-derived tumor-sphere formation and drug resistance. Tumor-spheres derived from different biomechanics (size and/or deformation) single-cells could be formed efficiently using this device. To demonstrate the microfluidic-platform capability, a proof-of-concept experiment was implemented by evaluating single-cell-derived sphere formation of single glioblastoma cells with different biomechanics. Additionally, a course of chemotherapy to study these single-cell-derived spheres was determined by coculture with vincristine. The results indicate that tumor cell biomechanics is associated with single-cell-derived spheres formation; that is, smaller and/or more deformable tumor cells are more stem-like defined by the formation of single-cell-derived spheres than more prominent and/or lesser deformable tumor cells. Also, tumor-spheres derived from single small and/or more deformable tumor cell have higher drug resistance than more prominent and/or less deformable tumor cells. Our device offers a new approach for single-cell-derived sphere formation according to tumor cell different biomechanical properties. Furthermore, it offers a new method for CSC identification and downstream analysis on a single-cell level.",A Superior Sodium/Lithium-Ion Storage Material: Sea Sponge C/Sn2Fe@GO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148454,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 12,"A well-structured anode nanomaterial, which can ensure electron and ion transport and avoid excessive pulverization, is of crucial importance to achieve high capacity with superior cycling stability for both sodium- and lithium-ion batteries (SIBs and LIBs).

The strain sensors were highly sensitive; the scan velocity afforded tunable sensitivity and an analytical model well-predicted behavior under low-strain (< 0.4%) conditions. We describe a prototype sensor that reliably measured composite beam tensile strain. We further enhanced the sensitivity by creating mechanical cracks facilitating small dynamic signal measurements. The linear sensitivity of the sensor could be tuned from 18.60 to 290.62 by varying the scan velocity from 2 to 40 μm/s.

However, previous electrically heated electrodes, including microwires and microdiscs, are usually small and often suffer from the requirement of frequent calibrations of the electrode surface temperature ( Ts) at different environment temperatures. Here, we fabricate a temperature-controllable disk electrode (TCDE) with a conventional size (3-5 mm in diameter). A one-parameter temperature calibration is proposed using a temperature transfer coefficient α and a structural model ( Ts = Te + α ( Th - Te)) to estimate Ts ( Th and Te are the temperature of the heating element and environment, respectively). The value of α is unique for a TCDE and mainly dependent on the structure and materials of the electrodes and the solution in nature. Once α is experimentally determined, Ts can be calibrated and found to be applicable to wide fluctuations in room temperature (15.0-33.0 °C) with errors below 1.5% for three types of disk electrodes (gold, glassy carbon, and platinum). The required Ts can be obtained by just setting Th without thermal characterization between the heating power and Ts. A simple relationship for exploring the dependence of α on the height ( H) and radius ( R) of the electrode materials and other constants ( a, b, c, and R0), α = 1 - c - aH - b ( R - R0)2, is revealed by numerical simulations (COMSOL). The impact of the radii of both the insulating materials of the electrode and the electrochemical cells on Ts is also considered. The effect of the solution thermal conductivity on α is studied. TCDEs are expected to be used as a sensor platform with enhanced performance.",Efficient Modulation of β-Amyloid Peptide Fibrillation with Polymer Nanoparticles Revealed by Super-Resolution Optical Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31148450,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 13,"β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregation is the essential hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Efficient inhibitors are highly desired for the prevention of Aβ assembly that has been considered as the primary therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from this, visualization of the aggregates and morphology at high spatial resolution is widely considered of crucial significance on biological treatment. In this work, we have developed small-sized (with diameter of ∼4.7 nm) and positively charged fluorescent conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNPs) with strong inhibition effect on Aβ1-40 peptides fibrillation. Interestingly, the CPNPs also possess excellent photophysical properties, including high photon counts, robust blinking, and repetitive fluorescence switching, that are especially suitable for localization-based super-resolution imaging. Spatial resolution of ∼20 nm for these blinking CPNPs is readily achieved. According to the optical microscopic results, it was found that binding of CPNPs to the terminal of seed fibrils can effectively inhibit the fibrillation process.
