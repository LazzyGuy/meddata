Underlying evidence is based on studies performed decades ago with perioperative care that significantly differed from current standards. Recent studies raise doubt about routine patching and have suggested that a more selective approach to patch closure (PAC) might be noninferior for procedural safety and long-term stroke prevention.

Despite curative surgery, some patients experience cancer recurrence. However, the pattern, stage, and time of recurrent disease (RD) remain unknown. We aimed to determine the pattern and stage of RD after curative open and laparoscopic surgery for CRC. Databases were searched using selected keywords for clinical studies that analyzed the pattern, stage, and time of RD from CRC. A systematic protocol was used for data extraction, data synthesis, and interpretation of results. Of 455 publications retrieved from databases, 9 clinical studies were selected for this systematic review. There is substantial evidence that pulmonary recurrence is most commonly associated with rectal tumors, and multisite RD appears more frequently with right-sided CRC. RD from colon cancers predominantly appears early in liver, while recurrences from rectal cancer appear late in lungs. Approximately 30% to 50% of RD after curative resection of CRC occurs within the first 2 years; however, median time to recurrence is gradually increasing, particularly for patients with rectal cancers. Advanced primary CRC is significantly correlated with more locoregional and distant RD, with worse disease-free survival. There is a decrease in the 5-year incidence of RD that is associated with prolongation of time of RD for both locoregional and metastatic disease. The duration and design of postoperative follow-up protocols for recurrences from CRC should be tailored to site and stage of primary tumor, as rectal cancers demand longer surveillance times than colon cancer.",Induction of Th2-related immune responses and production of systemic IgA in mice intranasally immunized with Brucella abortus malate dehydrogenase loaded chitosan nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792035,Vaccine,2019 03 08,"The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of mucosal immune responses by an important Brucella abortus antigen, malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), loaded in mucoadhesive chitosan nanoparticles (CNs) and immunized intranasally in a BALB/c mouse model. The production of cytokines was investigated in human leukemic monocyte cells (THP-1 cells) after stimulation with the nanoparticles. Mdh-loaded CNs (CNs-Mdh) induced higher interleukin (IL)-6 production than unloaded antigens and TF loaded CNs (CNs-TF). Using ELISpot to quantify cytokines and antibody-secreting cells in the intranasally immunized mice, IL-4 and IgG-secreting cells were found to be significantly increased at 4 weeks and 6 weeks post-immunization in the CNs-Mdh immunized group, respectively. Increases in Mdh-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies were confirmed at 6 weeks after immunization, indicating a predominant IgG1 response. Analysis of the mucosal immune response in the intranasally immunized mice revealed, Mdh-specific IgA and total IgA in the nasal washes, genital secretions, fecal extracts and sera that were remarkably increased in the CNs-Mdh-immunized group compared to the CNs-TF-immunized group except total IgA of nasal wash. Therefore, the results indicated that the intranasal immunization of CNs-loaded B. abortus Mdh antigen effectively induced antigen-specific mucosal immune responses through the elicitation of Th2-related immune responses.",The impact of peripheral artery disease on left ventricular diastolic function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792034,Journal of cardiology,2019 04 14,Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is often accompanied by heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

The quantitative assessment of intraoperative blood loss can be useful for indicating the real risk of bleeding complications, especially in medically compromised individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of bleeding in individuals under vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy and non-anticoagulated individuals submitted to dental extractions. Perioperative bleeding was evaluated by using a total collected bleeding corrected by absorbance reading (dental bleeding score). 138 procedures were performed. When the perioperative dental bleeding score was correlated with the number of extracted teeth, the quantity of bleeding was found to be directly proportional to the procedure. Extractions of two or more teeth presented higher scores than single extractions (p = 0.003). In a comparative analysis between the VKA and non-anticoagulated groups, no significant difference in the scores was found. The previous history of complications in dental procedures (p = 0.001) and the use of additional hemostatic measures were higher in the VKA group (p = 0.017). VKA therapy did not impact significantly the volume of blood lost during dental extractions.

We sought to assess the safety of AT discontinuation following PFO closure in patients with a cryptogenic ischemic event. A total of 453 consecutive patients (mean age: 48 ± 13years, men: 51%) who underwent PFO closure due to a cryptogenic ischemic event were included. All patients were on AT following PFO closure (antiplatelet therapy: 92.7%, anticoagulation: 7.3%). Ischemic and bleeding events, and AT were assessed at a median follow-up of 8 (IQR: 4 to 11) years, and follow-up was complete in 96% of patients. Stroke and transient ischemic attack occurred in 4 (0.9%) and 12 (2.6%) patients, respectively, and 27 (6.0%) patients had bleeding events (major in 6 [1.3%] patients, including 4 episodes of intracranial hemorrhage). All major bleeding events occurred under aspirin therapy. A total of 82 patients (18%) stopped the AT at a median of 7 (IQR: 5 to 34) months post-PFO closure (due to a bleeding event or gastrointestinal symptoms: 13 patients, no specific reason: 69 patients), and none of them had any ischemic event after a median time of 7 (IQR 3 to 10) years without any AT. A propensity score matched analysis including 46 patients who discontinued the AT within 1-year post-PFO closure and 120 patients with an ongoing AT showed the lack of differences in ischemic events between groups (0 vs 0.2 stroke/transient ischemic attack per 100 patient-years in the no-AT and AT groups, respectively). In conclusion, in young patients who underwent PFO closure, bleeding events occurred in ∼6% of patients after a median follow-up of 8years. AT was discontinued in about one fifth of patients (most of them within the year following PFO closure), and this was not associated with any increase in ischemic events at long-term follow-up. These results suggest that, in patients without other co-morbidities increasing the risk of stroke, temporary AT following PFO closure may be a reasonable strategy.",Relation of Minor Electrocardiographic Abnormalities to Cardiovascular Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30792000,The American journal of cardiology,2019 04 08,"Although minor electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities are common findings in clinical practice, their prognostic significance remains unclear due to inconsistent reports. We hypothesized that this inconsistency is due to the traditional focus on examining their prognostic significance as a binary variable (i.e., presence vs absence of any abnormality) ignoring the number of abnormalities. We tested this hypothesis in 6,467 participants (mean age 59 years, 53% women) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were free of baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD) and major ECG abnormalities. ECG abnormalities were defined from digitally recorded and centrally processed standard electrocardiograms using the Minnesota ECG Classification. CVD mortality was ascertained using National Death Index. About 38% of participants (n = 2,438) had at least 1 minor ECG abnormality at baseline. During a median follow-up of 13.9 years, 755 CVD deaths occurred. In a multivariable Cox model, presence of at least 1 minor ECG abnormality was marginally associated with increased risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval):1.15(1.00,1.34), p-value = 0.04)). However, as the number of ECG abnormalities increases, the association with CVD mortality showed a dose-response relation (event rate per 1,000 person-year of 7.3, 10.1, and 16.7 in participants with 0, 1, and ≥2 ECG abnormalities, respectively; p-value for trend <0.01). Also, each additional minor ECG abnormality was associated with a 13% increased risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.13(1.04, 1.24)). In conclusion, the number, not only the mere presence of minor ECG abnormalities should be taken into account to understand the prognostic significance of these common findings.",Prescription of Potentially Harmful Drugs in Young Adults With Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791999,The American journal of cardiology,2019 04 08,"According to national guidelines and statements drugs that can cause or exacerbate heart failure (HF) are considered potentially harmful and should be avoided if possible in patients with a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). To evaluate the prevalence of potentially harmful drug (PHD) prescription among patients with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure we conducted a retrospective cohort study using Truven Health MarketScan Commercial database from 2011 to 2014. Prescription of PHD as defined by American Heart Association Statement was examined among patients with a HFREF diagnosis in: (1) Two outpatient encounters, (2) One inpatient encounter as primary diagnosis and/or (3) one inpatient encounter any position and one outpatient encounter. Among 40,966 patients, 24.2% were prescribed with at least 1 drug with the potential to cause or exacerbate heart failure. Of the 9,954 patients prescribed with PHD, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were the most frequent category prescribed (67.4%), followed by antihypertensive (24%), diabetes mellitus (23.3%), neurological and psychiatric (21%) and antiarrhythmic medications (12.6%). After multivariable analysis female patients, the presence of a comorbidity associated with a PHD use and polypharmacy were more frequently prescribed a PHD. In conclusion almost ¼ of adult patients with a diagnosis of HFREF have a prescription of a drug with a potential to cause or exacerbate heart failure as defined by current heart failure guidelines.",Role of Preoperative Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Planning Ventricular Septal Myectomy in Patients With Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791998,The American journal of cardiology,2019 04 08,"In obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), extreme heterogeneity of septal morphology makes septal myectomy particularly challenging. Although cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reconstructs ventricular anatomy with high spatial resolution, CMR is not used systematically to plan preoperatively septal myectomy. In this study, we report our results with using CMR to plan the extent of septal excision in 112 consecutive HC patients who subsequently underwent myectomy. Depth and length of the myectomy planned at CMR were compared with those of the septal muscle excised in a single piece in all patients. Anterior septum maximal thickness at CMR was 22 ± 5 mm and excised muscle thickness 9 ± 3 mm. Planned myectomy length was 35 ± 11 mm (range 17 to 65) and excised muscle length 38 ± 10 mm (range 10 to 70), indicating extension of septal resection to mid-cavity. Thickness and length of the planned myectomy showed a significant correlation with the excised muscle (R2 = 0.345; p <0.001; and R2 = 0.358; p <0.001, respectively). Deep septal crypts were identified at CMR in 12(11%) patients, preventing muscle excision from areas at increased risk of iatrogenic septal defect. Large aberrant muscle bundles that could decrease mid-cavity dimension were identified at CMR and excised in 26(23%) patients. In the 55 patients with postoperative CMR, qualitative comparison of pre and postoperative ventricular morphology showed a smooth and apically extended myectomy. In conclusion, CMR planning of septal myectomy provided high resolution images of septal morphology and allowed us to perform a standardized and apically extended septal excision that was associated with favorable outcome. Our novel approach could make myectomy more accessible to cardiovascular surgeons.",Do we need to perform MRI of the whole spine in addition to MRI of the sacroiliac joints in suspected spondyloarthropathy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791997,Clinical radiology,2019 04 12,To identify the incidence of spinal-only changes (including both acute inflammatory and chronic structural changes) in patients with suspected spondyloarthropathy (SpA) to determine whether MRI of the sacroiliac joints would be sufficient in the initial radiological work-up and whether the number of spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations performed could be reduced.,Disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein protects against ectopic fat deposition and lipid-related kidney damage in diabetic nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791996,Kidney international,2019 03 24,"Ectopic fat deposition (EFD) in the kidney has been shown to play a causal role in diabetic nephropathy; however, the mechanism underlying EFD remains elusive. By transcriptome analysis, we found decreased expression levels of disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) in the kidneys of diabetic mice (induced by high-fat diet plus Streptozotocin) compared with control mice. Increased expression of adipocyte differentiation-related protein and abnormal levels of collagen I, fibronectin, and phosphorylated 5'AMP-activated kinase (p-AMPK), adipose triglyceride lipase (p-ATGL), and HMG-CoA reductase (p-HMGCR) were also observed in diabetic mice. These alterations were accompanied by deposition of lipid droplets in the kidney, and were more pronounced in diabetic DsbA-L knockout mice. In vitro, overexpression of DsbA-L ameliorated high glucose-induced intracellular lipid droplet deposition in a human proximal tubular cell line, and DsbA-L siRNA aggravated lipid droplet deposition and reduced the levels of p-AMPK, p-ATGL, and p-HMGCR. High glucose and palmitic acid treatment enhanced the expression of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18; these enhancements were further increased after treatment with DsbA-L siRNA but alleviated by co-treatment with an AMPK activator. In kidney biopsy tissue from patients with diabetic nephropathy, DsbA-L expression was negatively correlated with EFD and tubular damage. Collectively, these results suggest that DsbA-L has a protective role against EFD and lipid-related kidney damage in diabetic nephropathy. Activation of the AMPK pathway is a potential mechanism underlying DsbA-L action in the kidney.","Concurrent Criterion-related Validity, Reliability, and Responsiveness to Treatment of the Figure-of-Four Position for Measurement of Anterior Hip Joint Structures Tightness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791995,Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,2019 03 15,"The objective of this study was to examine the intra- and intertester reliability, concurrent criterion-related validity, and responsiveness to treatment of the ""figure-of-four"" position.",Utilization of Chiropractic Care in US Children and Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791994,Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,2019 03 15,The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of chiropractic utilization and examine sociodemographic characteristics associated with utilization in a representative sample of US children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years.,Colonoscopy utilization in rural areas by general surgeons: An analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791993,American journal of surgery,2019 02 22,"One in three adults above 50 years old have not been screened for colorectal cancer as of 2013.1 Rural areas have even lower screening and have more general surgeons compared to gastroenterologists,2 offering surgeons as a reservoir for necessary services."

However, whether LMAN1 plays a role as a trafficking factor in the central nervous system is largely unknown. Here, we determined the role of LMAN1 on endogenous protein levels of the Cys-loop superfamily of neuroreceptors, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 3 (5-HT3) receptors, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Knockdown of LMAN1 reduces the surface trafficking of endogenous β3 subunits of GABAARs in mouse hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of brain homogenates from LMAN1 knockout mice demonstrated that loss of LMAN1 decreases the total protein levels of 5HT3A receptors and γ2 subunits of GABAARs. LMAN1 knockout regulates the ER proteostasis network by upregulating ERP44 without changing calnexin levels. Interestingly, despite the critical role of the glycan-binding function of LMAN1 in its other known cargo clients, LMAN1 interacts with GABAARs in a glycan-independent manner. In summary, LMAN1 is a trafficking factor for certain neuroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is the first report of LMAN1 function in membrane protein trafficking.",Iron treatment inhibits Aβ42 deposition in vivo and reduces Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791980,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 16,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques containing the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) within the parenchyma of the brain. Aβ42, which is 42 amino acids in length, is considered to be the key pathogenic factor in AD. Iron deposition is found abundantly in the amyloid plaques of AD patients; however, whether iron intake exacerbates amyloid deposition in vivo is unknown. Here, we treated AD model mice with iron-containing water and found that Aβ42 deposition in the brain was significantly inhibited, along with a decrease in iron deposition. Iron treatment did not change the overall levels of iron in the brain or serum. Interestingly, Aβ40 generation was significantly increased by iron treatment in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing fibroblasts, whereas Aβ42 generation did not change, which led to a decreased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Because Aβ40 can inhibit Aβ42 aggregation in vitro, and Aβ40 inhibits amyloid formation in vivo, our results suggest that iron can selectively enhances Aβ40 generation and inhibit amyloid deposition by reducing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Thus, iron may be used as a novel treatment for reducing the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and Aβ42 deposition in AD.",miR-100-5p confers resistance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors Crizotinib and Lorlatinib in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791979,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 06,"Lung cancer causes the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Resistance to therapy is a major clinical issue contributing to the poor prognosis of lung cancer. In recent years, targeted therapy has become a concept where subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with genetically altered receptor tyrosine kinases are targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). One such subgroup harbors a gene fusion of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Although most NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK fusions initially respond to ALK TKI-therapy they eventually develop resistance. While ALK kinase domain mutations contribute to ALK TKI-refractoriness, they are only present in a fraction of all ALK TKI-resistant tumors. In this study we sought to explore a possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in conferring resistance to ALK TKIs in ALK TKI-refractory NSCLC cell lines. We subjected our ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells along with parental cancer cells to systematic miRNA expression arrays. Furthermore, ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells were exposed to a synthetic miRNA inhibitory Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-library in the presence of ALK TKIs Crizotinib or Lorlatinib. The outcome of the combined approaches uncovered miR-100-5p to confer resistance to Crizotinib and Lorlatinib in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells and to be a potential therapeutic target in drug resistance.",A tutorial on individual participant data meta-analysis using Bayesian multilevel modeling to estimate alcohol intervention effects across heterogeneous studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791977,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 31,"This paper provides a tutorial companion for the methodological approach implemented in Huh et al. (2015) that overcame two major challenges for individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Specifically, we show how to validly combine data from heterogeneous studies with varying numbers of treatment arms, and how to analyze highly-skewed count outcomes with many zeroes (e.g., alcohol and substance use outcomes) to estimate overall effect sizes. These issues have important implications for the feasibility, applicability, and interpretation of IPD meta-analysis but have received little attention thus far in the applied research literature. We present a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for combining multi-arm trials (i.e., those with two or more treatment groups) in a distribution-appropriate IPD analysis. Illustrative data come from Project INTEGRATE, an IPD meta-analysis study of brief motivational interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use and related harm among college students. Our approach preserves the original random allocation within studies, combines within-study estimates across all studies, overcomes between-study heterogeneity in trial design (i.e., number of treatment arms) and/or study-level missing data, and derives two related treatment outcomes in a multivariate IPD meta-analysis. This methodological approach is a favorable alternative to collapsing or excluding intervention groups within multi-arm trials, making it possible to directly compare multiple treatment arms in a one-step IPD meta-analysis. To facilitate application of the method, we provide annotated computer code in R along with the example data used in this tutorial.",Alternate Grassy Ecosystem States Are Determined by Palatability-Flammability Trade-Offs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791976,Trends in ecology & evolution,2019 03 23,"Fire and mammalian grazers both consume grasses, and feedbacks between grass species, their functional traits, and consumers have profound effects on grassy ecosystem structure worldwide, such that savanna and grassland states determined by fire or grazing can be considered alternate states.

Chronic opioid use during pregnancy poses several challenges for providing adequate analgesia and anesthesia in the peripartum period. These challenges include the potential for withdrawal, opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Here we discuss alterations in analgesic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that are associated with chronic opioid use. In addition, when treating pain in patients with opioid use disorder it is important to distinguish between different subgroups. In this review, we will discuss practical management strategies for parturients with (1) untreated opioid use disorder, (2) parturients on medication-assisted treatment (methadone, buprenorphine) and (3) patients recovering from opioid use disorder that are currently abstinent. Finally, we offer an overview of non-opioid strategies that may be utilized as part of a multimodal approach to providing optimal analgesia in this patient population.",Metformin-associated hyperlactacidaemia acidosis: Diagnosis rate in standard clinical practice and its relationship with renal failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791973,Revista clinica espanola,2019 06 02,Observational study on the difference between the number of cases of acidosis with hyperlactacidaemia suspected of being caused by metformin diagnosed in standard clinical practice and the incidence of this condition according to the datasheet.

Human genetic and preclinical studies suggest a critical role for IL-1β signaling in ethanol drinking and dependence, but little is known about the effects of chronic ethanol on the IL-1 system in addiction-related brain regions such as the central amygdala (CeA). In this study, we generated naïve, non-dependent (Non-Dep) and dependent (Dep) male mice using a paradigm of chronic-intermittent ethanol vapor exposure interspersed with two-bottle choice to examine 1) the expression of IL-1β, 2) the role of the IL-1 system on GABAergic transmission, and 3) the potential interaction with the acute effects of ethanol in the CeA. Immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy was used to assess expression of IL-1β in microglia and neurons in the CeA, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from CeA neurons to measure the effects of IL-1β (50 ng/ml) or the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra; 100 ng/ml) on action potential-dependent spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Overall, we found that IL-1β expression is significantly increased in microglia and neurons of Dep compared to Non-Dep and naïve mice, IL-1β and IL-1ra bi-directionally modulate GABA transmission through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms in all three groups, and IL-1β and IL-1ra do not alter the facilitation of GABA release induced by acute ethanol. These data suggest that while ethanol dependence induces a neuroimmune response in the CeA, as indicated by increased IL-1β expression, this does not significantly alter the neuromodulatory role of IL-1β on synaptic transmission.",Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (55 Gy in 20 fractions) for high-grade laryngeal dysplasia: report of acute toxicity and functional outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791965,The Journal of laryngology and otology,2019 04 22,"Radiotherapy is an option to treat high-grade laryngeal dysplasia.

Excessive accumulation of brain water content causes a gradual expansion of brain parenchyma, decreased blood flow and increased intracranial pressure and, ultimately, cerebral herniation and death. Current clinical treatment for ischemic edema is very limited, therefore, it is urgent to develop novel treatment strategies. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that AQP4, a water channel protein, is closely correlated with brain edema and could be an optimal therapeutic target for the reduction of ischemic brain edema. AQP4 is prevalently distributed in the central nervous system, and mainly regulates water flux in brain cells under normal and pathological conditions. This review focuses on the underlying mechanisms of AQP4 related to its dual role in edema formation and elimination.",CD97 Is Decreased in Preeclamptic Placentas and Promotes Human Trophoblast Invasion Through PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791863,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2019 02 22,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy disorder leading to the morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of the understanding of etiology, the only effective treatment of PE is the delivery of the placenta. An improved mastery on the regulation of trophoblast invasion could be meaningful to alleviate the disease burden of PE. Relative expression of CD97 in PE and normal placental tissues was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistology, and Western blot. The CD97 siRNA and expression vector was transfected to cultured human trophoblast HTR-8/SVneo, and the cell invasion as well as the protein expression in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway were evaluated. Expression of CD97 is significantly downregulated in PE placental tissues compared to normal controls. The Si-CD97 inhibits HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In accordance, overexpression of CD97 promotes trophoblast cell invasion. In addition, CD97 regulates FOXC2 expression and showed similar effects on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as specific FOXC2 inhibitor. In short, this study demonstrated the downregulation of CD97 expression in preeclamptic placentas. Further mechanism investigation revealed that CD97 promoted trophoblast invasion by targeting FOXC2 via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, laying the foundation for the development of PE intervention strategy by targeting CD97 in placentation and pathogenesis of PE.",Suppressed Immune-Related Profile Rescues Abortion-Prone Fetuses: A Novel Insight Into the CBA/J × DBA/2J Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791861,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2019 02 22,"The adverse clinical result and poor treatment outcome in recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) make it necessary to understand the pathogenic mechanism.

Five hundred twenty-four differentially expressed genes were obtained followed by clustering analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, and pathway analysis. We paid more attention to immune-related genes namely ""immune response"" and ""immune system process"" including 33 downregulated genes and 28 upregulated genes. Twenty-one genes contribute to suppressing immune system and 7 are against it. Six genes were validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, namely Ccr1l1, Tlr4, Tgf-β1, Tyro3, Gzmb, and Il-1β. Furthermore, Tlr4, Tgf-β1, and Il-1β were analyzed by Western blot. Such immune profile gives us a better understanding of the complicated immune processing in RSA and immunosuppression can rescue pregnancy loss."

Expert commentary: Gastric cancer is an inflammation-associated cancer with multistep carcinogenesis. The process consists of H. pylori infection, ongoing inflammation, development of metaplastic epithelia and genetic instability eventuating in gastric cancer. H. pylori infection is critical for development of the disease and studies have consistently shown that H. pylori eradication results in a reduction in (a) gastric mucosal inflammation, (b) progression of histologic damage, (c) risk of peptic ulcers and ulcer recurrence, and (d) risk of gastric cancer. Compared with a large number of clinical trials evaluating chemopreventive approaches, studies of population-wide screening, and eradication of H. pylori have only recently begun and only in high-risk populations.

FD is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), with meal-related symptoms such as postprandial fullness and early satiation, and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), with meal-unrelated symptoms such as epigastric pain or burning. We used a literature search for a narrative review on the current state of knowledge regarding PDS. Areas covered: Epidemiological studies support PDS as a separate entity and the biggest FD subgroup. The pathophysiology of PDS is heterogeneous, and disorders of gastric sensorimotor function as well as low grade duodenal inflammation have been implicated. Although prokinetic agents may provide the most pathophysiology-oriented treatment option, there is a paucity of suitable agents, and proton pump inhibitors are the traditional first-line therapy. Other options include agents that enhance gastric accommodation, such as acotiamide and 5-HT1A agonists, neuromodulators such as mirtazapine, and traditional medicine approaches.

Areas covered: The rescue of the remnant small bowel requires a multidisciplinary expertise to achieve digestive autonomy. The use of intestinal trophic factors has shown encouraging results in improving the intestinal adaptation process. Whenever the residual bowel length is inadequate, in a well-selected population weaning parenteral nutrition (PN) off could be attempted by surgery through lengthening procedures. A further subset of patients, with total and irreversible intestinal failure and severe complications on PN, may have an indication to intestinal transplantation. This procedure is still affected by poor long-term results. Expert commentary: Novel approaches developed through a multidisciplinary team work, such as manipulation of microbiota or tissue bioengineering, should be added to current therapies to treat successfully SBS.","Obesity, diabetes, and the gut microbiome: an updated review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791839,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 02 22,"Obesity and diabetes are two of the most prevalent health problems and leading causes of death globally. As research on the intestinal microbiome increases, so does our understanding of its intricate relationship to these diseases, although this has yet to be fully elucidated. Areas covered: This review evaluates the role of the gut microbiome in obesity and diabetes, including the influences of internal and environmental factors. Literature searches were performed using the keywords 'diabetes,' 'insulin resistance,' 'gut microbiome,' 'gut microbes,' 'obesity,' and 'weight gain.' Expert commentary: Highlights of recent research include new findings regarding the effects of caloric restriction, which expound the importance of diet in shaping the gut microbiome, and studies reinforcing the lasting implications of antibiotic use for diabetes and obesity, particularly repeated doses in early childhood. Mechanistically, interactions between the microbiome and the host innate immune system, mediated by TLR4-LPS signaling, have been shown to meditate the metabolic benefits of caloric restriction. Further, gut microbes haven now been shown to regulate oxygen availability via butyrate production, thus protecting against the proliferation of pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella. However, many microbial metabolites remain unidentified and their roles in obesity and diabetes remain to be determined.","Ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir, ombitasvir plus ribavirin could improve eGFR in patients with renal impairment and HCV: an Egyptian cohort.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791838,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 02 22,"The present study aimed at evaluation of changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3-5 who were treated with 12 weeks of ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir, ombitasvir plus ribavirin.",Social Interventions Targeting Social Relations Among Older People at Nursing Homes: A Qualitative Synthesized Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791836,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2019 04 11,"Social relations are part of the complex set of factors affecting health and well-being in old age. This systematic review seeks to uncover whether social interventions have an effect on social and health-related measures among nursing home residents. The authors screened PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for relevant peer-reviewed literature. Interventions were included if (1) they focused primarily on social relations or related terms such as loneliness, social support, social isolation, social network, or being involuntarily alone either as the base theory of the intervention or as an outcome measure of the intervention; (2) they were implemented at nursing homes (or similar setting); (3) they had a narrative activity as its core (as opposed to dancing, gardening or other physical activity); (4) their participants met either physically or nonphysically, ie, via video-conference or the like; and if (5) they targeted residents at a nursing home. The authors systematically appraised the quality of the final selection of studies using the Mixed Methods Assessments Tool (MMAT) version 2011 and did a qualitative synthesis of the final study selection. A total of 10 studies were included. Reminiscence therapy was the most common intervention. Studies also included video-conference, cognitive, and support group interventions. All studies found the social interventions brought about positive trends on either/or the social and health-related measures included. Despite limited and very diverse evidence, our systematic review indicated a positive social and health-related potential of social interventions for older people living in nursing homes or similar institutions."

Most qualitative studies undertaken alongside RCTs involve interviews that produce data that are used in a supportive or supplicatory role, but there is potential for qualitative research to be more influential. In this article, we describe the research methods underpinning the ""QuinteT"" (Qualitative Research Integrated Within Trials) approach to understand and address RCT recruitment difficulties. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) brings together multiple qualitative strategies and quantitative data and uses triangulation to understand recruitment issues rapidly.

UZIKWASA is a civil society organization based in Pangani District in coastal Tanzania and since 2009 has conducted BCCs focused on promoting gender justice and effective leadership. As with other complex programs there is a question about how such approaches affect norms and practice in relation to violence against women and girls. Drawing on longitudinal research utilizing more than 1000 community diary entries (hearsay ethnographies) and qualitative methods using 20 in-depth interviews and 16 focus group discussions with women and men, and adolescent girls and boys, this article explores the ways in which UZIKWASA's program effects change. The findings reveal personal and community narratives about gender-based and IPV as forms of retributive justice and assertion of authority by men. Drawing on gender performance as an explanation for violence, the research revealed changes in norms and practice in relation to violence against women and girls. Thus, we argue that UZIKWASA is gender-transformative by addressing gender norms and the critical awareness among leaders and the community of the social construction and reconstruction of gender that creates the context for real impact on changes in behavior.",Smart In-Vehicle Technologies and Older Drivers: A Scoping Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791814,"OTJR : occupation, participation and health",2019 05 31,"In-vehicle technologies may decrease crash risk in drivers with age-related declines. Researchers determined the impact of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) or advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) on driving. Through a scoping review, the effect of IVIS or ADAS on older drivers' convenience (i.e., meets one's needs), comfort (i.e., physical or psychological ease), or safety (i.e., absence of errors or crashes) was examined. Researchers synopsized findings from 28 studies, including driving simulators and on-road environments. Findings indicated that IVIS or ADAS enhanced safety and mitigated age-related declines. Notably, IVIS may reduce cognitive workload, but may jeopardize safety if the systems are overly complicated. The ADAS enhanced safety and comfort by increasing speed control, lane maintenance, and braking responses. However, no studies addressed convenience. In-vehicle technologies may enhance safety and comfort while driving, if one's cognitive workload is not compromised. Naturalistic studies are needed to elucidate the risks and benefits of IVIS and ADAS for older drivers.","Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting: A Call for a Paradigm Shift in States' Approaches to Funding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791813,"Policy, politics & nursing practice",2019 06 03,"Early home visiting is a vital health promotion strategy that is widely associated with positive outcomes for vulnerable families. To expand access to these services, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program was established under the Affordable Care Act, and over $2 billion have been distributed from the Health Resources and Services Administration to states, territories, and tribal entities to support funding for early home visiting programs serving pregnant women and families with young children (birth to 5 years of age). As of October 2018, 20 programs met Department of Health and Human Services criteria for evidence of effectiveness and were approved to receive MIECHV funding. However, the same few eligible programs receive MIECHV funding in almost all states, likely due to previously established infrastructure prior to establishment of the MIECHV program. Fully capitalizing on this federal investment will require all state policymakers and bureaucrats to reevaluate services currently offered and systematically and transparently develop a menu of home visiting services that will best match the specific needs of the vulnerable families in their communities. Federal incentives and strategies may also improve states' abilities to successfully implement a comprehensive and diverse menu of home visiting service options. By offering a menu of home visiting program models with varying levels of service delivery, home visitor education backgrounds, and targeted domains for improvement, state agencies serving children and families have an opportunity to expand their reach of services, improve cost-effectiveness, and promote optimal outcomes for vulnerable families. Nurses and nursing organizations can play a key role in advocating for this approach.","IFITM1 is a Novel, Highly Sensitive Marker for Endometriotic Stromal Cells in Ovarian and Extragenital Endometriosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791812,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",2019 02 22,"When the presence of endometriotic lesions are not evident by hematoxylin and eosin staining, CD10 is used to highlight and confirm the presence of endometriotic stroma. However, CD10 is not specific only to the endometrial stroma but is also expressed in many other cells. Recently, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) was reported as a highly specific immunohistochemical marker of normal endometrial stroma and endometrial stromal neoplasm. In this study, we examined the expression of IFITM1 and CD10 in 18 cases of ovarian endometriosis and 44 cases of extragenital endometriosis. Among the 62 patients, 62 (100.0%) were positive for IFITM1 and 60 (96.8%) for CD10, and CD10 was negative in 2 cases that were positive for IFITM1. Additionally, we found that IFITM1 sensitivity was unaffected by the presence or absence of hormonal therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of IFITM1 as a highly sensitive stromal marker of ovarian and extragenital endometriosis.","Masculine/Instrumental and Feminine/Expressive Traits and Health, Well-Being, and Psychological Distress in Spanish Men.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791811,American journal of men's health,2019 04 04,"Many studies have explored the relationship between masculine norms and men's health outcomes.

The current cross-sectional study examines whether masculine/instrumental and feminine/expressive traits are associated to men's health and well-being. Participants were 1,870 Spanish men, aged 21 to 64 years. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that the masculine/instrumental trait and the feminine/expressive trait were positively related to men's psychological well-being and self-rated health, so that men whose self-concept includes both masculine/instrumental and feminine/expressive characteristics presented greater psychological well-being and better self-rated health. The feminine/expressive trait was associated with lower psychological distress yet only in case of men with low social support. Self-esteem and social support were important predictors of men's health, in such a way that men who had high self-esteem and social support reported higher ratings of psychological well-being, better self-rated health, and less psychological distress. The implications of these findings for promoting men's health and well-being are discussed."

This study sought to provide an overview of PCI in elderly patients, especially nonagenarians, in a Japanese large prospective nationwide registry. Methods and Results We analyzed 562 640 patients undergoing PCI (≥60 years of age) from 1018 Japanese hospitals between 2014 and 2016 in the J-PCI (Japanese percutaneous coronary intervention) registry. Among them, 10 628 patients (1.9%), including 6780 (1.2%) with acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) and 3848 (0.7%) with stable coronary artery disease, were ≥90 years of age. We investigated differences in characteristics and in-hospital outcomes among sexagenarians, septuagenarians, octogenarians, and nonagenarians. Older patients were more frequently women and had a greater frequency of heart failure and chronic kidney disease than younger patients. In addition, older patients had a higher rate of in-hospital mortality, cardiac tamponade, cardiogenic shock after PCI , and bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion. Nonagenarians had the highest risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 3.60; 95% CI , 3.10-4.18 in ACS ; odds ratio , 6.24; 95% CI, 3.82-10.20 in non- ACS ) and bleeding complications ( odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.35-2.36 in ACS ; odds ratio , 2.70; 95% CI, 1.68-4.35 in non- ACS ) when referenced to sexagenarians. More important, transradial intervention was an inverse independent predictor of both in-hospital mortality and bleeding complications. Conclusions Older patients, especially nonagenarians, carried a greater risk of in-hospital death and bleeding compared with younger patients after PCI . Transradial intervention might contribute to risk reduction for periprocedural complications in elderly patients undergoing PCI .",A review of parathyroid mass and patients with nonspecific complaints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791798,The Journal of international medical research,2019 03 05,"In this review, parathyroid mass and its nonspecific symptoms are discussed.

However, the mechanism by which SNHG3 contributes to osteosarcoma (OS) remains elusive. The association between SNHG3 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics in OS patients was analyzed using the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset. Cell viability and colony number were estimated by MTT and colony formation assays. MiR-196a-5p-specific binding with SNHG3 or HOXC8 was confirmed by the luciferase report assay. As a result, the expression of SNHG3 was dramatically increased in OS tissue as compared with the adjacent normal tissues. High expression of SNHG3 was associated with tumor size and acted as an independent prognostic factor of poor survival in OS patients. Knockdown of SNHG3 inhibited cell viability and colony formation, but its overexpression reversed these effects. SNHG3 was further identified to act as a sponge of miR-196a-5p, which counteracted the tumor-promoting effects caused by SNHG3 in OS cells. The expression of miR-196a-5p had a negative correlation with SNHG3 and the poor survival in OS patients. In conclusion, lncRNA SNHG3 promoted cell growth by sponging miR-196a-5p and indicated a poor prognosis in OS patients.",Implementing a community-based task-shifting psychosocial intervention for individuals with psychosis in Chile: Perspectives from users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791796,The International journal of social psychiatry,2019 05 21,"Latin America, and Chile in particular, has a rich tradition of community mental health services and programs.

Growing lines of evidence indicate that sarcopenia not only correlates with the clinical outcomes and survival of patients undergoing liver transplant, but also serves as a prognostic factor for candidates of liver transplantation and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Areas covered: In this review, we conducted a narrative review and search of literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database up to August 2018. Studies relevant to the emerging data of sarcopenia and chronic liver diseases were examined and discussed. Expert commentary: Although sarcopenia has been shown to play a vital role in the outcomes of cirrhotic patients with or without liver transplant, its impact on non-cirrhotic patients remains unclear and deserves future research efforts. To develop an effective and practical measurement of sarcopenia has become an urgent issue in the management of patients with chronic liver diseases.",Therapeutic implication of platelets in liver regeneration -hopes and hues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791793,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 02 22,"Mounting evidence highlights platelet involvement in liver regeneration via interaction with liver cells, growth factors release, and signaling contributions. Existing research suggests a compelling biological rationale for utilizing platelet biology, with the goal of improving liver function and accelerating its regenerative potential. Despite its expanding application in several clinical areas, the contribution of the platelet and its therapeutic implementation in liver regeneration so far has not yet fulfilled the initial high expectations. Areas covered: This review scrutinizes the progress, current updates, and discusses how recent understanding - particularly in the clinical implications of platelet-based therapy - may enable strategies to introduce and harness the therapeutic potential of the platelet during liver regeneration. Expert commentary: Several clinical and translational studies have facilitated a platform for the development of platelet-based therapy to enhance liver regeneration. While some of these therapies are effective to augment liver regeneration, the others have had some detrimental outcomes.

Most studies have focused on the significance of the biliary microbiome in gallstone pathogenesis. Areas covered: In this study, the epidemiology of gallstone diseases and the existence, composition, origin, and mechanisms of the biliary microbiota were reviewed. Mechanisms involved in promoting the formation of different types of gallstones were also emphasized. The antibiotic susceptibility of the biliary microbiota is briefly discussed because it may guide clinical strategies. Expert commentary: The biliary microbiome facilitates the formation of brown pigment stones. Although glycoprotein (mucin) may be pivotal for many promoting substances to coagulate and integrate relevant components, new mechanisms involving prostaglandins, oxysterols, oxygen free radicals, and lipopolysaccharides have been discovered. Furthermore, specific bacterial species such as Helicobacter and Salmonella are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. Recently, metabolomics of the biliary microbiome has been used to determine the detailed mechanisms that promote gallstone formation. Previously, the bacterial effects involved in the pathogenesis of brown pigment stones have not been analyzed in detail. Whether the administration of antibiotics is related to prophylaxis for gallstone formation and gallstone-associated infections remains unclear.",Endoscopic management of complications of acute pancreatitis: an update on the field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791791,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 02 22,"Acute pancreatitis is a frequent, nonmalignant gastrointestinal disorder leading to hospital admission. For its severe form and subsequent complications, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are being used increasingly, and are subject to rapid technical advances.

A special focus is placed on studies directly comparing different stent types, including lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) and clinical outcomes when draining pseudocysts or WONs. The clinical significance and endoscopic treatment options for DPDS are also discussed. Expert commentary: Endoscopic therapy has become the treatment of choice for different types of pancreatic and peripancreatic collections, the majority of which, however, require no intervention. The use of LAMS has facilitated drainage and necrosectomy in patients with WON or pseudocysts. Serious complications remain a problem in spite of high technical and clinical success rates.

A total of 36 studies were included: 30 studies from the perspective of the healthcare payer, 3 from the societal perspective, and 3 did not report the perspective. For genotype 1, the highest number of ICER comparison corresponds to sofosbuvir (SOF) triple therapy and SOF-based combinations which reported a cost per QALY systematically ranging from negative to lower than US$100,000 when compared with no treatment or dual therapy or Simeprevir triple therapy. Expert commentary: Selected studies may be overestimating the true cost per QALY of second-generation DAAs in the treatment of HCV, mainly because of neglecting non-healthcare costs, using official list prices which are higher than actual transaction prices and not adopting the long run drug price in a dynamic approach. In addition, the impact of important price reductions of several DAAs in recent years on cost per QALY should be considered."

Although endoscopy has traditionally been considered a gold standard, cost, complexity, resource limitations, and invasiveness are important limitations. Hence, substantial interest exists for non-invasive serum and fecal biomarkers, namely C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC), in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CD. Areas covered: We review the evidence for using serum CRP and FC in distinguishing patients with CD from those with irritable bowel syndrome, categorizing disease activity among patients with an established diagnosis of CD, predicting the likelihood of treatment response, identifying asymptomatic patients in medically or surgically induced remission who are at risk for disease relapse, and as treatment targets. Expert commentary: Accurate interpretation of CRP and FC is dependent on several factors including the clinical context, the performance characteristics of the assay, the specified test cut-offs, and the pre-test probability of disease.

Vitamin D (VD) may interfere in a plethora of cellular mechanisms, and act directly or indirectly in the regulation of the microbiome, the release of anti-microbial peptides, modulation of the immune system and inflammation processes; which in turn, may positively interfere with the altered gut function. The main purpose of this review was to survey studies involving the impacts of VD on IBS. Area covered: Eligible studies including the term VD and IBS were searched in the MEDLINE-PubMed and EMBASE (2009-2018). VD may act direct or indirectly in the regulation of the gut microbiome, immune response, and psychosocial factors that may be included in the list of IBS triggering factors. Expert opinion: Once VD plays an essential role in many processes associated with IBS, its deficiency may be associated with IBS, and the supplementation could help in the therapeutic approach for this condition. For these reasons, the understanding of the association of VD in IBS is indispensable for the development of new strategies that could improve the quality of life of the patient.",Oxaliplatin in perioperative chemotherapy for gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791774,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Platinum-based chemotherapy remains standard-of-care for gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. For locally advanced resectable disease, perioperative treatment with cisplatin-based doublet or triplet chemotherapy regimens had been the predominant approach in Europe and the US, based on pivotal phase III trials including the MAGIC study. Results from more recent landmark studies including the German FLOT4 and the Asian CLASSIC trials have, however, triggered a shift from cisplatin towards oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy protocols in the perioperative setting. Areas covered: This drug profile summarizes current state-of-the-art of perioperative and adjuvant treatment for locally advanced resectable gastric/GEJ cancers with a special focus on the increasingly predominant role of oxaliplatin over cisplatin in this setting. We review pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of oxaliplatin and oxaliplatin combination regimens. We highlight recent advances and ongoing developments in the field. Expert opinion: While the adoption of oxaliplatin-containing combination regimens for perioperative therapy of gastric/GEJ cancers represents a significant step ahead, many pivotal questions remain unanswered. At the sample time, the evolution of molecular subtyping and immunotherapy is likely to dramatically change clinical practice in the foreseeable future.","Extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease - epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791773,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder, primarily of, but not restricted to the gut. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are frequently observed and involve the joints, eyes, hepatobiliary tract, and skin. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss classical EIM focusing on epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis, highlighting recent advances in the understanding of EIM. We further discuss treatment-induced immunological phenomena, which are increasingly recognized and might challenge IBD-treating physicians in the era of biological treatment. Expert opinion: EIM considerably contributes to morbidity and mortality. Genetic studies have revealed a common genetic background between EIM and IBD and among specific EIM. Identified protein interactions have been shown to cluster in shared biological pathways. However - despite these recent advances - pathogenesis of EIM is at best partially understood. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed such as upregulation of tumor necrosis factor, aberrant lymphocyte homing, and cross-reactive antigen presentation. It still remains unclear whether EIM is a direct result of the inflammatory process in the gut or rather a consequence of a shared genetic background leading to dysfunctional immune responses to environmental stimuli. Exploration and understanding of EIM genetics and pathophysiology will pave the road for better and more efficacious treatment options in the future.",Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis and prognosis: an update on serum and elastography markers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791772,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis is increasingly utilized in clinical practice to diagnose hepatic fibrosis. Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis relies on biologic and/or physical properties to assess tissue fibrosis. Serum markers estimate fibrosis by incorporating markers reflecting hepatic function (indirect markers) and/or markers measuring extracellular matrix degradation/fibrogenesis (direct markers). Radiology based techniques relay the mechanical properties and stiffness of a tissue, with increased stiffness associated with more advanced fibrosis. Areas covered: In this comprehensive review, the recent literature discussing serum markers and elastography-based techniques will be covered. These modalities are also explored in the setting of various liver diseases. Expert opinion: The etiology of liver disease and clinical context should be taken into consideration when non-invasive markers are incorporated in clinical practice. Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis has been most extensively utilized in hepatitis C, followed by hepatitis B and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but its role remains less developed in other etiologies of liver disease such as alcohol-associated liver disease and autoimmune liver disease. The role of non-invasive markers in predicting progression or regression of fibrosis, development of liver-related events and survival needs to be further explored.",Safety and tolerability of linaclotide for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: pooled Phase 3 analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791771,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Linaclotide is approved for treating irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; 290 µg QD) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC; 145 µg or 72 µg QD).

Current therapeutics to improve GI-transit usually require oral ingestion of therapeutic drugs, such as the serotonin receptor agonist prucalopride. However, most receptors are distributed all over the body and unsurprisingly drugs like prucalopride stimulate multiple organs, often leading to unwanted side effects. There is a desperate need in the community to improve GI-transit selectively without effects on other organs. Areas covered: We performed a systematic review of the literature on Pubmed and report significant technical advances in optogenetic control of the GI-tract. We discuss recent demonstrations that optogenetics can be used to potently control the activity of subsets of enteric neurons. Special focus is made of the first recent demonstration that wireless optogenetics can be used to stimulate the colon in conscious, freely-moving, untethered mice causing a significant increase in fecal pellet output. This is a significant technical breakthrough with a major therapeutic potential application to improve GI-transit. Expert opinion: The ability to selectively stimulate the ENS to modulate GI-transit in live mammals using light, avoids the need for oral consumption of any drugs and side effects; by stimulating only the GI-tract.",An overview of walled-off pancreatic necrosis for clinicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791769,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Walled of pancreatic necrosis (WOPN) is a new term coined for encapsulated fluid collection developing after acute necrotising pancreatitis (ANP). It is a heterogeneous collection containing varying amount of liquid as well as solid necrotic material. The literature on its natural history as well as appropriate management is gradually expanding thereby improving treatment outcomes of this enigmatic disease. Areas covered: This review discusses currently available literature on etiology, frequency, natural history, and imaging features WOPN. Also, updated treatment options including endoscopic, radiological and surgical drainage are discussed. Expert opinion: WOPN is alocal complication of ANP occurring in the delayed phase of ANP and may be asymptomatic (50%) or present with pain, fever, jaundice, or gastric outlet obstruction. Natural courses of asymptomatic WOPN have been infrequently studied, and it appears that the majority remain asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously. Magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound are the best imaging modalities to evaluate solid necrotic debris. Symptomatic WOPN usually needs immediate drainage, this can be done endoscopically, radiologically, or surgically. Current evidence suggests that endoscopic transluminal drainage is the preferred drainage technique as it is effective and associated with lower mortality, risk of organ failure, adverse effects, and length of hospital stay.",The association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer incident and recurrence: a meta-analysis of observational studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791768,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 03 08,"Lifestyle modification plays a key role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and colorectal adenoma and/or cancer (CRA/CRC) development.

NAFLD may progress to fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, advanced cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, definitive medical treatment has not been established, with the exception of lifestyle modification with exercise. Because of the direct connection via portal vein between the intestines and the liver (gut-gut microbiota-liver axis), gut microbiota and associated dysbiosis have been known as regulators in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Area covered: New therapeutic approaches for modulation of gut microbiota have been proposed and the effectiveness of new therapies including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, bile acid regulation, absorbent, and fecal microbiota transplantation have been demonstrated in recent several studies. This review focuses on the available evidences for new therapies modulating gut microbiota in the management and the prevention of NAFLD. Expert commentary: Gut-gut microbiota-liver axis may play an important role in the etiology of many liver diseases, including NAFLD. It is logical to seek the manipulation of this axis, and further studies are required to understand the underlying precise mechanisms of microbiota-modulation on NAFLD."

Integrated care requires linked data; activity-based funding requires valid coding; EHRs require standards for documentation, retrieval and analysis; and decision support systems require standardised nomenclatures. The ethical oversight of how health-related information is used, as opposed to governance of its content, storage and communication, remains ill-defined. More fundamentally, the conceptual foundations of health information in terms of ""diagnostic"" constructs are creating limitations: Why should a medical diagnosis be privileged as the key descriptor of care, over disability or other aspects of the human experience? Who gets to say what matters, and how and by whom is that translated into meaningful information? These are important questions on which the health information management profession is well placed to lead. In this changing environment, threats and opportunities for the profession are presented and discussed. Highlighted is the need for leadership from the profession on the ethical use of health information.","Antifungal activity in the methanolic, aqueous and hexane extracts of Calligonum polygonoides.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791750,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Calligonum polygonoides is locally called as Phog which belongs to the Polygonaceae family.

Calligonum polygonoides showed significant activity against Candida albicans as the observed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is 6.5 µg/mL for methanolic extract, 9.8 µg/mL for ethyl acetate extract, whereas aqueous and hexane extracts showed no activity. Calligonum polygonoides did not show any significant activity against Aspergillus niger.",Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in AFB smear-negative sputum specimens through MTB culture and GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791749,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health issue around the globe which is a chronic infectious disease and is still one of the major challenges for developing countries. The emergence of drug-resistant TB makes the condition worse and there is an urgent need of fast, highly sensitive diagnostic methods. This study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of GeneXpert® MTB/RIF assay and MTB culture for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB/drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) suspects. A total of 168 sputum smear-negative TB suspects were recruited for the study. Among the suspected TB cases, 52.98% were male and 47.02% were females with the mean age of 42 ± 17.6 years. All the sputum specimens collected from the study population were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, and MTB culture. The results revealed that, out of 168 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)/ZN smear microscopy-negative sputum specimens, 48 (28.57%) and 58 (34.52%) were detected MTB positive by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB culture, respectively, while 120 (71.43%) and 110 (65.48%) suspected TB cases were confirmed negative by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB culture, respectively. The study concluded that GeneXpert assay was found to be a rapid and accurate tool for MTB detection in smear-negative sputum specimens. GeneXpert has advantage over ZN smear microscopy and MTB culture as it detects MTB and rifampicin resistance simultaneously within 2 h with minimal biohazards.",Reuterinos® as adjuvant for peri-implant treatment: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791748,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of lozenges-containing Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjuvant treatment of peri-implant mucositis and to detect the level of L. reuteri colonization in the peri-implant tissues of treated patients. A total of 10 patients were selected. Subjects with at least one implant affected by peri-implant mucositis, with gingival index (GI) of ⩾2 in each quadrant, evaluated at the buccal aspect of all teeth. Patients included in the study were partially edentulous and had implants with mucositis or peri-implantitis. Implants with radiographic bone loss of ⩾5 mm and/or ⩾50% of the implant length were excluded, and only one implant per patient was included. Each patient received L. reuteri-containing lozenges. Microbiological sampling was performed at baseline and on day 28 and analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our results indicate that the use of the probiotic did not influence the peri-implant microbiota in a statistically significant way, although there was a reduction in the number of periodontal and peri-implant species. The lack of statistically significant microbiological changes could be explained either by the small sample population or by the short evaluation period. Therefore, the poor colonization of L. reuteri in the peri-implant pockets can be explained by the different anatomical and histological characteristics of the interface of the dental-gingival unit with respect to the periodontal sulcus. The administration of a daily lozenge of L. reuteri for 4 weeks had a limited effect on the microbiological analysis. Probiotics provide an alternative therapeutic approach to consider in the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases, but further long-term prospective studies with standardized variables are needed.",Augmentation of Cancer Cachexia Components With Targeted Acupuncture in Patients With Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791747,Integrative cancer therapies,2019 03 29,Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer-associated cachexia are at risk of high morbidity and mortality.

To gain insight into the pathophysiology of ME/CFS in New Zealand, we examined the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNA-seq analysis in a small well-characterized patient group (10 patients), with age/gender-matched healthy controls (10 control subjects). Twenty-seven gene transcripts were increased 1.5- to sixfold and six decreased three- to sixfold in the patient group ( P < 0.01). The top enhanced gene transcripts, IL8, NFΚBIA and TNFAIP3, are functionally related to inflammation, and significant changes were validated for IL8 and NFΚBIA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Functional network analysis of the altered gene transcripts ( P < 0.01) detected interactions between the products related to inflammation, circadian clock function, metabolic dysregulation, cellular stress responses and mitochondrial function. Ingenuity pathway analysis ( P < 0.05) provided further insights into the dysfunctional physiology, highlighting stress and inflammation pathways. This analysis provides novel insights into the molecular changes in ME/CFS and contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease.",Blocking of checkpoint receptor PD-L1 aggravates osteoarthritis in macrophage-dependent manner in the mice model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791745,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"As a chronic degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis is among the most common diseases all over the world. In osteoarthritis, inflammation plays an important role in the generation of joint symptoms and the development of disease. When the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint is blocked, the antitumor immunity will be enhanced. We aim to illustrate the function of PD-L1 in osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis in mice was induced by the injection of collagenase or anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Anti-PD-L1 was employed to block the signal of PD-L1. Knee joints histological sections were stained by Safranin-O. The level of cytokine was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mRNA level was shown by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The blockade of PD-L1 signal up-regulated inflammatory response and promoted the development of osteoarthritis in mice. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α expression were promoted by PD-L1 blocking in macrophages. Osteoarthritis was aggravated when the expression of inflammatory cytokine is elevated in macrophages. Our results indicated that the blockade of PD-L1 signal in macrophages elevates the expression of inflammatory cytokine and promotes the development of osteoarthritis in mice, which could be utilized as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for osteoarthritis patients.",Possible treatment for cutaneous lichen planus: An in vitro anti-inflammatory role of Angelica polysaccharide in human keratinocytes HaCaT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791744,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) is an autoimmune disease. Angelica polysaccharide (AP) has been found to exert immunomodulation activity. In this study, we explored the roles of AP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), as well as the underlying mechanisms. LPS-induced cell injury was evaluated by alterations of cell viability, apoptosis, and expressions of proteins associated with apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines. Then, the protective effects of AP on LPS-induced cell injury were assessed. The protein expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and key kinases in the Nrf2/HO-1 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways were measured using western blotting. SIRT1 knockdown and overexpression were used to analyze whether AP affected HaCaT cells through regulating SIRT1. Finally, the possible inhibitory effects of AP on cell injury after LPS treatment were also evaluated. We found that LPS reduced HaCaT cell viability, enhanced apoptosis, and induced release of inflammatory cytokines. AP alleviated LPS-induced HaCaT cell inflammatory injury. The expression of SIRT1 was enhanced after AP treatment. AP activated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway while inhibited NF-κB pathway in HaCaT cells. The protective effects of AP on LPS-induced HaCaT cell injury were reversed by SIRT1 knockdown. Dysregulation of SIRT1 altered the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB pathways in LPS-treated HaCaT cells. Furthermore, AP also exerted inhibitory effects on HaCaT cell injury after LPS stimulation. In conclusion, AP could alleviate LPS-induced inflammatory injury of HaCaT cells through upregulating SIRT1 expression and then activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway but inactivating NF-κB pathway. This study provided a possible therapeutic strategy for clinical CLP treatments.",Effects of 12-months treatment with zoledronate or teriparatide on intima-media thickness of carotid artery in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791743,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Atherosclerosis and osteoporosis are interrelated entities and share similar pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies showed that key proteins of bone metabolism, such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN), are also involved in vascular atherosclerosis and calcifications. The carotid intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) is an early quantitative marker of generalized atherosclerosis. Aim of study was to investigate whether 12-months treatment with zoledronate (ZLN) or teriparatide (TPT) affects CA-IMT and circulating OPG and OPN levels. In this study, 11 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (aged 73, 70.5-74.5 years; median, range interquartile) treated with 5 mg/year iv ZLN; 9 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (aged 70, 62.5-73.5 years) treated with 20 µg/day sc TPT; and 10 aged-, body mass index (BMI)-, glycemic, and lipid profiles-matched, free from anti-osteoporotic and hypocholesterolemic drugs, controls were prospectively investigated at baseline and after 12 months. At baseline, median CA-IMT was similar in the three groups and increased after 12 months. CA-IMT increased significantly in TPT-treated patients (1.0, 0.8-1.2 vs 1.1, 0.9-15 mm, P = 0.04), though the change was minimal. After 12 months of treatment, CA-IMT positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (r = 0.767, P = 0.008) and negatively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (r = -0.65, P = 0.03), suggesting interplay between active bone remodeling and lipid profile. At baseline and after 12 months, median serum OPG and OPN levels did not differ among the groups and did not correlate with changes in CA-IMT. In conclusion, ZLN and TPT treatments are safe on carotid walls in osteoporotic women with subclinical atherosclerosis; circulating OPG and OPN are not affected by long-term anti-osteoporotic treatments and do not correlate with CA-IMT.",Tripterine up-regulates miR-223 to alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced damage in murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791741,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Tripterine, also known as celastrol, is a main natural ingredient in Tripterygium wilfordii. Tripterine has a variety of pharmacological functions, and the therapeutic potential of tripterine in many kinds of inflammation-linked diseases has been revealed. However, the function of tripterine on osteoarthritis still remains unclear. The objective of this study was to study the function of tripterine (TPR) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injured chondrocyte. ATDC5 cells were treated with tripterine after LPS stimulation and then cell survival, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of chondrogenic differentiation-associated proteins were assessed by performing CCK-8, flow cytometry, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot. Moreover, the expression of miR-223 and core factors in PI3K/AKT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling was tested by RT-qPCR/Western blot. LPS stimulation significantly reduced ATDC5 cells viability, induced apoptosis, and increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced chondrocyte loss and the release of IL-6 and TNF-α. miR-223 was down-regulated by LPS, while was up-regulated by tripterine. The protective actions of tripterine were eliminated when miR-223 was silenced. Besides, tripterine inhibited hypertrophic differentiation induced by LPS, and the inhibitory effects of tripterine on hypertrophic differentiation could be abolished when miR-223 was silenced. Furthermore, tripterine activated PI3K/AKT pathway and deactivated NF-κB pathway. And the regulatory effects of tripterine on these two pathways were abolished by miR-223 silence. This study revealed that tripterine protected ATDC5 cells against LPS-induced cell damage possibly via up-regulation of miR-223 and modulation of NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathways."

With the current opioid epidemic, both patients and providers are seeking alternative methods to treat both addiction and pain control, and kratom as an alternative means of treatment has increasingly entered the mainstream. In this article, we present the clinical course of a 47-year-old male who developed fatigue, pruritus, and abnormal liver tests (with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern) approximately 21 days after beginning kratom. After extensive evaluation including a negligible alcohol history, negative hepatitis serologies, and inconclusive imaging, the patient was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by kratom. Nine months after his liver tests returned to normal, he took kratom again, and after a latency of 2 days, he developed fatigue, pruritus, and loss of appetite along with abnormal liver tests (with the same biochemical profile as previously), consistent with a positive rechallenge. We believe, through the use of the Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method and expert opinion, that this is a highly likely or definite example of kratom-induced DILI. With the gaining popularity of this drug, it appears that DILI may be an important complication of kratom for providers to recognize.",Vitamin A and Hydrochlorothiazide Causing Severe Hypercalcemia in a Patient With Primary Hyperparathyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791717,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,2019 02 24,"To report a case of severe hypercalcemia, exacerbated by vitamin A supplementation and hydrochlorothiazide, in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism.",Severe Restrictive Lung Disease in One of the Oldest Documented Males With Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791716,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,2019 02 24,"Coffin-Lowry syndrome is expressed as different phenotypes in males and females.

Increasingly, yoga has become a popular approach to improving the quality of life (QoL) of women with breast cancer. However, the extant synthetic evidence on yoga has not used other exercise comparison conditions. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically assess yoga-specific effects relative to any other physical exercise intervention (eg, aerobics) for women with breast cancer. QoL was the primary outcome of interest. Eight randomized controlled trials with 545 participants were included. The sample-weighted synthesis at immediate postintervention revealed marginally statistically and modest practically significant differences suggesting yoga's potentially greater effectiveness: d = 0.14, P = .10. However, at longer term follow-up, no statistically or practically significant between-group difference was observed. This meta-analysis preliminarily demonstrated that yoga is probably as effective as other exercise modalities in improving the QoL of women with breast cancer. Both interventions were associated with clinically significant improvements in QoL. Nearly all of the yoga intervention programs, however, were very poorly resourced. Larger and better controlled trials of well-endowed yoga programs are needed.","The influence of cognitions, emotions and behavioral factors on treatment outcomes in musculoskeletal shoulder pain: a systematic review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791696,Clinical rehabilitation,2019 06 06,"To examine the predictive, moderating and mediating role of cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors on pain and disability following shoulder treatment.",Potential biomarkers for antidiastole of tuberculous and malignant pleural effusion by proteome analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791695,Biomarkers in medicine,2019 02 27,To investigate novel potential biomarkers for antidiastole of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) from malignant pleural effusion (MPE).,Prosthetic pulmonary valve and conduit endocarditis in congenital heart disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791694,Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,2019 04 16,Pulmonary valve replacement is one of the most common procedures in patients with congenital heart disease.

It is a zoonotic flavivirus transmitted between water birds and/or pigs by Culex mosquitoes; humans are dead-end hosts. In 1995, JEV emerged for the first time in northern Australia causing an unprecedented outbreak in the Torres Strait. In this article, we revisit the history of JEV in Australia and describe investigations of JEV transmission cycles in the Australian context. Public health responses to the incipient outbreak included vaccination and sentinel pig surveillance programs. Virus isolation and vector competence experiments incriminated Culex annulirostris as the likely regional vector. The role this species plays in transmission cycles depends on the availability of domestic pigs as a blood source. Experimental evidence suggests that native animals are relatively poor amplifying hosts of JEV. The persistence and predominantly annual virus activity between 1995 and 2005 suggested that JEV had become endemic in the Torres Strait. However, active surveillance was discontinued at the end of 2005, so the status of JEV in northern Australia is unknown. Novel mosquito-based surveillance systems provide a means to investigate whether JEV still occurs in the Torres Strait or is no longer a risk to Australia.",Genome-Wide Analysis of Auxin Receptor Family Genes in Brassica juncea var. tumida.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791673,Genes,2019 03 29,"Transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling f-box proteins (TIR1/AFBs) play important roles in the process of plant growth and development as auxin receptors. To date, no information has been available about the characteristics of the TIR1/AFB gene family in Brassica juncea var. tumida. In this study, 18 TIR1/AFB genes were identified and could be clustered into six groups. The genes are located in 11 of 18 chromosomes in the genome of B. juncea var. tumida, and similar gene structures are found for each of those genes. Several cis-elements related to plant response to phytohormones, biotic stresses, and abiotic stresses are found in the promoter of BjuTIR1/AFB genes. The results of qPCR analysis show that most genes have differential patterns of expression among six tissues, with the expression levels of some of the genes repressed by salt stress treatment. Some of the genes are also responsive to pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae treatment.

These proteins were classified into four subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships, and include the ARF, RAV, LAV, and REM subfamilies. The chromosomal locations, gene structures, conserved protein motifs, and sub-cellular localizations of the tobacco B3 proteins were analyzed. The patterns of exon-intron numbers and arrangement and the protein structures of the tobacco B3 proteins were in general agreement with their phylogenetic relationships. The expression patterns of 114 B3 genes revealed that many B3 genes show tissue-specific expression.

To prevent this disease, important efforts to monitor the situation in the main source, livestock, are conducted in most developed countries.

Here, Salmonella surveillance systems in one of the main sources of foodborne salmonellosis, swine, and humans in Spain were reviewed to identify potential gaps and discuss potential ways of integration under a ""One-Health"" approach. Despite the extensive information generated through the surveillance activities, source attribution can be only routinely performed through ad-hoc outbreak investigations, and national reports on human outbreaks do not provide sufficiently detailed information to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the pathogen. Human and animal monitoring of Salmonella would benefit from a better exchange of information and collaboration.

The aim of this research was to describe the apparent prevalence of food insecurity in adults at enrolment in a food literacy program and to examine the relationship between food insecurity and a range of independent variables. Individuals attending the Food Sensations® for Adults program in Western Australia from May 2016 to April 2018 completed a pre-program questionnaire (n = 1433) indicating if they had run of money for food in the past month (food insecurity indicator), frequency of food literacy behaviours, selected dietary behaviours, and demographic characteristics. The level of food insecurity reported by participants (n = 1379) was 40.5%. Results from multiple logistic regression demonstrated that behaviours related to planning and management, shopping, preparation, and cooking were all statistically independently associated with food insecurity, in addition to soft/soda drink consumption, education, employment status, and being born in Australia. The results are salient as they indicate an association between food literacy and food insecurity. The implications are that food insecure participants may respond differently to food literacy programs. It may be necessary to screen people enrolling in programs, tailor program content, and include comprehensive measures in evaluation to determine effect on the impact of food literacy programs on different subgroups.",Characterizing Mental Health Treatment Utilization among Individuals Exposed to the 2001 World Trade Center Terrorist Attacks 14⁻15 Years Post-Disaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791669,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Following the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks in New York City (NYC) on 11 September 2001 (9/11), thousands in NYC experienced significant stress reactions and disorders, presenting an immediate need for counseling and treatment. While other studies documented post-9/11 mental health treatment utilization, none have data more than two years post-disaster. We used data from 35,629 enrollees of the WTC Health Registry, a longitudinal cohort study of those exposed to the WTC attacks, to examine predictors of counseling after 9/11, the types of practitioners seen, and the perceived helpfulness of therapy up to 15 years post-disaster. Among enrollees, 37.7% reported receiving counseling at some time after 9/11. Predictors of seeking counseling included race/ethnicity, age at 9/11, education level, exposure to the WTC attacks, other traumatic experiences, mental health symptomology, and pre-9/11 counseling. Whites and Hispanics, those who were children on 9/11, and those with high levels of exposure to the WTC attacks sought counseling soonest after 9/11. Among those who sought counseling, Blacks, Asians, and those with lower education and income were less likely to see mental health specialists and more likely to see general practitioners or religious advisors. Finally, among those who sought recent counseling, women, Blacks, those aged ≥65 years, and those with very high WTC exposures were more likely to rate their recent counseling as very helpful. This study used data up to 15 years post-disaster to document mental health treatment utilization patterns, trends, and disparities that have implications for future preparedness plans and needs assessments.",Modifying a Paediatric Rational Prescribing Tool (POPI) for Use in the UK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791668,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"Rational prescribing tools can be used by individual prescribers, organisations, and researchers to evaluate the quality of prescribing for research and quality improvement purposes.

The aim of this study was to modify this tool to facilitate its use in paediatric practice in the United Kingdom (UK). POPI criteria were compared to relevant UK clinical guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and the British National Formulary for Children. Where guidelines differed, criteria were modified to reflect UK guidance. If there were no relevant guidelines or directly contradictory guidelines, criteria were removed. Overall, no change was made to 49 criteria. There were 29 modified to concord with UK guidelines. Four criteria were reduced to two criteria due to being linked in single guidelines. Twenty-three criteria were omitted, due to the absence of relevant UK guidance or directly conflicting UK practice, including one entire clinical category (mosquitos).

A two-dimensional random aggregate model is generated by the Monte Carlo method. A multi-linear two-dimensional damage model is applied to describe the damage properties of each phase in the concrete. The strain-softening behavior, strain-rate effect, and failure patterns of the concrete are studied. The numerical results find that the peaks of compressive stress and compressive strain of concrete show the rate-sensitivity in various degrees under different strain rates. The calculated results of the dynamic enhancement factors are in a good agreement with the formula given by the Comité Euro-International du Béton (CEB) and other experimental results. The failure diagram of the specimen clearly describes the compressive failure process of the concrete specimen. This failure's characteristics are similar to the experimental results."

Although smoking cessation yields the most individual and population health benefits, switching to exclusive e-cigarette use offers some individual health benefits for cigarette smokers. However, e-cigarette use is not harmless, and its use among non-cigarette smokers should be prevented. Our study aims to explore the decision-making process about e-cigarettes among an e-cigarette users, cigarette smokers, and non-users. We conducted 12 semi-structured focus group interviews with e-cigarette users, cigarette smokers, and non-users. We performed a thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. First, knowledge reported by e-cigarette users was mainly based on other users' experiences. Second, cigarette smokers and non-users were more negative towards e-cigarettes than e-cigarette users. Third, e-cigarette users considered switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use by deliberating relevant information, and weighing up the benefits and disadvantages of e-cigarette use versus smoking. Additionally, important factors in the decision-making process were a perception of risks and benefits of e-cigarettes compared to cigarettes, a supportive social environment about e-cigarette use, and trust in information offered about the risks and benefits of e-cigarettes. Our findings provide insight into what we can learn from the conscious decision-making process of e-cigarette users who switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. This information can be considered to develop targeted communications strategies to stimulate a conscious decision-making process, these may highlight benefits of switching to e-cigarettes for cigarette smokers, discussing the risks of smoking, and correcting misperceptions about the perceived risks and benefits of e-cigarette use.",Tobacco Use as a Health Disparity: What Can Pediatric Clinicians Do?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791653,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Tobacco use is a global health crisis, and has a tremendous and negative impact on health and wellbeing.

In this paper, in order to examine whether the above two goals can be achieved by setting a specific reuse target, we have modelled a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a supplier (the leader) and a manufacturer (the follower) with the constraint of a mandated remanufacturing target. In this model, the supplier determines the level of interchangeability in product design and the wholesale price of the key component. The manufacturer buys the key components from the supplier and makes production and remanufacturing decisions under the requirement of a mandated remanufacturing target. We have investigated the supply chain's members' optimal decisions and analyzed the impact of the mandated remanufacturing target on the optimal profits of the supply chain's members and consumer surplus, and finally, we have explored the environmental implications of the mandated remanufacturing target. We found that the supply chain's members' optimal decisions are affected by the mandated remanufacturing target and the cost of the new component. In terms of the economic implications of the mandated remanufacturing target, we have demonstrated that the increase in the mandated remanufacturing target has negative effects on the profits of the supply chain's members and consumer surplus. Regarding the goal of incentivizing green product design, we found that the mandated remanufacturing target cannot always incentivize the supplier to implement product design that is beneficial to remanufacturing. From the perspective of the environment, we further indicate that more stringent mandated remanufacturing targets may bring an undesirable environmental outcome.",Evaluation of Mycotoxin Screening Tests in a Verification Study Involving First Time Users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791649,Toxins,2019 04 02,"(AFB₁) in maize and wheat using LFD and LC-HRMS, respectively. The results of analyses were used to calculate intermediate precision (RSDip, covering the inter-analyst variability in preparing the analytical samples and the precision under repeatability conditions) cut-off values and false suspect rates. RSDip ranged from 6.5% to 30% for DON, and from 16% to 33% for AFB₁. The highest obtained variances were associated with the AFB₁ analyses due to working with much lower mass fractions. The rate of false suspect results were lower than 0.1% for all tested methods. All methods showed a fit-for-purpose method performance profile, which allowed a clear distinction of samples containing the analytes at the screening target concentration (STC) from negative control samples. Moreover, the first time users obtained method performances similar to those obtained for validation studies previously performed on the screening methods included in the training course.",Deep Learning for Sensor-Based Rehabilitation Exercise Recognition and Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791648,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"In this paper, a multipath convolutional neural network (MP-CNN) is proposed for rehabilitation exercise recognition using sensor data. It consists of two novel components: a dynamic convolutional neural network (D-CNN) and a state transition probability CNN (S-CNN). In the D-CNN, Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are exploited to capture the distribution of sensor data for the body movements of the physical rehabilitation exercises. Then, the input signals and the GMMs are screened into different segments. These form multiple paths in the CNN. The S-CNN uses a modified Lempel⁻Ziv⁻Welch (LZW) algorithm to extract the transition probabilities of hidden states as discriminate features of different movements. Then, the D-CNN and the S-CNN are combined to build the MP-CNN. To evaluate the rehabilitation exercise, a special evaluation matrix is proposed along with the deep learning classifier to learn the general feature representation for each class of rehabilitation exercise at different levels. Then, for any rehabilitation exercise, it can be classified by the deep learning model and compared to the learned best features. The distance to the best feature is used as the score for the evaluation. We demonstrate our method with our collected dataset and several activity recognition datasets. The classification results are superior when compared to those obtained using other deep learning models, and the evaluation scores are effective for practical applications.",Macronutrient and Micronutrient Intake during Pregnancy: An Overview of Recent Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791647,Nutrients,2019 05 01,"Nutritional status during pregnancy can have a significant impact on maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Requirements for macronutrients such as energy and protein increase during pregnancy to maintain maternal homeostasis while supporting foetal growth. Energy restriction can limit gestational weight gain in women with obesity; however, there is insufficient evidence to support energy restriction during pregnancy. In undernourished women, balanced energy/protein supplementation may increase birthweight whereas high protein supplementation could have adverse effects on foetal growth. Modulating carbohydrate intake via a reduced glycaemic index or glycaemic load diet may prevent gestational diabetes and large-for-gestational-age infants. Certain micronutrients are also vital for improving pregnancy outcomes, including folic acid to prevent neural tube defects and iodine to prevent cretinism. Newly published studies support the use of calcium supplementation to prevent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly in women at high risk or with low dietary calcium intake. Although gaps in knowledge remain, research linking nutrition during pregnancy to maternofoetal outcomes has made dramatic advances over the last few years. In this review, we provide an overview of the most recent evidence pertaining to macronutrient and micronutrient requirements during pregnancy, the risks and consequences of deficiencies and the effects of supplementation on pregnancy outcomes.",Assessment of Cardiovascular Disease Risk and Therapeutic Patterns among Urban Black Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791646,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have nearly twice the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the general population. We aimed to assess, in a predominantly Black population, the prevalence of traditional and RA-specific CVD risk factors and therapeutic patterns. Utilizing ICD codes, we identified 503 RA patients ≥18 years old who were seen from 2010 to 2017. Of them, 88.5% were Black, 87.9% were women and 29.4% were smokers. CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) were higher than in previously reported White RA cohorts. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had at least one traditional CVD risk factor, 37% had three or more traditional CVD risk factors and 58% had RA-specific risk factors (seropositive RA, >10 years of disease, joint erosions, elevated inflammatory markers, extra-articular disease, body mass index (BMI) < 20). CV outcomes (coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and stroke) were comparable to published reports. Higher steroid use, which increases CVD risk, and lesser utilization of biologics (decrease CV risk) were also observed. Our Black RA cohort had higher rates of traditional CVD risk factors, in addition to chronic inflammation from aggressive RA, which places our patients at a higher risk for CVD outcomes, calling for revised risk stratification strategies and effective interventions to address comorbidities in this vulnerable population.","Electronic Cigarettes and Youth in the United States: A Call to Action (at the Local, National and Global Levels).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791645,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 12,"E-cigarettes have emerged and soared in popularity in the past ten years, making them the most common tobacco product used among youth in the United States (US).

Further, we review tobacco control policy efforts (e.g., Tobacco 21, banning flavors, advertising restrictions, and clean indoor air laws)-efforts proven to be critical in reducing cigarette smoking and smoking-related disease and death among US children and adults-including their potential and challenges regarding managing and mitigating the emergence of e-cigarettes.

The high diversity among Leptospira species provides an array to look for important mediators involved in pathogenesis. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems represent an important survival mechanism on stress conditions. vapBC modules have been found in nearly one thousand genomes corresponding to about 40% of known TAs. In the present study, we investigated TA profiles of some strains of Leptospira using a TA database and compared them through protein alignment of VapC toxin sequences among Leptospira spp. genomes. Our analysis identified significant differences in the number of putative vapBC modules distributed in pathogenic, saprophytic, and intermediate strains: four in L. interrogans, three in L. borgpetersenii, eight in L. biflexa, and 15 in L. licerasiae. The VapC toxins show low identity among amino acid sequences within the species. Some VapC toxins appear to be exclusively conserved in unique species, others appear to be conserved among pathogenic or saprophytic strains, and some appear to be distributed randomly. The data shown here indicate that these modules evolved in a very complex manner, which highlights the strong need to identify and characterize new TAs as well as to understand their regulation networks and the possible roles of TA systems in pathogenic bacteria.",Protocols for Culturing and Imaging a Human Ex Vivo Osteochondral Model for Cartilage Biomanufacturing Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791632,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Cartilage defects and diseases remain major clinical issues in orthopaedics. Biomanufacturing is now a tangible option for the delivery of bioscaffolds capable of regenerating the deficient cartilage tissue. However, several limitations of in vitro and experimental animal models pose serious challenges to the translation of preclinical findings into clinical practice. Ex vivo models are of great value for translating in vitro tissue engineered approaches into clinically relevant conditions. Our aim is to obtain a viable human osteochondral (OC) model to test hydrogel-based materials for cartilage repair. Here we describe a detailed step-by-step framework for the generation of human OC plugs, their culture in a perfusion device and the processing procedures for histological and advanced microscopy imaging. Our ex vivo OC model fulfils the following requirements: the model is metabolically stable for a relevant culture period of 4 weeks in a perfusion bioreactor, the processing procedures allowed for the analysis of 3 different tissues or materials (cartilage, bone and hydrogel) without compromising their integrity. We determined a protocol and the settings for a non-linear microscopy technique on label free sections. Furthermore, we established a clearing protocol to perform light sheet-based observations on the cartilage layer without the need for tedious and destructive histological procedures. Finally, we showed that our OC system is a clinically relevant in terms of cartilage regeneration potential. In conclusion, this OC model represents a valuable preclinical ex vivo tool for studying cartilage therapies, such as hydrogel-based bioscaffolds, and we envision it will reduce the number of animals needed for in vivo testing.",Walk Score® and Its Associations with Older Adults' Health Behaviors and Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791631,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"This study aimed to investigate the associations between Walk Score® and lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes in older Taiwanese adults. A nationwide survey was conducted through telephone-based interviews with older adults (65 years and older) in Taiwan. Data on Walk Score®, lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, healthy eating behavior, alcohol use, and smoking status), health outcomes (overweight/obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and personal characteristics were obtained from 1052 respondents. A binary logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders was employed. None of the Walk Score® categories were related to the recommended levels of total physical activity. The categories ""very walkable"" and ""walker's paradise"" were positively related to total sedentary time and TV viewing among older adults. No significant associations were found between Walk Score® and other lifestyle health behaviors or health outcomes. While Walk Score® was not associated with recommended levels of physical activity, it was positively related to prolonged sedentary time in the context of a non-Western country. The different associations between the walk score and health lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes in different contexts should be noted.",Molecular Characterization of a Novel Endornavirus Conferring Hypovirulence in Rice Sheath Blight Fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA Strain GD-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791630,Viruses,2019 04 02,"The complete sequence and genome organization of a novel Endornavirus from the hypovirulent strain GD-2 of Rhizoctonia solani AG-1 IA, the causal agent of rice sheath blight, were identified using a deep sequencing approach and it was tentatively named as Rhizoctonia solani endornavirus 1 (RsEV1). It was composed of only one segment that was 19,936 bp in length and was found to be the longest endornavirus genome that has been reported so far. The RsEV1 genome contained two open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 contained a glycosyltransferase 1 domain and a conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, whereas ORF2 encoded a conserved hypothetical protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RsEV1 was phylogenetically a new endogenous RNA virus. A horizontal transmission experiment indicated that RsEV1 could be transmitted from the host fungal strain GD-2 to a virulent strain GD-118P and resulted in hypovirulence in the derivative isogenic strain GD-118P-V1. Metabolomic analysis showed that 32 metabolites were differentially expressed between GD-118P and its isogenic hypovirulent strain GD-118P-V1. The differential metabolites were mainly classified as organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and the intermediate products of energy metabolism. Pathway annotation revealed that these 32 metabolites were mainly involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, starch, and sucrose metabolism, and so on. Taken together, our results showed that RsEV1 is a novel Endornavirus, and the infection of virulent strain GD-118P by RsEV1 caused metabolic disorders and resulted in hypovirulence. The results of this study lay a foundation for the biocontrol of rice sheath blight caused by R. solani AG1-IA.",Danger-Pose Detection System Using Commodity Wi-Fi for Bathroom Monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791629,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"A bathroom has higher probability of accidents than other rooms due to a slippery floor and temperature change. Because of high privacy and humidity, we face difficulties in monitoring inside a bathroom using traditional healthcare methods based on cameras and wearable sensors. In this paper, we present a danger-pose detection system using commodity Wi-Fi devices, which can be applied to bathroom monitoring, preserving privacy. A machine learning-based detection method usually requires data collected in target situations, which is difficult in detection-of-danger situations. We therefore employ a machine learning-based anomaly-detection method that requires a small amount of data in anomaly conditions, minimizing the required training data collected in dangerous conditions. We first derive the amplitude and phase shift from Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) to extract low-frequency components that are related to human activities. We then separately extract static and dynamic features from the CSI changes in time. Finally, the static and dynamic features are fed into a one-class support vector machine (SVM), which is used as an anomaly-detection method, to classify whether a user is not in bathtub, bathing safely, or in dangerous conditions. We conducted experimental evaluations and demonstrated that our danger-pose detection system achieved a high detection performance in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario.","High-Performance Resistance-Switchable Multilayers of Graphene Oxide Blended with 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Acceptor Nanocomposite.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791628,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Graphene oxide (GO) has been actively utilized in nonvolatile resistive switching random access memory (ReRAM) devices due to solution-processability, accessibility for highly scalable device fabrication for transistor-based memory, and cross-bar memory arrays. Uncontrollable oxygen functional groups of GO, however, restrict its application. To obtain stable memory performance, 2-tert-butylphenyl-5-biphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) a that can serve as 1,3,4-oxadiazole acceptor was carefully introduced onto the GO framework. Better stability was achieved by increasing the weight ratio of the chemical component from 2:1 to 10:1 in all GO-based solutions. Particularly, rewritable nonvolatile memory characteristics were dependent on the ratio between PBD and GO. PBD:GO devices with a proportion of 10:1 w/w exhibited better memory performance, possessed a higher ON/OFF ratio (>10²) at a lower switching voltage of -0.67 V, and had a long retention ability. The interaction between PBD and GO can be demonstrated by transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, thermogravimetric analysis, fourier transform infrared spectra, Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction, and fluorescence spectra. The superior ReRAM properties of the multilayers of GO blended with the PBD nanocomposite are attributed to electron traps caused by the strong electron acceptors.",Microstructures and Properties of Porous Liquid-Phase-Sintered SiC Ceramic by Hot Press Sintering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791627,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Porous liquid-phase-sintered SiC (L-SiC) ceramics were successfully fabricated by hot press sintering (HP) at 1800 °C in argon, using Al₂O₃ and Y₂O₃ as oxide additions.

Extensive antigenic diversity between genotypes and within the GII.4 genotype present major challenges for the development of a broadly protective vaccine. Efforts have been devoted to characterizing antibody-binding interactions with dynamic human norovirus viral-like particles, which recognize distinct antigenic sites on the capsid. Neutralizing antibody functions recognizing these sites have been validated in both surrogate (ligand blockade of binding) and in vitro virus propagation systems. In this review, we focus on GII.4 capsid protein epitopes as defined by monoclonal antibody binding. As additional antibody epitopes are defined, antigenic sites emerge on the human norovirus capsid, revealing the antigenic landscape of GII.4 viruses. These data may provide a road map for the design of candidate vaccine immunogens that induce cross-protective immunity and the development of therapeutic antibodies and drugs."

The World Health Organization also reported that a third of all new HIV infections around the world are estimated to occur among youths (aged 15⁻25). and teen pregnancy rates are on the rise in many places. These worrying trends suggest that existing sexuality education programs and interventions may be inadequate and/or ineffective. Although the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development's (ICPD) Programme of Action highlighted the roles of Governments to offer sex education to young people to promote teenage reproductive health, yet inconsistency exists in the related initiatives in the global context. The present article aims to provide a comprehensive literature review of the existing sexuality programs in selected places in both English-speaking (i.e., the United States of America, the United Kingdom) and Chinese-speaking contexts (i.e., Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan). Based on the review, observations and implications for sexuality education policy and practice, as well as recommendations for future research for youths are outlined.",Towards the Development of Artificial Bone Grafts: Combining Synthetic Biomineralisation with 3D Printing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791603,Journal of functional biomaterials,2019 04 19,"A synthetic technique inspired by the biomineralisation process in nacre has been previously reported to be effective in replicating the nanostructural elements of nacre in 2D chitosan hydrogel films. Here we evaluate the applicability of this synthetic biomineralisation technique, herein called the McGrath method, in replicating the flat tabular morphology of calcium carbonate and other nanostructural elements obtained when 2D chitosan hydrogel films were used, on a 3D porous chitosan hydrogel-based scaffold, hence developing 3D chitosan-calcium carbonate composites. Nozzle extrusion-based 3D printing technology was used to develop 3D porous scaffolds using chitosan hydrogel as the printing ink in a custom-designed 3D printer. The rheology of the printing ink and print parameters were optimised in order to fabricate 3D cylindrical structures with a cubic lattice-based internal structure. The effects of various dehydration techniques, including air-drying, critical point-drying and freeze-drying, on the structural integrity of the as-printed scaffolds from the nano to macroscale, were evaluated. The final 3D composite materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The study has shown that McGrath method can be used to develop chitosan-calcium carbonate composites wherein the mineral and matrix are in intimate association with each other at the nanoscale. This process can be successfully integrated with 3D printing technology to develop 3D compartmentalised polymer-mineral composites.",Efficient Expression of Xylanase by Codon Optimization and Its Effects on the Growth Performance and Carcass Characteristics of Broiler.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791602,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 03 10,"The aim of the present study was to improve the expression level of Trichoderma reesei xylanase (XynB) in Pichia pastoris through a codon optimization strategy and evaluate its effects on the growth performance and carcass characteristics of broiler. According to the codon bias of Pichia genome, the XynB gene from T. reesei was optimized and synthesized by whole gene assembly to improve its expression level in P. pastoris. Approximately 180 target mutations were successfully introduced into natural XynB. The maximum activity of xylanase (optiXynB) secreted by P. pastoris pPICZaA-optiXynB was 1299 U/mL after 96 h induction. Purified recombinant optiXynB had the molecular weight of 24 kDa. The optiXynB presented highest activity in pH 5.0 and 50 °C. The recombinase was highly specific towards birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, and oat-spelt xylan. In the broiler experiment, a total of 200 Arbor Acre broilers (one day old) were randomly allocated into four groups fed with basal diets containing 0 (control group), 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB. Dietary 1000 and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) final weight and body weight gain; dietary 500, 1000, and 1500 IU/kg optiXynB significantly increased (p < 0.05) pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight compared with the control group. Inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly increased final weight, body weight gain, breast muscle weight and leg muscle weight, but linearly decreased feed conversion rate (p < 0.05). Furthermore, inclusion of optiXynB in broiler diets linearly and quadratically increased pre-evisceration weight, dressed percentage, and eviscerated weight (p < 0.05). The recombinant optiXynB from P. pastoris pPICZaA-optiXynB was beneficial in improving growth performance and carcass characteristics of broilers.",Characterisation of an Isogenic Model of Cisplatin Resistance in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791601,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 26,"Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) is widely used for the treatment of solid malignancies; however, the development of chemoresistance hinders the success of this chemotherapeutic in the clinic. This study provides novel insights into the molecular and phenotypic changes in an isogenic oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) model of acquired cisplatin resistance. Key differences that could be targeted to overcome cisplatin resistance are highlighted. We characterise the differences in treatment sensitivity, gene expression, inflammatory protein secretions, and metabolic rate in an isogenic cell culture model of acquired cisplatin resistance in OAC. Cisplatin-resistant cells (OE33 Cis R) were significantly more sensitive to other cytotoxic modalities, such as 2 Gy radiation (p = 0.0055) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (p = 0.0032) treatment than parental cisplatin-sensitive cells (OE33 Cis P). Gene expression profiling identified differences at the gene level between cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cells, uncovering 692 genes that were significantly altered between OE33 Cis R cells and OE33 Cis P cells. OAC is an inflammatory-driven cancer, and inflammatory secretome profiling identified 18 proteins secreted at significantly altered levels in OE33 Cis R cells compared to OE33 Cis P cells. IL-7 was the only cytokine to be secreted at a significantly higher levels from OE33 Cis R cells compared to OE33 Cis P cells. Additionally, we profiled the metabolic phenotype of OE33 Cis P and OE33 Cis R cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The oxygen consumption rate, as a measure of oxidative phosphorylation, is significantly higher in OE33 Cis R cells under normoxic conditions. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions of 0.5% O₂, the oxygen consumption rate is significantly lower in OE33 Cis R cells than OE33 Cis P cells. This study provides novel insights into the molecular and phenotypic changes in an isogenic OAC model of acquired cisplatin resistance, and highlights therapeutic targets to overcome cisplatin resistance in OAC.",A Three-Dimensional Hough Transform-Based Track-Before-Detect Technique for Detecting Extended Targets in Strong Clutter Backgrounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791600,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Hough Transform (HT), which has a low sensitivity to local faults and good ability in suppressing noise and clutters, usually applies to trajectory detection in a cluttered environment. This paper describes its application for detecting the trajectories of extended targets in three-dimensional measurements, i.e., a two-dimensional positional information and its measuring time. For taking the full merits of a multi-scan, the measuring time is regarded as a variable for the time axis. This correspondence extends the HT to 3-dimensional data. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional accumulator matrix is built for the purpose of voting. The voting process is done in an iterative way by selecting the 3D-line with the most votes and removing the corresponding measurements in each step. The three dimensional Hough Transform-based extended target track-before-detect technique (3DHT-ET-TBD), proposed here, is suitable to track the extended target and non-extended target simultaneously and few false alarm trajectories arise. Both the real data and simulated data are exploited to evaluate its performance. Compared with the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter based methods and a 4DHT-TBD algorithm, the 3DHT-ET-TBD is a more promising approach for multi-extended target tracking problems due to its high efficiency and low computation, especially in situations where the noise and false alarms are considerably high but few measurements are generated by the extended targets.",Integrated Proteomics and Metabolomic Analyses of Plasma Injury Biomarkers in a Serious Brain Trauma Model in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791599,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a prevalent and serious brain injury with significant morbidity and disability. However, the underlying pathogenesis of DAI remains largely unclear, and there are still no objective laboratory-based tests available for clinicians to make an early diagnosis of DAI. An integrated analysis of metabolomic data and proteomic data may be useful to identify all of the molecular mechanisms of DAI and novel potential biomarkers. Therefore, we established a rat model of DAI, and applied an integrated UPLC-Q-TOF/MS-based metabolomics and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis to obtain unbiased profiling data. Differential analysis identified 34 metabolites and 43 proteins in rat plasma of the injury group. Two metabolites (acetone and 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde) and two proteins (Alpha-1-antiproteinase and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein) were identified as potential biomarkers for DAI, and all may play important roles in the pathogenesis of DAI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of integrated metabolomics and proteomics method to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of DAI, and may help provide clinicians with some novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Nevertheless, creating robust predictive models from data collected unobtrusively in home environments can be challenging, especially for vulnerable ageing population. Under that premise, we propose an activity recognition scheme for older people exploiting feature extraction and machine learning, along with heuristic computational solutions to address the challenges due to inconsistent measurements in non-standardized environments. In addition, we compare the customized pipeline with deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, applied to raw sensor data without any pre- or post-processing adjustments.

They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat⁻animal and bat⁻human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.",A Computational Thermodynamics-Assisted Development of Sn-Bi-In-Ga Quaternary Alloys as Low-Temperature Pb-Free Solders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791585,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Low-temperature lead (Pb)-free solders are demanding in the electronic packaging industry, because it would open the door for various economic choices of polymeric materials as substrates and also revives the lower cost processes. Here, we proposed a tin⁻bismuth⁻indium⁻gallium (Sn-52.5Bi-2.68In-1Ga, SBIG (in wt.%)) quaternary low-temperature solder, designed based on systematic CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram)-type thermodynamic calculations and corresponding key experiments. The solidification behavior of SBIG was carefully elaborated based on the computations using the lever rule and the Scheil model, and the experiments in terms of thermal analyses and microstructures of sample produced with step-quenching and various cooling rates. The mechanical properties of as-cast and 80 °C-annealed SBIG as well as their microstructures and fracture surfaces were evaluated in the tensile tests. The proposed SBIG solder is with a low liquidus temperature of 141.9 °C and is typically composed of the primary (Sn) phase, the (Sn) + (Bi) eutectic structure and a small amount of (Ga) phase. Air cooling has been identified as a satisfactory cooling rate, which would not lead to the formation of the brittle BiIn intermetallic compound. The as-cast SBIG solder exhibited high yield strength (YS) of 43.7 MPa, high ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 53.3 MPa and an extremely large elongation of 97.3% as comparing to the conventional eutectic Sn-58Bi solder (YS: 43.1 MPa, UTS: 49.5 MPa, and elongation: 37.5%). However, the proposed SBIG solder does not possess qualified thermal stability, that significant degradation in both strength and elongation were observed after being subjected to extensive thermal ageing at 80 °C for 504 h.","Nanostructured Fe,Co-Codoped MoO₃ Thin Films.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791584,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Molybdenum oxide (MoO₃) and Fe,Co-codoped MoO₃ thin films obtained by spray pyrolysis have been in-depth investigated to understand the effect of Co and Fe codoping on MoO₃ thin films. The effect of Fe and Co on the structural, morphological and optical properties of MoO₃ thin films have been studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), optical and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and electropyroelectric methods. The XRD patterns demonstrated the formation of orthorhombic α-MoO₃ by spray pyrolysis. SEM characterization has shown an increase in roughness of MoO₃ thin films by Fe and Co doping. Optical reflectance and transmittance measurements have shown an increase in optical band gap with the increase in Fe and Co contents. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of Fe,Co-doped MoO₃ were 24.10⁻25.86 Wm-1K-1 and 3.80 × 10-6⁻5.15 × 10-6 m²s-1, respectively. MoO₃ thin films have shown PL emission. Doping MoO₃ with Fe and Co increases emission in the visible range due to an increase number of chemisorbed oxygen atoms. The photodegradation of an aqueous solution of methylene blue (MB) depended on the content of the codoping elements (Fe,Co). The results showed that a degradation efficiency of 90% was observed after 60 min for MoO₃: Fe 2%-Co 1%, while the degradation efficiency was about 35% for the undoped MoO₃ thin film.",The Influence of Granite Cutting Waste on The Properties of Ultra-High Performance Concrete.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791583,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"This study analyzes the effect of using waste by-products generated in the process of granite cutting as part of the granular structure of Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC). The manufactured concrete has a compressive strength greater than 115 MPa. This study substitutes 35%, 70% and 100% of the volume of micronized quartz powder (<40 μm) with granite cutting waste. This is an innovative study where the feasibility of using waste from granite quarries as a replacement for micronized quartz in UHPC has been analyzed. The results show an improvement in the workability and compressive strength of UHPC, for all substitution ratios. The flexural strength and tensile strength increase when the substitution ratio is 35%, and even the values obtained for 100% substitution are acceptable. In view of the results obtained in this study, granite cutting waste, instead of the micronized quartz powder usually used, is a viable alternative for the manufacture of expectedly more sustainable UHPC.",Targeting the Viral Polymerase of Diarrhea-Causing Viruses as a Strategy to Develop a Single Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791582,Viruses,2019 04 02,"Viral gastroenteritis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, being particularly severe for children under the age of five.

We here discuss the feasibility of developing a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment against these diarrhea-causing viruses. This review focuses on the viral polymerase as an antiviral target, as this is the most conserved viral protein among the diverse viral families to which these viruses belong to. We describe the functional and structural similarities of the different viral polymerases, the antiviral effect of reported polymerase inhibitors and highlight common features that might be exploited in an attempt of designing such pan-polymerase inhibitor.",A Novel Microwave Staring Correlated Radar Imaging Method Based on Bi-Static Radar System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791581,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"The stochastic characteristic of the radiation field of a mono-static microwave staring correlated imaging (MSCI) radar degenerates with the increase of the imaging distance, which results in degradation of the image quality. To address this issue, a novel MSCI method based on bi-static radar is proposed from two perspectives: site-deploying and waveform design. On the one hand, a new bi-static MSCI site-deploying scheme is proposed which adopts two transmitting stations with their azimuth angles relative to the center of the imaging region differing by 90 degrees. On the other hand, by using two transmitting arrays synchronously transmitting inner-and-inter pulse frequency hopping (IAIP-FH) signals, the radiation field of each station includes a few ""frequency stripes"" perpendicular to the radiation direction, and as a consequence, the ""frequency stripes"" of each radiation field are perpendicular to each other. As a result, the radiation field of the bi-static MSCI is the superposition of the two striped radiation fields, thus a latticed radiation field is constructed. Therefore, the targets in different latticed grids scatter independent fields, then, the images can be reconstructed using correlation process (CP) algorithms. The grid size of the latticed radiation field is determined by the inner-pulse frequency hopping (FH) interval of the IAIP-FH signals and the imaging geometry. Moreover, it is shown that the 3 dB beam width of the space correlation function of the radiation field does not change with the imaging distance, thus the stochastic characteristic of the radiation field is partly preserved when the imaging distance increases. Simulation results validate the analysis and show that the proposed method can obtain higher resolution images than the common mono-static MSCI method.",State-of-the-Art of Profiling Immune Contexture in the Era of Multiplexed Staining and Digital Analysis to Study Paraffin Tumor Tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791580,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Multiplexed platforms for multiple epitope detection have emerged in the last years as very powerful tools to study tumor tissues. These revolutionary technologies provide important visual techniques for tumor examination in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens to improve the understanding of the tumor microenvironment, promote new treatment discoveries, aid in cancer prevention, as well as allowing translational studies to be carried out. The aim of this review is to highlight the more recent methodologies that use multiplexed staining to study simultaneous protein identification in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues for immune profiling, clinical research, and potential translational analysis. New multiplexed methodologies, which permit the identification of several proteins at the same time in one single tissue section, have been developed in recent years with the ability to study different cell populations, cells by cells, and their spatial distribution in different tumor specimens including whole sections, core needle biopsies, and tissue microarrays. Multiplexed technologies associated with image analysis software can be performed with a high-quality throughput assay to study cancer specimens and are important tools for new discoveries. The different multiplexed technologies described in this review have shown their utility in the study of cancer tissues and their advantages for translational research studies and application in cancer prevention and treatments.",Astrocytes Maintain Glutamate Homeostasis in the CNS by Controlling the Balance between Glutamate Uptake and Release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791579,Cells,2019 03 29,"Glutamate is one of the most prevalent neurotransmitters released by excitatory neurons in the central nervous system (CNS); however, residual glutamate in the extracellular space is, potentially, neurotoxic. It is now well-established that one of the fundamental functions of astrocytes is to uptake most of the synaptically-released glutamate, which optimizes neuronal functions and prevents glutamate excitotoxicity. In the CNS, glutamate clearance is mediated by glutamate uptake transporters expressed, principally, by astrocytes. Interestingly, recent studies demonstrate that extracellular glutamate stimulates Ca2+ release from the astrocytes' intracellular stores, which triggers glutamate release from astrocytes to the adjacent neurons, mostly by an exocytotic mechanism. This released glutamate is believed to coordinate neuronal firing and mediate their excitatory or inhibitory activity. Therefore, astrocytes contribute to glutamate homeostasis in the CNS, by maintaining the balance between their opposing functions of glutamate uptake and release. This dual function of astrocytes represents a potential therapeutic target for CNS diseases associated with glutamate excitotoxicity. In this regard, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of glutamate uptake and release, their regulation, and the significance of both processes in the CNS. Also, we review the main features of glutamate metabolism and glutamate excitotoxicity and its implication in CNS diseases.",Pulse Pressure Variation Can Predict the Hemodynamic Response to Pneumoperitoneum in Dogs: A Retrospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791578,Veterinary sciences,2019 04 21,"Pneumoperitoneum may induce important hemodynamic alterations in healthy subjects. Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a hemodynamic parameter able to discriminate preload dependent subjects. Anesthesia records of dogs undergoing laparoscopy were retrospectively evaluated. The anesthetic protocol included acepromazine, methadone, propofol and isoflurane administered with oxygen under mechanical ventilation. The hemodynamic parameters were considered five minutes before (BASE) and ten minutes after (P10) the pneumoperitoneum. Based on the cardiac index (CI) variation, at P10, dogs were classified as sensitive (S group, CI ≤ 15%) and non-sensitive (NO-S group). Data were analyzed with the ANOVA test and the ROC curve (p < 0.05). Fifty-five percent of dogs (S) had a reduction of CI ≥ 15% at P10 (2.97 ± 1.4 L/min/m²) compared to BASE (4.32 ± 1.62 L/min/m²) and at P10 in the NO-S group (4.51 ± 1.41 L/min/m²). PPV at BASE was significantly higher in the S group (22.4% ± 6.1%) compared to the NO-S group (10.9% ± 3.3%). The ROC curve showed a threshold of PPV > 16% to distinguish the S and NO-S groups. PPV may be a valid predictor of the hemodynamic response to pneumoperitoneum in dogs. A PPV > 16% can identify patients that may require fluid administration before the creation of pneumoperitoneum."

Studies show that early Palliative Care (PC) interventions based on a problem-oriented approach can improve quality of life, support decision-making, and optimize the timing of medical treatment and transition to hospice services. The aim of this quality-improvement project was to develop a pragmatic structure meeting all clinical settings and populations needs. Based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework, a literature review identifying approaches commonly used in PC was performed. In addition, more than 500 hospital-based interprofessional consultations were analyzed. Identified themes were structured and compared to published approaches. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of this structure with an online survey among professionals. The emerged 'SENS'-structure stands for: Symptoms patients suffer from; End-of-life decisions; Network around the patient delivering care; and Support for the carer. Evaluation among professionals has confirmed that the 'SENS'-structure covers all relevant areas for anticipatory planning in PC. 'SENS' is useful in guiding patient-centered PC conversations and pragmatic anticipatory planning, alongside the regular diagnosis-triggered approach in various settings. Following this approach, 'SENS' may facilitate systematic integration of PC in clinical practice. Depending on clearly defined outcomes, this needs to be confirmed by future randomized controlled studies.",Differences of the Structure of Immune Regulatory Cell Populations between Cellular Material from Sonographically Detected Focal Thyroid Lesions and Peripheral Blood in Humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791564,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Focal thyroid lesions are common ultrasound findings with the estimated prevalence up to 67% of the population. They form characteristically enveloped regions with individual encapsulated microenvironment that may involve the specific distribution of immune system compounds-especially antigen presenting cells (APC). We analyzed and compared the most potent APC-plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells (DCs) subpopulations and three monocyte subpopulations as well as other immune cells-in peripheral blood and local blood of thyroid gland obtained parallelly in patients with focal thyroid lesions using flow cytometry. The analysis revealed significant differences in the distribution of main subsets of assessed cells between peripheral blood and biopsy material.

Fiber optic sensors, which are based on light signals, solve many of the problems of monitoring structures in high temperature environments; however, they present their own challenges. This paper, which is intended for structural engineers new to fiber optic sensors, reviews various fiber optic sensors that have been used to make measurements in structure fires, including the sensing principles, fabrication, key characteristics, and recently-reported applications. Three categories of fiber optic sensors are reviewed: Grating-based sensors, interferometer sensors, and distributed sensors.",Research on the Improvement Effect and Mechanism of Micro-Scale Structures Treated by Laser Micro-Engraving on 7075 Al Alloy Tribological Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791561,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"During various applications in aerospace, ships, autos, and aircraft, 7075 Al alloy will frequently contact other materials, and therefore suffer from slight abrasion. However, the poor tribological properties of 7075 Al alloy greatly affect its performance and life length, leading to limitations in its application. Preparing roughness structures on the surface is regarded as a promising method to improve the properties of materials. However, the tribological properties of 7075 Al alloy cannot be enhanced significantly by roughness structures in complex dynamic changeable environments, owing to the incomplete understanding of the effect of roughness structures. Given the above issues, in this paper, micro-scale structures (linear grooves, gridding grooves, and arc grooves) were designed and prepared on 7075 Al alloy surfaces by a surface treatment (laser micro-engraving), which provides excellent controllability of the morphology and dimensions of as-prepared roughness structures. The tribological properties of the as-prepared surfaces were investigated systemically. The effect of micro-scale structures on the tribological properties was studied. The wear mechanism and tribological properties improvement mechanism of the surfaces were clarified. Furthermore, the effect degree of the enhancement factors of the micro-scale structures on the tribological properties was explored under different conditions. The results indicate that the micro-scale structures play an important role in improving the tribological properties of Al alloy under different sliding speeds. The improvement mechanism can be summarized by four factors. However, the effect degrees of these factors on the tribological properties exhibit considerable differences. This study not only develops specific micro-scale structures that can dramatically improve the tribological properties of 7075 Al alloy under different conditions, but also offers guidance for the construction of appropriate roughness structures that can dramatically improve the tribological properties of Al alloy according to the friction conditions.",Aspirin Use among Adults with Cardiovascular Disease in the United States: Implications for an Intervention Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791560,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major underlying cause of death, with high economic burden in most countries, including the United States. Lifestyle modifications and the use of antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, can contribute significantly to secondary prevention of CVD in adults. This study examined the prevalence and associated factors of aspirin use for the secondary prevention of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular disease (stroke) in a sample of American adults. The 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset was analyzed for this cross-sectional study. Almost 16% of the study population (N = 441,456) had angina, MI, or stroke. Weighted percentages of respondents with angina, MI, and stroke were 4%, 4.3%, and 3%, respectively. Overall, weighted prevalence of daily (or every other day) aspirin use was about 65%, 71%, and 57% among respondents with angina, MI, and stroke, respectively. Factors that were significantly associated with aspirin use included male sex, more than high school education, high blood pressure, diabetes, and less than excellent general health. There were existing differences among individuals with CVD based on diagnosis, demographic and socioeconomic status in the use of aspirin for secondary prevention. Resources for promoting aspirin use should be directed toward groups with lower utilization.",Improving the Performance of Horseradish Peroxidase by Site-Directed Mutagenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791559,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is an intensely studied enzyme with a wide range of commercial applications. Traditionally, HRP is extracted from plant; however, recombinant HRP (rHRP) production is a promising alternative. Here, non-glycosylated rHRP was produced in Escherichia coli as a DsbA fusion protein including a Dsb signal sequence for translocation to the periplasm and a His tag for purification. The missing N-glycosylation results in reduced catalytic activity and thermal stability, therefore enzyme engineering was used to improve these characteristics. The amino acids at four N-glycosylation sites, namely N13, N57, N255 and N268, were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis and combined to double, triple and quadruple enzyme variants. Subsequently, the rHRP fusion proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and biochemically characterized. We found that the quadruple mutant rHRP N13D/N57S/N255D/N268D showed 2-fold higher thermostability and 8-fold increased catalytic activity with 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) as reducing substrate when compared to the non-mutated rHRP benchmark enzyme.","How Can Cities Respond to Flood Disaster Risks under Multi-Scenario Simulation? A Case Study of Xiamen, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791558,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Flood disasters often have serious impacts on cities. Disaster prevention and mitigation schemes for flood disasters must be based on risk assessment. We constructed an indicator system for flood disaster risk assessment from the aspects of hazard factors, sensitivity to the environment, disaster vulnerability, flood disaster prevention, and resilience. Then we add the precipitation factor as a scenario parameter to the assessment of flood disasters, in order to assess the flood disaster risk under annual average precipitation scenarios, multi-year flood season average precipitation scenarios, and large typhoon precipitation scenarios. Xiamen is one of the cities with more serious flood disasters. We select Xiamen as an example and refer to existing indicators of flood disaster assessment. The results show that: (1) the coefficient of variation of flood disasters in Xiamen under the impact of large-scale typhoon precipitation is large; (2) the drainage and flood control capacity of Xiamen is generally insufficient, and the risk in the old city is high; (3) there are many flood-prone locations in Xiamen. Underpass interchanges, underground spaces, and urban villages have become the new key areas for flood control; and (4) the flood risk in the northern mountainous areas of Xiamen is the highest. Based on the assessment results, we further delineate the urban flood control zones and propose corresponding countermeasures. The study expands the research on flood disaster risk assessment, and also provides reference for relevant cities to deal with flood disasters.","Efficacy of Polydextrose Supplementation on Colonic Transit Time, Bowel Movements, and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Adults: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791557,Nutrients,2019 05 01,"The addition of fiber is one of the most important dietary means to relieve constipation through lifestyle modification. Polydextrose (PDX) has been reported in several studies to increase fecal bulk, soften stools, and increase the number of defecations. However, there are few studies on the effect of PDX on colonic transit time (CTT). Therefore, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of PDX on CTT and other aspects of gastrointestinal function during two weeks (Day 1 to Day 14), preceded by a 2-week run-in period (Day -14 to Day -1). A total of 192 adults who were diagnosed with functional constipation per Rome III criteria were recruited for the study. Participants were randomized equally into 4 groups (12 g, 8 g, or 4 g of PDX or placebo per day). The primary endpoint was CTT, assessed using radio-opaque markers and abdominal X-rays on Day 0, the baseline; and Day 15, the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes that were measured using inventories were the patient assessment of constipation symptoms and quality of life, bowel function index, relief of constipation, bowel movement frequency (BMF), stool consistency, degree of straining, and proportion of bowel movements. Ancillary parameters and harms were also evaluated. The recruited population was not sufficiently constipated (e.g., baseline values for CTT and BMF of 42 h and 8.7 BMF/week, respectively). Despite this limitation, our results demonstrated an increased number of bowel movements when supplemented with PDX at a dosage of 12 g per day for 2 weeks. This dosage also consistently improved the secondary outcomes that were measured using inventories at Day 15, compared with the baseline. No serious or significant adverse events were reported during the study."

We previously confirmed the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine treatment targeting tumor angiogenesis with synthetic peptides, for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) epitopes in recurrent HGG patients. In this study, we evaluated a novel vaccine therapy targeting not only tumor vasculature but also tumor cells, using multiple glioma oncoantigen (GOA)/glioma angiogenesis-associated antigen (GAAA) peptides in HLA-A2402+ recurrent/progressive HGG patients. The vaccine included peptide epitopes from four GOAs (LY6K, DEPDC1, KIF20A, and FOXM1) and two GAAAs (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2). Ten patients received subcutaneous vaccinations. The primary endpoint was the safety of the treatment. T-lymphocyte responses against GOA/GAAA epitopes and treatment response were evaluated secondarily. The treatment was well tolerated without any severe systemic adverse events. The vaccinations induced immunoreactivity to at least three vaccine-targeted GOA/GAAA in all six evaluable patients. The median overall survival time in all patients was 9.2 months. Five achieved progression-free status lasting at least six months. Two recurrent glioblastoma patients demonstrated stable disease. One patient with anaplastic oligoastrocytoma achieved complete response nine months after the vaccination. Taken together, this regimen was well tolerated and induced robust GOA/GAAA-specific T-lymphocyte responses in recurrent/progressive HGG patients.",The Cognitive Profile of People with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791545,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 10,"Several studies have examined the cognitive profile of people with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (IQ > 70), and its relationship with the symptoms of ASD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). However, no data exist on the similarities or differences in this profile in less affluent countries. The present study examined the cognitive profile and its relationship with the symptoms of ASD and ADHD in 30 subjects aged 6⁻16 years with high-functioning ASD and compared the results with those of 30 typically developing (TD) subjects. In line with previous research findings, the WISC-IV cognitive profile analysis of subjects with high-functioning ASD showed a good competence in Matrix Reasoning and weaknesses in Comprehension, but the main distinguishing point was the competence in processing speed in both groups. In the present study, the Verbal Comprehension Index correlated negatively with the communication symptoms, and the Working Memory Index correlated positively with the social symptoms in the ASD group. Given the similarities that exist between the results of the present research and previous studies, it may be concluded that there are similarities in the cognitive profile of individuals with ASD.",Copy-Paste Mutagenesis: A Method for Large-Scale Alteration of Viral Genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791544,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"The cloning of the large DNA genomes of herpesviruses, poxviruses, and baculoviruses as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) in Escherichia coli has opened a new era in viral genetics. Several methods of lambda Red-mediated genome engineering (recombineering) in E. coli have been described, which are now commonly used to generate recombinant viral genomes. These methods are very efficient at introducing deletions, small insertions, and point mutations. Here we present Copy-Paste mutagenesis, an efficient and versatile strategy for scarless large-scale alteration of viral genomes. It combines gap repair and en passant mutagenesis procedures and relies on positive selection in all crucial steps. We demonstrate that this method can be used to generate chimeric strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the largest human DNA virus. Large (~15 kbp) genome fragments of HCMV strain TB40/E were tagged with an excisable marker and cloned (copied) in a low-copy plasmid vector by gap repair recombination. The cloned fragment was then excised and inserted (pasted) into the HCMV AD169 genome with subsequent scarless removal of the marker by en passant mutagenesis. We have done four consecutive rounds of this procedure, thereby generating an AD169-TB40/E chimera containing 60 kbp of the donor strain TB40/E. This procedure is highly useful for identifying gene variants responsible for phenotypic differences between viral strains. It can also be used for repair of incomplete viral genomes, and for modification of any BAC-cloned sequence. The method should also be applicable for large-scale alterations of bacterial genomes.",Therapeutic Effects of HIF-1α on Bone Formation around Implants in Diabetic Mice Using Cell-Penetrating DNA-Binding Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791543,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"Patients with uncontrolled diabetes are susceptible to implant failure due to impaired bone metabolism. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor that is up-regulated in response to reduced oxygen during bone repair, is known to mediate angiogenesis and osteogenesis. However, its function is inhibited under hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients. This study thus evaluates the effects of exogenous HIF-1α on bone formation around implants by applying HIF-1α to diabetic mice and normal mice via a protein transduction domain (PTD)-mediated DNA delivery system. Implants were placed in the both femurs of diabetic and normal mice. HIF-1α and placebo gels were injected to implant sites of the right and left femurs, respectively. We found that bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume (BV) were significantly greater in the HIF-1α treated group than placebo in diabetic mice (p < 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis showed that diabetic mice had 216 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 21 target genes. Among the target genes, NOS2, GPNMB, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL16, and TRIM63 were found to be associated with bone formation. Based on these results, we conclude that local administration of HIF-1α via PTD may boost bone formation around the implant and induce gene expression more favorable to bone formation in diabetic mice.",Sphingomyelin Depletion from Plasma Membranes of Human Airway Epithelial Cells Completely Abrogates the Deleterious Actions of S. aureus Alpha-Toxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791542,Toxins,2019 04 02,"Interaction of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin (hemolysin A, Hla) with eukaryotic cell membranes is mediated by proteinaceous receptors and certain lipid domains in host cell plasma membranes. Hla is secreted as a 33 kDa monomer that forms heptameric transmembrane pores whose action compromises maintenance of cell shape and epithelial tightness. It is not exactly known whether certain membrane lipid domains of host cells facilitate adhesion of Ha monomers, oligomerization, or pore formation. We used sphingomyelinase (hemolysin B, Hlb) expressed by some strains of staphylococci to pre-treat airway epithelial model cells in order to specifically decrease the sphingomyelin (SM) abundance in their plasma membranes. Such a pre-incubation exclusively removed SM from the plasma membrane lipid fraction. It abrogated the formation of heptamers and prevented the formation of functional transmembrane pores. Hla exposure of rHlb pre-treated cells did not result in increases in [Ca2+]i, did not induce any microscopically visible changes in cell shape or formation of paracellular gaps, and did not induce hypo-phosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin as usual. Removal of sphingomyelin from the plasma membranes of human airway epithelial cells completely abrogates the deleterious actions of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin.",Influence of Boundary Layer Structure and Low-Level Jet on PM2.5 Pollution in Beijing: A Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791541,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Beijing experiences frequent PM2.5 pollution, which is influenced by the planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure/process. Partly due to a lack of appropriate observations, the impacts of PBL on PM2.5 pollution are not yet fully understood. Combining wind-profiler data, radiosonde measurements, near-surface meteorological observations, aerosol measurements, and three-dimensional simulations, this study investigated the influence of PBL structure and the low-level jet (LLJ) on the pollution in Beijing from 19 to 20 September 2015. The evolution of the LLJ was generally well simulated by the model, although the wind speed within the PBL was overestimated. Being influenced by the large-scale southerly prevailing winds, the aerosols emitted from the southern polluted regions could be easily transported to Beijing, contributing to ~68% of the PM2.5 measured in Beijing on 20 September. The relative contribution of external transport of PM2.5 to Beijing was high in the afternoon (≥80%), which was related to the strong southerly PBL winds and the presence of thermally-induced upslope winds. On 20 September, the LLJ in Beijing demonstrated a prominent diurnal variation, which was predominant in the morning and after sunset. The occurrence of the LLJ could enhance the dilution capacity in Beijing to some extent, which favors the dilution of pollutants at a local scale. This study has important implications for better understanding the complexity of PBL structure/process associated with PM2.5 pollution in Beijing.",Diet Supplementation in ω3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Favors an Anti-Inflammatory Basal Environment in Mouse Adipose Tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791540,Nutrients,2019 05 01,"Oxylipins are metabolized from dietary ω3 and ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and are involved in an inflammatory response. Adipose tissue inflammatory background is a key factor of metabolic disorders and it is accepted that dietary fatty acids, in terms of quality and quantity, modulate oxylipin synthesis in this tissue. Moreover, it has been reported that diet supplementation in ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids resolves some inflammatory situations. Thus, it is crucial to assess the influence of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids on oxylipin synthesis and their impact on adipose tissue inflammation. To this end, mice fed an ω6- or ω3-enriched standard diet (ω6/ω3 ratio of 30 and 3.75, respectively) were analyzed for inflammatory phenotype and adipose tissue oxylipin content. Diet enrichment with an ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid induced an increase in the oxylipins derived from ω6 linoleic acid, ω3 eicosapentaenoic, and ω3 docosahexaenoic acids in brown and white adipose tissues. Among these, the level of pro-resolving mediator intermediates, as well as anti-inflammatory metabolites, were augmented. Concomitantly, expressions of M2 macrophage markers were increased without affecting inflammatory cytokine contents. In vitro, these metabolites did not activate macrophages but participated in macrophage polarization by inflammatory stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrated that an ω3-enriched diet, in non-obesogenic non-inflammatory conditions, induced synthesis of oxylipins which were involved in an anti-inflammatory response as well as enhancement of the M2 macrophage molecular signature, without affecting inflammatory cytokine secretion.",Development and Validation of an Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Method for the Determination of Wedelolactone in Rat Plasma and its Application in a Pharmacokinetic Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791539,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"Wedelolactone is a coumarin ether with significant hepatoprotective effects. However, there are few pharmacokinetic studies of wedelolactone, which will affect the studies of its efficacy and potential toxicity. In this study, a selective ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method was developed to confirm the pharmacokinetic parameters of wedelolactone in rat plasma. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Kromasil C18 UPLC column (250 × 4.6 mm; 5.0 μm) by gradient mobile phase of methanol-water containing 0.5% acetic acid (v/v). Perfect linearity was obtained and the samples were stable under different conditions. The intra-day and inter-day precisions (relative standard deviation, %) were within 3.81% and accuracies (relative error, %) ranged from -4.01% to 7.12%. The extraction recoveries in rat plasma ranged from 95.98% to 108.93%. This rapid method was successfully applied in the pharmacokinetic study of wedelolactone in rat plasma. Following the oral administration of 5.00 mg/kg wedelolactone, the wedelolactone was rapidly absorbed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were used to quantitatively describe the dynamic changes of wedelolactone in vivo, providing a theoretical basis for pharmacological research on drugs and preclinical medication. The study of wedelolactone can provide a theoretical basis and quick analysis for the study of other traditional Chinese medicine. This may lead to breakthroughs in the pharmacokinetic study of complex Chinese medicines.",Transcriptomic Analysis of Vibrio parahaemolyticus Reveals Different Virulence Gene Expression in Response to Benzyl Isothiocyanate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791538,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from seafood is a pathogenic microorganism that leads to several acute diseases that are harmful to our health and is frequently transmitted by food.

Treatment with BITC resulted in 332 differentially expressed genes, among which 137 genes were downregulated, while 195 genes were upregulated. Moreover, six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RNA sequencing studies were further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Genes found to regulate virulence encoded an l-threonine 3-dehydrogenase, a GGDEF family protein, the outer membrane protein OmpV, a flagellum-specific adenosine triphosphate synthase, TolQ protein and VirK protein.

For increasing Eu3+ content, the Eu3+ emission intensity increased as well while the Tb3+ emission intensity decreased owing to Tb3+→Eu3+ energy transfer. The energy transfer efficiencies were calculated and the energy transfer mechanism was discussed in detail. The lifetime for both the Eu3+ and Tb3+ emission decreases with the Eu3+ addition, the former is due to the formation of resonant energy transfer net, and the latter is because of contribution by Tb3+→Eu3+ energy transfer. The phosphor morphology can be controlled by adjusting the hydrothermal condition (reaction pH), and the morphological influence to the luminescent properties (PL/PLE, decay lifetime, etc.) has been studied in detail."

The corrosion current density of carbon-manganese steel significantly increased due to the galvanic effect irrespective of temperature used in this study. With the increase in temperature, the extent of the galvanic effect on the corrosion current density of carbon-manganese steel and reductive dissolution of magnetite gradually increased.

These diseases are generally qualitative and/or quantitative defects that are associated with monoallelic or biallelic mutations in the relevant gene. Among RICDs, factor V (FV) deficiency is one of the least characterized at the molecular level. Here, we investigated four unrelated patients with reduced plasma FV levels (three severe, one mild), which were associated with a moderately severe bleeding tendency. Sequence analysis of the FV gene identified seven different variants, five hitherto unknown (p.D1669G, c.5789-11C>A, c.5789-12C>A, c.5789-5T>G, and c.6528G>C), and two previously reported (c.158+1G>A and c.5789G>A). The possible pathogenic role of the newly identified missense variant was studied by in silico approaches. The remaining six genetic defects (all putative splicing mutations) were investigated for their possible effects on pre-mRNA splicing by transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells with plasmids expressing appropriate hybrid minigenes. The preparation of minigene constructs was instrumental to demonstrate that the two adjacent variants c.5789-11C>A and c.5789-12C>A are indeed present in cis in the analyzed FV-deficient patient (thus leading to the c.5789-11_12CC>AA mutation). Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that each variant causes either a skipping of the relevant exon or the activation of cryptic splice sites (exonic or intronic), eventually leading to the introduction of a premature termination codon.",The Role of Environmental Conditions on Marathon Running Performance in Men Competing in Boston Marathon from 1897 to 2018.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791523,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"This study investigated the effects of weather conditions on male performance during the Boston Marathon from 1897 to 2018. A total of 383,982 observations from 244,642 different finishers were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. All runners, annual top 100 finishers and annual top ten finishers were considered. Weather conditions, on race day, were: average air temperature (°C), precipitations (mm), wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (°C), wind speed (km/h), wind direction (N, S, W, E) and pressure (hPa). These effects were examined in multi-variable models with spline smooth terms in function of calendar year. Temperature, when increasing by 1 °C, was related to worsened performance for all groups (i.e., by 00:01:53 h:min:sec for all finishers, p < 0.001). Wind coming from the West, compared to wind coming from other directions, was the most favourable for performance of all groups of finishers. Increasing precipitations worsened performances of top 100 (estimate 00:00:04 h:min:sec, p < 0.001) and top 10 finishers (estimate 00:00:05 h:min:sec, p < 0.001). Wind speed, when increasing by 1 km/h, was related to worsened performance for all finishers (estimate 00:00:19 h:min:sec, p < 0.001), but not for top 100 group, where performances were 00:00:09 h:min:sec faster, p < 0.001. Pressure and WBGT were examined in uni-variable models: overall, performances worsened as pressure and WBGT increased. Our findings contributed to the knowledge about the effect of weather conditions on performance level in male marathon runners.",Pharmacological Properties of Morus nigra L. (Black Mulberry) as A Promising Nutraceutical Resource.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791521,Nutrients,2019 05 01,"Mulberry plants belonging to the Moraceae family have been grown for the purpose of being the nutrient source for silk worm and raw materials for the preparation of jams, marmalades, vinegars, juices, wines, and cosmetics. Morus nigra L. (black mulberry) is native to Southwestern Asia, and it has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for animals and humans. In this article, recent research progress on various biological and pharmacological properties of extracts, fractions, and isolated active constituents from different parts of M. nigra are reviewed. M. nigra exhibited a wide-spectrum of biological and pharmacological therapeutic effects including antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-melanogenic, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anticancer activities. M. nigra also showed protective effects against various human organs and systems, mainly based on its antioxidant capacity. These findings strongly suggest that M. nigra can be used as a promising nutraceutical resource to control and prevent various chronic diseases.",Damage Evolution of RC Beams Under Simultaneous Reinforcement Corrosion and Sustained Load.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791520,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"To accurately obtain the performance of concrete structures in coastal regions, it is necessary to correctly understand the damage evolution law of reinforced concrete (RC) members under real working conditions. In this paper, four RC beams, subjected to different levels of corrosion and sustained load, are first tested. Reinforcement corrosion coupled with sustained load increases the number and width of cracks at the soffit of beams but decreases their loading capacities. Crack width of the corroded beam under 50% of designed load is two times of that under 30% of designed load. Residual loading capacities of the corroded beams subjected to 30% and 50% of designed load are 87.5% and 81.8% of the control beam. A finite element model is developed for the corroded RC beams. Due to less confinement, concrete below and at the sides of reinforcements is subjected to a higher stress, compared to concrete above the reinforcements. Corrosion expansion of reinforcements is successfully modelled by a temperature-filed method, as it properly simulates the damage evolution of the corroded RC beams. As a result, concrete cracking, caused by the reinforcement corrosion, is well captured. Coupling reinforcement corrosion with sustained load significantly increases the damage level in RC beams, particularly for those subjected to a high sustained load. The whole damage evolution process of concrete cracking due to corrosion expansion under the coupling effect of sustained loading and environment can be simulated, thus providing a reference for the durability evaluation, life prediction, and numerical simulation of concrete structure.",Plasma-Induced Crystallization of TiO₂ Nanotubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791519,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Facile crystallization of titanium oxide (TiO₂) nanotubes (NTs), synthesized by electrochemical anodization, with low pressure non-thermal oxygen plasma is reported. The influence of plasma processing conditions on TiO₂ NTs crystal structure and morphology was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For the first time we report the transition of amorphous TiO₂ NTs to anatase and rutile crystal structures upon treatment with highly reactive oxygen plasma. This crystallization process has a strong advantage over the conventional heat treatments as it enables rapid crystallization of the surface. Thus the crystalline structure of NTs is obtained in a few seconds of treatment and it does not disrupt the NTs' morphology. Such a crystallization approach is especially suitable for medical applications in which stable crystallized nanotubular morphology is desired. The last part of the study thus deals with in vitro biological response of whole blood to the TiO₂ NTs. The results indicate that application of such surfaces for blood connecting devices is prospective, as practically no platelet adhesion or activation on crystallized TiO₂ NTs surfaces was observed.",Biodegradability of Trimethylbenzene Isomers under Denitrifying and Sulfate-Reducing Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791518,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Trimethylbenzene (TMB) isomers (1,2,3-TMB, 1,2,4-TMB, and 1,3,5-TMB) are often used as conservative tracers in anaerobic, contaminated aquifers for assessing BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) biodegradation at field sites. However, uncertainties exist about the behavior of these compounds under anaerobic conditions. For this reason, the influence of various parameters (temperature, residence time) on the biodegradability of TMB isomers was investigated under denitrifying and sulfate-reducing conditions in microcosms and 1D-column experiments. Soil and groundwater contaminated with a cocktail of aromatic hydrocarbons including the TMB isomers, both collected from an industrial site in Berlin, Germany, were used for the laboratory investigations. A continuous and complete biodegradation of 1,3,5-TMB and 1,2,4-TMB under denitrifying conditions was observed independent of realized temperature (10⁻20 °C) and residence time. Biodegradation of 1,2,3-TMB started after longer lag-phases and was not continuous over the whole experimental period; a strong dependence on temperature and residence time was identified. The biodegradability of all TMB isomers under sulfate-reducing conditions was continuous and complete at higher temperatures (20 °C), whereas no degradation was observed for lower temperatures (10 °C). First-order biodegradation rate constants ranged from 0.05 to 0.21 d-1 for 1,3,5-TMB and 1,2,4-TMB and from 0.01 to 0.11 d-1 for 1,2,3-TMB.",MEG Effects on Hydrolysis of Polyamide 66/Glass Fiber Composites and Mechanical Property Changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791517,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"Polyamide66 (PA66) hydrolysis affects the mechanical properties of Polyamide66/glass fiber (PA66/GF) composites. We investigated the effects of monoethylene glycol (MEG) on the degree of hydrolysis and mechanical properties of four different commercial PA66/glass fiber composites. Using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS), we identified the byproducts of PA66 composite hydrolysis: carboxylic acid and alkylamine substances. The degree of hydrolysis increased as the immersion time in MEG increased. However, the tensile and flexural properties decreased due to hydrolysis. The tensile strength decreased by 42⁻45%; however, elongation increased by 23⁻63%. When PA66 absorbs MEG at 130 °C, the materials molecular chains' bonding force decreased, resulting in increased elongation.",Relationship between Perceived Indoor Temperature and Self-Reported Risk for Frailty among Community-Dwelling Older People.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791516,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"This study investigated the relationship between perceived indoor temperature in winter and frailty among community-dwelling older people. This cross-sectional study included 342 people 65 years and older in Japan. Participants answered questions about demographics, frailty, housing, and perceived indoor temperature in winter. Participants were grouped based on perceived indoor temperature (Cold or Warm) and economic satisfaction (Unsatisfied or Satisfied). Differences in the frailty index between perceived indoor temperature groups and economic satisfaction groups were tested by using ANCOVA and MANCOVA. An interaction effect showed that people in the Cold Group and unsatisfied with their economic status had significantly higher frailty index scores (F(1, 336) = 5.95, p = 0.015). Furthermore, the frailty index subscale of fall risk was the specific indicator of frailty that accounted for this significant relationship. While previous research has shown the risks related to cold indoor temperature in homes, interestingly among those who reported cold homes, only those who were not satisfied with their economic situation reported being at increased risk for frailty. This highlights the potential importance of preventing fuel poverty to prevent frailty.","Twin CHCH Proteins, CHCHD2, and CHCHD10: Key Molecules of Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal Dementia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791515,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Mutations of coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) and 10 (CHCHD10) have been found to be linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and/or frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD). CHCHD2 and CHCHD10 proteins, which are homologous proteins with 54% identity in amino acid sequence, belong to the mitochondrial coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain protein family. A series of studies reveals that these twin proteins form a multimodal complex, producing a variety of pathophysiology by the disease-causing variants of these proteins. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge about the physiological and pathological roles of twin proteins, CHCHD2 and CHCHD10, in neurodegenerative diseases."

Their structures were elucidated via high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Together with 23 additional cytochalasans isolated from ascomata and mycelial cultures of different Ascomycota, they were tested on their ability to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of mammal cells in a preliminary structure⁻activity relationship study. Out of all structural features, the presence of hydroxyl group at the C7 and C18 residues, as well as their stereochemistry, were determined as important factors affecting the potential to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, reversibility of the actin disrupting effects was tested, revealing no direct correlations between potency and reversibility in the tested compound group. Since the diverse bioactivity of cytochalasans is interesting for various applications in eukaryotes, the exact effect on eukaryotic cells will need to be determined, e.g., by follow-up studies involving medicinal chemistry and by inclusion of additional natural cytochalasans. The results are also discussed in relation to previous studies in the literature, including a recent report on the anti-Biofilm activities of essentially the same panel of compounds against the pathogenic bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus.",Protecting Group-Free Synthesis of Glycopolymer-Type Amphiphilic Macromonomers and Their Use for the Preparation of Carbohydrate-Decorated Polymer Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791503,Biomolecules,2019 04 10,"Polymer particles modified with carbohydrates on their surfaces are of significant interest, because their specific recognition abilities to biomolecules are valuable for developing promising materials in biomedical fields. Carbohydrate-decorated core-shell polymer particles are expected to be efficiently prepared by dispersion polymerization using a glycopolymer-based amphiphilic macromonomer as both a polymeric steric stabilizer and a monomer. To create glycopolymer-type macromonomers, we propose a new strategy combining living cationic polymerization of an alkynyl-functionalized vinyl ether (VE), and the click reaction for the preparation of glycopolymers having a polymerizable terminal group, and investigate their dispersion copolymerization with styrene for generating carbohydrate-decorated polymer particles. This study deals with (i) the synthesis of block copolymer-type amphiphilic macromonomers bearing a methacryloyl group at the α-terminus, and pendant alkynyl groups by living cationic polymerization of alkynyl-substituted VE (VEEP), (ii) the derivatization of maltose-carrying macromonomers by click chemistry of the pendant alkynyl groups of the precursor macromonomers with maltosyl azide without any protecting/deprotecting processes, and (iii) the preparation of maltose-decorated (Mal-decorated) polymer particles through the dispersion copolymerization of glycopolymer-type macromonomers with styrene in polar media.

The aim was to report on young adults' experiences of receiving dietary feedback text messaging intervention. Diet was captured using an image-based 4-day mobile food recordTM application (mFRTM) and assessed to formulate two tailored feedback text messages on fruit and vegetables and energy-dense nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods and beverages. At 6-months 143 participants completed a second mFRTM and a questionnaire evaluating the dietary feedback. Participants who agreed the text messages made them think about how much vegetables they ate were more likely to increase their intake by at least half a serve than those who disagreed [odds ratio (OR) = 4.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.76 to 10.39]. Those who agreed the text messages made them think about how much EDNP foods they ate, were twice as likely to decrease their intake by over half a serve (OR = 2.39, 95%CI: 1.12 to 5.25) than those who disagreed. Undertaking detailed dietary assessment ensured the tailored feedback was constructive and relevant. Personal contemplation about vegetable and EDNP food intake appears to be a mediator of dietary change in young adults.",Wound Healing Fluid Reflects the Inflammatory Nature and Aggressiveness of Breast Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791501,Cells,2019 03 29,"Wound healing fluid that originates from breast surgery increases the aggressiveness of cancer cells that remain after the surgery. We determined the effects of the extent of surgery and tumor-driven remodeling of the surrounding microenvironment on the ability of wound-healing to promote breast cancer progression. In our analysis of a panel of 34 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in wound healing fluid, obtained from 27 breast carcinoma patients after surgery, the levels of several small molecules were associated with the extent of cellular damage that was induced by surgery. In addition, the composition of the resulting wound healing fluid was associated with molecular features of the removed tumor. Specifically, IP-10, IL-6, G-CSF, osteopontin, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and MCP1-MCAF were higher in more aggressive tumors. Altogether, our findings indicate that the release of factors that are induced by removal of the primary tumor and subsequent wound healing is influenced by the extent of damage due to surgery and the reactive stroma that is derived from the continuously evolving network of interactions between neoplastic cells and the microenvironment, based on the molecular characteristics of breast carcinoma cells.",Parallel Connected Generative Adversarial Network with Quadratic Operation for SAR Image Generation and Application for Classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791500,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Thanks to the availability of large-scale data, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have witnessed success in various applications of computer vision. However, the performance of CNNs on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image classification is unsatisfactory due to the lack of well-labeled SAR data, as well as the differences in imaging mechanisms between SAR images and optical images. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of SAR image classification by employing the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce more labeled SAR data. We propose special GANs for generating SAR images to be used in the training process. First, we incorporate the quadratic operation into the GAN, extending the convolution to make the discriminator better represent the SAR data; second, the statistical characteristics of SAR images are integrated into the GAN to make its value function more reasonable; finally, two types of parallel connected GANs are designed, one of which we call PWGAN, combining the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) together in the structure, and the other, which we call CNN-PGAN, applying a pre-trained CNN as a discriminator to the parallel GAN. Both PWGAN and CNN-PGAN consist of a number of discriminators and generators according to the number of target categories.

To model and to compensate for process variations, process sensors based on pixel source follower (SF)'s transconductance gm,SF have been proposed to model and to be compared against the measurement results of SF gain ASF. In addition, ASF's thermal dependency has been analyzed in detail. To provide thermal information required for temperature compensation, six scattered bipolar junction transistor (BJT)-based temperature sensors replace six image pixels inside the array. They are measured to have an untrimmed inaccuracy within ±0.5 ⁰C.

This paper presents a platform that has been implemented for realizing this vision. It leverages semantic web technologies to address the two key challenges in expanding the IoT beyond product silos into web-scale open ecosystems: data interoperability and resources identification and discovery. The paper provides extensive description of the proposed solution and its implementation details. Regarding the implementation details, it is important to highlight that the platform described in this paper is currently supporting the federation of eleven IoT deployments (from heterogeneous application domains) with over 10,000 IoT devices overall which produce hundreds of thousands of observations per day.",Profound Changes in Net Energy and Nitrogen Metabolites Fluxes within the Splanchnic Area during Overfeeding of Yucatan Mini Pigs That Remain Euglycemic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791497,Nutrients,2019 04 22,"A dysregulation of nutrient exchange between tissues (gut, liver, muscles, adipose) occurs during overnutrition and could induce obesity and metabolic diseases.

Pigs PA glycaemia and PP-induced hyperglycemia remained unchanged over the experimental period, suggesting that the management of the excess of energy intake allowed the maintenance of glucose levels. This was associated with (1) an increased PA plasma insulin, (2) an increased gut lactate production (increased lactate net release +89%, 1 h PP, D1 vs. D60) probably from an increased glucose oxidation, (3) a shift in utilization of gluconeogenic precursor (lactate, propionate) in the liver, and (4) a reduced gut utilization of nitrogen moieties for energy purposes (glutamine), a nitrogen sparing effect at the whole body level (decreased plasma urea in PA (-24% D1 vs. D60) and PP states) and a specific increased level of AA involved in lipids handling and bile recycling in the gut lumen (taurine and glycine).",Affinity of Electrochemically Deposited Sol⁻Gel Silica Films towards Catecholamine Neurotransmitters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791495,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine neurotransmitters can be detected by electrochemical oxidation in conventional electrodes.

These layers were morphologically and compositionally characterized using different techniques, such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), TEM, FTIR, or thermogravimetric analysis⁻mass spectrometry (TG-MS). The affinity of silica for neurotransmitters was evaluated, exclusively, by means of electrochemical methods. It was demonstrated that silica adsorbs dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, showing different interaction with silica pores. The adsorption process is dominated by a hydrogen bond between silanol groups located at the silica surface and the amine groups of neurotransmitters. Because of the different interaction with neurotransmitters, electrodes modified with silica films could be used in electrochemical sensors for the selective detection of such molecules.",Small Molecule Fluorescent Probes for G- Quadruplex Visualization as Potential Cancer Theranostic Agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791494,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"G-quadruplexes have gained prominence over the past two decades for their role in gene regulation, control of anti-tumour activity and ageing.

Although the radiosensitization effect was initially attributed to a physical mechanism, an increasing number of studies challenge this mechanistic hypothesis and evidence the importance of oxidative stress in this process. This work evidences the central role played by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in the GNP-induced radiosensitization. A cell type-dependent reduction in TrxR activity was measured in five different cell lines incubated with GNPs leading to differences in cell response to X-ray irradiation. Correlation analyses demonstrated that GNP uptake and TrxR activity inhibition are associated to a GNP radiosensitization effect. Finally, Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that high TrxR expression is correlated to low patient survival in four different types of cancer. Altogether, these results enable a better understanding of the GNP radiosensitization mechanism, which remains a mandatory step towards further use in clinic. Moreover, they highlight the potential application of this new treatment in a personalized medicine context.",Design and Validation with Influenza A Virus of an Aerosol Transmission Chamber for Ferrets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791478,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Background: The importance of aerosols in the spread of viruses like influenza is still a subject of debate. Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets. Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.",Extrinsic or Intrinsic Apoptosis by Curcumin and Light: Still a Mystery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791477,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Curcumin-a rhizomal phytochemical from the plant Curcuma longa-is well known to inhibit cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in a broad range of cell lines. In previous studies we showed that combining low curcumin concentrations and subsequent ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) or VIS irradiation induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. There is still debate whether curcumin induces apoptosis via the extrinsic or the intrinsic pathway. To address this question, we investigated in three epithelial cell lines (HaCaT, A431, A549) whether the death receptors CD95, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor I and II are involved in apoptosis induced by light and curcumin. Cells were incubated with 0.25⁻0.5 µg/mL curcumin followed by irradiation with 1 J/cm² UVA. This treatment was combined with inhibitors specific for distinct membrane-bound death receptors. After 24 h apoptosis induction was monitored by quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA-fragments. Validation of our test system showed that apoptosis induced by CH11 and TNF-α could be completely inhibited by their respective antagonists. Interestingly, apoptosis induced by curcumin/light treatment was reversed by none of the herein examined death receptor antagonists. These results indicate a mechanism of action independent from classical death receptors speaking for intrinsic activation of apoptosis. It could be speculated that a shift in cellular redox balance might prompt the pro-apoptotic processes.",Exploring RGB+Depth Fusion for Real-Time Object Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791476,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"In this paper, we investigate whether fusing depth information on top of normal RGB data for camera-based object detection can help to increase the performance of current state-of-the-art single-shot detection networks. Indeed, depth sensing is easily acquired using depth cameras such as a Kinect or stereo setups. We investigate the optimal manner to perform this sensor fusion with a special focus on lightweight single-pass convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling real-time processing on limited hardware. For this, we implement a network architecture allowing us to parameterize at which network layer both information sources are fused together. We performed exhaustive experiments to determine the optimal fusion point in the network, from which we can conclude that fusing towards the mid to late layers provides the best results. Our best fusion models significantly outperform the baseline RGB network in both accuracy and localization of the detections.",Influence of Abscisic Acid-Biosynthesis Inhibitor Fluridone on the Feeding Behavior and Fecundity of Nilaparvata lugens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791475,Insects,2019 04 01,"Fluridone (FLU) was a pyrrolidone herbicide that was used for selective weeding in wheat, rice, corn and pasture and was also a biosynthesis inhibitor of abscisic acid (ABA), a significant plant hormone. ABA-promoted callose deposition facilitates rice resistance to pests but whether FLU had the opposite influence was unknown. The effects of FLU on the feeding behavior of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stål; BPH), after feeding with rice plants treated with FLU, were studied, using an electrical penetration graph (EPG). For susceptible rice cultivar (TN1), the duration for which BPH sucked phloem sap (N4 wave duration) after 15 μmol/L of FLU treatment was longer than that of the control but decreased after 30 and 60 μmol/L FLU treatments. Fecundity of BPH treated with 15 μmol/L FLU had no significant change, while the deposition area of callose was significantly decreased. For moderately-resistant rice cultivar (IR42), no differences in BPH feeding behavior and fecundity were observed but the deposition area of callose declined after treated with 15 μmol/L of FLU. These findings suggested that a low concentration of FLU (15 μmol/L) promoted BPH feeding behavior in TN1 but not in IR42 and the response in IR42 appeared to be more complicated, which provided supplementary evidence that ABA promoted plant resistance to BPH.","Phytochemicals of Cinnamomi Cortex: Cinnamic Acid, but not Cinnamaldehyde, Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Cold and Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791474,Nutrients,2019 04 22,"A chemotherapy drug, oxaliplatin, induces cold and mechanical hypersensitivity, but effective treatments for this neuropathic pain without side effects are still lacking. We previously showed that Cinnamomi Cortex suppresses oxaliplatin-induced pain behaviors in rats. However, it remains unknown which phytochemical of Cinnamomi Cortex plays a key role in that analgesic action. Thus, here we investigated whether and how cinnamic acid or cinnamaldehyde, major components of Cinnamomi Cortex, alleviates cold and mechanical allodynia induced by a single oxaliplatin injection (6 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Using an acetone test and the von Frey test for measuring cold and mechanical allodynia, respectively, we found that administration of cinnamic acid, but not cinnamaldehyde, at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (i.p.) significantly attenuates the allodynic behaviors in oxaliplatin-injected rats with the strongest effect being observed at 20 mg/kg. Our in vivo extracellular recordings also showed that cinnamic acid (20 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibits the increased activities of spinal wide dynamic range neurons in response to cutaneous mechanical and cold stimuli following the oxaliplatin injection. These results indicate that cinnamic acid has an effective analgesic action against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain through inhibiting spinal pain transmission, suggesting its crucial role in mediating the effect of Cinnamomi Cortex.",Micrometric Wrinkled Patterns Spontaneously Formed on Hydrogel Thin Films via Argon Plasma Exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791473,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"The generation of microstructured patterns on the surface of a specific polymeric material could radically improve their performance in a particular application. Most of the interactions with the environment occur at the material interface; therefore, increasing the exposed active surface considerably improves their range of application. In this article, a simple and reliable protocol to form spontaneous wrinkled patterns using a hydrogel layer is reported. For this purpose, we took advantage of the doctor blade technique in order to generate homogenous films over solid substrates with controlled thickness and large coverage. The hydrogel wrinkle formation involves a prepolymerization step which produces oligomers leading to a solution with increased viscosity, enough for doctor blade deposition. Subsequently, the material was exposed to vacuum and plasma to trigger wrinkled pattern formation. Finally, a UV-polymerization treatment was applied to fix the undulations on top. Interestingly, the experimental parameters allowed us to finely tune the wrinkle characteristics (period, amplitude, and orientation). For this study, two main aspects were explored. The first one is related to the role of the substrate functionalization on the wrinkle formation. The second study correlates the deswelling time and its relationship with the dimensions and distribution of the wrinkle pattern. In the first batch, four different 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TSM) concentrations were used to functionalize the substrate in order to enhance the adhesion between hydrogel film and the substrate. The wrinkles formed were characterized in terms of wrinkle amplitude, wavelength, pattern roughness, and surface Young modulus, by using AFM in imaging and force spectroscopy modes. Moreover, the chemical composition of the hydrogel film cross-section and the effect of the plasma treatment were analyzed with confocal Raman spectroscopy. These results demonstrated that an oxidized layer was formed on top of the hydrogel films due to the exposure to an argon plasma.",Inferring Drug-Protein⁻Side Effect Relationships from Biomedical Text.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791472,Genes,2019 03 29,"Although there are many studies of drugs and their side effects, the underlying mechanisms of these side effects are not well understood.

This study examines stakeholder perspectives on the process, performance, and outcome of the AFC program. A 53-item questionnaire was developed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, including mechanisms and processes (20 items), outcome evaluations (23 items), and resource integration (10 items). There was a ""great difference"" found among scores between facilitators and experts for ""inter-exchange experience with local and international cities"" (40%) and ""monitor and revise indicators"" (37%) in mechanisms and processes, ""evaluate performance of indicators and action plans"" (37%) in outcome evaluations, and ""interaction between government and community"" (46%) and ""interaction between civil organization and senior society"" (39%) in resource integration. Clearly, facilitators showed overly optimistic assessments in AFC mechanisms and processes, outcome evaluation, and resource integration. The results showed disconnect between experts' expectations versus actual practice conducted by facilitators. Implications of these findings are to integrate top down expectations with the realities of bottom up practice to design more realistic evaluations; continue to educate stakeholders about design, implementation and evaluation; and further integrate resources from government, civil organizations, and community.",A Magnesium Transport Protein Related to Mammalian SLC41 and Bacterial MgtE Contributes to Circadian Timekeeping in a Unicellular Green Alga.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791470,Genes,2019 03 29,"Circadian clocks in eukaryotes involve both transcriptional-translational feedback loops, post-translational regulation, and metabolic, non-transcriptional oscillations. We recently identified the involvement of circadian oscillations in the intracellular concentrations of magnesium ions (Mg2+i) that were conserved in three eukaryotic kingdoms. Mg2+i in turn contributes to transcriptional clock properties of period and amplitude, and can function as a zeitgeber to define phase. However, the mechanism-or mechanisms-responsible for the generation of Mg2+i oscillations, and whether these are functionally conserved across taxonomic groups, remain elusive. We employed the cellular clock model Ostreococcustauri to provide a first study of an MgtE domain-containing protein in the green lineage. OtMgtE shares homology with the mammalian SLC41A1 magnesium/sodium antiporter, which has previously been implicated in maintaining clock period. Using genetic overexpression, we found that OtMgtE contributes to both timekeeping and daily changes in Mg2+i. However, pharmacological experiments and protein sequence analyses indicated that critical differences exist between OtMgtE and either the ancestral MgtE channel or the mammalian SLC41 antiporters. We concluded that even though MgtE domain-containing proteins are only distantly related, these proteins retain a shared role in contributing to cellular timekeeping and the regulation of Mg2+i."

Carcinogen-Induced cMDI Models: Characterization and Cancer Therapeutic Approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791458,Cancers,2019 02 22,"In this second study, we established syngeneic in vivo models named carcinogen-induced mouse-derived isografts (cMDIs). Carcinogen-induced tumors were obtained during short-term observation (3⁻9 months) of CBA/J mice treated with various administration routes with 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) or N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) as carcinogens. During necropsy, primary tumors and suspicious tissues were assessed macroscopically and re-transplanted (in PDX-like manner) into sex-matched syngeneic animals. Outgrowing tumors were histologically characterized as either spinocellular carcinoma (1/8) or various differentiated sarcomas (7/8). Growth curves of four sarcomas showed striking heterogeneity. These cMDIs were further characterized by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, or efficacy studies. A variable invasion of immune cells into the tumors, as well as varying expression of tyrosine kinase receptor, IFN-γ signature, or immune cell population marker genes could be observed. Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (anti-mPD-1, anti-mCTLA-4, or a combination thereof) showed different responses in the various cMDI models. In general, cMDI models are carcinogen-induced tumors of low passage number that were propagated as tissue pieces in mice without any tissue culturing. Therefore, the tumors contained conserved tumor characteristics and intratumoral immune cell populations. In contrast to the previously described spontaneous MDI, carcinogen induction resulted in a greater number of individual but histologically related tumors, which were preferentially sarcomas.",Hand Hygiene Compliance Study at a Large Central Hospital in Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791457,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Lack of proper hand hygiene among healthcare workers has been identified as a core facilitator of hospital-acquired infections. Although the concept of hand hygiene quality assurance was introduced to Vietnam relatively recently, it has now become a national focus in an effort to improve the quality of care. Nonetheless, barriers such as resources, lack of education, and cultural norms may be limiting factors for this concept to be properly practiced. Our study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers toward hand hygiene and to identify barriers to compliance, as per the World Health Organization's guidelines, through surveys at a large medical center in Vietnam. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the compliance rate across different hospital departments and the roles of healthcare workers through direct observation. Results showed that, in general, healthcare workers had good knowledge of hand hygiene guidelines, but not all believed in receiving reminders from patients. The barriers to compliance were identified as: limited resources, patient overcrowding, shortage of staff, allergic reactions to hand sanitizers, and lack of awareness. The overall compliance was 31%; physicians had the lowest rate of compliance at 15%, while nurses had the highest rate at 39%; internal medicine had the lowest rate at 16%, while the intensive care unit had the highest rate at 40%. In summary, it appears that addressing cultural attitudes in addition to enforcing repetitive quality assurance and assessment programs are needed to ensure adherence to safe hand washing.",Prediction of Lower Flammability Limits for Binary Hydrocarbon Gases by Quantitative Structure-A Property Relationship Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791456,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"The lower flammability limit (LFL) is one of the most important parameters for evaluating the fire and explosion hazards of flammable gases or vapors. This study proposed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models to predict the LFL of binary hydrocarbon gases from their molecular structures. Twelve different mixing rules were employed to derive mixture descriptors for describing the structures characteristics of a series of 181 binary hydrocarbon mixtures. Genetic algorithm (GA)-based multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to select the most statistically effective mixture descriptors on the LFL of binary hydrocarbon gases. A total of 12 multilinear models were obtained based on the different mathematical formulas. The best model, issued from the norm of the molar contribution formula, was achieved as a six-parameter model. The best model was then rigorously validated using multiple strategies and further extensively compared to the previously published model. The results demonstrated the robustness, validity, and satisfactory predictivity of the proposed model. The applicability domain (AD) of the model was defined as well. The proposed best model would be expected to present an alternative to predict the LFL values of existing or new binary hydrocarbon gases, and provide some guidance for prioritizing the design of safer blended gases with desired properties.",Protein Phosphatases-A Touchy Enemy in the Battle Against Glioblastomas: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791455,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor arising from brain parenchyma. Although many efforts have been made to develop therapies for GBM, the prognosis still remains poor, mainly because of the difficulty in total resection of the tumor mass from brain tissue and the resistance of the residual tumor against standard chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, novel adjuvant therapies are urgently needed. Recent genome-wide analyses of GBM cases have clarified molecular signaling mechanisms underlying GBM biology. However, results of clinical trials targeting phosphorylation-mediated signaling have been unsatisfactory to date. Protein phosphatases are enzymes that antagonize phosphorylation signaling by dephosphorylating phosphorylated signaling molecules. Recently, the critical roles of phosphatases in the regulation of oncogenic signaling in malignant tumor cells have been reported, and tumorigenic roles of deregulated phosphatases have been demonstrated in GBM. However, a detailed mechanism underlying phosphatase-mediated signaling transduction in the regulation of GBM has not been elucidated, and such information is necessary to apply phosphatases as a therapeutic target for GBM. This review highlights and summarizes the phosphatases that have crucial roles in the regulation of oncogenic signaling in GBM cells.",Plasmid-Mediated Colistin Resistance in Salmonella enterica: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791454,Microorganisms,2019 03 29,"Colistin is widely used in food-animal production. Salmonella enterica is a zoonotic pathogen, which can pass from animal to human microbiota through the consumption of contaminated food, and cause disease, often severe, especially in young children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Recently, plasmid-mediated colistin resistance was recognised; mcr-like genes are being identified worldwide. Colistin is not an antibiotic used to treat Salmonella infections, but has been increasingly used as one of the last treatment options for carbapenem resistant Enterobacteria in human infections. The finding of mobilizable mcr-like genes became a global concern due to the possibility of horizontal transfer of the plasmid that often carry resistance determinants to beta-lactams and/or quinolones. An understanding of the origin and dissemination of mcr-like genes in zoonotic pathogens such as S. enterica will facilitate the management of colistin use and target interventions to prevent further spread. The main objective of this review was to collect epidemiological data about mobilized colistin resistance in S. enterica, describing the mcr variants, identified serovars, origin of the isolate, country and other resistance genes located in the same genetic platform.",Antennal Morphology and Sexual Dimorphism of Antennal Sensilla in Callitettix versicolor (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Cercopidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791453,Insects,2019 04 01,"The rice spittlebug Callitettix versicolor (Fabricius) is an important pest of rice and maize in South Asia and causes severe economic damage. To provide background information for chemical ecology studies, the fine morphology of antennae and the types and distribution of the sensilla on the male and female antennae of Callitettix versicolor (Fabricius) are investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results show that the antenna is filiform and composed of three segments: a scape, a pedicel, and a flagellum. The female antennae are slightly shorter than the male antennae. In both sexes, four types and nine subtypes of sensilla were observed: sensilla basiconica (SB1, SB2), sensilla campaniformia (SCa1, SCa2 and SCa3), sensilla coeloconica (SCo1, SCo2 and SCo3) and sensilla trichodea (ST). In addition, sensilla coeloconica (SCo1) are observed on the membrane of the top of the pedicel in Cercopidae for the first time. Sexual dimorphism mainly occurs in variation in the number of sensilla coeloconica (SCo2, SCo3) on the bulb-shaped portion of the flagellum and in the shape of sensilla basiconica (SB2). There are significantly more sensilla coeloconica in males than in females. The external structure and distribution of these sensilla are compared to those of other cercopids and possible functions of the antennal sensilla are discussed.",Reducing Racial Inequities in Health: Using What We Already Know to Take Action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791452,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"This paper provides an overview of the scientific evidence pointing to critically needed steps to reduce racial inequities in health. First, it argues that communities of opportunity should be developed to minimize some of the adverse impacts of systemic racism. These are communities that provide early childhood development resources, implement policies to reduce childhood poverty, provide work and income support opportunities for adults, and ensure healthy housing and neighborhood conditions. Second, the healthcare system needs new emphases on ensuring access to high quality care for all, strengthening preventive health care approaches, addressing patients' social needs as part of healthcare delivery, and diversifying the healthcare work force to more closely reflect the demographic composition of the patient population. Finally, new research is needed to identify the optimal strategies to build political will and support to address social inequities in health. This will include initiatives to raise awareness levels of the pervasiveness of inequities in health, build empathy and support for addressing inequities, enhance the capacity of individuals and communities to actively participate in intervention efforts and implement large scale efforts to reduce racial prejudice, ideologies, and stereotypes in the larger culture that undergird policy preferences that initiate and sustain inequities.",The Effects of Resveratrol in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease and Heart Failure: A Narrative Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791450,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death globally and responsible for the second highest number of deaths in Canada. Medical advancements in the treatment of CVD have led to patients living longer with CVD but often progressing to another condition called heart failure (HF). As a result, HF has emerged in the last decade as a major medical concern. Fortunately, various ""traditional"" pharmacotherapies for HF exist and have shown success in reducing HF-associated mortality. However, to augment the treatment of patients with CVD and/or HF, alternative pharmacotherapies using nutraceuticals have also shown promise in the prevention and treatment of these two conditions. One of these natural compounds considered to potentially help treat HF and CVD and prevent their development is resveratrol. Herein, we review the clinical findings of resveratrol's ability to be used as an effective treatment to potentially help treat HF and CVD.

Although collision-induced dissociation (CID)-based tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is commonly applied for identification and quantification of cystine in both biomedical and nutritional studies, gas-phase fragmentation reactions of cystine in CID has remained unclear. This may lead to improper assay design, which may in turn result in inaccurate test results. In the present study, gas-phase fragmentation reactions of protonated cystine in CID were characterized using high-resolution MS/MS and pseudo MS³. Fragmentations started from cleavages of disulfide bond (S⁻S) and carbon⁻sulfur bond (C⁻S). When cleaving at the S⁻S, protonated cysteine was generated as one of the predominant fragmentation products. Minor fragmentations started from the loss of H₂O + CO and the loss of NH₃. Our results reveal that the m/z 74 fragment ion, which is commonly used as a product ion of the transition (precursor/product ion pair) in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay for quantifying cystine, comprises two isobaric fragments originating from different parts of cystine. This indicates the need for careful selection of a stable isotope-labeled cystine molecule as an internal standard for SRM assays. Here, we provide a clear picture of the fragmentation reactions of protonated cystine in CID. It can serve as a useful guidance for designing MS/MS-based assays for cystine testing."

It is essential to study their roles in myogenesis. In our previous sequencing data, both miR-30a-3p and circular HIPK3 (circHIPK3) RNA, which are produced by the third exon of the HIPK3 gene, were differentially expressed among chicken skeletal muscles at 11 embryo age (E11), 16 embryo age (E16), and 1-day post-hatch (P1). Here, we investigated their potential roles in myogenesis. Proliferation experiment showed that miR-30a-3p could inhibit the proliferation of myoblast. Through dual-luciferase assay and Myosin heavy chain (MYHC) immunofluorescence, we found that miR-30a-3p could inhibit the differentiation of myoblast by binding to Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 C (MEF2C), which could promote the differentiation of myoblast. Then, we found that circHIPK3 could act as a sponge of miR-30a-3p and exerted a counteractive effect of miR-30a-3p by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. Taking together, our data suggested that circHIPK3 could promote the chicken embryonic skeletal muscle development by sponging miR-30a-3p.",Acoustic Field Characterization of Medical Array Transducers Based on Unfocused Transmits and Single-Plane Hydrophone Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791437,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Medical ultrasonic arrays are typically characterized in controlled water baths using measurements by a hydrophone, which can be translated with a positioning stage. Characterization of 3D acoustic fields conventionally requires measurements at each spatial location, which is tedious and time-consuming, and may be prohibitive given limitations of experimental setup (e.g., the bath and stage) and measurement equipment (i.e., the hydrophone). Moreover, with the development of new ultrasound sequences and modalities, multiple measurements are often required to characterize each imaging mode to ensure performance and clinical safety. Acoustic holography allows efficient characterization of source transducer fields based on single plane measurements. In this work, we explore the applicability of a re-radiation method based on the Rayleigh⁻Sommerfeld integral to medical imaging array characterization. We show that source fields can be reconstructed at single crystal level at wavelength resolution, based on far-field measurements. This is herein presented for three practical application scenarios: for identifying faulty transducer elements; for characterizing acoustic safety parameters in focused ultrasound sequences from 2D planar measurements; and for estimating arbitrary focused fields based on calibration from an unfocused sound field and software beamforming. The results experimentally show that the acquired pressure fields closely match those estimated using our technique.",Effect of Selected Stilbenoids on Human Fecal Microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791436,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"Dietary phenolics or polyphenols are mostly metabolized by the human gut microbiota.

This study explored the effect of six stilbenoids (batatasin III, oxyresveratrol, piceatannol, pinostilbene, resveratrol, thunalbene) on the gut microbiota composition. Stilbenoids were anaerobically fermented with fecal bacteria from four donors, samples were collected at 0 and 24 h, and effects on the microbiota were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical tests identified affected microbes at three taxonomic levels. Observed microbial composition modulation by stilbenoids included a decrease in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, a decrease in the relative abundance of strains from the genus Clostridium, and effects on the family Lachnospiraceae. A frequently observed effect was a further decrease of the relative abundance when compared to the control. An opposite effect to the control was observed for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose relative abundance increased. Observed effects were more frequently attributed to resveratrol and piceatannol, followed by thunalbene and batatasin III.",Function and Role of ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters as Receptors for 3D-Cry Toxins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791434,Toxins,2019 04 02,"When ABC transporter family C2 (ABCC2) and ABC transporter family B1 (ABCB1) were heterologously expressed in non-susceptible cultured cells, the cells swelled in response to Cry1A and Cry3 toxins, respectively. Consistent with the notion that 3D-Cry toxins form cation-permeable pores, Bombyx mori ABCC2 (BmABCC2) facilitated cation-permeable pore formation by Cry1A when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, BmABCC2 had a high binding affinity (KD) to Cry1Aa of 3.1 × 10-10 M. These findings suggest that ABC transporters, including ABCC2 and ABCB1, are functional receptors for 3D-Cry toxins. In addition, the Cry2 toxins most distant from Cry1A toxins on the phylogenetic tree used ABC transporter A2 as a receptor. These data suggest that 3D-Cry toxins use ABC transporters as receptors. In terms of inducing cell swelling, ABCC2 has greater activity than cadherin-like receptor. The pore opening of ABC transporters was hypothesized to be linked to their receptor function, but this was repudiated by experiments using mutants deficient in export activity. The synergistic relationship between ABCC2 and cadherin-like receptor explains their ability to cause resistance in one species of insect.",Comparison of Frictional Properties of CVD-Grown MoS₂ and Graphene Films under Dry Sliding Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791433,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"In the present study, dry friction and wear properties of atomically thin CVD-grown graphene and MoS₂ films on SiO₂/Si substrates were compared at low (72 MPa) and high (378 MPa) contact pressures. Analysis of atomic force microscopy images of these films verified that the MoS₂ films, which were directly grown on the SiO₂/Si substrates, had clean surfaces and made conformal contacts with the substrates. In contrast, the graphene film showed many contaminants on its surface and was loosely bonded with its SiO₂/Si substrate due to its wet transfer from a Cu foil to the substrate. The MoS₂ film exhibited friction and wear properties superior to those of the graphene film both at low and high contact pressures. We found that the clean sliding surface and strong bonding with SiO₂/Si were the main causes of the superiority of the MoS₂ film compared to the graphene film. Mild wear occurred in a layer-by-layer fashion at low contact pressure for the MoS₂ film. At high contact pressure, severe wear occurred due to failure at the boundary between the MoS₂ films and the underlying substrates. At both contact pressures, friction did not increase immediately after the removal of the MoS₂ film from the SiO₂/Si substrate because the film transferred onto the counter sliding surface and served as a lubricant.",Machine Learning Approach for Determining the Formation of β-Lactam Antibiotic Complexes with Cyclodextrins Using Multispectral Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791432,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"The problem of determining the formation of complexes of β-lactam antibiotics with cyclodextrins (CDs) and the interactions involved in this process were addressed by machine learning on multispectral images. Complexes of β-lactam antibiotics, including cefuroxime axetil, cefetamet pivoxil, and pivampicillin, as well as CDs, including αCD, βCD, γCD, hydroxypropyl-αCD, methyl-βCD, hydroxypropyl-βCD, and hydroxypropyl-γCD, were prepared in all combinations. Thermograms confirming the formation of cyclodextrin complexes were obtained using differential scanning calorimetry. Transmission Fourier-transform infrared (tFTIR) and complementary attenuated total reflectance FTIR (ATR) coupled with machine learning were techniques chosen as a nondestructive alternative. The machine learning algorithm was used to determine the formation of complexes in samples using solely their tFTIR and ATR spectra at the prediction stage. Parameterized method 7 (PM7) was used to support the analysis by molecular modeling of the complexes. The model developed through machine learning properly distinguished samples with formed complexes form noncomplexed samples with a cross-validation accuracy of 90.4%. Analysis of the contribution of spectral bands to the model indicated interactions of ester groups of β-lactam antibiotics with CDs, as well as some interactions of cephem ring in cefetamet pivoxil and penam moiety in pivampicillin.

Specifically, androgen receptor activation appears to be associated with increased risks of developing ovarian cancer and inducing tumor progression. However, conflicting findings have also been reported. This review summarizes and discusses the available data indicating the involvement of androgens as well as androgen receptor and related signals in ovarian carcinogenesis and cancer growth. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms for androgen receptor functions in ovarian cancer remain far from being fully understood, current observations may offer effective chemopreventive and therapeutic approaches, via modulation of androgen receptor activity, against ovarian cancer. Indeed, several clinical trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.",A Short Review on the Role of the Metal-Graphene Hybrid Nanostructure in Promoting the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791430,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) sensors have potential applications in essential and important areas such as bio-sensor technology, especially in medical applications and gas sensors in environmental monitoring applications. Figure of Merit (FOM) and Sensitivity (S) measurements are two ways to assess the performance of an LSPR sensor. However, LSPR sensors suffer low FOM compared to the conventional Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensor due to high losses resulting from radiative damping of LSPs waves. Different methodologies have been utilized to enhance the performance of LSPR sensors, including various geometrical and material parameters, plasmonic wave coupling from different structures, and integration of noble metals with graphene, which is the focus of this report. Recent studies of metal-graphene hybrid plasmonic systems have shown its capability of promoting the performance of the LSPR sensor to a level that enhances its chance for commercialization. In this review, fundamental physics, the operation principle, and performance assessment of the LSPR sensor are presented followed by a discussion of plasmonic materials and a summary of methods used to optimize the sensor's performance. A focused review on metal-graphene hybrid nanostructure and a discussion of its role in promoting the performance of the LSPR sensor follow.",The Effects of Criminal Punishment on Medical Practices in the Medical Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791428,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Recently, there have been cases in which doctors were criminally convicted for misdiagnosing a patient with constipation who then died of diaphragmatic hernia. The criminal punishment of doctors could create a side effect of reduced medical practitioners. This study analyzed the impact of medical disputes and deduced a plan to create a stable composition of the medical environment. An online survey was conducted with 79,022 doctors who are members of the Korea Medical Association. A total of 3109 responses were obtained, and the analysis used the questionnaire system of the Doctor's News online survey system. The results demonstrated that doctors have become more psychologically inclined to prescribe overtreatments, avoidance treatments, and defensive treatments. Also, it was found that specialized agencies for medical appraisals were necessary. In order to resolve medical disputes objectively, it is necessary to improve credibility by securing the expertise of the Korea Medical Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Agency. In addition, there is a need for specialized agencies to undertake the medical appraisals and training of medical staff to build up their understanding of medical disputes. Thus, medical disputes can be minimized, and the fairness of medical dispute results can be strengthened.",Food Trucks: Assessment of an Evaluation Instrument Designed for the Prevention of Foodborne Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791427,Nutrients,2019 04 22,"This study aimed to validate an evaluation instrument for food trucks (FTs) regarding its internal consistency and to establish a score classification according to the food contamination probability assessment. The instrument was applied in 44 food trucks (convenience sample), along with microbial analysis, in the Federal District, Brazil. After its application, sample collection and statistical analysis, the evaluation instrument was reduced to a 22-item final version. FTs were divided into three groups according to their ready-to-eat foods. Food trucks from Group A (hot and cold sandwiches) presented the highest percentage of contamination. The lowest percentage of contamination was observed in food trucks from Group C (regional and international cuisine). The application of the validated evaluation instrument to the 44 food trucks revealed that none achieved 100% adequacy. The reproducibility analysis exhibited an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) value of 0.780 (CI 95%: 0.597; 0.880), indicating good reproducibility of the instrument. The reliability assessment presented a Kuder⁻Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) value of 0.627 and a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.634, indicating good internal consistency. The proposed classification score was obtained by assigning 1 point for each item with an inadequate response, and the final score may vary between 0 and 20 points. Food trucks with up to 11 points exhibit low probability of contamination and low risk of foodborne diseases, while food trucks scoring 12 or more points exhibit a high probability of contamination and high risk of foodborne diseases. The evaluation instrument will allow effective assessment of the hygienic⁻sanitary practices and conditions of food trucks and potentially ensure consumers' access to safe food."

Effective therapies against neurodegenerative disorders can be developed by regulating the ""self-defense"" equipment of neurons, such as autophagy. Through the degradation and recycling of the intracellular content, autophagy promotes neuron survival in conditions of trophic factor deprivation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage, or accumulation of misfolded proteins. Autophagy involves the activation of self-digestive pathways, which is different for dynamics (macro, micro and chaperone-mediated autophagy), or degraded material (mitophagy, lysophagy, aggrephagy). All neurodegenerative disorders share common pathogenic mechanisms, including the impairment of autophagic flux, which causes the inability to remove the neurotoxic oligomers of misfolded proteins. Pharmacological activation of autophagy is typically achieved by blocking the kinase activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) enzymatic complex 1 (mTORC1), removing its autophagy suppressor activity observed under physiological conditions; acting in this way, rapamycin provided the first proof of principle that pharmacological autophagy enhancement can induce neuroprotection through the facilitation of oligomers' clearance. The demand for effective disease-modifying strategies against neurodegenerative disorders is currently stimulating the development of a wide number of novel molecules, as well as the re-evaluation of old drugs for their pro-autophagic potential.",Performance of Toluene Removal in a Nonthermal Plasma Catalysis System over Flake-Like HZSM-5 Zeolite with Tunable Pore Size and Evaluation of Its Byproducts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791415,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"In this study, a series of HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by the chemical liquid-phase deposition method, and low concentration toluene degradation was carried out in an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), SEM, TEM, and N₂ adsorption analysis techniques. In addition, several organic contaminants were used to evaluate the adsorption performance of the prepared catalysts, and the effect of pore size on the removal efficiency of toluene and byproduct formation was also investigated. The unmodified HZSM-5 zeolite (Z0) exhibited good performance in toluene removal and CO₂ selectivity due to the diffusion resistance of ozone and the amounts of active species (OH• and O•). Meanwhile, the time of flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) result showed that there were more byproducts of the benzene ring in the gas phase under the action of small micropore size catalysts. Moreover, the surface byproducts were detected by gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS).",A Human⁻Machine Interface Based on Eye Tracking for Controlling and Monitoring a Smart Home Using the Internet of Things.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791414,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"People with severe disabilities may have difficulties when interacting with their home devices due to the limitations inherent to their disability. Simple home activities may even be impossible for this group of people. Although much work has been devoted to proposing new assistive technologies to improve the lives of people with disabilities, some studies have found that the abandonment of such technologies is quite high. This work presents a new assistive system based on eye tracking for controlling and monitoring a smart home, based on the Internet of Things, which was developed following concepts of user-centered design and usability. With this system, a person with severe disabilities was able to control everyday equipment in her residence, such as lamps, television, fan, and radio. In addition, her caregiver was able to monitor remotely, by Internet, her use of the system in real time. Additionally, the user interface developed here has some functionalities that allowed improving the usability of the system as a whole. The experiments were divided into two steps. In the first step, the assistive system was assembled in an actual home where tests were conducted with 29 participants without disabilities. In the second step, the system was tested with online monitoring for seven days by a person with severe disability (end-user), in her own home, not only to increase convenience and comfort, but also so that the system could be tested where it would in fact be used. At the end of both steps, all the participants answered the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, which showed that both the group of participants without disabilities and the person with severe disabilities evaluated the assistive system with mean scores of 89.9 and 92.5, respectively.",A Novel Antenna for Partial Discharge Measurements in GIS Based on Magnetic Field Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791413,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"This paper presents a new concept for partial discharge measurements in gas insulated systems (GIS).

The foundations of the measurement technique and the magnetic antenna design are presented together with laboratory measurements. The magnetic antenna performance and the sensitivity of the acquisition system are studied. The bandwidth of the measurement system is in the high frequency and very high frequency (HF⁻VHF) range. Laboratory experiments demonstrate the suitability of the novel magnetic antenna-based measuring system for PD in GIS for corona, surface discharges, and free moving particles in SF₆.","Swiss Cheese Flavor Variability Based on Correlations of Volatile Flavor Compounds, Descriptive Sensory Attributes, and Consumer Preference.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791411,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Minimizing flavor variation in cheeses without perceived flavor defects in order to produce a consistent product is a challenge in the Swiss cheese industry. This study evaluated flavor variability based on correlations of volatile flavor compounds and sensory attributes. The headspace concentrations of volatile compounds were analyzed using selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), while the sensory attributes were evaluated using descriptive sensory analysis and consumer testing. The important discriminating volatile compounds were classified into five functional groups: sulfur-containing compounds (methyl mercaptan, hydrogen sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and methional), organic acids (propanoic acid, acetic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid), aldehydes (3-methylbutanal, butanal, and 2-methylpropanal), a ketone (2,3-butanedione), and an ester (ethyl hexanoate). Correlations were identified among volatile compounds and between volatile compounds and sensory attributes. Only a small number of volatile compounds strongly correlated positively or negatively to a specific sensory attribute. Nutty malty, milkfat lactone, salty, umami, and sweet positively correlated to overall liking and nutty flavor liking of Swiss cheese. Evaluation of cheese flavor using correlations between volatile compounds and sensory attributes provided further understanding of the complexity of flavor and flavor variability among Swiss cheeses manufactured from different factories that can be used to improve flavor consistency of Swiss cheeses.",Enhanced Ability of Oligomeric Nanobodies Targeting MERS Coronavirus Receptor-Binding Domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791410,Viruses,2019 05 08,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an infectious coronavirus first reported in 2012, has a mortality rate greater than 35%. Therapeutic antibodies are key tools for preventing and treating MERS-CoV infection, but to date no such agents have been approved for treatment of this virus. Nanobodies (Nbs) are camelid heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments. We generated two oligomeric Nbs by linking two or three monomeric Nbs (Mono-Nbs) targeting the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared their RBD-binding affinity, RBD⁻receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Relative to Mono-Nb, dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) had significantly greater ability to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without mutations in the RBD, thereby potently blocking RBD⁻MERS-CoV receptor binding. The engineered oligomeric Nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. Importantly, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel MERS-CoV strains isolated in different countries and years. Overall, the engineered Nbs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infection.",QuantIF: An ImageJ Macro to Automatically Determine the Percentage of Infected Cells after Immunofluorescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791409,Viruses,2019 04 02,"Counting labeled cells, after immunofluorescence or expression of a genetically fluorescent reporter protein, is frequently used to quantify viral infection.

For this reason, we have developed QuantIF, an ImageJ macro that automatically determines the total number of cells and the number of labeled cells from two images of the same field, using DAPI- and specific-stainings, respectively. QuantIF can automatically analyze hundreds of images, taking approximately one second for each field. It is freely available as supplementary data online at MDPI.com and has been developed using ImageJ, a free image processing program that can run on any computer with a Java virtual machine, which is distributed for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is routinely used in our labs to quantify viral infections in vitro, but can easily be used for other applications that require quantification of labeled cells.",Carotenoid Biosynthesis in Oriental Melon (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791408,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Full-length cDNAs encoding ξ-carotene desaturase (CmZDS), lycopene ε-cyclase (CmLCYE), β-ring carotene hydroxylase (CmCHXB), and zeaxanthin epoxidase (CmZEP), and partial-length cDNA encoding ε-ring carotene hydroxylase (CmCHXE) were isolated in Chamoe (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa), an important commercial fruit. Sequence analyses revealed that these proteins share high identity and common features with other orthologous genes. Expression levels of entire genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were investigated in the peel, pulp, and stalk of chamoe cultivars Ohbokggul and Gotgam. Most of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes were expressed at their highest levels in the stalk, whereas carotenoids were highly distributed in the peel. The expression levels of all carotenoid biosynthetic genes in fruits of the native cultivar Gotgam chamoe were higher than those in the cultivar Ohbokggul chamoe, consistent with the abundant carotenoid accumulation in Gotgam chamoe fruits and trace carotenoid content of Ohbokggul chamoe fruit. Lutein and β-carotene were the dominant carotenoids; high levels (278.05 μg g-1 and 112.02 μg g-1 dry weight, respectively) were found in the peel of Gotgam chamoe. Our findings may provide a foundation for elucidating the carotenoid biosynthetic mechanism in C. melo and inform strategies for developing new chamoe cultivars with improved characteristics.",A Pilot Study of Infrared Thermography Based Assessment of Local Skin Temperature Response in Overweight and Lean Women during Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791407,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Obesity is recognized as a major public health issue, as it is linked to the increased risk of severe pathological conditions. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the relations between adiposity (and biophysical characteristics) and temperature profiles under thermoneutral conditions in normal and overweight females, investigating the potential role of heat production/dissipation alteration in obesity. We used Infrared Thermography (IRT) to evaluate the thermogenic response to a metabolic stimulus performed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Thermographic images of the right hand and of the central abdomen (regions of interests) were obtained basally and during the oral glucose tolerance test (3 h OGTT with the ingestion of 75 g of oral glucose) in normal and overweight females. Regional temperature vs BMI, % of body fat and abdominal skinfold were statistically compared between two groups. The study showed that mean abdominal temperature was significantly greater in lean than overweight participants (34.11 ± 0.70 °C compared with 32.92 ± 1.24 °C, p < 0.05). Mean hand temperature was significantly greater in overweight than lean subjects (31.87 ± 3.06 °C compared with 28.22 ± 3.11 °C, p < 0.05). We observed differences in temperature profiles during OGTT between lean and overweight subjects: The overweight individuals depict a flat response as compared to the physiological rise observed in lean individuals.

Their binding to μOR was assessed with radioligand competitive binding assay. A uniform set of binding affinity data contains values for two novel and one previously uncharacterized derivative. The data confirms trends known so far and thanks to their uniformity, they facilitate further comparisons. In order to provide structural hypotheses explaining the experimental affinities, the complexes of the studied derivatives with μOR were modeled and subject to molecular dynamics simulations. Five common General Features (GFs) of fentanyls' binding modes stemmed from these simulations. They include: GF1) the ionic interaction between D147 and the ligands' piperidine NH⁺ moiety; GF2) the N-chain orientation towards the μOR interior; GF3) the other pole of ligands is directed towards the receptor outlet; GF4) the aromatic anilide ring penetrates the subpocket formed by TM3, TM4, ECL1 and ECL2; GF5) the 4-axial substituent (if present) is directed towards W318. Except for the ionic interaction with D147, the majority of fentanyl-μOR contacts is hydrophobic. Interestingly, it was possible to find nonlinear relationships between the binding affinity and the volume of the N-chain and/or anilide's aromatic ring. This kind of relationships is consistent with the apolar character of interactions involved in ligand⁻receptor binding. The affinity reaches the optimum for medium size while it decreases for both large and small substituents. Additionally, a linear correlation between the volumes and the average dihedral angles of W293 and W133 was revealed by the molecular dynamics study. This seems particularly important, as the W293 residue is involved in the activation processes. Further, the Y326 (OH) and D147 (Cγ) distance found in the simulations also depends on the ligands' size. In contrast, neither RMSF measures nor D114/Y336 hydrations show significant structure-based correlations. They also do not differentiate studied fentanyl derivatives. Eventually, none of 14 popular scoring functions yielded a significant correlation between the predicted and observed affinity data (R < 0.30, n = 28).",Electrochemical Characterization and Inhibiting Mechanism on Calcium Leaching of Graphene Oxide Reinforced Cement Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791393,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Calcium leaching is a degradation progress inside hardened cement composites, where Ca2+ ions in cement pore solution can migrate into the aggressive solution. In this work, calcium leaching of graphene oxide (GO) reinforced cement composites was effectively characterized by combined techniques of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Inhibiting mechanism of GO on calcium leaching of the composites was also examined. The obtained results show that the diameter of the semi-circle of the Nyquist curves of leached samples with GO addition decreased less than that of controlled samples. After leaching for 35 days, loss rate of model impedance RCCP of leached samples with 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 wt.% GO addition was 94.85%, 84.07%, 79.66%, 75.34%, and 68.75%, respectively. Therefore, GO addition can significantly mitigate calcium leaching of cement composites, since it can absorb Ca2+ ions in cement pore solution, as well as improve the microstructure of the composites. In addition, coupling leaching depth and compressive strength loss were accurately predicted by using the impedance RCCP.",Management and Monitoring of IoT Devices Using Blockchain †.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791392,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Nowadays, we are surrounded by a large number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors.

Adoption of blockchain into enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled. Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain.

In particular, vision-based methods for predicting pedestrian intentions are now being actively studied to improve the performance of pedestrian protection systems. In this paper, we propose a vision-based system that can detect pedestrians using an on-dash camera in the car, and can then analyze their movements to determine the probability of collision. Information about pedestrians, including position, distance, movement direction, and magnitude are extracted using computer vision technologies and, using this information, a fuzzy rule-based system makes a judgement on the pedestrian's risk level. To verify the function of the proposed system, we built several test datasets, collected by ourselves, in high-density regions where vehicles and pedestrians mix closely. The true positive rate of the experimental results was about 86%, which shows the validity of the proposed system.",Overexpression of Transglutaminase from Cucumber in Tobacco Increases Salt Tolerance through Regulation of Photosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791389,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Transglutaminase (TGase) is a regulator of posttranslational modification of protein that provides physiological protection against diverse environmental stresses in plants. Nonetheless, the mechanisms of TGase-mediated salt tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the transcription of cucumber TGase (CsTGase) was induced in response to light and during leaf development, and the CsTGase protein was expressed in the chloroplast and the cell wall. The overexpression of the CsTGase gene effectively ameliorated salt-induced photoinhibition in tobacco plants, increased the levels of chloroplast polyamines (PAs) and enhanced the abundance of D1 and D2 proteins. TGase also induced the expression of photosynthesis related genes and remodeling of thylakoids under normal conditions. However, salt stress treatment reduced the photosynthesis rate, PSII and PSI related genes expression, D1 and D2 proteins in wild-type (WT) plants, while these effects were alleviated in CsTGase overexpression plants. Taken together, our results indicate that TGase-dependent PA signaling protects the proteins of thylakoids, which plays a critical role in plant response to salt stress. Thus, overexpression of TGase may be an effective strategy for enhancing resistance to salt stress of salt-sensitive crops in agricultural production.",Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel Thiazolyl-Coumarin Derivatives as Potent Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors with Antifibrotic Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791388,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 04,"New histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors with low toxicity to non-cancerous cells, are a prevalent issue at present because these enzymes are actively involved in fibrotic diseases. We designed and synthesized a novel series of thiazolyl-coumarins, substituted at position 6 (R = H, Br, OCH₃), linked to classic zinc binding groups, such as hydroxamic and carboxylic acid moieties and alternative zinc binding groups such as disulfide and catechol. Their in vitro inhibitory activities against HDACs were evaluated. Disulfide and hydroxamic acid derivatives were the most potent ones. Assays with neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated low cytotoxic effects for all compounds. Regarding the parameters associated to cardiac fibrosis development, the compounds showed antiproliferative effects, and triggered a strong decrease on the expression levels of both α-SMA and procollagen I. In conclusion, the new thiazolyl-coumarin derivatives inhibit HDAC activity and decrease profibrotic effects on cardiac fibroblasts.",An Intelligent Failure Detection on a Wireless Sensor Network for Indoor Climate Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791387,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) involve large number of sensor nodes distributed at diverse locations. The collected data are prone to be inaccurate and faulty due to internal or external influences, such as, environmental interference or sensor aging. Intelligent failure detection is necessary for the effective functioning of the sensor network. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method that is named artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), to predict temperature in a remote location and detect failures in sensors. It allows predicting the temperature and detecting failure in sensor node of remote locations using information from a web service comparing it with field temperature sensors. For experimentation, we implemented a small WSN to test our sensor in order to measure failure detection, identification and accommodation proposal. In our experiments, 94.18% of the testing data were recovered and accommodated allowing of validation our proposed approach that is based on AHN, which detects, identify and accommodate sensor failures accurately.",Understanding the Wellbeing of the Oldest-Old in China: A Study of Socio-Economic and Geographical Variations Based on CLHLS Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791386,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Empirical studies of the socio-economic determinants of the wellbeing of the oldest-old in China including the role of geography and spatial factors are rare. This paper applies binary logistic regression analysis to data on the oldest-old aged 80 years old and higher from the 2011 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS). Socioeconomic determinants of the self-reported quality of life (QoL) and self-reported health (SRH) of the oldest-old population are explored, with special attention paid to the role of residence and region. The results indicate that, after controlling for individual demographic and health behavior variables, both economic status and social welfare have a significant effect on self-reported QoL and SRH. There are also significant differences in self-reported QoL among cities, towns and rural areas, with the oldest-old respondents living in Central rural, Western town and Western rural areas being significantly less likely to report good QoL, compared to the oldest-old living in Eastern cities. Significant differences in SRH exist among Eastern China, Western China and Northeastern China, with the oldest-old from Western towns being significantly less likely to report good health, and the oldest-old from Northeastern cities being significantly more likely to report good health than those from Eastern cities. The results of this study indicate that socioeconomic factors that explain self-reported QoL and SRH of the older population are in general factors that explain the self-reported QoL and SRH of the oldest-old cohorts. The interaction effect of residence and region matters more than each of the individual factors, in providing us with more detailed information on the role of geography in explaining QoL and health of the oldest-old. At a time when the oldest-old cohorts in China are at the beginning of their projected growth, these findings are vital for providing policy makers with more information on the urgency of making more geographically targeted policy to improve more effectively the self-reported QoL and SRH of the oldest-old population.",The Role of Palliative Care in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791385,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"In the last few years, important changes have occurred in the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients that were admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICU). Care has shifted from acute coronary syndrome patients towards elderly patients, with a high prevalence of non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and a high burden of non-cardiovascular comorbid conditions: both increase the susceptibility of patients to developing life-threatening critical conditions. These conditions are associated with a significant symptom burden and mortality rate and an increased length of stay. In this context, palliative care programs, including withholding/withdrawing life support treatments or the deactivation of implanted cardiac devices, are frequently needed, according to the specific guidelines of scientific societies. However, the implementation of these recommendations in clinical practice is still inconsistent. In this review, we analyze the reasons for this gap and the main cultural changes that are required to improve the care of patients with advanced illness.",DNA Methylation in Inflammatory Pathways Modifies the Association between BMI and Adult-Onset Non-Atopic Asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791383,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"A high body mass (BMI) index has repeatedly been associated with non-atopic asthma, but the biological mechanism linking obesity to asthma is still poorly understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that inflammation and/or innate immunity plays a role in the obesity-asthma link. DNA methylome was measured in blood samples of 61 non-atopic participants with asthma and 146 non-atopic participants without asthma (non-smokers for at least 10 years) taking part in the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) study. Modification by DNA methylation of the association of BMI or BMI change over 10 years with adult-onset asthma was examined at each CpG site and differentially methylated region. Pathway enrichment tests were conducted for genes in a priori curated inflammatory pathways and the NLRP3-IL1B-IL17 axis. The latter was chosen on the basis of previous work in mice. Inflammatory pathways including glucocorticoid/PPAR signaling (p = 0.0023), MAPK signaling (p = 0.013), NF-κB signaling (p = 0.031), and PI3K/AKT signaling (p = 0.031) were enriched for the effect modification of BMI, while NLRP3-IL1B-IL17 axis was enriched for the effect modification of BMI change over 10 years (p = 0.046). DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood is consistent with inflammation as a link between BMI and adult-onset asthma and with the NLRP3-IL1B-IL17 axis as a link between BMI change over 10 years and adult-onset asthma in non-atopic participants."

Nonetheless, studies are still scarce and widely controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive systematic review on the possible complications associated to autoantibodies (AA) impeding the chances of a successful IVF cycle. An Embase, PubMed/Medline and Cochrane Central Database search was performed on 1 December 2018, from 2006 until that date. From the 598 articles yielded in the search only 44 relevant articles ultimately fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were qualitatively analyzed. Five subsets of results were identified, namely, thyroid related AA, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, AA affecting the reproductive system and AA related to celiac disease. It may be implied that the majority of auto-antibodies exert a statistically significant effect on miscarriage rates, whereas the effects on clinical pregnancy and live birth rates differ according to the type of auto-antibodies. While significant research is performed in the field, the quality of evidence provided is still low. The conduction of well-designed prospective cohort studies is an absolute necessity in order to define the impact of the different types of autoantibodies on IVF outcome.",A VCSEL-Based NIR Transillumination System for Morpho-Functional Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791370,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Transillumination with non-ionizing radiation followed by the observation of transmitted and diffused light is the simplest, and probably the oldest method to obtain qualitative information on the internal structure of tissues or body sections. Although scattering precludes formation of high-definition image (unless complex techniques are employed), low resolution pictures complemented by information on the functional condition of the living sample can be extracted. In this context, we have investigated a portable optoelectronic instrumental configuration for efficient transillumination and image detection, even in ambient day-light, of in vivo samples with thickness up to 5 cm, sufficient for visualizing macroscopic structures. Tissue illumination is obtained with an extended source consisting in a matrix of 36 near infrared Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that is powered by a custom designed low-voltage current driver. In addition to the successful acquisition of morphological images of the hand dorsal vein pattern, functional detection of physiological parameters (breath and hearth rate) is achieved non-invasively by means of a monochrome camera, with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor, turned into a wavelength selective image detector using narrow-band optical filtering.",New Insights into the Role of Epithelial⁻Mesenchymal Transition during Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791369,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 04,"Epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process by which differentiated epithelial cells undergo a phenotypic conversion to a mesenchymal nature. The EMT has been increasingly recognized as an essential process for tissue fibrogenesis during disease and normal aging. Higher levels of EMT proteins in aged tissues support the involvement of EMT as a possible cause and/or consequence of the aging process. Here, we will highlight the existing understanding of EMT supporting the phenotypical alterations that occur during normal aging or pathogenesis, covering the impact of EMT deregulation in tissue homeostasis and stem cell function.",Measuring Blood Pulse Wave Velocity with Bioimpedance in Different Age Groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791368,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"In this project, we have studied the use of electrical impedance cardiography as a possible method for measuring blood pulse wave velocity, and hence be an aid in the assessment of the degree of arteriosclerosis. Using two different four-electrode setups, we measured the timing of the systolic pulse at two locations, the upper arm and the thorax, and found that the pulse wave velocity was in general higher in older volunteers and furthermore that it was also more heart rate dependent for older subjects. We attribute this to the fact that the degree of arteriosclerosis typically increases with age and that stiffening of the arterial wall will make the arteries less able to comply with increased heart rate (and corresponding blood pressure), without leading to increased pulse wave velocity. In view of these findings, we conclude that impedance cardiography seems to be well suited and practical for pulse wave velocity measurements and possibly for the assessment of the degree of arteriosclerosis. However, further studies are needed for comparison between this approach and reference methods for pulse wave velocity and assessment of arteriosclerosis before any firm conclusions can be drawn.",Somatosensory Electrical Stimulation Does Not Improve Motor Coordination in Patients with Unilateral Knee Osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791367,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Non-surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is often focused on the motor component of KOA even though there is evidence that sensory dysfunctions play an important role in the impaired control of the affected joint. Excitation of sensory afferents can increase motor function by exploiting the nervous system's ability to adapt to changing environments (i.e., neuronal plasticity). Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the acute effects of a single session (30 min) of sensory intervention targeting neuronal plasticity using low-frequency (10 Hz) somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) of the femoral nerve. We evaluated the effects of SES on the position and force control of the affected knee and self-reported pain in KOA patients (n = 14) in a sham-controlled randomized trial. The results showed that SES did not improve measures of lower-limb motor coordination compared to sham stimulation in KOA patients, nor did it improve self-reported knee function and pain (all p > 0.05). In conclusion, despite sensory involvement in KOA, the sensory intervention used in the present explorative study did not relieve self-reported pain, which may underlie the absence of an effect on measures of motor coordination. In sum, the present explorative study showed that SES alone does not improve motor coordination in KOA patients.",Modelling Impulse Response Function of Functional Infrared Imaging for General Linear Model Analysis of Autonomic Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791366,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Functional infrared imaging (fIRI) is a validated procedure to infer autonomic arousal. Currently, fIRI signals are analysed through descriptive metrics, such as average temperature changes in a region of interest (ROI). However, the employment of mathematical models could provide a powerful tool for the accurate identification of autonomic activity and investigation of the mechanisms underlying autonomic arousal. A linear temporal statistical model such as the general linear model (GLM) is particularly suited for its simplicity and direct interpretation. In order to apply the GLM, the thermal response linearity and time-invariance of fIRI have to be demonstrated, and the thermal impulse response (TIR) needs to be characterized. In this study, the linearity and time-invariance of the thermal response to sympathetic activating stimulation were demonstrated, and the TIR for employment of the GLM was characterized. The performance of the GLM-fIRI was evaluated by comparison with the GLM applied on synchronous measurements of the skin conductance response (SCR). In fact, the GLM-SCR is a validated procedure to estimate autonomic arousal. Assuming the GLM-SCR as the gold standard approach, a GLM-fIRI sensitivity and specificity of 86.4% and 75.9% were obtained. The GLM-fIRI may allow increased performances in the evaluation of autonomic activity and a broader range of application of fIRI in both research and clinical settings for the assessment of psychophysiological and psychopathological states.",Heat Waves Occurrence and Outdoor Workers' Self-assessment of Heat Stress in Slovenia and Greece.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791365,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"Changing patterns of heat waves are part of the global warming effect and the importance of changes is reinforced by their negative impact on society.

Secondly, outdoor workers (70 from Greece, 216 from Slovenia) provided a self-assessment of heat stress. The heat wave timeline is presented as an effective way of illustrating long-term changes in heat waves' characteristics for various stakeholders. In both countries, workers assessed as significant the heat stress impact on productivity (Greece 69%, Slovenia 71%; p > 0.05), and in Slovenia also on well-being (74%; p < 0.01).

The cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems enter into a perverse relationship with tumor cells to create a tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the most lethal of all gynecological malignancies, is characterized by a unique TME that paves the way to the formation of metastasis and mediates therapy resistance through the deregulation of immune surveillance. A characteristic feature of the ovarian cancer TME is the ascites/peritoneal fluid, a malignancy-associated effusion occurring at more advanced stages, which enables the peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells and the formation of metastasis. The standard therapy for EOC involves a combination of debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. However, most patients experience disease recurrence. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced EOC. Harnessing the body's natural immune defenses against cancer in the form of immunotherapy is emerging as an innovative treatment strategy. NK cells have attracted attention as a promising cancer immunotherapeutic target due to their ability to kill malignant cells and avoid healthy cells. Here, we will discuss the recent advances in the clinical application of NK cell immunotherapy in EOC.",Sorting out the Value of Cruciferous Sprouts as Sources of Bioactive Compounds for Nutrition and Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791362,Nutrients,2019 04 22,"Edible sprouts with germinating seeds of a few days of age are naturally rich in nutrients and other bioactive compounds.

Besides, the evidence regarding the bioavailability and the biological activity of these compounds after their dietary intake has also attracted growing interest in recent years, supporting the intake of the natural food instead of enriched ingredients or extracts. Also, there is a growing interest regarding their uses, consumption, and applications for health and wellbeing, in different industrial sectors. In this context, the present review aims to compile and update the available knowledge on the fundamental aspects of production, enrichment in composition, and the benefits upon consumption of diverse edible cruciferous sprouts, which are sources of phenolic compounds and glucosinolates, as well as the evidence on their biological actions in diverse pathophysiological situations and the molecular pathways involved."

This was a cross-sectional study involving 300 students of both sexes (20.5 ± 4.4 years) who were freshmen in a Brazilian public university. Eating behavior was evaluated using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, SC was identified by a yes/no question (""Have you had a very strong desire to eat sweet food over the last three months?""), and characterized by the Questionnaire for Assessment of Sweet Substance Dependence. Individuals with SC scored significantly higher for uncontrolled eating (UE), emotional eating (EE), and anxiety symptoms. Logistic regression analysis revealed that anxiety symptoms are independently associated with SC. In conclusion, negative emotions, like anxiety, and eating guided by these emotions can contribute to the SC phenomenon.","Post-flood social support networks and morbidity in Jôsô City, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791345,Psychiatry research,2019 04 10,"Social support networks are considered beneficial for post-disaster survivor mental health.

Clinically effective interventions are scarce. For negative symptoms to become a reliable primary endpoint in treatment studies, clear operationalization and construct validation is needed. Recent factor analyses mostly find two main factors for negative symptoms: diminished expression und amotivation/anhedonia. The Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS) consists of the subscales ""motivation and pleasure"" and ""expression"". We assessed three samples of subjects with schizophrenia (n = 105) for different aspects of the scale's reliability and validity. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the CAINS confirmed its two-factorial structure. The subscales had distinct correlational profiles: ""Motivation and pleasure"" was strongly associated with functional outcome and depression and further with neurocognition, positive symptoms and social cognition. ""Expression"" seems independent of sources of secondary negative symptoms and neurocognition. We found good internal consistency and interrater agreement. Test-retest reliability (two-week interval) was moderate for the CAINS and its ""expression"" subscale and low for the ""motivation and pleasure"" subscale.

Compared to no use of interpreter, the use of interpreter in psychotherapy was associated with less improvement during treatment on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the secondary outcome measures HSCL-25, SI-SCL-90, SDS, WHO-5, HAM-A, but not on GAF-S, GAF-F and HAM-D. Based on the primary outcome measure HTQ and the majority of the secondary ratings the subsample in interpreter-mediated psychotherapy had less improvement in their mental health status compared to the subsample without interpreter.","A longitudinal study investigating bidirectionality among nonsuicidal self-injury, self-criticism, and parental criticism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791341,Psychiatry research,2019 04 10,"Previous research has indicated that both self-criticism and parental criticism may be associated with engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, much less is known about the temporal sequencing of these relationships (i.e., do self-criticism and parental criticism predict NSSI across time, or does NSSI predict self-criticism and parental criticism across time?). Undergraduate students (N = 1132; 70.5% female; Mage = 19.06) from a midsized Canadian university completed measures of NSSI, self-criticism, maternal criticism, and paternal criticism at two time points (one year apart). An autoregressive cross-lagged path analysis revealed that there was a significant unidirectional relationship between NSSI and self-criticism, such that greater NSSI frequency predicted greater self-criticism across time, but self-criticism did not predict greater NSSI frequency across time. In addition, both maternal and paternal criticism were not significantly associated with NSSI frequency when examining either direction of effects. Overall, our results challenge the notion that self-criticism is a risk factor for NSSI engagement, and instead, suggest that it may be a consequence of NSSI engagement. Intervention programs may benefit from recognizing that individuals who engage in NSSI may subsequently criticize themselves.",Machiavellianism and early neural responses to others' facial expressions caused by one's own decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791340,Psychiatry research,2019 04 10,"The processing of social stimuli generated by one's own voluntary behavior is an element of social adaptation. It is known that self-generated stimuli induce attenuated sensory experiences compared with externally generated stimuli. The present study aimed to examine this self-specific attenuation effect on early stimulus processing in the case of others' facial expressions during interpersonal interactions. In addition, this study explored the possibility that the self-specific attenuation effect on social cognition is modulated by antisocial personality traits such as Machiavellianism. We analyzed early components of the event-related brain potential in participants elicited by happy and sad facial expressions of others when the participant's decision was responsible for the others' emotions and when the others' facial expressions were independent of the participant's decision. Compared to the non-responsible condition, the responsible condition showed an attenuated amplitude of the N170 component in response to sad faces. Moreover, Machiavellianism explained individual differences in the self-specific attenuation effect depending on the affective valence of social signals. The present findings support the possibility that the self-specific attenuation effect extends to interpersonal interactions and imply that distorted cognition of others' emotions caused by one's own behavior is associated with personality disorders that promote antisocial behaviors.",Association between FKBP5 polymorphisms and depressive disorders or suicidal behavior: A systematic review and meta-analysis study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791339,Psychiatry research,2019 04 10,"Psychiatric disorders are complex polygenic diseases that show common genetic vulnerability. Several studies have investigated the association of polymorphisms of FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) gene and depressive disorders or suicidal behavior, however, the results have been controversial and ambiguous. The aim of our study was to explore the role of the FKBP5 gene variants (rs1360780, rs3800373 and rs4713916), in depressive disorders or suicidal behavior through a systematic review and a meta-analysis. The protocol number of the study is PROSPERO CRD42018089295. The meta-analysis included 12 studies. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the association and the publication bias was tested by Egger's test and funnel plot; heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran's chi-square-based Q statistic test and the inconsistency index. Our results showed that the rs3800373 and rs4713916 were associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders when using the heterozygous and dominant models. In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, a significantly increased risk of depressive disorders was also observed for rs3800373 and rs4713916 in Caucasians. When we analyzed suicidal behavior, we found a significant association with the rs1360780 of FKBP5 and suicidal behavior risk in the overall population and rs3800373 in completed suicide subgroup. Existing evidence indicates that the polymorphisms of FKBP5 gene are associated with risk of depressive disorders and suicidal behavior. Future studies with larger sample sizes will be necessary to confirm the present results.",Intervention mechanism of repeated oral GABA administration on anxiety-like behaviors induced by emotional stress in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791338,Psychiatry research,2019 04 23,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanism of repeated oral administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on anxiety-like behaviors induced by emotional stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups (8 rats each): control, emotional stress model, three emotional stress + GABA-treated groups (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg). The rats were given empty water bottles after the training of drinking water to induce emotional stress. Each group was treated with saline or different doses of GABA respectively for 21 consecutive days. Then open field and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behaviors. Both frontal cortex and plasma NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite (NOx) levels were determined spectrophotometrically. Results showed that oral administration of GABA significantly reversed the stress-induced anxiety-like negative responses dose-dependently. The frontal cortex NOx levels were lower in stressed rats than in control group (P < 0.05), but higher in 2 mg/kg GABA-treated group than stress model group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, NOx levels in plasma showed a gradual decline trend. Collectively, these results suggest that short repeated oral administration of GABA has an anxiolytic-like effect possibly via preventing NO reduction caused by stress and improving availability of NO in the frontal cortex.",Capturing the risk of persisting depressive symptoms: A dynamic network investigation of patients' daily symptom experiences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791337,Psychiatry research,2019 04 23,"What drives the large differences across patients in terms of treatment efficacy of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unclear. A network approach to psychopathology may help to reveal underlying mechanisms determining patients' capacity for recovery. We used daily diary MDD symptom data and six-month follow-up data on depression to examine how dynamic associations between symptoms relate to the future course of MDD. Daily experiences of depressive symptoms of 69 participants were assessed by means of the SCL-90-R depression subscale, three days a week for a period of six weeks, as part of a larger intervention study. Multilevel vector autoregressive modelling was used to estimate networks of dynamic symptom connections. Long-term outcome was determined by the percentage change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score between pre-intervention and six-month follow-up. For patients with more persisting symptoms, the symptom 'feeling everything is an effort' most strongly predicted other symptoms. The networks of the two groups did not significantly differ in overall connectivity. Findings suggest that future research should not solely focus on the presence or intensity of individual symptoms when predicting long-term outcomes, but should also examine the role of a specific symptom in the larger network of dynamic symptom-to-symptom interactions."

The injury of mesothelial cells plays an important role in GCPD. However, its molecular mechanism is not entirely clear. Here, we focused on the sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) which regulates HPMCs autophagy in GCPD progression. Initially, we analyzed SPHK1 expression immunohistochemically in 120 GC peritoneal tissues, and found high SPHK1 expression to be significantly associated with LC3B expression and peritoneal recurrence, leading to poor prognosis. Using a coculture system, we observed that GC cells promoted HPMCs autophagy and this process was inhibited by blocking TGF-β1 secreted from GC cells. Autophagic HPMCs induced adhesion and invasion of GC cells. We also confirmed that knockdown of SPHK1 expression in HPMCs inhibited TGF-β1-induced autophagy. In addition, SPHK1-driven autophagy of HPMCs accelerated GC cells occurrence of GCPD in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we explored the relationship between autophagy and fibrosis in HPMCs, observing that overexpression of SPHK1 induced HPMCs fibrosis, while the inhibition of autophagy weakened HPMCs fibrosis. Taken together, our results provided new insights for understanding the mechanisms of GCPD and established SPHK1 as a novel target for GCPD.","Dysregulation, functional implications, and prognostic ability of the circadian clock across cancers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791227,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"It has been proposed that the circadian rhythm generally plays important roles in tumor suppression, but there is also evidence that disruption of the canonical circadian pathway has anticancer effects. In this study, we systematically analyzed the aberrances of circadian clock genes across cancers based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These data showed that the frequencies of mutations and copy number alterations in core clock genes (PER1/2/3, CLOCK, CRY1/2, and ARNTL) were low, but that the expression levels of core clock genes were downregulated by the higher levels of DNA methylation in most tumors. The circadian clock index (CCI) was established through a principal component analysis, and this measure well represents the overall expression of the core clock genes. In fact, the CCI was significantly lower in hepatocellular carcinoma with HBV infection than in other cancers. Furthermore, pathways such as the MAPK, JAK-STAT, and immune-related signaling pathways were enriched in tumors with high CCI values. Interestingly, the CCI was generally positively related to the immunophenoscores and immunophenotypes of tumors. Additionally, the expression levels of core clock genes and the CCI were also generally positively related to survival across cancers. Taken together, the results of this study provide a comprehensive analysis of circadian clock aberrances in cancer, and the results should aid further investigations of the molecular mechanisms of cancer and the development of therapeutic strategies.",Use of Titration as a Therapeutic Individualization Strategy: An Analysis of Food and Drug Administration-Approved Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791226,Clinical and translational science,2019 05 21,"Selecting a dose regimen that is both safe and effective for patients is one of the most critical elements of a successful drug development program. Titrating the dose regimen of a drug based on patient response may help to identify safe and effective dosages at the individual patient level. Therefore, we quantified and characterized the use of response-guided titration for drugs recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to assess how frequently this dosing strategy is used and how titration regimens are evaluated during drug development. Most of the 181 drugs approved from 2013-2017 (78%) had only one approved dosing regimen. Only 30 of 76 (39%) drugs that were considered amenable to response-guided dosing strategies had information in labeling about such strategies. These findings indicate that although response-guided titration can be found in labeling, this strategy is used in a minority of drugs for which it may be useful. Careful consideration should be made early in drug development as to whether a new drug is amenable to response-guided titration as an approach to reducing interpatient variability.","A Phase 1, Open-Label, Pharmacokinetic Trial to Investigate Possible Drug-Drug Interactions Between Clobazam, Stiripentol, or Valproate and Cannabidiol in Healthy Subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791225,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,2019 02 21,"GW Pharmaceuticals' formulation of highly purified cannabidiol oral solution is approved in the United States for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes in patients aged ≥2 years, for which clobazam, stiripentol, and valproate are commonly used antiepileptic drugs. This open-label, fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction, healthy volunteer trial investigated the impact of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of clobazam (and N-desmethylclobazam), stiripentol, and valproate; the reciprocal effect of clobazam, stiripentol, and valproate on cannabidiol and its major metabolites (7-hydroxy-cannabidiol [7-OH-CBD] and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol [7-COOH-CBD]); and cannabidiol safety and tolerability when coadministered with each antiepileptic drug. Concomitant cannabidiol had little effect on clobazam exposure (maximum concentration [Cmax ] and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC], 1.2-fold), N-desmethylclobazam exposure increased (Cmax and AUC, 3.4-fold), stiripentol exposure increased slightly (Cmax , 1.3-fold; AUC, 1.6-fold), while no clinically relevant effect on valproate exposure was observed. Concomitant clobazam with cannabidiol increased 7-OH-CBD exposure (Cmax , 1.7-fold; AUC, 1.5-fold), without notable 7-COOH-CBD or cannabidiol increases. Stiripentol decreased 7-OH-CBD exposure by 29% and 7-COOH-CBD exposure by 13%. There was no effect of valproate on cannabidiol or its metabolites.

In this method, a detection probe composed of two functional sequences, a binding site for DNA polymerase and a catalytic substrate for RNase H, serves as a key component. The detection probe, at its initial state, suppresses the DNA polymerase activity, but it becomes destabilized by RNase H, which specifically hydrolyzes RNA in RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes. As a result, DNA polymerase recovers its activity and initiates multiple primer extension reactions in a separate TaqMan probe-based signal transduction module, leading to a significantly enhanced fluorescence ""turn-on"" signal. This assay can detect RNase H activity as low as 0.016 U mL-1 under optimized conditions. Furthermore, its potential use for evaluating RNase H inhibitors, which have been considered potential therapeutic agents against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), is successfully explored. In summary, this approach is quite promising for the sensitive and accurate determination of enzyme activity and inhibitor screening.",Real impact of liver cirrhosis on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in various liver diseases-meta-analytic assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791221,Cancer medicine,2019 04 09,"It is well known that the incidence of developing hepatocelluler carcinoma (HCC) is increased in liver cirrhosis of different etiologies.

Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is one of the major precursor lesions of PDAC. Although epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to play an important role for these malignant behaviors, the association between PanIN and EMT has not been clearly understood. Therefore, we explored possible molecules for regulation of EMT immunohistochemically. Using surgically resected specimens from 71 PDAC patients, expressions of SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST1, and ZEB1 were investigated in high-grade PanIN (HG-PanIN) and PDAC. Results demonstrated that PDAC accompanied by SNAIL-positive HG-PanIN showed a significantly better relapse-free survival (RFS) (median survival time (MST) of 11.3 months vs 4.4 months, P < 0.001) and overall survival overall survival (OS) (MST of 25.2 months vs 13.6 months, P < 0.001). In PDAC accompanied by SLUG-positive HG-PanIN, RFS and OS (P = 0.09 and P = 0.05) tended to have a better prognosis. In contrast, we could not find any significant prognostic benefits in the expression of TWIST1 or ZEB1 in PDAC accompanied by HG-PanIN. Our present results suggest that (1) EMT may play an important role in the development of PDAC from HG-PanIN, and (2) SNAIL may predict a distinct subgroup that shows a better prognosis.","Impact on immigrant screening adherence with introduction of a population-based colon screening program in Ontario, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791219,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"The literature suggests that differential colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence exists between Canada's immigrant and nonimmigrant populations.

However, limitations of detecting KRAS mutations in tissues are obvious. KRAS mutations in the peripheral blood can be detected as an alternative to tissue analysis. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic value of cfDNA (circulating free DNA) compared with tissues and to investigate the prognostic potential of cfDNA KRAS mutations in CRC patients. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for published studies. We extracted true-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), false-negative (FN), true-negative (TN) values, survival rate of CRC patients with mutant and wild-type KRAS and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios [PLRs/NLRs], diagnostic odds ratios [DORs], and corresponding 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]. We also generated a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve to evaluate the overall diagnostic potential. Totally, 31 relevant studies were recruited and used for the meta-analysis on the efficacy of cfDNA testing in detecting KRAS mutations. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and DOR were 0.637 (95% CI: 0.607-0.666), 0.943 (95% CI: 0.930-0.954), 10.024 (95% CI: 6.912-14.535), 0.347 (95% CI: 0.269-0.447), and 37.882 (95% CI: 22.473-63.857), respectively. The area under the SROC curve was 0.9392. Together, the results suggest that detecting KRAS mutations in cfDNA has adequate diagnostic efficacy in terms of specificity. There is a promising role for cfDNA in the detection of KRAS mutations in CRC patients. However, prospective studies with larger patient cohorts are still required before definitive conclusions of the prognostic potential of cfDNA KRAS mutations in CRC patients were drawn.",Efficient Bioconversion of Sucrose to High-Value-Added Glucaric Acid by In Vitro Metabolic Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791217,ChemSusChem,2019 05 23,"Glucaric acid (GA) is a major value-added chemicals feedstock and additive, especially in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.

The in vitro system, which does not require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) supplementation, contains seven enzymes. All enzymes were chosen from the BRENDA and NCBI databases and were expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). All seven enzymes were combined in an in vitro cascade system, and the reaction conditions were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the in vitro seven-enzyme cascade system converted 50 mm sucrose to 34.8 mm GA with high efficiency (75 % of the theoretical yield). This system represents an alternative pathway for more efficient and less costly production of GA, which could be adapted for the synthesis of other value-added chemicals."

Using histological, molecular, and bioinformatics tools, we demonstrated that (a) PACAP messenger RNA shows a high sequence identity with that reported in other birds studied so far and in other vertebrates. Furthermore, we showed that purifying selection acts on PACAP; (b) the PACAP peptide is present only in Leydig cells, whereas its receptors are localized within both Leydig and germ cells; (c) the synthesis of PACAP does not take place in seminiferous tubules. The role of PACAP in the control of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in birds is discussed.

However, few miRNAs have been shown to regulate seed vigor. Here, we conducted microarray assays to analyze miRNA expression levels in seeds of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar ZR02. Results showed significant differences in the expression of 11 miRNAs between artificially aged and untreated control seeds. Among these, osa-miR164c was transcriptionally upregulated, while osa-miR168a was downregulated in artificially aged seeds; this was verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Under the same aging condition, osa-miR164c overexpression in OE164c transgenic seeds and osa-miR168a silencing in MIM168a transgenic seeds of the rice cultivar Kasalath led to lower germination rates, whereas osa-miR164c silencing in MIM164c and osa-miR168a overexpression in OE168a resulted in higher seed germination rates compared with wild-type seeds. Meanwhile, changes in cytomembrane permeability of seeds and in the expression level of osa-miR164c target genes (OsPM27 and OsPSK5) and osa-miR168a target genes (OsAGO1 and OsPTR2) under aging conditions coincided with changes in seed vigor induced by osa-miR164c and osa-miR168a.

However, so far, the effective control of valley polarization degree in monolayer TMDs semiconductors is mostly achieved at liquid helium cryogenic temperature (4.2 K), with the requirements of high magnetic field and on-resonance laser, which are of high cost and unwelcome for applications. To overcome this obstacle, it is depicted that by electrostatic and optical doping, even at temperatures far above liquid helium cryogenic temperature (80 K) and under off-resonance laser excitation, a competitive valley polarization degree of monolayer WS2 can be achieved (more than threefold enhancement). The enhanced polarization is understood by a general doping dependent valley relaxation mechanism, which agrees well with the unified theory of carrier screening effects on intervalley scattering process. These results demonstrate that the tunability corresponds to an effective magnet field of ≈10 T at 4.2 K. This work not only serves as a reference to future valleytronic studies based on monolayer TMDs with various external or native carrier densities, but also provides an alternative approach toward enhanced polarization degree, which denotes an essential step toward practical valleytronic applications.",Application and future perspective of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in fruit crops.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791200,Journal of integrative plant biology,2019 04 19,"Fruit crops, including apple, orange, grape, banana, strawberry, watermelon, kiwifruit and tomato, not only provide essential nutrients for human life but also contribute to the major agricultural output and economic growth of many countries and regions in the world.

Here, we summarize recent reports of applying CRISPR/Cas9 to fruit crops, including efforts to reduce disease susceptibility, change plant architecture or flower morphology, improve fruit quality traits, and increase fruit yield. We discuss challenges facing fruit crops as well as new improvements and platforms that could be used to facilitate genome editing in fruit crops, including dCas9-base-editing to introduce desirable alleles and heat treatment to increase editing efficiency.

The most extreme shape changes along the precloacal axis are seen in fully aquatic sea snakes (Hydrophiinae): ""microcephalic"" sea snakes have tiny heads and dramatically reduced forebody girths that can be less than a third of the hindbody girth. This morphology has evolved repeatedly in sea snakes that specialize in hunting eels in burrows, but its developmental basis has not previously been examined. Here, we infer the developmental mechanisms underlying body shape changes in sea snakes by examining evolutionary patterns of changes in vertebral number and postnatal ontogenetic growth. Our results show that microcephalic species develop their characteristic shape via changes in both the embryonic and postnatal stages. Ontogenetic changes cause the hindbodies of microcephalic species to reach greater sizes relative to their forebodies in adulthood, suggesting heterochronic shifts that may be linked to homeotic effects (axial regionalization). However, microcephalic species also have greater numbers of vertebrae, especially in their forebodies, indicating that somitogenetic effects also contribute to evolutionary changes in body shape.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of ionizing radiation in zebrafish embryos and found that radiation-induced γH2AX foci formation and cell cycle arrest did not occur until the gastrula stage, despite the presence of major DNA repair-related gene transcripts, passed on as maternal factors. Interestingly, P21/WAF1 accumulation began ∼6 h post-fertilization, although p21 mRNA was upregulated by irradiation at 2 or 4 h post-fertilization. These results suggest that the cellular responses of zebrafish embryos at 2 or 4 h post-fertilization to radiation failed to overcome P21 protein accumulation and further signaling. Regulation of P21/WAF1 protein stabilization appears to be a key factor in the response to genotoxins during early embryogenesis.",Stricture rate after chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a 20-year experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791194,ANZ journal of surgery,2019 04 03,"Definitive chemoradiation for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the first-line treatment in many centres.

As a result of phosphorus quaternization, heterocyclic phosphonium salts 1 c-3 c, derived from naphthalene, phenanthrene, and anthracene cores, exhibited very intense blue to green fluorescence (Φem =0.38-0.99) and high photostability in aqueous medium. The structure-emission relationship was further investigated by tailoring the electron-donating functions to the anthracene moiety to give dyes 4 c-6 c with charge-transfer character. The latter significantly decreases the emission energy to reach near-IR region. Thus, the intramolecular phosphacyclization renders an ultra-wide tuning of fluorescence from 420 nm (1 c) to 780 nm (6 c) in solution, extended to 825 nm for 6 c in the solid state with quantum efficiency of approximately 0.07.

When being induced by inherent molecular chiral centers or ambient asymmetric factors, asymmetric spatial arrangement between building units shall occur, which is defined as supramolecular chirality. Except for molecular design, utilizing external stimulus factors to tune supramolecular chirality is a promising approach. In this Concept article, we particularly discuss the important role of solvents in manipulating the chirality of self-assembled systems. The impact of solvents on the chirality is generally based on three properties of solvents, i.e., chirality, polarity, and active coassembly with building blocks. Molecular self-assembly in chiral solvents could undergo the chirality transfer, exhibiting a chiral induction effect. Solvent polarity often determines intermolecular orientation. As a consequence, those building blocks with both polar and apolar segments might change their chirality depending on the solvent polarity. We elaborate the active participation of solvent molecules into ordered structures together with building blocks, where solvents and building blocks exhibit a coassembly manner. By specific treatments such as heating and cooling, solvents could be released or re-entrapped, allowing a smart control over supramolecular chirality. The solvent effect in manipulating two-dimensional chiral self-assemblies is then discussed. The perspective and future development in this research field are presented at last.",The impact of a General Practitioner-led community paediatric allergy clinic: A service evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791174,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2019 04 29,"The NHS is not meeting the nation's allergy needs.

The movement of TAN can precisely go through a 60° rotation, which is confirmed by atomic force microscopy, and each stepwise directional rotating is monitored by fluorescent measurements. Moreover, the rotary nanomachine is used to spatially organize cascade enzymes: glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in four different arrangements. The multistep regulations of the biocatalytic activities are achieved by employing TAN rotations.

Aniseikonia is associated with anisometropia, as both anisometropia itself and the optical correction for anisometropia can cause aniseikonia. Image size differences above one to three per cent can be clinically symptomatic. Common symptoms include asthenopia, headache and diplopia in vertical gaze. Size differences of three and more impair binocular visual functions such as binocular summation and stereopsis. Above five per cent of aniseikonia, binocular inhibition or suppression tend to occur to prevent diplopia and confusion. Aniseikonia can be measured using a range of techniques and can be corrected or reduced by prescribing contact lenses or specially designed spectacle lenses. Subjective testing of aniseikonia is the only way to accurately measure the overall perceived amount of aniseikonia. However, currently it is not routinely assessed in most clinical settings. At least two-thirds of patients with amblyopia have anisometropia, thus we may expect aniseikonia to be common in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. However, aniseikonia may not be experienced by the patient under normal binocular viewing conditions if the image from the amblyopic eye is of poor quality or is too strongly suppressed for image size differences to be recognised. This lack of binocular simultaneous perception in amblyopia may also prevent the measurement of aniseikonia, as most common techniques require direct comparisons of images seen by each eye. Current guidelines for the treatment of amblyopia advocate full correction of anisometropia to equalise image clarity, but do not address aniseikonia. Significant image size differences between eyes may lead to suppression and abnormal binocular adaptations. It is possible that correcting anisometropia and aniseikonia simultaneously, particularly at the initial diagnosis of anisometropia, would reduce the need to develop suppression and improve treatment outcomes for anisometropic amblyopia.",Parental reports showed that snoring in infants at three and eight months associated with snoring parents and smoking mothers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791132,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2019 03 26,This prospective study examined the prevalence of snoring during infancy and the prenatal and postnatal risk factors for this condition.,Decision aids for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus: an effectiveness rapid review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791131,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 04 13,To perform a rapid review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating patient decision aids (PtDAs) for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Trends in cardiovascular management of people with diabetes by primary healthcare nurses in Auckland, New Zealand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791130,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 05 10,The study aim was to re-examine current work practices and evaluate time trends in the cardiovascular management of people with diabetes consulted by primary healthcare nurses in New Zealand.,Viral CD229 (Ly9) homologs as new manipulators of host immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791129,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 04 19,"The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family (SLAMF) of receptors plays crucial roles during innate and adaptive immune responses. The SLAMF member CD229 (Ly9, SLAMF3) is a homophilic receptor predominantly expressed on the surface of B and T cells. CD229 acts as a cosignaling molecule, regulating lymphocyte homoeostasis and activation. To promote viral replication and survival in their hosts, viruses have developed sophisticated mechanisms to combat and avoid immune surveillance. Many of these strategies rely on host defense genes captured during the process of virus-host coevolution. In particular, large DNA viruses devote a wide range of proteins to interfere with almost every host immune pathway. Given that CD229 is critically involved in regulating immune responses, it is not surprising that viruses have designed tactics to mimic or interfere with this receptor. The discovery, in recent years, that some viruses have hijacked CD229 genes from their hosts, incorporating them as an integral part of their genomes, or have evolved proteins to directly target CD229, indicates that this is the case. While it is still an emerging area of research, the present review discusses these viral molecules and their potential in immune modulation. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action and the functional implications of these new viral CD229 mimics may not only provide seminal information on viral immune evasion mechanisms but also, unveil unrecognized aspects of CD229 immune functions.","Socio-economic inequality in oral health in childhood to young adulthood, despite full dental coverage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791128,European journal of oral sciences,2019 05 09,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess differences in caries experience according to socio-economic status (SES) in a health-care system with full coverage of dental costs for children up to the age of 18 yr.

In 23-yr-old participants, these estimates were 6.8 and 4.4, respectively (P < 0.05). Low-SES children have a greater risk of more caries experience than high-SES children. Thus, in a system with full free paediatric dental coverage, socio-economic inequality in caries experience still exists. Dental health professionals, well-child care doctors and nurses, general practitioners, and elementary school teachers should collaborate to promote oral health at the community level, with specific targeting of low-SES families.

While upper limits for heat stress designed to protect all workers have been recommended by occupational safety institutes for some time, heat stress continues to compromise health and productivity. In our view, this is largely explained by the inability of existing guidelines to consider the inter-individual (age, sex, disease, others) and intra-individual (medication use, fitness, hydration, others) factors that cause extensive variability in physiological tolerance to a given heat stress. In conditions that do not exceed the recommended limits, this 'one size fits all' approach to heat stress management can lead to reductions in productivity in more heat-tolerant workers, while compromising safety in less heat-tolerant workers who may develop heat-related illness, even in temperate conditions. Herein, we discuss future directions in occupational heat stress management that consider this individual variability.",Perceptions and predictors of dating violence among nursing and midwifery students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791113,Journal of advanced nursing,2019 04 05,To determine the prevalence and predictors of victimization and perpetration of dating violence among nursing and midwifery students.,The Antiresection Activity of the X Protein Encoded by Hepatitis Virus B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791110,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 05 29,"Chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV encodes an oncoprotein, hepatitis B x protein (HBx), that is crucial for viral replication and interferes with multiple cellular activities including gene expression, histone modifications, and genomic stability. To date, it remains unclear how disruption of these activities contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we report that HBV exhibits antiresection activity by disrupting DNA end resection, thus impairing the initial steps of homologous recombination (HR). This antiresection activity occurs in primary human hepatocytes undergoing a natural viral infection-replication cycle as well as in cells with integrated HBV genomes. Among the seven HBV-encoded proteins, we identified HBx as the sole viral factor that inhibits resection. By disrupting an evolutionarily conserved Cullin4A-damage-specific DNA binding protein 1-RING type of E3 ligase, CRL4WDR70 , through its H-box, we show that HBx inhibits H2B monoubiquitylation at lysine 120 at double-strand breaks, thus reducing the efficiency of long-range resection. We further show that directly impairing H2B monoubiquitylation elicited tumorigenesis upon engraftment of deficient cells in athymic mice, confirming that the impairment of CRL4WDR70 function by HBx is sufficient to promote carcinogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that lack of H2B monoubiquitylation is manifest in human HBV-associated HCC when compared with HBV-free HCC, implying corresponding defects of epigenetic regulation and end resection. Conclusion: The antiresection activity of HBx induces an HR defect and genomic instability and contributes to tumorigenesis of host hepatocytes.","Employment characteristics and cause-specific mortality at automotive electronics manufacturing plants in Huntsville, Alabama.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791109,American journal of industrial medicine,2019 03 08,"This study was carried out in response to worker concerns over their exposure to lead solder and chlorinated solvents at automotive electronics manufacturing plants in Huntsville, Alabama.",On the Limits of the Precautionary Principle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791108,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2019 06 14,"The precautionary principle (PP) is an influential principle of risk management.

Yet, there is little consensus on precisely how to understand and formulate the principle. In this article I prove some impossibility results for two plausible formulations of the PP as a decision-rule. These results illustrate the difficulty in making the PP consistent with the acceptance of any tradeoffs between catastrophic risks and more ordinary goods. How one interprets these results will, however, depend on one's views and commitments. For instance, those who are convinced that the conditions in the impossibility results are requirements of rationality may see these results as undermining the rationality of the PP. But others may simply take these results to identify a set of purported rationality conditions that defenders of the PP should not accept, or to illustrate types of situations in which the principle should not be applied.",The Spectrum of Hepatic Involvement in Patients With Telomere Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791107,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 05 29,"Loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode for components of the telomere repair complex cause accelerated telomere shortening. Hepatic involvement has been recognized as a cause of morbidity in telomere diseases, but very few studies have characterized the nature and extent of liver involvement in affected patients. We report the prevalence and characteristics of liver involvement in a large cohort of patients with telomere disease evaluated serially at the National Institutes of Health. One hundred twenty-one patients with known or suspected telomere disease were screened; 40 patients with liver involvement were included in the current study. Median follow-up was 2.4 years. Data were collected regarding their demographic information, laboratory analysis, imaging, and histopathology. Forty patients (40% of the cohort) with a median age of 42 years were found to have liver involvement. Liver enzyme elevation was cholestatic in pattern; 8 (21%) had drug-related enzyme elevations. The most common imaging finding was increased hepatic echogenicity on ultrasound in 39% (9) of patients, followed by hepatomegaly in 26% (6). Biopsies were infrequent because of risk associated with thrombocytopenia, but in 6 patients, there were varying findings: nodular regenerative hyperplasia, steatohepatitis, hemosiderosis, cholestasis, and cirrhosis with hepatic steatosis. Almost half the cohort had pulmonary diffusion abnormalities, and 25% died during the follow-up period. Conclusion: In patients with telomere disease, hepatic involvement is common and can present in diverse ways, including elevated liver enzymes as well as histopathologic and imaging abnormalities. Liver disease has important implications for morbidity and mortality in patients with telomere disease.",Tracking methods and retention for a longitudinal sample of alcohol- and drug-involved women on probation and parole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791106,Journal of community psychology,2019 02 21,"Attrition, or the progressive loss of individuals from a sample, poses a major problem in fields that carry out research to inform policy and program design. Attrition reduces statistical power by reducing sample size and compromises the external validity of findings by introducing sampling bias. If sampling bias results from disadvantages that act as barriers to research participation, then it promotes social injustice by excluding disadvantaged groups from the study. This study describes strategies used to retain participants in a longitudinal study of experiences of women under community supervision (probation or parole). It uses quantitative methods to examine sampling bias and qualitative methods to elicit accounts of participants' explanations for being hard to reach and their recommendations for retention in future research. For participants who were and who were not retained, there were no statistically significant differences on several common quantitative predictors of retention. Hard-to-reach women identified residential mobility, low income, and busy lifestyles as main reasons research staff had difficulty contacting them and recommended repeated attempts at contact through multiple means.

The expression profile of circulating miRNAs (ci-miRNAs) has been proposed as a potential diagnostic biomarker for adaptive responses of particular systems to physical exertion. Several miRNAs are recognized as regulators of signalling pathways such as the IGF1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, relevant to exercise adaptation. MicroRNA levels may fluctuate depending on training type/exercise regimen in correlation with phenotypic features such as VO2 max. Muscle-specific miRNAs have been proposed as regulators of skeletal muscle/myocardial interactions during physical exertion, thereby facilitating adaptation. Differential expression of miRNAs may relate to molecular patterns of communication triggered during/after exercise as response, recovery and adaptation mechanisms to training load. This review highlights recent findings and the potential significance of specific miRNAs in the process of exercise adaptation. Altered ci-miRNA profiles following exercise suggest that they may be useful biomarkers of health and adaptation to intervention strategies. Identification of the concert of miRNA expression signatures together with their targets is critical towards understanding gene regulation in this context. Understanding how the external environment influences gene expression via miRNAs will provide insight into potential therapeutic target strategies for disease.",Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels Mirror Bone Mineral Density in Amenorrheic and Eumenorrheic Athletes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791080,International journal of sports medicine,2019 03 25,"Amenorrhea and osteoporosis are strongly associated in female athletes. Amenorrheic women show lower serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) than eumenorrheic women. BDNF is known to regulate bone tissue development and remodeling; thus, athletes with low serum BDNF levels may show low bone mass. This study investigated the associations between serum BDNF, estradiol, and bone mineral density (BMD) in female athletes. This study included 160 elite female athletes (21.7±4.3 years). Serum levels of BDNF and estradiol were in 195 blood samples obtained from 132 eumenorrheic athletes (EA) and 63 amenorrheic athletes (AA). BMD was measured in the radius, lumbar spine, pelvis, and legs using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. AA showed significantly lower serum BDNF levels than EA (p=0.017). Serum BDNF levels were positively and significantly associated with both serum estradiol levels (p=0.0004) and the BMD measured at all sites (all p<0.05). 10 AA received transdermal estrogen therapy, and serum BDNF levels were measured at baseline and 6 months after therapy. Hormone-treated AA demonstrated a significant increase in serum BDNF levels after 6 months (p=0.022). Thus, serum BDNF levels may be associated with decreased BMD and serve as an indicator of the therapeutic effect of estradiol supplementation in female athletes with osteoporosis.",[Oesophageal Atresia - from the Challenge in Prenatal Medicine until Surgical Care].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791067,Zeitschrift fur Geburtshilfe und Neonatologie,2019 02 21,"Oesophageal atresia causes a dysplasia of the oesophagus with or without a connection to the adjoining trachea.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) in both patients identified a homozygous (c.2T > C) variant in exon one of RARS gene, encoding cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase. Our finding was confirmed by segregation analysis. In silico analyses of the c.2T > C variant showed its possible pathogenic role due to the absence of the start codon.

Hampson (1990) considered Micardia a synonym of Eustrotia. However, its generic status was revised by Warren (1913) and retained by subsequent authors (Ueda 1984). There are at present 13 species recognized within Micardia (Table 1), of which, M. quadrilinea Scriba 1921 was described from Japan on the basis of female specimens and without high-quality illustrations, and subsequently treated as of uncertain status by Chen Xue (2012). The remaining species are as follows: M. simplicissima Berio 1973 was described from Myanmar based on 2 females. M. munda Leech, 1900, was described from Western China (Sichuan, according to Chen Xue 2012). Chen (1999) extended the range of M. pulcherrima to include China, and Chen Xue (2012) subsequently reviewed Micardia from China, describing three new species, M. pallens, M. distincta and M. minuta. Four species have been described from Madagascar, M. argentoidea and M. terracottoides by Berio (1954), and M. ikoly and M. itremo by Viette (1982). Because they are geographically separated so widely from their congeners in Asia, Chen Xue (2012) considered their generic placement in need of confirmation. Moreover, the distribution of M. pulchra Butler was extended to Russia (Kurile Island) by synonymizing it with M. pulchrargentea Bryk, 1942 (Kononenko 2005). In this paper we report a new species, Micardia yixingensis, sp. nov. from Jiangsu, China.

One of these (now considered lost) came from the ""Rocher du Goulet"" at the base of the Biarritz section (Bartonian, Côte des Basques, southwest France). D'Archiac figured only the second cup; this belongs to the d'Orbigny Collection and is still housed in the palaeontological collection of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (Paris) as the lectotype of the species, C. thorenti. It appears that it was collected from Priabonian levels exposed near Castellane (Alpes de Haute Provence, southeast France). New observations on this cup, as well as a detailed study of the characters of aboral cups, columnals and proximal brachials in a few extant and fossil species classically attributed to Conocrinus or to closely related genera such as Democrinus, Rhizocrinus and Tormocrinus, have yielded arguments for a revision of the taxonomy and interrelationships of extant and fossil taxa in the family Bourgueticrinidae. Conocrinus (= Tormocrinus), as here interpreted, includes six Eocene species: C. thorenti, C. archiaci, C. cahuzaci n. sp., C. duperrieri, C. cf. suessi and C. veronensis. Numerous extinct species previously attributed to Conocrinus or Democrinus are here transferred to two new genera which first occur in the lower Paleocene: Paraconocrinus n. gen. (type species: P. pyriformis) and Pseudoconocrinus n. gen. (type species: P. doncieuxi). Aboral cups from the ""Rocher du Goulet"" (Biarritz) are here assigned to Paraconocrinus pellati n. gen., n. sp., while the Danian species Democrinus maximus is transferred to Pseudoconocrinus n. gen. A new genus, Cherbonniericrinus, is created to accommodate a single extant species, Ch. cherbonnieri, previously attributed to Conocrinus, while the extant genus Rhizocrinus, closely related to Democrinus, is resurrected. Conocrinus and closely related genera are derived from a bourgueticrinine lineage the first record of which is from the lower Campanian, with the new genus Carstenicrinus. These are all attributed to the family Rhizocrinidae which is here considered distinct from the family Bourgueticrinidae. Rhizocrinids rapidly diversified immediately after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) event. Cretaceous taxa previously placed within the family Bourgueticrinidae now appear to be polyphyletic. Some of them do not belong to Bourgueticrinina, such as those of the Dunnicrinus lineage. Interrelationships of Rhizocrinidae and other post-Palaeozoic families having a xenomorphic stalk are discussed.","Redescription and circumscription of the Acuminate Crayfish, Cambarus acuminatus Faxon, 1884 (Decapoda: Cambaridae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790990,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Cambarus acuminatus was described by Walter Faxon in 1884 from three specimens collected from the Saluda River in northwestern South Carolina, USA.

C, spans a range across much of the Piedmont Plateau and Coastal Plain from central South Carolina north to Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania. A primary impediment to a much-needed thorough taxonomic assessment and revision of C. sp. C is the absence of taxonomically useful type material of C. acuminatus coupled with the lack of a detailed description of the species. Here we provide a redescription of C. acuminatus based on modern standards for astacoidean crayfishes in the genus Cambarus and emend the circumscription of the species, thereby laying the groundwork necessary for future taxonomic and phylogenetic work within, and involving, the C. sp.

This phenomenon may help identify sex, except in the absence of mature individuals, and has led to confused taxonomy for several species. We examined a large collection of Compsaraia samueli collected during the breeding season from a remote stream in the Rio Negro drainage. This collection contains a wide range of sizes of both sexes, but most individuals were easily identified as mature. To quantify the sexual dimorphism of these specimens, 15 measurements were taken from the head and the body. In addition, some specimens were cleared-and-stained to study cranial osteology. We found that long-snouted males of C. samueli span a wide range of body sizes. As the snout length increases the distance between the eye and the occiput does not increase at the same rate, suggesting that it is only the anterior portion of the head that has an increased allometry. Skeletal anatomy differs between the sexes in that the lower jaw is more triangular in females and more linear in males. The coronomeckelian is small and round in females in contrast to being longer and pointed in males. There is strong interlacing of the dentary and anguloarticular bones in males, whereas this contact is not as extensive in females. We also discuss the implications of sexual dimorphism for identification of this species relative to its congener (C. compsa), and for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the family.","New and little-known species of Empis (Diptera: Empididae) from Bulgaria, Israel and Turkey, with keys to the Palaearctic Pachymeria and the Mediterranean Xanthempis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790949,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Empis (Pachymeria) vikhrevi sp. nov. is described from Bulgaria and Turkey (Bolu Province).

(2013) based on several early instars and one late instar collected among wet leaves and debris near Gamboa, Panama. The identification was based on collection of an adult Lepicerus in a similar habitat nearby and a combination of characters found in other myxophagan immatures but not known in other beetle larvae. We accepted this identification with some reservations, but a misinterpretation of one feature in the original description plus an unexpected new source of evidence makes it likely that our identification was incorrect. The one misinterpreted feature in this larva was the retraction of the ventral mouthparts. Reexamining the larvae, it was found that a pair of tendons extending mesally from the hypostomal rods were misinterpreted as maxillary bases. The mouthparts are definitely protracted, which is expected with long hypostomal rods. The new source of evidence is somewhat complicated, as explained below.","Description of the first species of Cymodusa Holmgren from Brazil (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Campopleginae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790910,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Cymodusa ypy sp. nov., the first species of the genus to be formally described from Brazil, is described and illustrated.

The new species is diagnosed from all other congeners by the following suite of characters: small body size (SVL&lt; 33 mm), dorsal scales on trunk homogeneous, one pair of post mentals separated by a single small chin scale, ventral scales on trunk smooth, subimbricate, 17-19 scales across the belly. Subdigitals scansors smooth, entire, unnotched; lamellae under digit IV of pes 17 -18. Males with femoral pores on each thigh but lacking precloacal pores. Median row of subcaudals smooth, subimbricate, enlarged and in an irregular series of subhexagonal scales. This new species had been previously confused with Cnemaspis alwisi Wickramasinghe Munidradasa, 2007. The new species differs from Cnemaspis alwisi by having 122-129 ventral scales (versus 146-152), 7-8 supralabials (versus 8-10), and relatively shorter SVL ranging between 31.5-32.9 mm (versus 37.8-39.9 mm). Further, the new species is genetically divergent from Cnemaspis alwisi, the species that it closely resembles by 13.5% and 7.8% from its sister species in the ND2 gene.

The presence of two primarily allopatric autochtonous species, Unio elongatulus Pfeiffer, and Unio mancus Lamarck, is confirmed for the Italian peninsula, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily.Autochthonous populations of Unio elongatulus are present in the peri-Adriatic drainages of the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, south as far as the Ofanto River (Apulia, Italy) and Lake Skadar (Albania), while its presence in the Tyrrhenian rivers of Tuscany is likely due to anthropogenic introduction events. Conversely, Unio mancus turtonii Payraudeau, an endangered peri-Tyrrhenian taxon, was found with autochthonous populations in the Apennine-Tyrrhenian drainages of peninsular Italy, eastern Mediterranean France, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily, while the actual autochthony of the single population found in the Ionian basin of the Italian peninsula (Bradano River, Basilicata) deserves further investigation. The Italian population of U. mancus requienii Michaud, reported from Lake Montepulciano is to be considered allochthonous.The binomen U. elongatulus, although widely used in the recent scientific literature, was, to date, assigned to a doubtful species, because its type locality includes a large area inhabited by different Unio taxa, which are not clearly distinguishable by their shell alone; furthermore, no type material is present in historical collections. To retain the recently-used name, a new restricted type locality is established, where only U. elongatulus lives, and a neotype is designated. The validity of the subspecies of Unio mancus is also discussed and confirmed.Finally, hypotheses on the origin of Italian mussels, and considerations on their conservation status are discussed."

Herein we describe a new species of leaf-mimicking leaf-tailed gecko, Uroplatus finaritra sp. nov., based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence. This new species inhabits the rainforests of Marojejy National Park at low elevations and is morphologically similar to Uroplatus phantasticus, but differs by having a larger body size, relatively shorter tail, and dark-red pigmentation of the oral mucosa. Molecular data reveals a distance of 14.0-14.7% in the 16S rRNA gene to U. phantasticus, and haplotype sharing in the c-mos nuclear gene only with species of much shorter tails (i.e., with U. kelirambo and two undescribed candidate species). Similar to other members of the leaf-mimicking Uroplatus species in northern Madagascar, Uroplatus finaritra sp. nov. likely has a small geographic distribution, and is currently known only from the lowland rainforests of Marojejy. We discuss the value of the buccal mucosa colouration and tail dimensions of Uroplatus as taxonomic characters, and the potential drivers of their evolution. In order to reduce the risk of international trade under incorrect species names we suggest that exported CITES species should be obligatorily accompanied by information about their precide geographic origin within Madagascar.","Schismatothelinae spiders (Araneae, Mygalomorphae, Theraphosidae) from Colombia: four new species and an approach to their diversity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790890,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"The spider subfamily Schismatothelinae from Colombia is revised.

The situation is particularly poor for two species (Macrodasys indicus Govindankutty Nair, 1969 and Paradasys lineatus Rao, 1980), which consequently, are considered here to be species inquirendae; moreover, the Indian records of Tetranchyroderma hystrix and T. massiliense reported from Kerala are doubtful and consequently the two species should not be included among the fauna of the Indian region until proper evidence is found.

The focus is on new genera and on species that belong to recently revised genera. Eight new genera and 25 new species are formally described. In Arteminae, three new species are described in Artema Walckenaer, 1837: A. bahla sp. n., A. ghubrat sp. n., and A. dhofar sp. n. (all from Oman); five new species in Arnapa gen. n. (eastern Indonesia and New Guinea): A. arfak sp. n., A. tinoor sp. n., A. manokwari sp. n., A. meja sp. n., A. tolire sp. n.; and one new species in Chisosa Huber, 2000: C. caquetio sp. n. (Netherlands Antilles). In Ninetinae, three new monotypic genera are described: Pemona gen. n., with the type species P. sapo sp. n. (Venezuela); Pinocchio gen. n., with the type species P. barauna sp. n. (Brazil); and Magana gen. n., with the type species M. velox sp. n. (Oman). In Modisiminae, three new species are described in Chibchea Huber, 2000 (all from Brazil): C. amapa sp. n., C. santosi sp. n., and C. hamadae sp. n.; one new species in Psilochorus Simon, 1893: P. bromelicolus sp. n. (Brazil); and three new monotypic genera, all from Brazil: Arenita gen. n., with the type species A. fazendinha sp. n.; Kairona gen. n., with the type species K. selva sp. n.; and Saciperere gen. n., with the type species S. catuaba sp. n. In Pholcinae, a new monotypic genus is described: Giloloa gen. n., with the type species G. sofifi sp. n. (Indonesia); three new species in the genus Aetana Huber, 2005 (all from Indonesia): A. ternate sp. n.; A. mokwam sp. n.; A. ondawamei sp. n.; and two new species in the genus Panjange Deeleman-Reinhold Deeleman, 1983 (both from Indonesia): P. thomi sp. n., and P. togutil sp. n.        Artema ghubrat is a cave-dwelling species and the only (slightly) troglomorphic representative of Arteminae; A. dhofar is presumably the closest known relative of the pantropical and synanthropic A. atlanta. The new genus Arnapa is probably species rich in eastern Indonesia and New Guinea but poorly collected; its morphological delimitation from other Australasian Arteminae (Wugigarra Huber, 2001; Holocneminus Berland, 1942; Trichocyclus Simon, 1908) needs further study. Arnapa nigromaculatus (Kulczyński, 1911) comb. n. is newly transferred from Psilochorus. Pemona sapo is the first representative of Ninetinae from Venezuela. The genus Chibchea, previously known from the Andes only, is for the first time recorded from Brazil/lowland Amazonia. Arenita fazendinha is among the few species in Pholcidae with extremely reduced procursus and barely modified male chelicerae. Kairona selva is unique among Pholcidae for its brush of strong hairs on a median horn anteriorly on the ocular area. Saciperere catuaba is one of only four pholcid species currently known to occur both in the Amazon and in the Atlantic Forest; however, variation indicates that more than one species might be included. It is among the few spiders known to have asymmetric genitalia (antisymmetric female internal genitalia). The Brazilian Psilochorus bromelicolus is the first South American Psilochorus of which both sexes are adequately described; however, the assignment to Psilochorus is tentative. Aetana ternate has extremely elongated procursi and accordingly elongated female internal genitalia. Aetana ondawamei and A. mokwam have almost identical male pedipalps and chelicerae (except for size) but differ clearly in the female genitalia.",Revision of the bamboo leafhopper tribe Mukariini (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Deltocephalinae) from the Indian subcontinent with description of new genera and species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790873,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Leafhopper genera and species of the tribe Mukariini from the Indian subcontinent are revised.

Interestingly, both wasp species have very different ovipositor lengths, in addition to other characters for species delimitation. Perhaps parasitism by the respective wasp species depends on the thickness of the stem harbouring the chloropid larvae. In the present study, both these new species of wasps are described and illustrated, together with notes on their biology. For the first time the genus Rhogadopsis has been found associated with Chloropidae; earlier records concern Agromyzidae.","Redescription and new records of a poorly known leucosiid crab, Pseudophilyra punctulata Chen Ng, 2003, and description of a new species of Pseudophilyra from Japan (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790866,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"A poorly known leucosiid crab, Pseudophilyra punctulata Chen Ng, 2003, originally described on the basis of an immature male holotype and an immature female paratype from Singapore, is rediscovered and rediagnosed on the basis of material from Thailand, the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands (Japan). In addition, a new species closely related to P. punctulata, P. parilis, is described and illustrated on the basis of material from Mie Prefecture, Honshu mainland of Japan. The new species is distinguished from P. punctulata by the coarser granules bordering the lateral carapace margins and the different shape of the gonopods. Pseudophilyra tridentata Miers, 1879, is also compared with P. punctulata and P. parilis n. sp. because of the close similarities in the overall morphology of the carapace and appendages, but can easily be differentiated by the smoother carapace and thoracic sternum surface, different shape of the carapace and the stouter cheliped palm. It is possible that previous records of P. tridentata outside Japan might contain more than one species.","Description of new species of algal-boring Limnoria (Crustacea, Isopoda, Limnoriidae) from Japan and redescription of Limnoria segnoides Menzies, 1957 and L. nagatai Nunomura, 2012.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790865,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Previous research on the mitochondrial COI gene sequences of several populations of Limnoria nagatai Nunomura suggested a cryptic species from the Sea of Japan.

The high morphological variability of the former hybrid form is analyzed and its diagnostic features, distinguishing their representatives from those of parental species are determined. Within their vast range, the hybrids B. brevimanus x B. cederströmii seem to be one of the most common and numerous members of the genus. For instance, they dominate in all reservoirs of the Volga River where their biology was investigated in some detail. The hybrids are distributed widely being known from Sweden, Finland, and north-west of European Russia to Central Yakutia in Eastern Siberia.

These rodents have strong morphologic adaptations to semiaquatic habit and inhabit forests along river and streams in almost the entire South American continent. Although Nectomys is not a very speciose genus, 23 nominal taxa are associated with this group. Among these names is Nectomys saturatus, described in 1897 and currently allocated as synonym of N. apicalis, the west-Amazon species of Nectomys. Based on the examination of type material of the genus Nectomys, we hypothesize that Nectomys saturatus is a valid species. To test this hypothesis, we examined morphological and morphometric traits of 570 specimens of genus Nectomys of the same age class, belonging to the five recognized species, including the N. saturatus type series. We analyzed the external dimensions through descriptive statistics and we assessed the variation in craniodental measurements by means of Discriminant Analysis. Our results indicate N. saturatus individuals are considerably larger than the samples of congeneric species in all external traits, and they were also discriminated from the other species in the multivariate space. Qualitatively, N. saturatus shows two exclusive traits, the presence of paralophule on M1 and almost parallel-sided interorbital region. In this sense, our set of evidences indicates that our hypothesis should be accepted and the name Nectomys saturatus represents a valid species.","A new species of the Amphisbaena (Squamata, Amphisbaenidae) from the Brazilian Cerrado with a key for the two-pored species.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790847,Zootaxa,2019 03 22,"Here, we describe a new species of Amphisbaena with two precloacal pores from open Cerrado areas of the municipality of Arenópolis, in the Brazilian state of Goiás.

Since 1870, when the first octocoral, Virgularia mirabilis (Müller, 1776), was recorded in the Azores a cyclic pattern on the taxonomical study of octocorals reveals the deep-sea investigation efforts made on the region at different periods: Prince Albert I of Monaco, Biaçores and recent expeditions. The first decade of this millennium was the peak on taxonomic research of cold-water octocorals in the Azores with 11 publications targeting gorgonians and soft corals (Alcyonacea) and specific sub-orders within it. Ninety-eight names of Octocorallia were found to be given in the economic exclusive zone of the Azores. While 25 names were changed or added to the known Azorean octocoral diversity, 3 species identified in the region and unreported in the reviewed literature, increase the number to 101 species. Twenty-five names were synonymized while three species names were unmasked as errors in need of taxonomical clarification.

In preclinical studies, ISMS in the lumbosacral enlargement produced standing and walking by activating networks controlling the hindlimb muscles. ISMS implants are placed surgically under anesthesia, and refinements in placement are made based on the evoked responses. Anesthesia can have a significant effect on the responses evoked by spinal neuroprostheses; therefore, in preparation for clinical testing of ISMS, we compared the evoked responses under a common clinical neurosurgical anesthetic protocol with those evoked under protocols commonly used in preclinical studies.",Oblique raster scanning: an ion dose delivery procedure with variable energy layers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790786,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 23,"In ion therapy accelerator complexes the dose is delivered 'actively' by subdividing the target in equal energy layers (EELs), which are scanned by a beam spot visiting in sequence the planned spots, previously defined by the treatment planning system. Synchrotrons-based complexes have three problems: (i) the switching from the energy needed to scan one Equal Energy Layer to the next takes time, an effect that is more relevant for the very short treatment times now often required; (ii) the unavoidable 'ripples' of the quadrupoles and bending magnets currents produce large erratic time variations of the extracted current complicating the dose delivery; (iii) in case of superconducting synchrotrons, it is difficult to rapidly change the magnetic field because of the power dumped in the cold masses. These problems are mitigated in the proposed Qblique Raster Scanning procedure, in which the magnet currents of the beamlines vary in synchrony and a beam spot of continuously varying energy moves at a constant velocity in the beam direction scanning layers that are not perpendicular to it. In this paper it is shown that, even for a 13.5 s irradiation of a 0.5 l target, the B-field rates can be as low as dB/dt  =  0.1 T s-1 and that the best procedures to follow 0.5 l moving targets, which combines 3D feedback systems with a five-fold rescanning, can be applied by accelerating in the synchrotron about 1010 carbon ions. ORS can be used in combination with respiratory gating,and is advantageous also for (synchro)cyclotrons-based centres: the variable energy beam can be produced with a slowly rotating absorber and a superconducting energy acceptance beamline/gantry system (with ΔE/E  =  ±1.5%) can substitute the more expensive beam transport systems which have ten times larger energy acceptance (ΔE/E  ⩾  ±15%).",Space charge layer effects in silicon studied by in situ surface transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790785,Journal of physics.

However, the surface sensitivity of this technique to atomic structures comes along with the control of bulk related electron paths and internal interfaces. Here we analyzed the role of Schottky-barriers and space charge layers for Si-surfaces. By means of a metal submonolayer coverage deposited on vicinal Si(1 1 1), we reliably accessed subsurface transport channels via angle- and temperature-dependent in situ transport measurements. In particular, high temperature treatments performed under ultra high vacuum conditions led to the formation of surface-near bulk defects, e.g. SiC-interstitials. Obviously, these defects act as p-type dopants and easily overcompensate lightly n-doped Si substrates.",Integrating DVH criteria into a column generation algorithm for VMAT treatment planning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790784,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 04 08,"Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment planning is an efficient treatment technique with a high degree of flexibility in terms of dose rate, gantry speed, and aperture shapes during rotation around the patient. However, the dynamic nature of VMAT results in a large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. Determining the priority of the tissues and voxels to obtain clinically acceptable treatment plans poses additional challenges for VMAT optimization. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an automatic planning approach integrating dose-volume histogram (DVH) criteria in direct aperture optimization for VMAT, by adjusting the model parameters during the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on column generation, an optimization technique that sequentially generates the apertures and optimizes the corresponding intensities. We take the advantage of iterative procedure in this method to modify the weight vector of the penalty function based on the DVH criteria and decrease the use of trial-and-error in the search for clinically acceptable plans. We evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm and treatment quality using a clinical prostate case and a challenging head-and-neck case. In both cases, we generate 15 random initial weight vectors to assess the robustness of the algorithm. In the prostate case, our methodology obtained clinically acceptable plans in all instances with only a 10% increase in the computational time, while simple VMAT optimization found just three acceptable plans. To have an idea with respect to the existing software, we compared the obtained DVH to a commercial software. The quality of the diagrams of the proposed method, especially for the healthy tissues, is significantly better while the computational time is less. In the head-and-neck case, 93.3% of the clinically acceptable plans are obtained while no plan was acceptable in simple VMAT. In sum, the results demonstrate the ability of the proposed optimization algorithm to obtain clinically acceptable plans without human intervention and also its robustness to weight parameters. Moreover, our proposed weight adjustment procedure proves to reduce the symmetry in the solution space and the time required for the post-optimization phase.",Low-temperature preferential oxidation of CO over Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C (MXene) for purifying H2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790783,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 04 10,"Selective removal of CO from reformate streams at low temperature is an important issue to be solved for anode catalysts of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that the Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can be used as an effective low cost catalyst with high activity, selectivity and stability for preferential oxidation of CO. Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can also be used as a filter membrane for separating H2 and CO. Meanwhile, the high selectivity is achieved because H2 hardly takes part in the reaction, and the good activity is obtained since the CO with moderate binding strength could be smoothly removed at various CO concentration. We propose a facile route for removing CO by injecting low O2 supply because it can resist CO poisoning with promoted activity for CO oxidation at higher CO concentration. We anticipate that Ag monolayer decorated Mo2C can be used as a promising H2 purifying pretreater by preferential oxidation of CO connecting to the anode of PEMFCs. We hope the present results could advance the development of catalysts for purifying H2 and inspire more researches on the application of MXene catalysts.",Analytical interatomic bond-order potential for simulations of oxygen defects in iron.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790782,Journal of physics.

The potential predicts binding energies of various small oxygen-vacancy clusters in [Formula: see text]-iron in good agreement with density functional theory results, and is therefore suitable for simulations of oxygen-based defects in iron. We apply the potential in simulations of the stability and structure of Fe/FeO interfaces and FeO precipitates in iron, and observe that the shape of FeO precipitates can change due to formation of well-defined Fe/FeO interfaces. The interface with crystalline Fe also ensures that the precipitates never become fully amorphous, no matter how small they are.",Computational modelling of resistance and associated treatment response heterogeneity in metastatic cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790781,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 23,"Metastatic cancer patients invariably develop treatment resistance. Different levels of resistance lead to observed heterogeneity in treatment response. The main goal was to evaluate treatment response heterogeneity with a computation model simulating the dynamics of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells. Model parameters included proliferation, drug-induced death, transition and proportion of intrinsically resistant cells. The model was benchmarked with imaging metrics extracted from 39 metastatic prostate cancer patients who had 18F-NaF-PET/CT scans performed at baseline and at three cycles into chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Two initial model assumptions were evaluated: considering only inter-patient heterogeneity and both inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells. The correlation between the median proportion of intrinsically resistant cells and baseline patient-level imaging metrics was assessed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The impact of model parameters on simulated treatment response was evaluated with a sensitivity study. Treatment response after periods of six, nine, and 12 months was predicted with the model. The median predicted range of response for patients treated with both therapies was compared with a Wilcoxon rank sum test. For each patient, the time was calculated when the proportion of disease with a non-favourable response outperformed a favourable response. By taking into account inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells, the model performed significantly better ([Formula: see text]) than by taking into account only inter-patient heterogeneity ([Formula: see text]). The median proportion of intrinsically resistant cells showed a moderate correlation (ρ  =  0.55) with mean patient-level uptake, and a low correlation (ρ  =  0.36) with the dispersion of mean metastasis-level uptake in a patient. The sensitivity study showed a strong impact of the proportion of intrinsically resistant cells on model behaviour after three cycles of therapy. The difference in the median range of response (MRR) was not significant between cohorts at any time point (p   >  0.15). The median time when the proportion of disease with a non-favourable response outperformed the favourable response was eight months, for both cohorts. The model provides an insight into inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity in the evolution of treatment resistance.",Early seizure detection for closed loop direct neurostimulation devices in epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790780,Journal of neural engineering,2019 05 09,"Current treatment concepts for epilepsy are based on continuous drug delivery or electrical stimulation to prevent the occurrence of seizures, exposing the brain and body to a mostly unneeded risk of adverse effects. To address the infrequent occurrence and short duration of epileptic seizures, intelligent implantable closed-loop devices are needed which are based on a refined analysis of ongoing brain activity with highly specific and fast detection algorithms to allow for timely, ictal interventions. Since the development and FDA approval of a first closed loop neurostimulation device relying on simple threshold-based approaches, machine learning approaches became widely available, probably outperformed in the near future by deep convolutional neural networks, which already showed to be extremely successful in pattern recognition in images and partly in signal analysis. Handcrafted features or rules defined by experts become replaced by systematic feature selection procedures and systematic hyperparameter search approaches. Training of these classifiers augments the need of large databases with intracranial EEG recordings, which is partly given by existing databases but potentially can be replaced by continuously transferring data from implanted devices and their publication for research purposes. Already in early design states, the final target hardware must be taken into account for algorithm development. Size, power consumption and, as a consequence, limited computational resources given by low power microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICS limit the complexity of feature computation, classifier complexity, and the numbers and complexity of layers of deep neuronal networks. Novel approaches for early seizure detection will be a key module for new generations of closed-loop devices together with improved low power implant hardware and will provide together with more efficient intervention paradigms new treatment options for patients with difficult to treat epilepsy."

To shed new light on the ecotoxicological effects of pesticides on aquatic communities across ecoregions, the model pollutant pyrimethanil (fungicide) was tested in an outdoor mesocosm study with macrophyte-dominated communities in the European ""South"" (Portugal) and ""Centre"" (Germany) regulatory zones. Phytoplankton indicators monitored over 12 months indicated a low risk of the fungicide (0.73 or 0.77 mg pyrimethanil L-1, single application) to phytoplankton functioning; as expected since exposure simulated worst-case scenarios. However, the growth of key structural macroalgae and macrophytes was affected by the fungicide and negative effects occurred, especially in the Central zone experiment. Such effects were not detected earlier than approximately nine months post single pyrimethanil application. The presence or absence of such extremely long-lasting/delayed pyrimethanil effects depended on species, competitive situation, and ecoregion-specific physico-chemical environment. The present findings suggest that a better understanding of both direct and indirect effects of fungicide pollution on aquatic flora in two European ecoregions helps to consolidate the environmental risk assessment of pesticides in specific regulatory zones.",Comparison of stage/discharge rating curves derived from different recording systems: Consequences for streamflow data and water management in a Mediterranean island.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790765,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 15,"Obtaining representative hydrometric values is essential for characterizing extreme events, hydrological dynamics and detecting possible changes on the long-term hydrology. Reliability of streamflow data requires a temporal continuity and a maintenance of the gauging stations, which data are affected by epistemic and random sources of error. An assessment of discharge meterings' and stage-discharge rating curves' uncertainties were carried out by comparing the accuracy of the measuring instruments of two different hydrometric networks (i.e., one analogical and one digital) established in the same river location at the Mediterranean island of Mallorca. Furthermore, the effects of such uncertainties were assessed on the hydrological dynamics, considering the significant global change impacts beset this island. Evaluation was developed at four representative gauging stations of the hydrographic network with analogic (≈40 years) and digital (≈10 years) data series. The study revealed that the largest source of uncertainty in the analogical (28 to 274%) and in the digital (17-37%) networks were the stage-discharge rating curves. Their impact on the water resources was also evaluated at the event and annual scales, resulting in an average difference of water yields of 183% and 142% respectively. Such improvement on the comprehension of hydrometric networks uncertainties will dramatically benefit the interpretation of the long-term streamflow by providing better insights into the hydrologic and flood hazard planning, management and modelling.",Studying the effect of bioswales on nutrient pollution in urban combined sewer systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790764,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of bioswales on nutrient pollution in an urban combined sewershed. This evaluation was based on two criteria: the ability of bioswales to (1) remove nutrient pollution from stormwater runoff directly and (2) decrease sewer overflow volumes, which indirectly reduces total sewershed nutrient pollution during a storm event. Bioswales' direct nutrient removal was determined by analyzing nitrogen and phosphorus levels in water samples at seven bioswales located in the Bronx, New York City (NYC) over 42 storm events, while a bioswale's indirect nutrient removal through combined sewer overflow reduction was estimated by quantifying water retention at one of the bioswales. The study results indicated that: 1) the bioswale retained about 40% of stormwater conveyed to it from a drainage area 231 times its size, 2) bioswales leach nutrients into the subsurface, and 3) nitrogen leaching from bioswales varied seasonally, while phosphorus leaching decreased steadily over the study period. Although the studied bioswales leached a median 1.3 kg nitrogen per year into the subsurface, they provided an aggregate decrease in watershed nutrient pollution, from 7.7 to 6 kg nitrogen per year, due to their reduction of combined sewer overflow via stormwater retention.",Redox properties of compost-derived organic matter and their association with polarity and molecular weight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790763,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 15,"Compost-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM), which has a wide distribution of molecular weight (MW) and polarity, has a potential application in the remediation of the contaminated soil due to its redox-active functional groups. Composting treatment can change the MW and polarity of the DOM through microbial transformation and degradation. However, the relationship between the redox properties of compost-derived DOM and its MW and polarity is still unclear. DOM was extracted from municipal solid wastes with different composting times in this study, and it was further fractionated into humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and hydrophilic (HyI) fractions based on its hydrophobicity and XAD-8 resin. Electron transfer capacities [including electron accepting capacities (EAC) and electron donating capacities (EDC)] of the HA, FA and HyI fractions and their associations with polarity and MW were studied. The results showed that the EAC of the HA, FA and HyI all increased after composting. The EDC of the HA and HyI exhibited an increasing trend as well, though that of the FA decreased remarkably after composting. The MW, polarity and redox-active functional groups of the HA, FA and HyI fractions were determined using high performance liquid chromatography and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra coupled with parallel factor analysis. The result showed that the quinone-like groups were mainly detected in the medium MW and transphilic sub-fractions of the HA, FA and HyI, and were the main functional groups responsible for the EAC. The low MW sub-fractions, which consisted mainly of tyrosine-like matter, were the main functional components accounted for the EDC. The results advance our understanding of the influence of MW and polarity on the redox properties of organic substances, and facilitate to reveal the important redox-active functional groups when compost is utilized to remediate the contaminated soil.",Current and emerging methodologies for estimating carbon sequestration in agricultural soils: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790762,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 15,"This review covers the current and emerging analytical methods used in laboratory, field, landscape and regional contexts for measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soil. Soil depth plays an important role in estimating SOC sequestration. Selecting appropriate sampling design, depth of soil, use of proper analytical methods and base line selection are prerequisites for estimating accurately the soil carbon stocks. Traditional methods of wet digestion and dry combustion (DC) are extensively used for routine laboratory analysis; the latter is considered to be the ""gold standard"" and superior to the former for routine laboratory analysis. Recent spectroscopic techniques can measure SOC stocks in laboratory and in-situ even up to a deeper depth. Aerial spectroscopy using multispectral and/or hyperspectral sensors located on aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or satellite platforms can measure surface soil organic carbon. Although these techniques' current precision is low, the next generation hyperspectral sensor with improved signal noise ratio will further improve the accuracy of prediction. At the ecosystem level, carbon balance can be estimated directly using the eddy-covariance approach and indirectly by employing agricultural life cycle analysis (LCA). These methods have tremendous potential for estimating SOC. Irrespective of old or new approaches, depending on the resources and research needed, they occupy a unique place in soil carbon and climate research. This paper highlights the overview, potential limitations of various scale-dependent techniques for measuring SOC sequestration in agricultural soil.",Significant enhancement of electron transfer from Shewanella oneidensis using a porous N-doped carbon cloth in a bioelectrochemical system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790761,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Modifying the surface of an anode can improve electron transfer, thus enhancing the performance of the associated bioelectrochemical system. In this study, a porous N-doped carbon cloth electrode was obtained via a simple thermal reduction and etching treatment, and then used as the anode in a bioelectrochemical system. The electrode has a high nitrogen-to‑carbon (N/C) ratio (~3.9%) and a large electrochemically active surface area (145.4 cm2, about 4.4 times higher than that of the original carbon cloth), which increases the bacterial attachment and provides more active sites for extracellular electron transfer. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the peak anodic current (0.71 mA) of the porous N-doped carbon cloth electrode in riboflavin is 18 times higher than that of the original carbon cloth electrode (0.04 mA), confirming the presence of more electroactive sites for the redox reaction. We also obtained a maximum current density of 0.29 mA/cm2 during operation of a bioelectrochemical system featuring the porous N-doped carbon cloth electrode, which is 14.5 times higher than that of the original carbon cloth electrode. This result demonstrates that the adoption of our new electrode is a viable strategy for boosting the performance of bioelectrochemical systems.",Environmental DNA provides information on sediment sources: A study in catchments affected by Fukushima radioactive fallout.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790760,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"An excessive supply of sediment is observed in numerous rivers across the world where it leads to deleterious impacts. Information on the sources delivering this material to waterbodies is required to design effective management measures, and sediment tracing or fingerprinting techniques are increasingly used to quantify the amount of sediment derived from different sources. However, the current methods used to identify the land use contributions to sediment have a limited discrimination power. Here, we investigated the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide more detailed information on the plant species found in sediment source areas as a next generation fingerprint. To this end, flood sediment deposits (n = 12) were collected in 2017 in two catchments impacted by the Fukushima radioactive fallout along differing river sections draining forests, cropland or a mix of both land uses. Conventional fingerprints (i.e. fallout radionuclides and organic matter properties) were also measured in these samples. The conventional fingerprint model results showed that most sediment samples contained a dominant proportion of subsoil material. Nevertheless, the eDNA information effectively discriminated the three above-mentioned groups of sediment, with the dominance of tree, shrub and fern species in sediment sampled in rivers draining forests versus a majority of grass, algae and cultivated plant species in sediment collected in rivers draining cropland. Based on these encouraging results, future research should examine the potential of eDNA in mixed land use catchments where the contribution of topsoil to sediment dominates and where the cultivation of land has not been abandoned in order to better characterize the memory effect of eDNA in soils and sediment.","Biomonitoring of children exposure to urban pollution and environmental tobacco smoke with hair analysis - A pilot study on children living in Paris and Yeu Island, France.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790759,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The impact of pollution on children's health has been increasingly pointed out in numerous studies which emphasized their increased vulnerability compared to adults. This pilot study investigated the relevance of hair analysis for the assessment of children exposure to pollution and to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The methodology based on GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, is the first one to investigate simultaneously parent PAH (n = 15), PAH metabolites (n = 56), nicotine and cotinine in a biological matrix. The method was applied to hair samples collected from 25 children, aged from 2 to 11 years, living in Paris, France, selected as densely populated area with urban pollution including vehicle exhausts, and Yeu Island, a French island in the Atlantic ocean, selected as control area with low population density and no fuel powered vehicles. Nicotine and cotinine were detected in all the samples at concentrations up to 2275 pg/mg and 110 pg/mg respectively, suggesting exposure to ETS in the two areas. 10 parent PAH and 10 metabolites were detected in 100% and in >90% of the samples respectively. Eight of these biomarkers presented a significantly higher concentration in children from Paris than from Yeu Island. The results suggest association between PAH exposure and estimated time of exposure to vehicle exhaust as well as higher exposure to both PAH and ETS in the youngest children. Although these findings need to be confirmed on wider populations, the results obtained in this pilot study strongly support the relevance of hair analysis for the biomonitoring of children exposure to urban pollution and ETS."

In the sediments of the Yeongsan River estuary (St. YE), SR dominated the Corg oxidation pathway, accounting for 81.7% of total anaerobic Corg oxidation. Under the SR-dominated condition, H2S derived from SR reacts quickly with iron oxides to form iron sulfides, which ultimately release the P bound to Fe(III) into the pore water. The enhanced benthic P flux (0.24 mmol m-2 d-1) at the YE site accounted for 80% of the P required for primary production in the water column. In contrast, in the limnetic sediments of the Yeongsan Lake (St. YL), where high levels of CH4 accumulated, most P was bound to Fe and Al, which resulted in a low benthic P flux (0.03 mmol m-2 d-1). The results suggest that the frequent discharge of relatively P-depleted freshwater into the estuary via the artificial dyke may result in relatively P-limiting conditions in estuarine ecosystems. As a result, benthic P release from the SR-dominated estuarine sediment is a significant internal source of P in the coastal ecosystem. Our results indicate that the construction of a large dyke at a river mouth greatly alters Corg oxidation pathways and P dynamics in coastal ecosystems.",Future global pig production systems according to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790747,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Global pork production has increased fourfold over the last 50 years and is expected to continue growing during the next three decades. This may have considerable implications for feed use, land requirements, and nitrogen emissions. To analyze the development of the pig production sector at the scale of world regions, we developed the IMAGE-Pig model to describe changes in feed demand, feed conversion ratios (FCRs), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and nitrogen excretion for backyard, intermediate and intensive systems during the past few decades as a basis to explore future scenarios. For each region and production system, total production, productive characteristics and dietary compositions were defined for the 1970-2005 period. The results show that due to the growing pork production total feed demand has increased by a factor of two (from 229 to 471Tg DM). This is despite the improvement of FCRs during the 1970-2005 period, which has reduced the feed use per kg of product. The increase of nitrogen use efficiency was slower than the improvement of FCRs due to increasing protein content in the feed rations. As a result, total N excretion increased by more than a factor of two in the 1970-2005 period (from 4.6 to 11.1 Tg N/year). For the period up to 2050, the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) provide information on levels of human consumption, technical development and environmental awareness. The sustainability of pig production systems for the coming decades will be based not only on the expected efficiency improvements at the level of animal breeds, but also on four additional pillars: (i) use of alternative feed sources not competing with human food, (ii) reduction of the crude protein content in rations, (iii) the proper use of slurries as fertilizers through coupling of crop and livestock production and (iv) moderation of the human pork consumption.",A simple and safe method for tracheal intubation using a supraglottic intubation-aid device in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790746,Respiratory physiology & neurobiology,2019 05 30,"Although mice are a commonly used animal species in experimental medicine, airway management of this species is not easy due to their small size. In order to develop a new method of tracheal intubation in mice, we produced a supraglottic intubation-aid conduit (SIAC) for mice, and tested the efficacy of this device in spontaneously breathing mice anesthetized with sevoflurane inhalation. The success rate of tracheal intubation with the crude prototype of the SIAC was 50% and adverse effects on respiration and some trauma in the upper airway were occasionally observed. After refining the size and shape of the SIAC, the success rate of tracheal intubation with the refined prototype of the SIAC was 100% without any serious adverse effects. This study showed that it is possible to produce a supraglottic airway device to aid tracheal intubation in mice and that the shape and size of the SIAC play a crucial role in successful tracheal intubation in mice.",Are Anterior Communicating Aneurysms Truly Anterior Communicating Aneurysms?

In this study, we examined whether any cross talk exists between glucocorticoids and AMPK in the regulation of the liver bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Dexamethasone treatment decreased the growth performance of broiler chickens. The liver mRNA levels of fatty acid transport protein (FATP-1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), AMPK alpha 1 subunit (AMPKα1), and glucocorticoid receptor were significantly upregulated in DEX-treated broilers; the gene expression of liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) was significantly downregulated. The protein level of liver CYP7A1 was significantly decreased by DEX treatment at both 24 and 72 h, while the protein level of p-AMPK/ t-AMPK stayed unchanged. In the in vitro cultured hepatocytes, compound C pretreatment blocked the increase in CYP7A1 protein level by DEX and significantly suppressed FATP-1, SREBP-1c, FXR, and CYP7A1 gene expression stimulated by DEX. Compound C treatment significantly reduces the protein level of p-AMPK, and the combination of compound C and DEX significantly reduces the protein level of t-AMPK.

HDPs have great therapeutic potential against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, viruses and even parasites. However, high manufacturing costs have greatly limited their development as drugs, thus highlighting the need to develop novel and competitive production strategies. Here, a cost-effective procedure was established to produce the high amounts of peptides required for basic and clinical research. Firstly, a novel culture medium was designed, which was found to support significantly higher cell densities and recombinant expression levels of peptides under test compared to conventional media. The procedure has been also efficiently scaled up by using a 5 L fermenter, while the costs have been lowered significantly by developing a successful auto-induction strategy, which has been found to support higher yields of target constructs and cell biomass compared to conventional strategies based on expression induction by IPTG. Interestingly, it was estimated that by increasing production scale from 100 to 1000 mg/batch, unit costs decreased strongly from 253 to 42 €/mg. These costs appear highly competitive when compared to chemical synthesis strategies. Altogether, the data indicate that the strategy represents an important starting point for the future development of large-scale manufacture of HDPs."

To assess the role of protein kinases in the regulation of RegA function, this study identified phosphorylation sites on RegA and characterized the role of these modifications through the analysis of phospho-mimetic and phospho-ablative mutations. Mutations affecting residue T676 of RegA, a presumed target of the atypical MAP kinase Erk2, altered the rate of development and impacted cell distribution in chimeric organisms suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue reduces RegA function and regulates cell localization during multicellular development. Mutations affecting the residue S142 of RegA also impacted the rate developmental morphogenesis but in a manner opposite of changes at T676 suggesting the phosphorylation of the S142 residue increases RegA function. Mutations affecting residue S413 residue altered aggregate sizes and delayed developmental progression suggesting that PKA operates in a negative feedback mechanism to increase RegA function. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of different residues on RegA can lead to increased or decreased RegA function and therefore in turn regulate developmental processes such as aggregate formation, cell distribution, and the kinetics of developmental morphogenesis.",The population structure of Ochrobactrum isolated from entomopathogenic nematodes indicates interactions with the symbiotic system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790700,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) form specific mutualistic associations with bioluminescent enterobacteria. In Heterorhabditidis indica, Ochrobactrum spp. was identified beside the symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens but its involvement in the symbiotic association in the EPNs remains unclear. This study describe the population structure and the diversity in Ochrobactrum natural populations isolated from EPNs in the Caribbean basin in order to question the existence of EPN-specialized clones and to gain a better insight into Ochrobactrum-EPNs relationships. EPN-associated Ochrobactrum and Photorhabdus strains were characterized by multi-locus sequence typing, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis fingerprinting and phenotypic traits. Population study showed the absence of EPN-specialized clones in O. intermedium and O. anthropi but suggested the success of some particular lineages. A low level of genetic and genomic diversification of Ochrobactrum isolated from the natural population of Caribbean nematodes was observed comparatively to the diversity of human-associated Ochrobactrum strains. Correspondences between Ochrobactrum and P. luminescens PFGE clusters have been observed, particularly in the case of nematodes from Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. O. intermedium and O. anthropi associated to EPNs formed less biofilm than human-associated strains. These results evoke interactions between Ochrobactrum and the EPN symbiotic system rather than transient contamination. The main hypothesis to investigate is a toxic/antitoxic relationship because of the ability of Ochrobactrum to resist to antimicrobial and toxic compounds produced by Photorhabdus.",Phenotyping of Lewis and secretor HBGA from saliva and detection of new FUT2 gene SNPs from young children from the Amazon presenting acute gastroenteritis and respiratory infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790699,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"The Histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) are host genetic factors associated with susceptibility to rotavirus (RV) and human norovirus (HuNoV), the major etiological agents of viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. The FUT2 gene expressing the alpha-1, 2-L- fucosyltransferase enzyme is important for gut HBGA expression, and also provides a composition of the phenotypic profile achieved through mutations occurring in populations with different evolutionary histories; as such, it can be considered a genetic population marker. In this study, Lewis and secretor HBGA phenotyping was performed using 352 saliva samples collected from children between three months and five years old born in the Amazon (Brazil, Venezuela and English Guyana) presenting AGE or acute respiratory infection (ARI), the latter considered as control samples. The total of children phenotyped as secretors was 323, corresponding to 91.80%. From these, 207 (58.80%) had a Le (a + b+) profile. The HBGA profiles were equally found in children with AGE as well as with ARI. The rs1047781 of the FUT2 gene was not detected in DNA from saliva cells with a Le (a+b+) profile. However, mutations not yet described in the FUT2 gene were observed: missense 325A>T, 501C>T, 585C>T, 855A>T and missense substitutions 327C>T [S (Ser) > C (Cys)], 446 T>C [L(Leu) > P(Pro)], 723C>A [N(Asn) > K(Lys)], 724A>T [I(Ile) > F(Phe)], 736C>A [H(His) > N(Asn)].

If patients are untreated, 80% of patients with chronic HCV develop liver failure, liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV genotype 1 is the most prevalent among the infected individuals with HCV. Hepatic steatosis is known as accumulation of lipid molecules in hepatocytes, and its prevalence is approximately 55% in CHC infection. The reason of HCV-related hepatic steatosis in CHC infection is mainly HCV core protein. HCV core protein inhibits activities of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) which is a lipid transfer protein expressed in the liver. The -493G/T polymorphism in the promoter region of MTP gene has been associated with HCV-related hepatic steatosis. This polymorphism in MTP gene influences MTP mRNA expression, therefore which might also affect lipid transfer. We evaluated the association between MTP gene polymorphism and the risk of HCV genotype 1-related hepatic steatosis.",The effect of released new synthetic peptide from nanofibrous scaffold of peptide/Poly (Vinyl Alcohol)/Poly l-Lactic Acid on expression of Secretory aspartyl proteinases 4 to 6 genes of Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790697,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"Secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps), are gene products that have been shown to directly contribute to Candida albicans pathogenicity.

Recently, drug-loaded electrospun nanofibers have attracted a great deal of attention. In this study we have established the nanofibrous scaffold of new synthetic peptide/Poly (Vinyl Alcohol)/Poly l-Lactic Acid on expression of Secretory aspartyl proteinases 4 to 6 genes of C. albicans in comparison with free peptide. We designed new synthetic Antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) used bioinformatics tools to predict structure and stabilities. The electrospinning method was used to produce the polymeric nanofibers. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to measure the nanofibers diameters and morphology. To analyze the expression of SAP4, SAP5 and SAP6 genes, RNA was extracted from clinical isolates of C. albicans before and after treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of new synthetic peptide on nanofibrous scaffold of new synthetic peptide/PVA/PLLA and then the cDNA was synthesized and used for Real-time PCR assay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the morphology, the diameter, are affected from peptide. Reletive quantitative Real-time PCR results revealed that the mRNA levels of SAP4, SAP5 and SAP6 genes significantly decreased after treatment with nanofibrous scaffold of new synthetic peptide/PVA/PLLA (P < .05). Electrospun nanofibrous of new Synthetic Peptide/PVA/PLLA is effective in downregulating of expression SAP4, SAP5 and SAP6 genes of C. albicans strains.","Cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and subcellular localization of a nitrogen oxide and aminopropyl-β-lactose derivative ruthenium complex used as nitric oxide delivery agent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790696,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2019 06 16,"This work investigates how the luminescent ruthenium-nitrite complexes cis-[Ru(py-bodipy)(dcbpy)2(NO2)](PF6) (I) and cis-[Ru(py-bodipy)(dcbpy-aminopropyl-β-lactose)2(NO2)](PF6) (II) behave toward the melanoma cancer cell line B16F10. The chemical structure and purity of the synthesized complexes were analyzed by UV-Visible and FTIR spectroscopy, MALDI, HPLC, and 1H NMR. Spectrofluorescence helped to determine the fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes of each of these complexes. In vitro MTT cell viability assay on B16F10 cancer cells revealed that the complexes possibly have a tumoricidal role. The metal-nitrite complexes evidenced the dichotomous NO nature: at high concentration, NO exerted a tumoricidal effect, whereas cancer cells grew at low NO concentration. Flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy aided cellular uptake calculation. Cell staining followed by fluorescence microscopy associated with organelle markers such as DAPI and Rhodamine 123 detected preferential intracellular localization of the ruthenium-nitrite py-bodipy and aminopropyl lactose derivative ruthenium complex in mitochondria. Thus, the cytotoxicity of compounds (I) and (II) against B16F10 cancer cell line show concentration-dependent results. The present studies suggest that nitric oxide ruthenium derivative compounds could be new potential chemotherapeutic agents against cytotoxic cells.",Bystander automated external defibrillator application in non-shockable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790694,Resuscitation,2019 03 23,"An increasing proportion of patients with OHCA present with non-shockable rhythms, among whom the benefit from AED application is not known.",Passive leg raising in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790693,Resuscitation,2019 03 23,The use of passive leg raising (PLR) in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is sometimes discussed and even recommended.

IAV relies on host factors for viral replication. PB1 N40 is translated from the fifth starting code (AUG) of PB1 mRNA, which is the product of the ribosomal scan omission. Here, we report the interactome landscape of H5N1 IAV PB1 N40 protein in chicken cells. The interacting complexes were captured by co-immunoprecipitation and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We identified 135 proteins as PB1 N40-interacting proteins. GO and Pathway analysis showed that proteins with biological functions such as protein localization and viral transcription and proteins related to signaling pathways of DNA replication and cell cycle were significantly enriched in virus-host interactions, suggesting the potential roles of them in infection with H5N1 IAV. Comparative analysis among H1N1 and H5N1 revealed conservation of the virus-host protein interaction between different subtypes or strains of influenza virus. ARCN1 was identified as a host interacting factor of H5N1 IAV PB1 N40 protein, which is the component of the coatomer. Knockdown of ARCN1 significantly decreased the titer of H5N1 IAV in chicken cells. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a great threat to public health and avian production. However, the manner in which avian IAV recruits the host cellular machinery for replication and how the host antagonizes the IAV infection was previously poorly understood. Here we present the viral-host interactome of the H5N1 IAV PB1 N40 protein and reveal its involvement with dozens of important host genes during the course of IAV infection."

However, the specificity of this alteration and its possible relation with chronicity and treatment have received small attention. We have assessed small-world (SW) and connectivity strength indexes of the structural network built using fractional anisotropy values of the white matter tracts connecting 84 cortical and subcortical regions in 25 chronic and 18 first episode (FE) schizophrenia and 24 bipolar patients and 28 healthy controls. Chronic schizophrenia and bipolar patients showed significantly smaller SW and connectivity strength indexes in comparison with controls and FE patients. SW reduction was driven by increased averaged path-length (PL) values. Illness duration but not treatment doses were negatively associated with connectivity strength, SW and PL in patients. Bipolar patients exposed to antipsychotics did not differ in SW or connectivity strength from bipolar patients without such an exposure. Executive functions and social cognition were related to SW index in the schizophrenia group. Our results support a role for chronicity but not treatment in structural network alterations in major psychoses, which may not differ between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and may hamper cognition.","Schizophrenia, cannabis use and Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT): Modeling the interplay on cognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790675,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 07,"Cognitive impairments are considered core features of schizophrenia and are recognized as the most important predictors of functional outcome and quality of life. A better study of the mechanisms underlying the cognition is of extreme relevance. Literature has shown that several genetic and environmental factors affect cognitive performance. In particular, the interaction between Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene and cannabis use has gained increasing attention in the past years. Based on these premises, the present study, aimed to analyze the interplay between cannabis use and COMT polymorphism on cognitive performance in a sample of 135 patients with chronic schizophrenia. Patients were assessed for neurocognitive measures with a broad battery, genotyped for COMT Val158Met polymorphism from peripheral blood sample, and evaluated with a semi-structured interview in order to establish the history of cannabis abuse. Results showed a significant interaction effect between COMT polymorphism and cannabis use on verbal fluency and speed of processing. The analysis revealed significant differences between subjects COMT Val/Val homozygous and Met carriers with history of cannabis use, with a better performance on both tasks among the Met carriers group. These data are in line with literature on healthy subjects that suggests a more detrimental effect of cannabis among subjects with Val/Val genotype. In conclusions, results highlight the need to better disentangle the biological pathways in which cannabis use and COMT are converging, as possible treatment targets, as well as the importance to assess these factors in clinical to optimize individualized interventions.",The association of health-related quality of life and cerebral gray matter volume in the context of aging: A voxel-based morphometry study with a general population sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790673,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Health-related quality of life is likely associated with the brain via processes relating to physiology, behavior, cognition, emotion and stress. Previous studies with small student or clinical samples have identified associations with gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, (para)hippocampal area, amygdala, and precuneus. The present study investigated the association of gray matter volume of these brain areas with mental and physical components of health, as well as general health perception, measured with the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, in a large sample of 3027 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania, using voxel-based morphometry for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Higher physical, but not mental, health-related quality of life and general health perception were associated with larger gray matter volume of the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and the precuneus with a substantial decrease when controlling for lifestyle, comorbidity and symptoms. Age-stratified analyses revealed significantly higher partial correlations of physical health and left insular gray matter volume in the oldest age group. Our study emphasizes the importance of high medial prefrontal and anterior insula gray matter volume for health-related quality of life on the basis of a large sample size.","Amygdala-prefrontal cortex white matter tracts are widespread, variable and implicated in amygdala modulation in adolescents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790672,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"The amygdala is critically involved in processing emotion. Through bidirectional connections, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is hypothesized to influence amygdala reactivity. However, research that elucidates the nature of amygdala-PFC interactions - through mapping amygdala-prefrontal tracts, quantifying variability among tracts, and linking this variability to amygdala activation - is lacking. Using probabilistic tractography to map amygdala-prefrontal white matter connectivity in 142 adolescents, the present study found that white matter connectivity was greater between the amygdala and the subgenual cingulate, orbitofrontal (OFC), and dorsomedial (dmPFC) prefrontal regions than with the dorsal cingulate and dorsolateral regions. Then, using a machine-learning regression, we found that greater amygdala-PFC white matter connectivity was related to attenuated amygdala reactivity. This effect was driven by amygdala white matter connectivity with the dmPFC and OFC, supporting implicit emotion processing theories which highlight the critical role of these regions in amygdala regulation. This study is among the first to map and compare specific amygdala-prefrontal white matter tracts and to relate variability in connectivity to amygdala activation, particularly among a large sample of adolescents from a well-sampled study. By examining the association between specific amygdala-PFC tracts and amygdala activation, the present study provides novel insight into the nature of this emotion-based circuit.",Age-related alterations in axonal microstructure in the corpus callosum measured by high-gradient diffusion MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790671,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Cerebral white matter exhibits age-related degenerative changes during the course of normal aging, including decreases in axon density and alterations in axonal structure. Noninvasive approaches to measure these microstructural alterations throughout the lifespan would be invaluable for understanding the substrate and regional variability of age-related white matter degeneration. Recent advances in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have leveraged high gradient strengths to increase sensitivity toward axonal size and density in the living human brain. Here, we examined the relationship between age and indices of axon diameter and packing density using high-gradient strength diffusion MRI in 36 healthy adults (aged 22-72) in well-defined central white matter tracts in the brain. A recently validated method for inferring the effective axonal compartment size and packing density from diffusion MRI measurements acquired with 300 mT/m maximum gradient strength was applied to the in vivo human brain to obtain indices of axon diameter and density in the corpus callosum, its sub-regions, and adjacent anterior and posterior fibers in the forceps minor and forceps major. The relationships between the axonal metrics, corpus callosum area and regional gray matter volume were also explored. Results revealed a significant increase in axon diameter index with advancing age in the whole corpus callosum. Similar analyses in sub-regions of the corpus callosum showed that age-related alterations in axon diameter index and axon density were most pronounced in the genu of the corpus callosum and relatively absent in the splenium, in keeping with findings from previous histological studies. The significance of these correlations was mirrored in the forceps minor and forceps major, consistent with previously reported decreases in FA in the forceps minor but not in the forceps major with age. Alterations in the axonal imaging metrics paralleled decreases in corpus callosum area and regional gray matter volume with age. Among older adults, results from cognitive testing suggested an association between larger effective compartment size in the corpus callosum, particularly within the genu of the corpus callosum, and lower scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, largely driven by deficits in short-term memory. The current study suggests that high-gradient diffusion MRI may be sensitive to the axonal substrate of age-related white matter degeneration reflected in traditional DTI metrics and provides further evidence for regionally selective alterations in white matter microstructure with advancing age.",A compound heterozygosity of Tecrl gene confirmed in a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia family.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790670,European journal of medical genetics,2019 05 20,"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is one of the most common causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) during childhood and in adolescence.

Tecrl homozygous c.331+1G > A splice site mutation in iPSCs revealed a definite correlation between Tecrl and Ca2+ transport in cardiomyocytes. However, no other researchers have confirmed Tecrl mutations in CPVT with literature review. In this study, a case of compound heterozygosity in the Tecrl gene (Arg196Gln and c.918+3T > G splice site mutation) was first identified in a 13-year-old boy with CPVT by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and confirmed by Sanger sequence. Support vector machine and neural network analysis predicted that Arg196Gln mutation could decrease the stability of Tecrl structure, the confidence scores were -0.8929 and -0.9930. A STRUM server also confirmed that Arg196Gln mutation may decrease the binding capacity of the substrate and cause an amino acid substitution immediately upstream of the 3-oxo-5-alpha steroid 4-dehydrogenase domain. According to the ""human splicing finder"" indication and Alamut Visual Splicing Prediction, the c.918 + 3T > G mutation could influence Tecrl variable splicing.

It is unknown how these changes influence perception of whole body movement during dynamic stance. The aim of this study was to examine how postural threat influences whole-body movements and conscious perception of these movements during continuous pseudo-random support surface perturbations to stance. Sixteen healthy young adults stood on a moveable platform with their eyes closed for 7 min in a low threat (1.1 m above ground, away from edge) then high threat (3.2 m above ground, near edge) condition. Continuous pseudorandom roll platform rotations (± 4.5°, < 0.5 Hz) evoked large amplitude sway in the medio-lateral (ML) direction. Participants were asked to remain upright and avoid a fall at all times while tracking their ML body movements using a hand-held rotary encoder. Kinematic data was recorded using three markers placed on the upper trunk. Questionnaires assessed anxiety, fear and confidence. Electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded as an indicator of arousal. Height-induced threat increased fear, anxiety and EDA, and decreased confidence. Trunk sway amplitude remained constant, while tracked movement amplitude increased at height. The gain for perceived to trunk movement was significantly increased at height across frequencies. Threat-related increases in sensitivity of sensory systems related to postural control and changes in cognitive and attention processes may lead to misperceptions of actual movement amplitudes, which may be important when examining increased fall risk in those with a fear of falling.",State-Dependent Spike and Local Field Synchronization between the Thalamic Parafascicular Nucleus and the Dorsal Striatum in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790668,Neuroscience,2019 06 03,"Recent studies on the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the thalamostriatal pathway have mainly focused on the structural and functional changes in the thalamus projection to the striatum. Alterations in the electrophysiological activity of the thalamostriatal circuit in PD have not been intensively studied. To further investigate this circuit, parafascicular nucleus (PF) single-unit spikes and dorsal striatum local field potential (LFP) activities were simultaneously recorded in control and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats during inattentive rest or treadmill walking states. We classified the PF neurons into two predominant subtypes (PF I and PF II). During rest state, after dopamine loss, increased PF I spike and striatal LFP coherence was observed in the beta-frequency (12-35 Hz), with changed PF I neuronal firing pattern and unchanged firing rates of the two neuron subtypes. However, in a treadmill walking state, PF II neurons displayed markedly increased coherence to striatal beta oscillations in the dopamine-depleted rats, as well as an altered PF II neuronal firing pattern and significantly decreased firing rates of the two neuron subtypes. The results indicate that in PD animals, state transition from rest to moving, such as treadmill walking, is associated with different PF neuron types and increased spike-LFP synchronization, which may provide new paradigms for understanding and treating PD.",SNAP-25 in Major Psychiatric Disorders: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790667,Neuroscience,2019 03 12,"Synaptosomal Associated Protein-25 kilodaltons (SNAP-25) is an integral member of the SNARE complex. This complex is essential for calcium-triggered synaptic vesicular fusion and release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. In addition to neurotransmission, SNAP-25 is associated with insulin release, the regulation of intracellular calcium, and neuroplasticity. Because of SNAP-25's varied and crucial biological roles, the consequences of changes in this protein can be seen in both the central nervous system and the periphery. In this review, we will look at the published literature from human genetic, postmortem, and animal studies involving SNAP-25. The accumulated data indicate that SNAP-25 may be linked with some symptoms associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders. These disorders include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, alcohol use disorder, and dementia. There are also data suggesting SNAP-25 may be involved with non-psychiatric seizures and metabolic disorders. We believe investigation of SNAP-25 is important for understanding both normal behavior and some aspects of the pathophysiology of behavior seen with psychiatric disorders. The wealth of information from both animal and human studies on SNAP-25 offers an excellent opportunity to use a bi-directional research approach. Hypotheses generated from genetically manipulated mice can be directly tested in human postmortem tissue, and, conversely, human genetic and postmortem findings can improve and validate animal models for psychiatric disorders.",Brain Regional and Temporal Changes in BDNF mRNA and microRNA-206 Expression in Mice Exposed to Repeated Cycles of Chronic Intermittent Ethanol and Forced Swim Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790666,Neuroscience,2019 06 07,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and signaling activity in brain are influenced by chronic ethanol and stress. We previously demonstrated reduced Bdnf mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following chronic ethanol treatment and forced swim stress (FSS) enhanced escalated drinking associated with chronic ethanol exposure. The present study examined the effects of chronic ethanol and FSS exposure, alone and in combination, on Bdnf mRNA expression in different brain regions, including mPFC, central amygdala (CeA), and hippocampus (HPC). Additionally, since microRNA-206 has been shown to negatively regulate BDNF expression, the effects of chronic ethanol and FSS on its expression in the target brain regions were examined. Mice received four weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor or air exposure and then starting 72-h later, the mice received either a single or 5 daily 10-min FSS sessions (or left undisturbed). Brain tissue samples were collected 4-h following final FSS testing and Bdnf mRNA and miR-206 levels were determined by qPCR assay. Results indicated dynamic brain regional and time-dependent changes in Bdnf mRNA and miR-206 expression. In general, CIE and FSS exposure reduced Bdnf mRNA expression while miR-206 levels were increased in the mPFC, CeA, and HPC. Further, in many instances, these effects were more robust in mice that experienced both CIE and FSS treatments. These results have important implications for the potential link between BDNF signaling in the brain and ethanol consumption related to stress interactions with chronic ethanol experience."

The β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) was reported to play protective effects on inhibiting myocardial fibrosis in response to hemodynamic stress. However, the effects of ADRB3 on LVDD and its underlying mechanisms are still undefined. In the current study, the role of ADRB3 in LVDD was identified in ADRB3-knockout mice. Echocardiography parameters showed that depletion of ADRB3 had little effect on cardiac systolic function but obviously led to cardiac diastolic dysfunction in vivo. Proteomics (including the global proteome, phosphorylated and acetylated proteome) and bioinformatics analysis (including GO analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, GO-Tree network, Pathway-Act network, and protein-protein interaction network) were performed on cardiac specimens of ADRB3-KO mice and wild-type mice. The results showed that the cardiac energy metabolism (especially the citrate cycle), actin cytoskeleton organization, and cardiac muscle contraction (related to mitogen-activated protein kinase, toll-like receptor, and ErbB signalling pathway) were potential core mechanisms underlying ADRB3-KO-induced LVDD. In addition, the protein-protein interaction network indicated that the core proteins associated with ADRB3-KO-induced LVDD were FGG, ALDH1A1, FGA, APOC3, SLC4A1, SERPINF2, HP, CTNNB1, and TKT. In conclusion, the absence of ADRB3 leads to LVDD, which is potentially associated with the regulation of cardiac energy metabolism, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cardiac muscle contraction.",Usefulness of COMT gene polymorphisms in North African populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790653,Gene,2019 04 09,"The COMT gene encodes for catechol-O-methyl-transferase, an enzyme playing a major role in regulation of synaptic catecholamine neurotransmitters. Investigating 4 markers of the COMT gene (rs2020917, rs4818, rs4680, rs9332377) in 6 Tunisian populations and a pool of Libyans. Our objective was to determine the distribution of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies by comparison to other populations of the 1000 genomes project and 59 populations from the Kidd Lab dataset. The allelic frequencies established for these SNPs in the North African populations are similar to those of Europeans and South Asians. Linkage disequilibrium between these SNPs and haplotypes frequencies are different between populations whose clustering in principal components analysis (PCA) according to their geographic origin was more significant using haplotypic frequencies. COMT activity prediction by haplotypes genotyping could be limited to rs4818-rs4680 micro-haplotypes. The Low activity haplotype (CG) displays the highest frequency in African populations (55%), in the 59 Kidd Lab populations we found also that Sub-Saharan Africans, Native Americans, and some East Asian and Pacific Island populations all have frequencies in the 50-81% range for (CG) where as its lowest frequency was found in Europeans (10%), this results have been also confirmed for Southwest Asians. North Africans and South Asians with intermediate frequencies have approximately similar values (20% and 25%). Europeans show the highest frequencies of haplotypes with predicted High and Medium activity in contrast to Africans. North Africans and South Asians present similar results for all the category of the COMT activity prediction by haplotypes genotyping. The high level of genetic diversity of COMT haplotypes, not only allows distinction between populations according to their history settlement, origin and ethnicity, it constitutes a basis for studies of association of the COMT gene polymorphism with pathologies, drugs response and for forensic investigation in North African populations.",Down-regulated WDR35 contributes to fetal anomaly via regulation of osteogenic differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790652,Gene,2019 04 11,"Autosomal recessive disorder is closely correlated with congenital fetal malformation.

Their distributions appear to be controlled more by water and salinity. The Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans can tolerate high salt stress. Here, high-throughput sequencing was employed to study the transcriptional characteristics of P. nutans under salt stress. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis showed that 1340 genes were significantly upregulated and 831 genes were markedly downregulated. The expression of representative DEGs including abscisic acid (ABA) and Jasmonates (JAs) pathway-related genes, antioxidant enzyme genes, and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were analyzed by real-time PCR and most were upregulated after salt stress. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly increased after salt treatment. The levels of hydroxyl free radical (∙OH) first rose then quickly decreased. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD), and the flavonoid content were enhanced after salt stress. Exogenous application of ABA, Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or proanthocyanidins (PA) improved the performance of P. nutans in response to high salt stress. Furthermore, real-time PCR showed that ABA or MeJA treatment upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant and flavonoid biosynthesis-related enzymes. These results suggest that the responses of P. nutans under salt stress are involved in activating phytohormone signaling pathways which trigger two main antioxidant defense systems (i.e., antioxidant enzymes and flavonoids) for protecting cell and scavenging reactive oxygen species.",The Relative Efficacy and Safety of Mirabegron and OnabotulinumtoxinA in Patients With Overactive Bladder who Have Previously Been Managed With an Antimuscarinic: A Network Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790650,Urology,2019 06 14,To compare the efficacy and safety of mirabegron and onabotulinumtoxinA in the management of treatment-experienced patients with overactive bladder.,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Management of Distal Ureteral Stones in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790649,Urology,2019 06 14,To determine the most cost-effective approach to the management of distal ureteral stones in children given the potential for recurrent renal colic during a trial of passage versus potential stent discomfort and complications of ureteroscopy.,Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26) Online: Validation of an Internet-Based Instrument for Assessment of Health-Related Quality of Life After Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790648,Urology,2019 06 14,"To test the validity of an Internet-based version of Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) versus the phone-based version.

The reason is unclear, but one of the possibilities might be alternations in the level of the neurotransmitters and their receptors. Considering the critical role of N-Methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the molecular regulation of cognition, motor control, and synaptic plasticity, it is important to investigate interactions between SMF exposure and administration of NMDA receptor blockers such as MK-801. Now, we administered low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) MK-801 to the male Wistar rats, from postnatal day (P) 6 to 10 and investigate whether its effects change under the influence of SMF exposure. Morris water maze, open field test, rotarod, and elevated plus maze tests were performed on P60-63 to evaluate long-term effects on learning and memory, locomotion activities, and anxiety-like behaviors. Our results showed that administration of low-dose MK-801 did not lead to significant adverse effects on their long-term anxiety-like behaviors, locomotion, learning, and memory; however, simultaneous exposure to SMF can result in these adverse effects. In conclusion, exposure to SMF can augment the neurobehavioral effects of MK-801, by enhancing the blockage of the NMDA receptors. Further studies are required to confirm these results.",Prolactin prevents mitochondrial dysfunction induced by glutamate excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790645,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 31,"Prolactin (PRL) is a pleiotropic hormone secreted by several cells and tissues in the body, such as mammary glands, T-lymphocytes, hypothalamus, among others. This hormone possess neuroprotective properties against glutamate-excitotoxicity through the activation of NF-kB, suggesting it could exert an antioxidant action. However, the role of PRL on the antioxidant defense during glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is not clear to date. Therefore, in the present study, we have evaluated the effect of PRL on SOD activity and protein content of both of its isoforms (Mn2+-SOD and Cu2+/Zn2+-SOD), as well as, its action on mitochondrial activity in primary culture of hippocampal neurons of rats. Additionally, we have evaluated the possible antioxidant effect of PRL through the determination of lipid peroxidation products (LPO), measured as malondialdehyde (MDA). Results show that PRL enhances the activity and the protein content of Mn2+-SOD and Cu2+/Zn2+-SOD in neurons exposed to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, our results demonstrate that PRL prevents mitochondrial dysfunction induced by glutamate and significantly decreases the levels of LPO products. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a potential antioxidant effect of PRL has been described in hippocampal neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity, opening questions of its potentiality for therapeutics."

Six major databases were systematically searched for trials comparing hypnotic inductions with no-intervention control conditions on pain ratings, threshold and tolerance using experimentally-evoked pain models in healthy participants. Eighty-five eligible studies (primarily crossover trials) were identified, consisting of 3632 participants (hypnosis nö=ö2892, control nö=ö2646). Random effects meta-analysis found analgesic effects of hypnosis for all pain outcomes (gö=ö0.54-0.76, p's<.001). Efficacy was strongly influenced by hypnotic suggestibility and use of direct analgesic suggestion. Specifically, optimal pain relief was obtained for hypnosis with direct analgesic suggestion administered to high and medium suggestibles, who respectively demonstrated 42% (pö<ö.001) and 29% (pö<ö.001) clinically meaningful reductions in pain. Minimal benefits were found for low suggestibles. These findings suggest that hypnotic intervention can deliver meaningful pain relief for most people and therefore may be an effective and safe alternative to pharmaceutical intervention. High quality clinical data is, however, needed to establish generalisability in chronic pain populations.",Coordinating what we've learned about memory consolidation: Revisiting a unified theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790633,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"According to traditional systems consolidation theories neocortical long-term plasticity (i.e., cellular consolidation) lags behind, and is dependent upon, hippocampal long-term plasticity. In this review, we examine accumulating evidence that local neocortical and hippocampal cellular consolidation occurs with a similar time-course. The implication is that the rate-limiting step for systems consolidation is the time it takes for cellular consolidation in longer connections throughout a more distributed extra-hippocampal system that comes to coordinate distributed neocortical activity during recall. The hippocampus is, thus, crucial for the development of this extra-hippocampal coordinating system, and acts to coordinate activities crucial for recall until it develops. Recent work on schema formation, engram cells, and the role of sleep in consolidation add substantial evidence for this ""unified theory"" of systems and cellular consolidation. Here, we discuss this evidence, its implications, and consider remaining questions.",HPA axis regulation in posttraumatic stress disorder: A meta-analysis focusing on potential moderators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790632,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often associated with alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Previous findings are inconsistent, possibly due to trauma exposure of controls or different hormone measurement methods. We investigated cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S) in adults with clinical PTSD under basal or challenged conditions (Prospero registration no. CRD42016041690). A search of PubMed, Scopus, Medline, PsycINFO, Pilots/ProQuest, and Web of Science resulted in 108 included studies (N = 6484).

Significant cortisol increases occurred after awakening in PTSD (g = 0.40; CI: 0.13-0.67) and in non-exposed controls (g = 0.96; CI: 0.59-1.33). Evening DHEA was significantly higher in PTSD than in non-exposed controls (g = 0.58; CI: 0.17-0.99). All groups showed large cortisol suppression effects after dexamethasone administration. Overall, the potential moderators investigated did not reveal a consistent pattern of HPA alterations.",Evidence that Moderate Eviction of Spt5 and Promotion of Error-Free Transcriptional Bypass by Rad26 Facilitates Transcription Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790631,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 01,"Transcription coupled repair (TC-NER) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair triggered by stalling of RNA polymerase at DNA lesions. It has been suspected that transcriptional misincorporations of certain nucleotides opposite lesions that result in irreversible transcription stalling might be important for TC-NER. However, the spectra of nucleotide misincorporations opposite UV photoproducts and how they are implicated in transcriptional stalling and TC-NER in the cell remain unknown. Rad26, a low abundant yeast protein, and its human homolog CSB have been proposed to facilitate TC-NER in part by positioning and stabilizing stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at DNA lesions. Here, we found that substantial AMPs but no other nucleotides are transcriptionally misincoporated and extended opposite UV photoproducts and adjacent bases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad26 does not significantly affect either the misincorporation or extension of AMPs. At normally low or moderately increased levels, Rad26 promotes error-free transcriptional bypass and TC-NER of UV photoproducts. However, Rad26 completely loses these functions when it is overexpressed to ~1/3 the level of RNAPII molecules. Also, Rad26 does not directly displace RNAPII but constitutively evicts Spt5, a key transcription elongation factor and TC-NER repressor, from the chromatin. Our results indicate that transcriptional nucleotide misincorporation is not implicated in TC-NER, and moderate eviction of Spt5 and promotion of error-free transcriptional bypass of DNA lesions by Rad26 facilitates TC-NER.",Kat6b Modulates Oct4 and Nanog Binding to Chromatin in Embryonic Stem Cells and Is Required for Efficient Neural Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790630,Journal of molecular biology,2019 03 19,"Chromatin remodeling is fundamental for the dynamical changes in transcriptional programs that occur during development and stem cell differentiation. The histone acetyltransferase Kat6b is relevant for neurogenesis in mouse embryos, and mutations of this gene cause intellectual disability in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in Kat6b mutant phenotype and the role of this chromatin modifier in embryonic stem (ES) cells remain elusive. In this work, we show that Kat6b is expressed in ES cells and is repressed during differentiation. Moreover, we found that this gene is regulated by the pluripotency transcription factors Nanog and Oct4. To study the functional relevance of Kat6b in ES cells, we generated a Kat6b knockout ES cell line (K6b-/-) using CRISPR/Cas9. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analyses suggest a more compact chromatin organization in K6b-/- cells and impaired interactions of Oct4 and Nanog with chromatin. Remarkably, K6b-/- cells showed a reduced efficiency to differentiate to neural lineage. These results reveal a role of Kat6b as a modulator of chromatin plasticity, its impact on chromatin-transcription factors interactions and its influence on cell fate decisions during neural development.",Specific and Fuzzy Interactions Cooperate in Modulating Protein Half-Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790629,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 08,"Protein degradation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The 20S proteasome is selective for unfolded, extended polypeptide chains without ubiquitin tags. Sequestration of such segments by protein partners, however, may provide a regulatory mechanism. Here we used the AP-1 complex to study how c-Fos turnover is controlled by interactions with c-Jun. We show that heterodimerization with c-Jun increases c-Fos half-life. Mutations affecting specific contact sites (L165V, L172V) or charge separation (E175D, E189D, K190R) with c-Jun both modulate c-Fos turnover, proportionally to their impact on binding affinity. The fuzzy tail beyond the structured b-HLH/ZIP domain (~165 residues) also contributes to the stabilization of the AP-1 complex, removal of which decreases c-Fos half-life. Thus, protein turnover by 20S proteasome is fine-tuned by both specific and fuzzy interactions, consistently with the previously proposed ""nanny"" model.",Detecting coevolution of positively selected in turtles sperm-egg fusion proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790628,Mechanisms of development,2019 05 01,"Physically interacting sperm-egg proteins have been identified using gene-modified animals in some mammal species. Three proteins are essential for sperm-egg binding: Izumo1 on the sperm surface, and JUNO and CD9 on the egg surface. Most proteins linked to reproductive function evolve rapidly among species by positive selection, and have correlated evolutionary rates to compensate for changes on both the sperm and egg. Up to now, interactions between sperm and egg proteins have not been identified in non-mammalian vertebrates, such as turtles that have interspecific hybrids that can produce surviving F1 generations. To explore the potential physical interactions of sperm-egg proteins in turtle species, the coding region of Izumo1, JUNO, and CD9 homologous genes (named Tu-Izumo1, Tu-JUNO, and Tu-CD9) in six turtle species (Mauremys reevesii, M. mutica, M. sinensis, Cistoclemmys flavomarginata, Platysternon megacephalum and Chrysemys picta bellii) were identified, amplified, and sequenced, and tissue-specific expression was analyzed in M. reevesii. We constructed phylogenetic trees and analyzed the signatures of coevolution between sperm-egg protein pairs using MirrorTree Server and linear regression methods. The results showed that Tu-Izumo1, Tu-JUNO, and Tu-CD9 proteins have correlated evolutionary rates, and that the area where Tu-Izumo1 interacts with Tu-JUNO has only one positive selection site in some turtle species. These results suggest there is a potential interaction between Tu-Izumo1 and Tu-JUNO among turtles that can interbreed, and that a significantly lower positive selection in the interaction region may be one of the reasons why turtle hybrids are so common. Further studies are required to uncover Tu-Izumo1, Tu-JUNO and Tu-CD9 protein biological functions during gamete fusion.",Up-regulation of TREM2 accelerates the reduction of amyloid deposits and promotes neuronal regeneration in the hippocampus of amyloid beta1-42 injected mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790627,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 03 23,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a robust inflammatory response elicited by the accumulation and subsequently deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) within the brain. The immune cells of brain migrate to and invest their processes within Aβ plaques and clear plaques from the brain. Previous studies have shown that treatment of myeloid cell with nuclear factor inhibitor increases expression of phagocytesis-related genes, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). In myeloid cells, TREM2 has been involved in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell proliferation as well as inflammatory response in vitro. The purpose of this study was to further investigate microglial proliferation, phagocytosis and the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced by up-regulation of TREM2 in Aβ1-42 injected mice. We first singly injected Aβ1-42 into the hippocampus of mice to build the model of AD-like symptoms. Subsequently, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) was injected into the lateral ventricle of mice. Various immunohistochemical techniques and Western blot analyses were applied to examine expressions of TREM2, microglia, Aβ, Neuronal migration protein doublecortin (DCX) and BDNF in the hippocampus of mice. In the present study, we found the plaques-associated microglia lowly expressed TREM2 and BDNF in Aβ1-42 intra-hippocampal injected mice. Treatment of the models with a nuclear factor inhibitor, PDTC, further induced the expression of TREM2 and enhanced microglial phagocytosis, coincident with the rapid reduction in plaque burden. The expression of BDNF was up-regulated and the expression of DCX was partly restored. This means that up-regulation of TREM2 might induce the microglia to express the BDNF. These findings further indicate that the level of TREM2 may affect the microglia response to pathological process induced by Aβ.",Conditioned medium obtained from mesenchymal stem cells attenuates focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury through activation of ERK1/ERK2-BDNF signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790626,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 03 23,"Previous studies have shown that conditioned medium (CM) obtained from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might exert neuroprotective effects against focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was conducted to investigate if CM obtained from MSCs gives rise to neuroprotection by targeting neurogenesis. To induce focal cerebral ischemia in rats, middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded for 1 h and the amniotic mesenchymal stem cells-conditioned medium (AMSC-CM) at the dose of 0.5 μl was administered 30 min after reperfusion by stereotactic intracerebral infusion. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham operated animals received all procedures except occlusion of MCA (sham, n = 12), I/R group only received occlusion of MCA (MCAO, n = 17), treatment group received MCAO + 0.5 μl of AMSC-CM (MCAO + AMSC-CM, n = 17). The expression of Phospho-ERK1/ERK2, BDNF, VEGF and NGF were determined using immunohistochemical assay. Neuronal loss and DNA fragmentation were evaluated by Nissl and TUNEL assay, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the expression of Phospho-ERK1/ERK2 and BDNF, VEGF and NGF significantly decreased in MCAO rats and was reversed by AMSC-CM. Likewise, AMSC-CM markedly reduced neuronal loss and DNA fragmentation at 24 h after reperfusion. In sum, our study showed that AMSC-CM administration at the onset of reperfusion led to neuroprotection by activating neuronal ERK1/ERK2-BDNF signaling pathway, neurogenesis, angiogenesis as well as suppression of apoptosis.",Comparative Analysis of Established Risk Scores and Novel Hemodynamic Metrics in Predicting Right Ventricular Failure in Left Ventricular Assist Device Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790625,Journal of cardiac failure,2019 03 17,"Right ventricular failure (RVF) portends poor outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.

Cordycepin, a small molecule extracted from cordyceps sinensis, has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor properties. In this study, we explored its possible beneficial effects on PD. PD rat models and cell models were established via 1‑methyl‑4‑phenyl‑1,2,3,6‑tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) injection and LPS treatment respectively, and cordycepin was administered. The motor functions of rats were examined, and the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive DA neurons and Iba1-positive microglia were detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. The expression levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress-related factors were also measured in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the TLR/NF-κB pathway was investigated to explore the mechanism. We found that in vivo, MPTP injection introduced motor disorders, the loss of DA neurons and the activation of TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway. Cordycepin treatment alleviated these MPTP-induced changes. In vitro, the results were confirmed in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cells. Moreover, cordycepin mitigated the cytotoxic effects on PC12 cells produced by microglia.

However, little is known about the level of stability in HRB cluster membership during mid-adulthood and how social circumstances in early mid-adulthood may influence movement between HRB clusters during mid-life. Data were taken from a British cohort born in 1958 (N = 12,784), to examine the stability of membership of three HRB clusters: 'Risky', 'Moderate Smokers' and 'Mainstream' (the latter pattern consisting of more beneficial HRBs such as not smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, being physically active), between ages 33 and 42. The relationship between social circumstances at age 33 and movement between HRB clusters during mid-adulthood was also examined. HRB cluster membership was relatively stable during mid-adulthood, over 60% of the participants remained in the same cluster at both ages. However, there was considerable probability of movement from the 'Risky' and 'Moderate Smokers' clusters at age 33 to the 'Mainstream' cluster at age 42. Members of the 'Risky' cluster had a lower probability of transitioning to the 'Mainstream' cluster (men = 17%, women = 9%, p < 0.001) in comparison to the 'Moderate Smokers' cluster (men = 26%, women = 27%, p < 0.001).

The enzyme toxicity was evaluated using mammalian cell lineages: HEK-293, J774.A1, Sarcoma-180 and PBMCs which appeared to be viable at a level of 80%. The biochemical parameters of the mice treated with an acute dose of enzyme (2000 mg/mL) identified alterations of AST and ALT and the histomorphometric analysis of the liver showed a loss of endothelial cells (P < 0.001). However, these changes are considered minimal to affirm that there was a significant degree of hepatotoxicity. The comet assay and the micronucleus test did not identify damage in the DNA of the erythrocytes of the animals treated. The protease did not degrade the Aα and Bβ chains of human and bovine fibrinogens, thus indicating that it does not act as anticoagulant, but rather as a fibrinolytic agent. The assay performed to assess blood biocompatibility shows that at dose of 0.3-5 mg/mL the hemolytic grade is considered insignificant. Moreover, the enzyme did not prolong bleeding time in mice when dosed with 1 mg/kg. These results indicate that this enzyme produced is a potential competitor for developing novel antithrombotic drugs.",Healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use in long-term care facilities (HALT3): an overview of the Italian situation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790605,The Journal of hospital infection,2019 04 12,"Awareness of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial use in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) is increasing.

AMPs are components of innate immune system of eukaryotes and are not prone to the conventional mechanisms that are responsible of drug resistance. Fish are an important source of AMPs and, recently, we have isolated and characterized a new 22 amino acid residues peptide, the chionodracine (Cnd), from the Antarctic icefish Chionodraco hamatus. In this paper we focused on a new Cnd-derived mutant peptide, namely Cnd-m3a, designed to improve the selectivity against prokaryotic cells and the antimicrobial activity against human pathogens of the initial Cnd template. Cnd-m3a was used for immunization of rabbits, which gave rise to a polyclonal antibody able to detect the peptide. The interaction kinetic of Cnd-m3a with the Antarctic bacterium Psychrobacter sp. (TAD1) was imaged using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) immunogold method. Initially the peptide was associated with the plasma membrane, but after 180 min of incubation, it was found in the cytoplasm interacting with a DNA target inside the bacterial cells. Using fluorescent probes we showed that the newly designed mutant can create pores in the outer membrane of the bacteria E. coli and Psychrobacter sp. (TAD1), confirming the results of TEM analysis. Moreover, in vitro assays demonstrated that Cnd-m3a is able to bind lipid vesicles of different compositions with a preference toward negatively charged ones, which mimics the prokaryotic cell. The Cnd-m3a peptide showed quite low hemolytic activity and weak cytotoxic effect against human primary and tumor cell lines, but high antimicrobial activity against selected Gram - human pathogens. These results highlighted the high potential of the Cnd-m3a peptide as a starting point for developing a new human therapeutic agent.",Pretransplant HLA typing revealed loss of heterozygosity in the major histocompatibility complex in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790598,Human immunology,2019 03 20,Chromosomal abnormalities are frequent events in hematological malignancies.

SG, the suppression of irrelevant and redundant stimuli, is measured in a conditioning-testing (S1-S2) paradigm eliciting electroencephalography-derived P50 event-related potentials (ERPs), the S2 amplitudes of which are typically suppressed relative to S1. Despite extensive reports of nicotine-related improvements and several decades of research, an efficient nicotinic treatment has yet to be approved for SCZ. Following reports of SG improvements in low P50 suppressing SCZ patients and healthy participants with the α7 agonist, CDP-choline, this pilot study examined the combined modulatory effect of CDP-choline (500 mg) and galantamine (16 mg), a nAChR positive allosteric modulator and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on SG to speech stimuli in twenty-four SCZ patients in a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design. As expected, in low P50 suppressors CDP-choline/galantamine (vs. Placebo) improved rP50 and dP50 scores by increasing inhibitory mechanisms as reflected by S2P50 amplitude reductions. Results also suggest a moderating role for auditory verbal hallucinations in treatment response. These preliminary findings provide supportive evidence for the involvement of α7 nAChR activity in speech gating in SCZ and support additional trials, examining different dose combinations and repeated doses of this optimized and personalized targeted α7 cholinergic treatment for SG dysfunction in subgroups of SCZ patients.",Sex differences in event-related potential (ERP) waveforms of primary psychotic disorders: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790596,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2019 03 26,"Research aimed at understanding primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and schizoaffective disorder, with electrophysiological methods has flourished over recent years. However, a significant component that is often overlooked or underreported in electrophysiological research of psychosis is the factor of biological sex. Thus, the goal of this systematic review was to summarize the current understanding of EEG sex differences in primary psychotic disorders. Our study found a consistent sex difference relating to the P300 component (male amplitude < females), and that research examining sex differences of ERP waveforms, other than the P300, is very limited with ambiguous findings. This review also addressed the lack of consideration of sex as an influencing factor in electrophysiological research."

Biochemical and modelling studies based on the structure of the bacterial homologue LeuT are consistent with a transport mechanism whereby the binding pocket is alternately accessible to either side of the membrane. This is achieved by the sequential opening and closing of extracellular and intracellular gates. The amino acid residues participating in the formation of these gates are highly conserved within the neurotransmitter:sodium: symporter family. Net flux requires that the gating mechanism is operative regardless if the binding pocket is loaded with substrate or empty. On the other hand, exchange of labelled for non-labelled substrate across the membrane only requires gating in the presence of substrate. To address the question if the gating requirements of the substrate-bound and empty transporters are similar or different, we analyzed the impact of mutation of intra- and extra-cellular gate residues on net GABA influx and on exchange by liposomes inlaid with the mutant transporters. Whereas net flux by all four internal gate mutants tested was severely abrogated, each exhibited significant levels of exchange. In contrast, two external gate mutants were impaired in both processes. Our results indicate that perturbation of the internal gate of GAT1 selectively impairs the gating mechanism of the empty transporter.","A ""Dual"" Cell-Level Systems PK-PD Model to Characterize the Bystander Effect of ADC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790581,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 03 29,"Here, we have developed a cell-level systems PK-PD model to characterize the bystander effect of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Cytotoxicity data generated following incubation of Trastuzumab-vc-MMAE in cocultures of high HER2-expressing N87 and low HER2-expressing GFP-MCF7 cells were used to build the model. Single-cell PK model for ADC was used to characterize the PK of trastuzumab-vc-MMAE and released MMAE in N87 and GFP-MCF7 cells. The 2 cell-level PK models were mechanistically integrated to mimic the coculture condition. MMAE-induced intracellular occupancy of tubulin was used to drive the efficacy of ADC, and improvement in the tubulin occupancy of GFP-MCF7 cells in the presence of N87 cells was used to drive the bystander effect of trastuzumab-vc-MMAE. The ""dual"" cell-level PK-PD model was able to capture the observed data reasonably well. It was found that similar and high occupancy of tubulin by MMAE was required to achieve the cytotoxic effect in each cell line. In addition, estimated model parameters suggested that ∼60% improvement in the tubulin occupancy was required to attain half of the maximum bystander killing effect by the ADC. The presented model provides foundation for in vivo systems PK-PD model to characterize and predict the bystander effect of ADCs.",An Assessment of the Ability of Submicron- and Micron-Size Silicone Oil Droplets in Dropped Prefillable Syringes to Invoke Early- and Late-Stage Immune Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790580,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 03 19,"A number of biopharmaceuticals are available as lyophilized formulations along with a prefilled syringe (PFS) containing water for injection (WFI). Submicron- and micron-size droplets of lubricating silicone oil (SO) applied to the inner surface of the PFS barrel might migrate into the WFI, to which protein pharmaceuticals can adsorb, potentially inducing an immune response. In the present study, we subjected siliconized cyclo-olefin polymer PFSs filled with WFI to dropping stress to simulate actual shipping conditions as well as evaluated the risk associated with the released SO droplets. The results confirmed the undesirable effects of SO on therapeutic proteins, including adsorption to SO droplets and increased secretion of several innate cytokines from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a small donor panel. Assessment of immunogenicity in vivo using BALB/c mice revealed a slight increase in the plasma concentrations of antidrug antibodies over 21 days in response to SO-containing antibody samples compared to the absence of SO. These results indicate that SO droplets form complexes with pharmaceutical proteins that can potentially invoke early- and late-stage immune responses. Therefore, the use of SO-free cyclo-olefin polymer PFSs as primary containers for WFI could contribute to the enhanced safety of reconstituted biopharmaceuticals.",Inhibitory effects of flavonoids on P-glycoprotein in vitro and in vivo: Food/herb-drug interactions and structure-activity relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790579,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 03 18,"Flavonoids are a class of polyphenol antioxygen, despite various known biological activities and therapeutic potential, scattered but not much is known about their interactions with drug transporters. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as a cellular defense mechanism by effluxing its substrates has been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of 75 flavonoids on P-gp in vitro and in vivo and to illuminate the structure-activity relationships of flavonoids with P-gp. Five flavonoids, including tangeretin, sinensetin, isosinensetin, sciadopitysin and oroxylin A exhibited significant inhibition on P-gp in MDR1-MDCKIIcells, which reduced the P-gp-mediated efflux of paraquat and taxol and consequently increased their cell toxicity. In addition, co-administration of digoxin with five flavonoids increased the AUC0-t of digoxin in different extents in rats, from 19.84% to 81.51%. Molecular docking assays elucidated the inhibitory effect of flavonoids might be related to Pi interactions, but not hydrogen bonds. The pharmacophore model suggested the hydrophobic groups in B benzene ring may play a vital role in the potency of flavonoids inhibition on P-gp. Taken together, our findings would provide the basis for a reliable assessment of the potential risks of flavonoid-containing food/herb-drug interactions in humans.",Experimental evidence for maternal provisioning of alkaloid defenses in a dendrobatid frog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790578,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 05 07,"Dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid defenses from dietary arthropods.

Captive-raised females were fed the synthetic alkaloid decahydroquinoline (DHQ), which we subsequently quantified in their skin, eggs, and developing tadpoles. DHQ quantity was positively associated with tadpole mass/development, suggesting high sequestration rates by tadpoles. These data confirm that tadpoles obtain nutrition and alkaloids by feeding exclusively on maternally provisioned eggs.",Inactivation of lectins from castor cake by alternative chemical compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790577,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 04,"Enabling the use of castor cake in animal feeding is an excellent alternative strategy to reduce feed costs. The cake is a by-product derived from the extraction of the castor oil by the biodiesel industry whose chemical composition is satisfactory despite the presence of antinutritional factors like toxic lectins, which require detoxification before it can be used as a dietary ingredient. The aim of the present study was to evaluate alternative chemical sources in the degradation and inactivation of ricin and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), two lectins from castor cake. Ten chemical compounds were evaluated: sodium hydroxide, monodicalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcitic limestone, magnesian limestone, urea, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. Gel electrophoresis indicated 100% lectin degradation only in the cakes treated with 90 g sodium hydroxide and 2500 mL water per kg of cake. The hemagglutination assay was crucial to providing innocuousness to the treated cakes, with total absence of hemagglutinating activity observed in the castor cakes treated with 60 or 90 g sodium hydroxide in water volumes equal to or higher than 1500 mL/kg of castor cake and in the cakes treated with 90 g calcium oxide with 2500 or 3000 mL water/kg castor cake. Thus, though depending on the concentration of the chemical compound and on the volume of water per kilogram of treated cake, sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide showed to be promising chemical products for degradation and complete inactivation of the lectins present in castor cake to allow its use as an ingredient in animal diets.","Burrowing and nest building activity in mice after exposure to grid floor, isoflurane or ip injections.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790576,Physiology & behavior,2019 05 15,"Burrowing and nest building are examples of highly motivated innate behaviours in rodents. Assessments based on these behaviours can be used as non-invasive indicators of pain, distress and suffering. In this study, we investigated the effect of three stressful procedures, namely grid floor housing for 24 h, 15 min of isoflurane anaesthesia and an intraperitoneal saline injection daily for three days, on nest building and burrowing in female C57BL/6NTac mice. For burrowing, we also investigated the effect of the presence of a shelter and nesting material (standard home cage enrichment) versus no shelter and nesting material, and whether the test can be performed during normal working hours. Alongside this, we investigated the effect of grid floor, isoflurane anaesthesia and intraperitoneal injections on stress hormone level, body weight, fur status and sucrose preference. The burrowing test was found to be sensitive to 24 h grid floor housing when no shelter but only a cardboard tube was present during testing. The mice burrowed a mean of 21 g less after grid floor housing (P < .01). This change was accompanied by decreased sucrose preference (P < .01) and body weight (P < .01). 15 min of anaesthesia with isoflurane induced changes in the nest building activity test. After exposure to isoflurane the mice built less complex nests (P = .04). This was accompanied by a decrease in sucrose preference (P < .01), a decrease in body weight (P < .01), and elevated stress hormone levels (P < .01). One daily intraperitoneal injection of saline for three days did not result in changes in nest building activity (P > .01). We also found that the mice burrowed equal amount during normal working hours and prior to the dark phase, indicating that the burrowing test can be performed during normal working hours instead of prior to the dark phase (P = .62).",Functional genomics of dietary restriction and longevity in yeast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790575,Mechanisms of ageing and development,2019 03 26,"Dietary restriction-limitation of calories or other specific nutrients in the diet-is the sole non-genetic intervention known to extend the lifespan of a wide range of model organisms from yeast to mammals. Cell biology studies on the responses to dietary restriction have provided important clues about the mechanisms of longevity; however, a comprehensive genome-wide description of lifespan by dietary restriction has been mostly absent. Large-scale genetic analysis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers a great opportunity to uncover the conserved systems-level mechanisms that give way to longevity in response to diet. Here, we review recent advances in high-throughput phenotyping of the replicative and chronological life spans of yeast cells, which have contributed to our understanding of longevity by dietary restriction and the cellular crosstalks of nutrient-sensing regulation.",Impact of phenolic compounds on Meloidogyne incognita in vitro and in tomato plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790574,Experimental parasitology,2019 04 22,"Exposing second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne incognita in vitro to a phenolic compound sometimes fails to cause J2 mortality, but in tests in vivo the same compound may reduce the infectivity and population of the nematode. This work aimed to study the effect of phenolic compounds on M. incognita through in vitro and in vivo assays. In the in vitro assay 49 phenolic compounds were screened for their toxicity to M. incognita J2. As a result, D-(-)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, t-butylhydroquinone, L-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)alanine, sesamol, 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, and p-anisaldehyde increased the J2 mortality. These compounds presented, respectively, the following lethal concentrations to 50% of J2 (LC50): 365, 352, 251, 218, 210, and 85 μg/mL, while Carbofuran (positive control) had 150 μg/mL. However, none of these compounds were efficient in controlling the nematode in inoculated tomato plants, even when 2.77-fold of their LC50 were used. Although inactive in the in vitro test at 500 μg/mL, hydroquinone (3.5 mg per plant) reduced M. incognita population and galls by up to 99% to levels similar to the nematicide Carbofuran (1.2 mg per plant). Additionally, hydroquinone increased the root weight when compared to the negative and positive controls, water/NaOH and Carbofuran, respectively. In this study, we showed that some phenolic compounds, hydroquinone in particular, revealed a potential new option for the control of M. incognita.",Sodium arsenite augments sensitivity of Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces to albendazole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790573,Experimental parasitology,2019 05 14,"This study aimed to observe the effects of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) on apoptosis of Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces induced by albendazole (ABZ), and to explore the potential mechanism of NaAsO2.

Viability was detected with 0.1% eosin staining. The ultrastructural alterations were visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Caspase-3 activity was assessed with colorimetric assay. Meanwhile, ELISA or WST were applied to detect the activities of antioxidases in NaAsO2 treatment groups. The maximum protoscolicidal effect was seen with the combination 20 μM NaAsO2+80 μM ABZ. The ultrastructural damage detected after NaAsO2+ABZ incubation were greater than those caused by ABZ alone and its primary damage site was the tegument of the parasite. The caspase-3 activity was clearly higher in protoscoleces treated with the combination of NaAsO2+ABZ than when drugs were used separately. The activities of NQO-1, HO-1, GST, and SOD were significantly lower in protoscoleces incubated with NaAsO2 than the untreated controls (P < 0.05). According to our results, ABZ could induce protoscoleces apoptosis, and NaAsO2 could significantly augment sensitivity of protoscoleces to ABZ."

In this study, comparable proteome analysis of FFPE tissues revealed multiple candidate marker molecules for differentiating atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL) from lipoma. A total of 181 unique proteins were identified for ALT/WDL. Of the identified proteins, coiled-coil domain-containing protein 180 (CCDC180) and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 4 (LRRC4) were studied as candidate markers of ALT/WDL. CCDC180 and LRRC4 immunohistochemistry clearly stained tumor cells of ALT/WDL and dedifferentiated liposarcoma and could differentiate them from lipoma with high accuracy. Cell biological methods were used to further examine the expression of the candidate marker molecules in liposarcoma cells. In liposarcoma cells, knockdown of CCDC180 and LRRC4 inhibited cell proliferation. CCDC180 inhibited cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis resistance in WDL cells. Adipogenic differentiation suppressed the expression of CCDC180 and LRRC4 in WDL cells. These results indicated that LRRC4 and CCDC180 are novel immunohistochemical markers for differentiating ALT/WDLs. Their expression was associated with adipocyte differentiation and contributed to malignant potentials of WDL cells.

As a first step to elucidating the cellular function of SPP1 in macaque neurons, we examined the localization of SPP1 in the primary motor cortex (M1) of the macaque by using immunohistochemistry. SPP1 immunoreactivity was found to be localized in the cell bodies of neurons, but not outside the cells, indicating that SPP1 was not secreted from these neurons. The results of electron microscope analysis and double-labeling analysis with marker proteins suggested that SPP1 was localized in the mitochondria of neurons. The distributions of SPP1 in the neurons corresponded to those of integrin αV, a putative receptor for SPP1. The distribution of SPP1 was also investigated in macaques whose M1 had been lesioned. We found that SPP1 was secreted by proliferated microglia in the lesioned area. Double-labeling analysis indicated that SPP1 immunoreactivity in the microglia was colocalized with CD44, another putative receptor for SPP1. Success rates in the small-object-retrieval task were positively correlated with SPP1 immunoreactivity in the neurons in the perilesional area. SPP1 has multiple roles in the macaque motor cortex, and it may be a key protein during recovery of hand movement after brain damage.",Characterization of novel kainic acid analogs as inhibitors of select microglial functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790558,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta protein (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, as well as by a state of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Adverse activation of microglia, the brain immune cells, is believed to contribute to AD pathology including excessive neuronal death. Thus, normalizing immune functions of microglia could slow neurodegeneration, and identification of novel compounds capable of modifying microglial functions is an important goal. Since kainic acid (KA) has been shown to modulate microglial morphology and immune functions, we synthesized six new KA analogs (KAAs) and tested their effects on select microglial functions by using three different cell types as microglia models. Four of the KAAs at low micromolar concentrations inhibited secretion of cytotoxins, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) by immune-stimulated microglia-like cells. We hypothesize that the effects of the novel KAAs on microglia-like cells are not mediated by KA receptors since their biological activity was distinct from that of KA in all assays performed. A structural similarity search identified aldose reductase (AR) as a potential target for the novel KAAs. This hypothesis was supported by use of AR inhibitor zopolrestat, which abolished the inhibitory effects of two KAAs on microglial secretion of NO. Since the newly developed KAAs inhibited pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic functions of microglia, they should be further investigated for their potential beneficial effect on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD animal models.",Next generation sequencing from Hepatozoon canis (Apicomplexa: Coccidia: Adeleorina): Complete apicoplast genome and multiple mitochondrion-associated sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790556,International journal for parasitology,2019 04 09,"Extrachromosomal genomes of the adeleorinid parasite Hepatozoon canis infecting an Israeli dog were investigated using next-generation and standard sequencing technologies. A complete apicoplast genome and several mitochondrion-associated sequences were generated. The apicoplast genome (31,869 bp) possessed two copies of both large subunit (23S) and small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) within an inverted repeat region, as well as 22 protein-coding sequences, 25 transfer RNA genes (tDNA) and seven open reading frames of unknown function. Although circular-mapping, the apicoplast genome was physically linear according to next-generation data. Unlike other apicoplast genomes, genes encoding ribosomal protein S19 and tDNAs for alanine, aspartic acid, histidine, threonine and valine were not identified. No complete mitochondrial genome was recovered using next-generation data or directed PCR amplifications. Eight mitochondrion-associated (215-3523 bp) contigs assembled from next-generation data encoded a complete cytochrome c oxidase subunit I coding sequence, a complete cytochrome c oxidase subunit III coding sequence, two complete cytochrome B coding sequences, a non-coding, pseudogene for cytochrome B and multiple fragmented mitochondrial rDNA genes (SSUA, SSUB, SSUD, LSUC, LSUG, RNA6, RNA10, RNA14, RNA18). The paucity of NGS reads generating each of the mitochondrion-like sequences suggested that a complete mitochondrial genome at typically high copy number was absent in H. canis. In contrast, the complete nuclear rDNA unit sequence of H. canis (18S rDNA to 28S rDNA, 6977 bp) had >1000-fold next-generation coverage. Multiple divergent (from 93.6% to 99.9% pairwise identities) nuclear 18S rDNA contigs were generated (three types with 10 subtypes total). To our knowledge this is the first apicoplast genome sequenced from any adeleorinid coccidium and the first mitochondrion-associated sequences from this serious pathogen of wild and domestic canids. These newly generated sequences may provide useful genetic loci for high-resolution species-level genotyping that is currently impossible using existing nuclear rDNA targets.",Temporal and age-dependent effects of haptoglobin deletion on intracerebral hemorrhage-induced brain damage and neurobehavioral outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790555,Experimental neurology,2019 05 31,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating stroke subtype and the presence of extracorpuscular hemoglobin (Hb) exacerbates brain damage. Haptoglobin (Hp) binds Hb, which prevents its oxidation and participation in neurotoxic reactions. Multiple studies have investigated the role of Hp under conditions of intravascular hemolysis, but little is known about its role in the brain and following ICH where extravascular hemolysis is rampant. Young and aged wildtype and Hp-/- mice underwent the autologous blood or collagenase ICH model. Early after ICH, Hp-/- mice display 58.0 ± 5.6% and 36.7 ± 6.9% less brain damage in the autologous blood and collagenase ICH models, respectively. In line with these findings, Hp-/- mice display less neurological deficits on several neurobehavioral tests. Hp-/- mice have less Perl's iron content, HO1 expression, and blood brain barrier dysfunction, but no difference in brain Hb content, astrogliosis and angiogenesis/neovascularization. At the later endpoint, the young cohort displays 27.8 ± 9.3% less brain damage, while no difference is seen with the aged cohort. For both cohorts, no differences are seen in HO1 levels or iron accumulation, but young Hp-/- mice display less thalamic astrogliosis and striatal microgliosis. This study reveals that the presence or absence of Hp exerts important time- and age-dependent influences on ICH outcomes.","Role of container type, behavioural, and ecological factors in Aedes pupal production in Dhaka, Bangladesh: An application of zero-inflated negative binomial model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790554,Acta tropica,2019 05 28,"The container-inhabiting Aedes mosquitoes are the major vectors transmitting dengue and several other arboviral diseases such as chikungunya and zika across the tropical world. Surveillance for immature Aedes, particularly pupae, is an effective tool for measuring dengue outbreak risk. While in Bangladesh, the greatest burden of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases has periodically been occurring since the first major outbreak in 2000, very limited research has yet been pursued to understand the dynamics of Aedes pupal production in this country. In this backdrop, this study was carried out to i) identify containers at household premises contributing to dengue vector productivity; ii) measure the extent of pupae productivity of household containers; and, iii) determine the effects of household ecological factors upon productivity of pupae in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. During the monsoon months of 2013, a total of 1,033 containers (674 wet and 363 dry) in 727 household premises in 12 wards of the city of Dhaka were inspected to measure container productivity and collect household ecological, and human behavioural data. The results reveal that the majority of immature mosquitoes (73.52% larvae and 84.91% pupae) developed in containers located outdoor that are used mostly for household chores. Plastic containers (57.55% of all immature mosquito-positive containers) used for household chores produce most of the immature mosquitos. The results of the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model reveal that pupae production significantly varies by container type (p-value = 0.0136) for the count regression group. However, when considering container size along with container type, container size is found significant for pupae production (p-value = 0.0041), showing that container size is confounded with the container type and the pupae production. Containers greater than 50 litres (L) are likely to produce 4.9 times more pupae than containers with <1L. Two household ecological factors are found to be significant (shade: p-value = 0.005 in the count regression group and type of water: p-value = 0.001 in the excess zero group) for pupae production. We found that containers with partial shade produce 4.6 times more pupae than without any shade, whereas in the excess zero group the expected number of observed zero pupae count is 86.5% lower in containers filled with rain water than those with tap water, tube-well water, ring well water and water from other sources. The most commonly used plastic-made containers (i.e., refrigerator trays, drums, buckets) and flower tubs/trays are the most abundant immature mosquito-positive containers. These findings would help the concerned authorities to formulate programs for changing human behaviour targeting the most productive containers for Aedes habitat management and vector control in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh.",Antifibrinolytic Agents for Hemoptysis Management in Adults With Cystic Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790551,Chest,2019 06 08,Hemoptysis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

In this article, we present the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model and describe its applicability in designing behaviorally oriented interventions for women. Adapted from drug development research on the translation of basic laboratory research to clinical practice, the ORBIT model emphasizes the pre-efficacy testing phases of intervention development. Phase I is focused on the definition and refinement of the intervention and incorporates various study designs, including experimental, observational, qualitative, and adaptive design. Phase II involves the use of single-group proof-of-concept, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy studies to show the feasibility and capacity of the intervention to produce change in an intermediate endpoint. Phase III involves the use of randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of the intervention. We illustrate how the ORBIT model could be applied in a hypothetical intervention to increase a woman's sense of control of her life before behavioral weight loss efforts in the postpartum period.",Coper Classification Early After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture Changes With Progressive Neuromuscular and Strength Training and Is Associated With 2-Year Success: The Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790527,The American journal of sports medicine,2019 06 10,Some athletes demonstrate excellent dynamic stability after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and return to sport without ACL reconstruction (ACLR) (copers).

With the help of mathematical modeling and the cell-free system, we can streamline the design-build-test cycles of the circuits, in which we characterize and optimize these circuits in vitro to confirm that they function as expected before implementing them in vivo. We show that the performance of these circuits from in vitro studies closely recapitulates those from in vivo experiments. We demonstrate that these feedforward loops show dynamic response and pulse-like behavior both in vitro and in vivo.

The core concept of engineering materials for cell-based studies is the material's ability to redesign the physicochemical characteristics of the cellular niche. There is a growing interest in direct molding from cells (cell imprinting). These negative copies of cell surface topographies have been shown to affect cell shape and direct mesenchymal stem cells' differentiation. Analyzing the results is however challenging as cells seeded on these substrates do not always end up in a cell pattern, which leads to decreased effectiveness and biased quantification. To gain control over cell seeding into the patterns and avoid unwanted cell population outside of the patterns, the cell-imprinted surface needs to be modified. From this perspective, the standard optical contact lithography process was modified and cells were introduced to the cleanroom. Direct-cell photolithography was used for a single-step PDMS cell-imprint (chondrocytes as the molding template) surface modification down to single-cell (approximately 5 μm in diameter) resolution. As cells come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and optical profiles, a complementary optical soft lithography-based photomask fabrication technique is also reported. The simplicity of the fabrication process makes this cell-imprint surface modification technique compatible with any adherent cell type and leads to efficient cell-based studies.",Polypeptide-Conjugated Second Near-Infrared Organic Fluorophore for Image-Guided Photothermal Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790523,ACS nano,2019 03 27,"Image-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is an attractive strategy to improve the diagnosis accuracy and treatment outcomes by monitoring the accumulation of photothermal agents in tumors in real-time and determining the best treatment window. Taking advantage of the superior imaging quality of NIR-II fluorescence imaging and remote-controllable phototherapy modality of PTT, we developed a facile macromolecular fluorophore (PF) by conjugating a small-molecule NIR-II fluorophore (Flav7) with an amphiphilic polypeptide. The PF can form uniform micelles in aqueous solution, which exhibit a slight negative charge. In vitro experimental results showed that the PF nanoparticles showed satisfactory photophysical properties, prominent photothermal conversion efficiency (42.3%), excellent photothermal stability, negligible cytotoxicity, and photothermal toxicity. Meanwhile, the PF can visualize and feature the tumors by NIR-II fluorescence imaging owing to prolonged blood circulation time and enhanced accumulation in tumors. Moreover, in vivo studies revealed that the PF nanoparticles achieved an excellent photothermal ablation effect on tumors with a low dose of NIR-II dye and light irradiation, and the process can be traced by NIR fluorescence imaging."

It is emphasized that problem of rational diet of population has a marked social value and relates to quality and longevity of human life and human health. The practical experience demonstrates that children diet in families with lower income does not correspond to established modern medical biological standards. Frequently, the category of such households covers statistically average family with one or several children born and hence quality of life of these households drastically deteriorated. The poor and low-income population is limited in foodstuff consumption. The article presents the analysis of nutrition and energy value of diet in all types of examined families. It is emphasized that in households with one or two children the nutrition value of foodstuff is significantly lower than in households with many children. However, in families with few children diet includes high content of fats that is an important factor of development of obesity in growing generation. In families with many children the diet is characterized by lower consumption of protein, including animal one. The inadequate and ""poor"" type of diet results in increasing of protein-calorie deficiency шт families with many children. In households with children the diet does not correspond to standards of cost of living according food substances. Therefore, modern Russian family with more than one child, is characterized by deficiency of energy value of diet per every its member. The increasing of number of children in family significantly decreases quality of diet of its members. Accordingly, quality of diet in families with one child is higher than in families households with to and more children.","[On the Issue of Evolution of the Concept of ""Public Health""].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790482,"Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",2019 02 21,"The article substantiates necessity of including into common concept of ""public health"" such an additional systemic attribute as psychological (spiritual) health.

This is the reason of augmenting interest to screening programs permitting to timely detect chronic disease, to proceed with treatment and to stabilize condition of patient. At the same time, screening programs require permanent analysis and development that became a foundation for the actual study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the medical organizational aspects of the second stage (in-depth) of dispensarization exemplified by glaucoma. The retrospective analysis of 392 out-patient records of patients on suspicion of glaucoma was carried out. The questionnaire for ophthalmologists, consisting of 35 questions, was developed. The anonymous questionnaire survey of 62 ophthalmologists was carried out. The analysis of results of survey established that the most significant problem of dispensarization was shortage of time on reception of patient. This problem was resolved through both partial implementation of all needed examinations (21%) and referring all patients to specialized medical centers. All scheduled manipulations are not implemented by 87% of respondents. All respondents mentioned basically needed equipment as available. The extremely low quality of in-depth examination results in redistribution of load to the specialized medical centers and to increasing of waiting time period from establishment of diagnosis to beginning of treatment of disease. It is necessary to provide continuity of medical care during the second stage of dispensarization by the way of implementation of general scheme of out-patient record and notation of particular methods of examination. These measures will both decrease load on specialized medical centers and permit apply resources more efficiently and reduce time period from suspicion of disease to establishment of diagnosis and beginning of treatment of glaucoma.",[The Mortality from External Causes in Individuals of Risk Group].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790480,"Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",2019 02 21,"The article deals with the problem of mortality from external causes among the officers of the penitentiary system of the Russian Federation, who by virtue of their official duties, are in high-risk situations.

Clinical applications,2019 05 02,"The concept of personalized medicine is predominantly been pursued through genomic and transcriptomic technologies, leading to the identification of multiple mutations in a large variety of cancers. However, it has proven challenging to distinguish driver and passenger mutations and to deal with tumor heterogeneity and resistant clonal populations. More generally, these heterogeneous mutation patterns do not in themselves predict the tumor phenotype. Analysis of the expressed proteins in a tumor and their modification states reveals if and how these mutations are translated to the functional level. It is already known that proteomic changes including posttranslational modifications are crucial drivers of oncogenesis, but proteomics technology has only recently become comparable in depth and accuracy to RNAseq. These advances also allow the rapid and highly sensitive analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biobank tissues, on both the proteome and phosphoproteome levels. In this perspective, pioneering mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies are highlighted that pave the way toward clinical implementation.

However, its prognostic and staging value in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neo-CRT) is controversial. Four hundred and ninety-five LARC patients following neo-CRT and surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression in all lymph node (LN) -negative and LN-positive patients. Next, we used three methods to classify the counts of LNs and TDs (oN, only LN counts; n1N, counts according to the N1c standards; n2N, total counts of LNs and TDs) to evaluate the impact of TD on N staging. TD-positive patients were associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features. In multivariate analyses, TD was an independent poor prognostic factor of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local recurrence-free survival in all patients. In LN-negative patients, TD was an independent poor prognostic factor of OS, DFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). In LN-positive patients, TD has poor prognostic value only in patients with one positive LN. Three multivariate analyses according to three N staging methods showed that oN was not an independent prognostic factor, whereas n1N and n2N were independently associated with poor survival in OS, DFS and DMFS. The n2N method seemed to be better than n1N method. TD is an independent poor prognostic factor in LARC patients following neo-CRT, especially in patients with no more than one positive LN. TD probably should be considered as one positive LN when performing N staging.","Human cancer, the naked mole rat and faunal turnovers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790458,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"We argue that the human evolutionary heritage with frequent adaptations through geological time to environmental change has affected a trade-off between offspring variability and cancer resistance, and thus favored cancer-prone individuals.

The unpigmented planarian blastema, 3 days post head amputation, is a robust platform to assess the penetration of red-fluorescent CPPs into epithelial cells and deeper tissues. Three planarian proteins, Ovo, ZicA and Djeya, which collectively control head remodelling and eye regeneration following decapitation, are a convenient source of novel cationic CPP vectors. One example, Djeya1 (RKLAFRYRRIKELYNSYR), is a particularly efficient and seemingly inert CPP vector that could be further developed to assist the delivery of bioactive payloads across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. Eye regeneration, following head amputation, was utilized in an effort to identify bioportides capable of influencing stem cell-dependent morphogenesis. These investigations identified the tetradecapeptide mastoparan (INLKALAALAKKIL) as a bioportide able to influence the gross morphology of head development.

Confident structure identification depends on satisfying 4D data confirmation in both positive and negative ion mode. Using this methodology, a number of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine lipids are structurally elucidated from mouse brain lysosomes. It is further determined that several ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine structures are differentially abundant between lysosomes isolated from mouse cortex following traumatic brain injury as compared to that of sham animals.

The linkage to microbial identity and the mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the effects of nanoscale magnetite (nanoFe3 O4 ) and multiwalled CNTs on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in an enrichment obtained from lake sediment. The microbial populations were composed mainly of Smithella, Syntrophomonas, Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina and Methanoregula. In addition to acetate, butyrate was transiently accumulated indicating that propionate was oxidized by Smithella via the dismutation pathway and part of the leaked butyrate was oxidized by Syntrophomonas. Propionate oxidation and CH4 production were significantly accelerated in the presence of nanoFe3 O4 and CNTs. While propionate oxidation was suppressed upon H2 application and suspended completely upon formate application in the control, this suppressive effect was substantially compromised in the presence of nanoFe3 O4 and CNTs. The tests on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of a pure culture methanogen and of the enrichment culture without propionate showed negative effect by both materials. The positive effect of nanoFe3 O4 disappeared when it was insulated by surface-coating with silica. Observations made with fluorescence in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscope indicated the extensive formation of microbial cell-conductive material mixture aggregates. Our results suggest that direct interspecies electron transfer is likely activated by the conductive materials and operates in concert with H2 /formate-dependent electron transfer for syntrophic propionate oxidation in the sediment enrichment.",Catheter based treatments for fibrosing mediastinitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790443,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2019 02 21,"Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare, often debilitating and potentially lethal disease characterized by an exuberant fibroinflammatory response within the mediastinum.

A motor is designed by attaching two polydimethylsiloxane-coated oxidized copper foams (POCF) to the two opposite sides of an oxidized copper foam (OCF). When the hydrophobic POCF is immersed in water, it serves as both an air bubble trapper and a light-to-heat conversion center. As bubbles grow under photothermal heating, they provide lifting force and result in the revolving motion of the motor. With removal of light illumination, bubbles are cooled by the surrounding water and shrink, and the buoyance is lowered. The resultant force of gravitational force, buoyance, and fluid resistance drives the motor to move forward horizontally. Furthermore, the motors are utilized as oil collectors and oil/water separation is achieved successfully. To effectively control the suspending motion, a polydimethylsiloxane foam doped with carbon black (C-foam) is designed under the photothermal principle. It is maintained at a certain position underwater by controlling the on/off of light. The vertical motion is also studied and utilized to generate electricity. It is expected that different types of underwater motion will open up new opportunities for various applications including drug delivery, collection of heavy oil underwater, and electricity generation.",Ultrasonography effectiveness of the vibration vs cryotherapy added to an eccentric exercise protocol in patients with chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy: A randomised clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790440,International wound journal,2019 03 19,"Tendinopathy is a very common disease in the general population as well as in athletes.

The distribution and activity of these archaea in natural environments are not yet reported and understood. Here, a combination of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches was utilized to understand the ecological roles and metabolic potentials of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR)-based alkane oxidizing (MAO) archaea in Guaymas Basin sediments. Diverse MAO archaea, including multi-carbon alkane oxidizer Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum spp., anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea ANME-1 and ANME-2c as well as sulfate-reducing bacteria HotSeep-1 and Seep-SRB2 that potentially involved in MAO processes, coexisted and showed activity in Guaymas Basin sediments. High-quality genomic bins of Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum spp., ANME-1 and ANME-2c were retrieved. They all contain and expressed mcr genes and genes in Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for the complete oxidation from alkane to CO2 in local environment, while Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum spp. also possess beta-oxidation genes for multi-carbon alkane degradation. A global survey of potential multi-carbon alkane metabolism archaea shows that they are usually present in organic rich environments but are not limit to hydrothermal or marine ecosystems. Our study provided new insights into ecological and metabolic potentials of MAO archaea in natural environments.",Occult hepatitis B virus and surface antigen mutant infection in healthy vaccinated cohorts and children with various forms of hepatitis and multiple transfusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790411,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 05 25,"Despite the success of universal infant immunization initiated in Taiwan in 1984, occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) and circulating surface antigen mutants remain potential obstacles for eventual eradication of HBV infection.",The impact of age and ageing on hepatocarcinoma surgery: Short- and long-term outcomes in a multicentre propensity-matched cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790410,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 04 25,"Management of malignancy in elderly patients is challenging.

Developing cost-effective, active and stable semiconducting photoelectrodes is extremely important for achieving PEC water splitting with high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Perovskite oxides as a large family of semiconducting metal oxides are extensively investigated as electrodes in PEC water splitting owing to their abundance, high (photo)electrochemical stability, compositional and structural flexibility allowing the achievement of high electrocatalytic activity, superior sunlight absorption capability and precise control and tuning of band gaps and band edges. In this review, the research progress in the design, development, and application of perovskite oxides in PEC water splitting is summarized, with a special emphasis placed on understanding the relationship between the composition/structure and (photo)electrochemical activity.","Generation of Nanoparticle, Atomic-Cluster, and Single-Atom Cobalt Catalysts from Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks by Spatial Isolation and Their Use in Zinc-Air Batteries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30790406,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 04 01,"The size effect of transition-metal nanoparticles on electrocatalytic performance remains ambiguous especially when decreasing the size to the atomic level. Herein, we report the spatial isolation of cobalt species on the atomic scale, which was achieved by tuning the zinc dopant content in predesigned bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZnCo-ZIFs), and led to the synthesis of nanoparticles, atomic clusters, and single atoms of Co catalysts on N-doped porous carbon. This synthetic strategy allowed an investigation of the size effect on electrochemical behavior from nanometer to Ångström dimensions. Single-atom Co catalysts showed superior bifunctional ORR/OER activity, durability, and reversibility in Zn-air batteries compared with the other derivatives and noble-metal Pt/C+RuO2 , which was attributed to the high reactivity and stability of isolated single Co atoms. Our findings open up a new avenue to regulate the metal particle size and catalytic performance of MOF derivatives."
