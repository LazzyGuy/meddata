We present two rare cases of Phialemonium and Phaeoacremonium fungi infections of the foot diagnosed in northern California to inform physicians on the presentation and current treatment options for this unique pathology. The two cases presented outline the clinical presentations, diagnostic data, and surgical and antimicrobial interventions. There is a concentration on the antimicrobial options depending on which of the over 20 species is encountered. The pertinent literature and supporting data are reviewed to create an outline for discussion of treatment protocols when faced with these emerging opportunistic infections.",Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Endocarditis from a Diabetic Foot Ulcer Understanding and Mitigating the Risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742500,Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,2019 06 05,"Diabetic foot infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, and successful treatment often requires an aggressive and prolonged approach. Recent work has elucidated the importance of appropriate therapy for a given severity of diabetic foot infection, and highlighted the ongoing risk such patients have for subsequent invasive life-threatening infection should diabetic foot ulcers fail to heal. The authors describe the case of a man with diabetes who had prolonged, delayed healing of a diabetic foot ulcer. The ulcer subsequently became infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The infection was treated conservatively with oral therapy and minimal debridement. Several months later, he experienced MRSA bloodstream infection and complicating endocarditis. The case highlights the ongoing risk faced by patients when diabetic foot ulcers do not heal promptly, and emphasizes the need for aggressive therapy to promote rapid healing and eradication of MRSA.",Mosses in Low Earth Orbit: Implications for the Limits of Life and the Habitability of Mars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742499,Astrobiology,2019 02 11,"As a part of the European Space Agency mission ""EXPOSE-R2"" on the International Space Station (ISS), the BIOMEX (Biology and Mars Experiment) experiment investigates the habitability of Mars and the limits of life. In preparation for the mission, experimental verification tests and scientific verification tests simulating different combinations of abiotic space- and Mars-like conditions were performed to analyze the resistance of a range of model organisms. The simulated abiotic space- and Mars-stressors were extreme temperatures, vacuum, and Mars-like surface ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in different atmospheres. We present for the first time simulated space exposure data of mosses using plantlets of the bryophyte genus Grimmia, which is adapted to high altitudinal extreme abiotic conditions at the Swiss Alps. Our preflight tests showed that severe UVR200-400nm irradiation with the maximal dose of 5 and 6.8 × 105 kJ·m-2, respectively, was the only stressor with a negative impact on the vitality with a 37% (terrestrial atmosphere) or 36% reduction (space- and Mars-like atmospheres) in photosynthetic activity. With every exposure to UVR200-400nm 105 kJ·m-2, the vitality of the bryophytes dropped by 6%. No effect was found, however, by any other stressor. As the mosses were still vital after doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) expected during the EXPOSE-R2 mission on ISS, we show that this earliest extant lineage of land plants is highly resistant to extreme abiotic conditions.",Response of Methanogenic Archaea from Siberian Permafrost and Non-permafrost Environments to Simulated Mars-like Desiccation and the Presence of Perchlorate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742498,Astrobiology,2019 02 11,"Numerous preflight investigations were necessary prior to the exposure experiment BIOMEX on the International Space Station to test the basic potential of selected microorganisms to resist or even to be active under Mars-like conditions. In this study, methanogenic archaea, which are anaerobic chemolithotrophic microorganisms whose lifestyle would allow metabolism under the conditions on early and recent Mars, were analyzed. Some strains from Siberian permafrost environments have shown a particular resistance. In this investigation, we analyzed the response of three permafrost strains (Methanosarcina soligelidi SMA-21, Candidatus Methanosarcina SMA-17, Candidatus Methanobacterium SMA-27) and two related strains from non-permafrost environments (Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina barkeri) to desiccation conditions (-80°C for 315 days, martian regolith analog simulants S-MRS and P-MRS, a 128-day period of simulated Mars-like atmosphere). Exposure of the different methanogenic strains to increasing concentrations of magnesium perchlorate allowed for the study of their metabolic shutdown in a Mars-relevant perchlorate environment. Survival and metabolic recovery were analyzed by quantitative PCR, gas chromatography, and a new DNA-extraction method from viable cells embedded in S-MRS and P-MRS. All strains survived the two Mars-like desiccating scenarios and recovered to different extents. The permafrost strain SMA-27 showed an increased methanogenic activity by at least 10-fold after deep-freezing conditions. The methanogenic rates of all strains did not decrease significantly after 128 days S-MRS exposure, except for SMA-27, which decreased 10-fold. The activity of strains SMA-17 and SMA-27 decreased after 16 and 60 days P-MRS exposure. Non-permafrost strains showed constant survival and methane production when exposed to both desiccating scenarios. All strains showed unaltered methane production when exposed to the perchlorate concentration reported at the Phoenix landing site (2.4 mM) or even higher concentrations. We conclude that methanogens from (non-)permafrost environments are suitable candidates for potential life in the martian subsurface and therefore are worthy of study after space exposure experiments that approach Mars-like surface conditions.",A Desert Cyanobacterium under Simulated Mars-like Conditions in Low Earth Orbit: Implications for the Habitability of Mars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742497,Astrobiology,2019 02 11,"In the ESA space experiment BIOMEX (BIOlogy and Mars EXperiment), dried Chroococcidiopsis cells were exposed to Mars-like conditions during the EXPOSE-R2 mission on the International Space Station. The samples were exposed to UV radiation for 469 days and to a Mars-like atmosphere for 722 days, approaching the conditions that could be faced on the surface of Mars. Once back on Earth, cell survival was tested by growth-dependent assays, while confocal laser scanning microscopy and PCR-based assay were used to analyze the accumulated damage in photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins) and genomic DNA, respectively. Survival occurred only for dried cells (4-5 cell layers thick) mixed with the martian soil simulants P-MRS (phyllosilicatic martian regolith simulant) and S-MRS (sulfatic martian regolith simulant), and viability was only maintained for a few hours after space exposure to a total UV (wavelength from 200 to 400 nm) radiation dose of 492 MJ/m2 (attenuated by 0.1% neutral density filters) and 0.5 Gy of ionizing radiation. These results have implications for the hypothesis that, during Mars's climatic history, desiccation- and radiation-tolerant life-forms could have survived in habitable niches and protected niches while transported.",Limits of Life and the Habitability of Mars: The ESA Space Experiment BIOMEX on the ISS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742496,Astrobiology,2019 02 24,"BIOMEX (BIOlogy and Mars EXperiment) is an ESA/Roscosmos space exposure experiment housed within the exposure facility EXPOSE-R2 outside the Zvezda module on the International Space Station (ISS). The design of the multiuser facility supports-among others-the BIOMEX investigations into the stability and level of degradation of space-exposed biosignatures such as pigments, secondary metabolites, and cell surfaces in contact with a terrestrial and Mars analog mineral environment. In parallel, analysis on the viability of the investigated organisms has provided relevant data for evaluation of the habitability of Mars, for the limits of life, and for the likelihood of an interplanetary transfer of life (theory of lithopanspermia). In this project, lichens, archaea, bacteria, cyanobacteria, snow/permafrost algae, meristematic black fungi, and bryophytes from alpine and polar habitats were embedded, grown, and cultured on a mixture of martian and lunar regolith analogs or other terrestrial minerals. The organisms and regolith analogs and terrestrial mineral mixtures were then exposed to space and to simulated Mars-like conditions by way of the EXPOSE-R2 facility. In this special issue, we present the first set of data obtained in reference to our investigation into the habitability of Mars and limits of life. This project was initiated and implemented by the BIOMEX group, an international and interdisciplinary consortium of 30 institutes in 12 countries on 3 continents. Preflight tests for sample selection, results from ground-based simulation experiments, and the space experiments themselves are presented and include a complete overview of the scientific processes required for this space experiment and postflight analysis. The presented BIOMEX concept could be scaled up to future exposure experiments on the Moon and will serve as a pretest in low Earth orbit.",Characterization of Viability of the Lichen Buellia frigida After 1.5 Years in Space on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742495,Astrobiology,2019 02 11,"The lichen Buellia frigida was exposed to space and simulated Mars analog conditions in the Biology and Mars Experiment (BIOMEX) project operated outside the International Space Station (ISS) for 1.5 years. To determine the effects of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) conditions on the lichen symbionts, a LIVE/DEAD staining analysis test was performed. After return from the ISS, the lichen symbionts demonstrated mortality rates of up to 100% for the algal symbiont and up to 97.8% for the fungal symbiont. In contrast, the lichen symbiont controls exhibited mortality rates of 10.3% up to 31.9% for the algal symbiont and 14.5% for the fungal symbiont. The results performed in the BIOMEX Mars simulation experiment on the ISS indicate that the potential for survival and the resistance of the lichen B. frigida to LEO conditions are very low. It is unlikely that Mars could be inhabited by this lichen, even for a limited amount of time, or even not habitable planet for the tested lichen symbionts.",Pendrin Mediates Bicarbonate Secretion and Enhances Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Function in Airway Surface Epithelia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742493,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2019 05 31,"Bicarbonate facilitates mucin unpacking and bacterial killing; however, its transport mechanisms in the airways are not well understood. cAMP stimulates anion efflux through the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; ABCC7) anion channel, and this is defective in CF. The anion exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4) also mediates HCO3- efflux and is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we examined pendrin and CFTR expression and their contributions to HCO3- secretion by human nasal and bronchial epithelia. In native tissue, both proteins were most abundant at the apical pole of ciliated surface cells with little expression in submucosal glands. In well-differentiated primary nasal and bronchial cell cultures, IL-4 dramatically increased pendrin mRNA levels and apical immunostaining. Exposure to low-Cl- apical solution caused intracellular alkalinization (ΔpHi) that was enhanced fourfold by IL-4 pretreatment. ΔpHi was unaffected by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) or CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172, but was reduced by adenoviral shRNA targeting pendrin. Forskolin increased ΔpHi, and this stimulation was prevented by CFTRinh-172, implicating CFTR, yet forskolin only increased ΔpHi after pendrin expression had been induced by IL-4. The dependence of ΔpHi on pendrin suggests there is minimal electrical coupling between Cl- and HCO3- fluxes and that CFTR activation increases anion exchange-mediated HCO3- influx. Conversely, inducing pendrin expression increased forskolin-stimulated, CFTRinh-172-sensitive current by approximately twofold in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. We conclude that pendrin mediates most HCO3- secretion across airway surface epithelium during inflammation and enhances electrogenic Cl- secretion via CFTR, as described for other SLC26A transporters.",First Onset Herpesviral Infection and Lung Injury in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742492,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2019 06 10,"""Non-infectious"" pulmonary complications are significant causes of morbidity and mortality post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

Derived measurements and calculations are influenced by changes in both ventilation and perfusion and are therefore useful for assessing both respiratory and cardiovascular function. This article provides an evidence-based review of several potential uses of volume capnography in the intensive care unit: 1) monitoring the effectiveness of ventilation by using end-tidal Pco2 as a surrogate for arterial Pco2, 2) assessing volume responsiveness, 3) measuring cardiac output, 4) determining prognosis in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, 5) optimizing alveolar recruitment, and 6) excluding pulmonary embolism. Studies performed during the past few decades have clearly shown that volume capnography can provide important prognostic information in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and that end-tidal Pco2 should not be used to estimate or even to monitor the direction of change in the arterial Pco2 in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients. Unfortunately, few conclusions can be made from studies evaluating other potential applications. Of these, the most promising are the noninvasive measurement of cardiac output and optimization of alveolar recruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and in mechanically ventilated, morbidly obese patients."

Biomedical HIV treatment has been shown to impact these dimensions. However, there is little understanding of the real-world psychosocial and sociocultural effects of the latest biomedical HIV prevention strategy, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This study explored the psychosocial and sociocultural dimensions of PrEP use among LGBTQ adults. We interviewed 23 LGBTQ adults who were current or former users of PrEP. Results included that PrEP users' experiences were shaped by multiple forms of stigma. Participants were highly motivated to challenge PrEP stigma and to support PrEP use among other community members. Lastly, participants described positive impacts on their individual well-being and their sexual partnerships. Findings suggest that PrEP has significant impacts beyond biomedical outcomes for both the individuals who use PrEP and their communities.",Implications for PrEP Uptake in Young Adults Experiencing Homelessness: A Mixed Methods Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742477,AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,2019 02 11,"Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) have a high risk of contracting HIV; however, they remain relatively unreached by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-based HIV prevention initiatives.

Young adults were recruited from agencies serving YEH in Houston, TX (n = 30) and Los Angeles, CA (n = 15) to participate in an electronic self-report survey and a semistructured interview. Survey results indicate that 68.2% of YEH had low or no prior knowledge of PrEP, though 63.7% reported interest in taking PrEP. Qualitative results revealed facilitators of PrEP use, including high PrEP acceptability and awareness, and supportive social networks. Several barriers emerged, including medication-related barriers, adherence, cost, access barriers, low perceived HIV risk, perceived stigma of PrEP use, and low PrEP awareness. Despite high PrEP acceptability, PrEP use among YEH remains low partly due to low PrEP awareness, low perceived HIV risk, and medical mistrust.",TGF-β1 Decreases β2-Agonist-Induced Relaxation in Human Airway Smooth Muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742476,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2019 02 11,"Helper T effector cytokines implicated in asthma modulate the contractility of human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. We have reported recently that a profibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), induces HASM cell shortening and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Here we assessed whether TGF-β1 affects the ability of HASM cells to relax in response to β2-agonists, a mainstay treatment for AHR in asthma. Overnight TGF-β1 treatment significantly impaired isoproterenol (ISO)-induced relaxation of carbachol-stimulated isolated HASM cells. This single-cell mechanical hypo-responsiveness to ISO was corroborated by sustained increases in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. In TGF-β1 treated HASM cells, ISO evoked markedly lower levels of intracellular cAMP. These attenuated cAMP levels were, in turn, restored with pharmacological and siRNA inhibition of PDE4 and Smad3, respectively. Most strikingly, TGF-β1 selectively induced PDE4D gene expression in HASM cells in a Smad2/3-dependent manner. Together these data suggest that TGF-β1 decreases HASM cell β2-agonist relaxation responses by modulating intracellular cAMP levels via a Smad2/3-dependent mechanism. Our findings further define the mechanisms underlying β2-agonist hypo-responsiveness in asthma, and suggest TGF-β1 as a potential therapeutic target to decrease asthma exacerbations in severe and treatment-resistant asthma.",The attentional template is shifted and asymmetrically sharpened by distractor context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742475,Journal of experimental psychology. Human perception and performance,2019 06 05,"Theories of attention hypothesize the existence of an ""attentional template"" that contains target features in working or long-term memory. It is often assumed that the template contents are veridical, but recent studies have found that this is not true when the distractor set is linearly separable from the target (e.g., all distractors are ""yellower"" than an orange-colored target). In such cases, the target representation in memory shifts away from distractor features (Navalpakkam & Itti, 2007) and develops a sharper boundary with distractors (Geng, DiQuattro, & Helm, 2017). These changes in the target template are presumed to increase the target-to-distractor psychological distinctiveness and lead to better attentional selection, but it remains unclear what characteristics of the distractor context produce shifting versus sharpening. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the template representation shifts whenever the distractor set (i.e., all of the distractors) is linearly separable from the target but asymmetrical sharpening occurs only when linearly separable distractors are highly target-similar. Our results were consistent, suggesting that template shifting and asymmetrical sharpening are 2 mechanisms that increase the representational distinctiveness of targets from expected distractors and improve visual search performance.

Such variation is even found in exact replication studies, suggesting that it is not only because of identifiable moderators but also to subtler random variation across studies. Such heterogeneity of effect sizes is typically ignored, with unfortunate consequences. We consider its implications for power analyses, the precision of estimated effects, and the planning of original and replication research. With heterogeneity and an interest in generalizing to a population of studies, the usual power calculations and confidence intervals are likely misleading, and the preference for single definitive large-N studies is misguided. Researchers and methodologists need to recognize that effects are often heterogeneous and plan accordingly.

Increasingly, community detection methods are being used to subset the data in a data-driven manner. While many of these approaches perform well in simulation studies and thus offer some improvement upon traditional clustering approaches, there is no readily available approach for evaluating the robustness of these solutions in empirical data. Researchers have no way of knowing if their results are due to noise. We describe here 2 approaches novel to the field of psychology that enable evaluation of cluster solution robustness. This tutorial also explains the use of an associated R package, perturbR, which provides researchers with the ability to use the methods described herein. In the first approach, the cluster assignment from the original matrix is compared against cluster assignments obtained by randomly perturbing the edges in the matrix. Stable cluster solutions should not demonstrate large changes in the presence of small perturbations. For the second approach, Monte Carlo simulations of random matrices that have the same properties as the original matrix are generated. The distribution of quality scores (""modularity"") obtained from the cluster solutions from these matrices are then compared with the score obtained from the original matrix results. From this, one can assess if the results are better than what would be expected by chance. perturbR automates these 2 methods, providing an easy-to-use resource for psychological researchers. We demonstrate the utility of this package using benchmark simulated data generated from a previous study and then apply the methods to publicly available empirical data obtained from social networks and structural neuroimaging.

In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used. It will be elaborated in a completely nontechnical manner: what the Bayes factor is, how it can be obtained, how Bayes factors should be interpreted, and what can be done with Bayes factors. After reading this tutorial and executing the associated code, researchers will be able to use their own data for the evaluation of hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor, not only in the context of ANOVA models, but also in the context of other statistical models.

Clinicians report concerns that direct discussion of traumatic experiences could undermine the therapeutic alliance, which may negatively impact retention and outcome. Studies among adolescents with PTSD found no difference in alliance between trauma-focused and non-trauma-focused psychotherapies, but this has not been tested among adults. The present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial of collaborative care, also known as care management, for PTSD. We examined patient-reported therapeutic alliance among 117 veterans with PTSD who participated in cognitive processing therapy (CPT, now called CPT + A; n = 54) or non-trauma-focused supportive psychotherapy for PTSD (n = 73) at VA community outpatient clinics. We tested the hypothesis that alliance in CPT would be noninferior to (i.e., not significantly worse than) non-trauma-focused psychotherapy using patient ratings on the Revised Helping Alliance Questionnaire. Patients' therapeutic alliance scores were high across both groups (CPT: M = 5.13, SD = 0.71, 95% CI [4.96, 5.30]; non-trauma-focused psychotherapy: M = 4.89, SD = 0.64, 95% CI [4.73, 5.05]). The difference between groups (0.23, 95% CI [0.01, 0.48]) was less than the ""noninferiority margin"" based on suggested clinical cutoffs (0.58 points on a 1-6 scale). These results held even after adjusting for veterans' demographic and clinical characteristics and change in PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Although there are concerns that direct discussion of traumatic experiences could worsen therapeutic alliance, patients report similar levels of alliance in CPT and non-trauma-focused supportive psychotherapy.

Particularly for veterans residing in rural areas, the lack of providers, high provider turnover, and the burden of traveling long distances to VHA facilities may contribute to difficulties accessing mental health care. Telemental Health (TMH) services help bridge the geographic gap between mental health providers and veterans who need mental health services. The VHA TMH Hub initiative has attempted to leverage changes in technology-facilitated care by developing a model in which a facility ""hub"" could expand mental health resources to remote ""spoke"" clinics and veterans' residences. This paper describes the implementation of the VA New York Harbor Health care System (VA NYH) TMH Hub, which was one of 6 programs funded by the VHA Office of Rural Health (ORH) in September 2016. We will describe the structure of the program, services provided, veterans served, and our efforts to integrate quality improvement, research, and clinical training into the operations of the program.

During this time, infants' and mothers' physiological regulation may contribute to dyadic synchrony and, in infants, dyadic synchrony may support infants' physiological regulation. Because the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) serve different regulatory functions, the current study aimed to elucidate relations between infants' and mothers' SNS and PNS functioning and dyadic behavioral synchrony. Skin conductance (SC; SNS index), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; PNS index), heart period (HP; index of joint SNS and PNS arousal), and behavioral synchrony were assessed in 6-month-old infants (N = 140) and their mothers during a mild social stressor, the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm (Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, & Brazelton, 1978). Synchrony was related to infants' and mothers' PNS and to mothers' broad autonomic arousal but not to SNS-specific arousal. Higher levels of behavioral synchrony were associated with lower infant RSA but with higher mother HP and RSA at baseline and in each Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm episode. Therefore, lower RSA infants may have required more synchronous engagement with mothers to support regulation, while higher RSA, less aroused mothers may have been particularly well-attuned to infants' emotions. Findings suggest that each individual's physiological state may contribute to the behavioral functioning of the dyad. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

Supporting this possibility, promising work has harnessed big data and emergent technologies to automatically predict stable levels of one specific emotion, happiness, at the community (e.g., counties) and trait (i.e., people) levels. Furthermore, research in affective science has shown that nonverbal vocal bursts (e.g., sighs, gasps) and specific acoustic features (e.g., pitch, energy) can differentiate between distinct emotions (e.g., anger, happiness) and that machine-learning algorithms can detect these differences. Yet, to our knowledge, no work has tested whether computers can automatically detect normal, everyday, within-person fluctuations in one emotional state from acoustic analysis. To address this issue in the context of happy mood, across 3 studies (total N = 20,197), we asked participants to repeatedly report their state happy mood and to provide audio recordings-including both direct speech and ambient sounds-from which we extracted acoustic features. Using three different machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines) and two sets of acoustic features, we found that acoustic features yielded minimal predictive insight into happy mood above chance. Neither multilevel modeling analyses nor human coders provided additional insight into state happy mood. These findings suggest that it is not yet possible to automatically assess fluctuations in one emotional state (i.e., happy mood) from acoustic analysis, pointing to a critical future direction for affective scientists interested in acoustic analysis of emotion and automated emotion detection.

However, it is not yet clear what predicts mind wandering to and concealing secrets. We proposed that emotional appraisals of shame and guilt for secrecy would predict how secrecy is experienced. Four studies with 1,000 participants keeping more than 6,000 secrets demonstrated that shame was linked with increased mind wandering to the secret. Guilt, in contrast, was linked with reduced mind wandering to the secret. The current work represents the first test of how emotions from secrecy determine how that secrecy is experienced.

MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate numerous physiological processes and developmental transitions through translational repression and mRNA degradation. Their role in seasonal transitions has been vastly understudied, with only a few reports in animals. Furthermore, no study has assessed whether there are sex differences in seasonal regulation of miRs. miR-155 is a primary candidate for seasonal regulation because it influences immune responses, energetics, and reproductive function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that photoperiod regulates miR-155 gene expression in Siberian hamsters and whether there were sex differences in this photoperiod regulation. miR-155 gene expression levels were measured in hypothalamus, hippocampus, and spleen of male and female Siberian hamsters reared in short days (SDs) or long days (LDs). As expected, SD-reared hamsters had significantly reduced body mass, lightened pelage color, and lower reproductive organ size than LD-reared hamsters. Notably, SDs increased hypothalamic miR-155 gene expression in females but not in males. No differences were observed in hippocampus and spleen of either sex. These findings demonstrate sex-specific photoperiod regulation of miR-155 gene expression. Future studies should consider possible sex differences in miR contributions to seasonal changes in physiology and behavior.

The fetus was pulled out alive, but given the gestational age, died within a few minutes. The uterus was preserved, but the woman was advised to proceed with tubal ligation and, in any case, to absolutely avoid a new pregnancy. The literature on uterine rupture is examined focusing on the problem of uterine rupture resulting after a caesarean section, analyzing the possibility of monitoring the risk of rupture through ultrasound evaluation. Finally, the article conducts a moral analysis of the case in the light of catholic moral, questioning in particular the acceptability of a hysterectomy under certain conditions. The illegitimacy of direct sterilization is reaffirmed, that is to say, an intervention whose purpose is the impediment of procreation, but it is emphasized that direct sterilization cannot occur when it comes to the moral certainty that that uterus, because of its conditions , cannot carry on a pregnancy until the viability of the fetus.

As a right, the right to death is presented as the prohibition of the law and the community to interfere in the act of love for oneself or for another.

Contemporary moral debates lacks of a shared basic position, but it is not impossible to discuss. On human dignity there are two attitudes. For one of them, dignity depends on maintaining of one decisive quality, as autonomy, autodetermination or lack of intense suffering. For the other conception of dignity, it does not depend on any attribute of human life. Sufferance is not a refutation of dignity. This second idea of dignity is more correct in philosophical terms.

It is the aim of this paper to describe the concept of ""compassionate advance care"" as a way of caring for the patient and his family at the end of life from the perspective of both professionals, teachers and students of the health sciences, and persons with advanced disease and their families. A qualitative methodology was used. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups, and analysed and coded using the theory of Grounded Theory. Approval of an Ethics Committee was obtained. The intentional sample consisted of 29 participants, who were patients and relatives of patients with advanced disease, PC professionals and experts in bioethics, university professors and Health Sciences students. Data were collected in a PC Hospital in Madrid, Spain. The participants positively valued the compassionate advance care provided by professionals: analysing and reflecting on possible complications that may arise from the advanced disease situation suffered by the patient and establishing a dialogue with him about possible actions in this regard. The paper concludes that compassion is a virtue that implies anticipating the needs of patients, thus allowing the patient to make the right shared decisions. This is what the term Compassionate Advance Care Planning entails. Further studies are needed to delve into the characteristics of compassionate Advance Care Planning and how to optimally implement it in patients at the end of life. To admit the opposite is to enter a spiral where the dignity of the human being would become an object of weighting with respect to another value, which, in a hypothetical conflict could be postponed by another.

It is defended here that euthanasia is not exclusively an individual decision, but has, above all, an important social repercussion. If euthanasia were accepted and legalized, the very nature of the medicine and the physician's own identity would undergo a profound transformation. The doctor-patient relationship based on trust would be broken. Also, if euthanasia were endorsed, it would be encouraged that the human being was not valued for his / her being, but for his capacity to produce. Now, vulnerable, fragile and weak people (dependent, old, sick ...) keep their dignity intact, because we have this because of the simple fact of being born as human beings.

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by periods of flares (active disease) and remission (inactive disease). The disease can affect many organ systems, e.g., skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and the central nervous system (CNS). SLE patients often have an overproduction of cytokines, e.g., interferons, chemokines, and interleukins. The high cytokine levels are part of the systemic inflammation, which can lead to tissue injury. In the present study, SLE patients were divided into five groups based on their autoantibody profiles. We thus defined these five groups: ANA negative, antiphospholipid (aPL) positive, anti-Sm/anti-RNP positive, Sjögren's syndrome (SS) antigen A and B positive, and patients positive for more than one type of autoantibodies (other SLE). Cytokines were measured using Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) multiplex analysis. On the basis of the cytokine data, ANA negative patients were the most deviating subgroup, with lower levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23p40, and interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10. Despite low cytokine levels in the ANA negative group, autoantibody profiles did not discriminate between different cytokine patterns.",Fast Diffusion and Segregation along Threading Dislocations in Semiconductor Heterostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742447,Nano letters,2019 03 20,"Heterogeneous integration of semiconductors combines the functionality of different materials, enabling technologies such as III-V lasers and solar cells on silicon and GaN LEDs on sapphire. However, threading dislocations generated during the epitaxy of these dissimilar materials remain a key obstacle to the success of this approach due to reduced device efficiencies and reliability. Strategies to alleviate this and understand charge carrier recombination at threading dislocations now need an accurate description of the structure of threading dislocations in semiconductor heterostructures. We show that the composition around threading dislocations in technologically important InGaAs/GaAs/Ge/Si heterostructures are indeed different from that of the matrix. Site-specific atom probe tomography enabled by electron channeling contrast imaging reveals this at individual dislocations. We present evidence for the simultaneous fast diffusion of germanium and indium up and down a dislocation, respectively, leading to unique compositional profiles. We also detect the formation of clusters of metastable composition at the interface between Ge and GaAs, driven by intermixing in these two nearly immiscible materials. Together, our results have important implications for the properties of dislocations and interfaces in semiconductors and provide new tools for their study."

B,2019 03 07,"The control of the self-assembly of the nanocrystals into ordered structures has been extensively investigated, but fewer efforts have been devoted to studying one-component polymer-grafted nanoparticles (OPNPs). Herein, through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, we design a novel nanoparticle (NP) grafted with polymer chains, focusing on its self-assembled structures. First, we examine the effects of length and density of grafted polymer chains by calculating the radial distribution function between NPs, as well as through direct visualization. We observe a monotonic change of the arranged morphology of grafted-NPs as a function of the density of grafted polymer chains, which indicates that the increase of the grafting density contributes to the order of the morphology. Meanwhile, we find that much longer grafted polymer chains worsen the regularity of the morphology. Then, we probe the influence of the stiffness of grafted polymer chains (denoted by K ranging from 0 to 500) on the order of grafted-NPs, finding that the order of the structure exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of K at moderate grafting density. For high grafting density, the order of the morphology is initially enhanced and becomes saturated as a function of K. For the effect of K on the stress-strain behavior, the system with the lowest order demonstrates the most remarkable reinforced mechanical behavior for both low and high grafting density. Last, we establish the phase diagram by varying the stiffness and density of the grafted polymer chains, which contains the amorphous, ordered, and superlattice structures, respectively. In general, our simulated results provide guidelines to tailor the self-assembly of the OPNPs by taking advantage of the length, density, and stiffness of grafted polymer chains.",Virtual Screening Identifies Irreversible FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 Inhibitors with Activity toward Resistance-Conferring Mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742435,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"The use of covalent irreversible binding inhibitors is an established concept for drug development.

Herein, we report a virtual screening strategy that led to the discovery of irreversible inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. A virtual screening library was designed to target the highly conserved Cys828 residue preceding the DFG motif by modification of reported reversible inhibitors with chemically reactive groups. Prospective covalent docking allowed the identification of two lead series, resulting in a massive increase in inhibition of kinase activity and cell viability by irreversible inhibitors compared to the corresponding reversible scaffolds.

Strong mode-dependent variation of the tunneling rate measured with picosecond lasers indicates that tunneling probability is extremely sensitive to low-frequency vibrational modes seemingly orthogonal to the O-H elongation coordinate unless the rate of energy randomization exceeds that of tunneling. The multidimensional nature of tunneling has also been manifested in efficient internal-to-translational energy transfers observed at S1 vibronic modes strongly coupled to the tunneling coordinate, giving insights into otherwise the formidable multidimensional map of tunneling process. The nonadiabatic bifurcation dynamics in the later stage of the chemical reaction has been disentangled by analyzing picosecond time-resolved product state distributions, resolving a long controversial issue regarding the origin of high or low kinetic energy component of the product translational energy distributions.",Oxidative Damage in Aliphatic Amino Acids and Di- and Tripeptides by the Environmental Free Radical Oxidant NO3•: The Role of the Amide Bond Revealed by Kinetic and Computational Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742433,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 15,"Kinetic and computational data reveal a complex behavior of the important environmental free radical oxidant NO3• in its reactions with aliphatic amino acids and di- and tripeptides, suggesting that attack at the amide N-H bond in the peptide backbone is a highly viable pathway, which proceeds through a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism with a rate coefficient of about 1 × 106 M-1 s-1 in acetonitrile. Similar rate coefficients were determined for hydrogen abstraction from the α-carbon and from tertiary C-H bonds in the side chain. The obtained rate coefficients for the reaction of NO3• with aliphatic di- and tripeptides suggest that attack occurs at all of these sites in each individual amino acid residue, which makes aliphatic peptide sequences highly vulnerable to NO3•-induced oxidative damage. No evidence for amide neighboring group effects, which have previously been found to facilitate radical-induced side-chain damage in phenylalanine, was found for the reaction of NO3• with side chains in aliphatic peptides.",Oleanane-Type Saponins Biosynthesis in Panax notoginseng via Transformation of β-Amyrin Synthase Gene from Panax japonicus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742432,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 04,"Oleanane-type saponins considered as the main medicinal ingredients in Panax japonicus are not found in Panax notoginseng. β-Amyrin synthase (βAS) was recognized as the first key enzyme in the biosynthetic branch of oleanane-type saponins.

Our new method combines the LR-ODC-12 formulation of LR-DCT with core-valence separation approximation (CVS) that allows us to efficiently access high-energy core-excited states. We describe our computer implementation of the CVS-approximated LR-ODC-12 method (CVS-ODC-12) and benchmark its performance by comparing simulated X-ray absorption spectra to those obtained from experiment for several small molecules. Our results demonstrate that the CVS-ODC-12 method shows good agreement with experiment for relative spacings between transitions and their intensities, but the excitation energies are systematically overestimated. When compared to results from excited-state coupled cluster methods with single and double excitations, the CVS-ODC-12 method shows a similar performance for intensities and peak separations, while coupled cluster spectra are less shifted, relative to experiment. An important advantage of CVS-ODC-12 is that its excitation energies are computed by diagonalizing a Hermitian matrix, which enables efficient computation of transition intensities.",Coordination Chemistry of a Molecular Pentafoil Knot.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742430,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 01,"The binding of Zn(II) cations to a pentafoil (51) knotted ligand allows the synthesis of otherwise inaccessible metalated molecular pentafoil knots via transmetalation, affording the corresponding ""first-sphere"" coordination Co(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) pentanuclear knots in good yields (≥85%). Each of the knot complexes was characterized by mass spectrometry, the diamagnetic (zinc) knot complex was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and the zinc, cobalt, and nickel pentafoil knots afforded single crystals whose structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Lehn-type circular helicates generally only form with tris-bipy ligand strands and Fe(II) (and, in some cases, Ni(II) and Zn(II)) salts, so such architectures become accessible for other metal cations only through the use of knotted ligands. The different metalated knots all exhibit ""second-sphere"" coordination of a single chloride ion within the central cavity of the knot through CH···Cl- hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.

OCTP is the first implementation in LAMMPS that uses the Einstein relations combined with the order- n algorithm for the efficient sampling of dynamic variables. OCTP has low computational requirements and is easy to use because it follows the native input file format of LAMMPS. A tool for calculating the radial distribution function (RDF) of the fluid beyond the cutoff radius, while taking into account the system size effects, is also part of the new plugin.

The complexes of electron-transfer proteins are a notable example, such as those formed by plastocyanin (Pc) and cytochrome f (cyt f) in the photosynthetic apparatus. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of these complexes, however, makes their study challenging. To better elucidate the complex of Nostoc Pc and cyt f, 2D-IR spectroscopy coupled to site-specific labeling with cyanophenylalanine infrared (IR) probes was employed to characterize how the local environments at sites along the surface of Pc were impacted by cyt f binding. The results indicate that Pc most substantially engages with cyt f via the hydrophobic patch around the copper redox site. Complexation with cyt f led to an increase in inhomogeneous broadening of the probe absorptions, reflective of increased heterogeneity of interactions with their environment. Notably, most of the underlying states interconverted very rapidly (1 to 2 ps), suggesting a complex with a highly mobile interface. The data support a model of the complex consisting of a large population of an encounter complex.

The technological and nutritional properties of durum wheat semolina depend mainly on the type of gluten proteins and on their amount, which is a genotype- and environment-dependent trait. Gluten proteins are also responsible for celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune enteropathy with a prevalence of about 0.7-2% in the human population. At this purpose, two Italian durum wheat cultivars, Saragolla and Cappelli, currently used for monovarietal pasta, were chosen to compare (i) the reserve and embryo proteome, (ii) the free and bound phenolics, antioxidant activity, and amino acid composition, and (iii) the content of immunogenic peptides produced after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The results obtained from 2 years of field cultivation on average showed a higher amount of gluten proteins, amino acids, and immunogenic peptides in Cappelli. Saragolla showed a higher abundance in bound phenolics, antioxidant enzymes, and stress response proteins in line with its higher antioxidant activity. However, the impact of the year of cultivation, largely depending on varying rainfall regimes through the wheat growth cycle, was significant for most of the parameters investigated. Differences in technological and nutritional characteristics observed between the two cultivars are discussed in relation to the influence of genetic and environmental factors."

YcjS also exhibited catalytic activity for the NAD+-dependent oxidation of d-glucose, methyl β-d-glucopyranoside, and 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol.

We first sketch the early roots of resonance theory, its heritage of diverse physics and chemistry conceptions, and its subsequent rise to reigning chemical bonding paradigm of the mid-20th century. We then outline the alternative ""natural"" pathway to localized Lewis- and resonance-structural conceptions that was initiated in the 1950s, given semi-empirical formulation in the 1970s, recast in ab initio form in the 1980s, and successfully generalized to multi-structural ""natural resonance theory"" (NRT) form in the 1990s. Although earlier numerical applications were often frustrated by the ineptness of then-available numerical solvers, the NRT variational problem was recently shown to be amenable to highly efficient convex programming methods that yield provably optimal resonance weightings at a small fraction of previous computational costs. Such convexity-based algorithms now allow a full ""reboot"" of NRT methodology for tackling a broad range of chemical applications, including the many familiar resonance phenomena of organic and biochemistry as well as the still broader range of resonance attraction effects in the inorganic domain. We illustrate these advances for prototype chemical applications, including (i) stable near-equilibrium species, where resonance mixing typically provides only small corrections to a dominant Lewis-structural picture, (ii) reactive transition-state species, where strong resonance mixing of reactant and product bonding patterns is inherent, (iii) coordinative and related supramolecular interactions of the inorganic domain, where sub-integer resonance bond orders are the essential origin of intermolecular attraction, and (iv) exotic long-bonding and metallic delocalization phenomena, where no single ""parent"" Lewis-structural pattern gains pre-eminent weighting in the overall resonance hybrid.",Surface Chemistry-Mediated Near-Infrared Emission of Small Coinage Metal Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742413,Accounts of chemical research,2019 03 19,"From size-dependent luminescence to localized surface plasmon resonances, the optical properties that emerge from common materials with nanoscale dimensions have been revolutionary. As nanomaterials get smaller, they approach molecular electronic structures, and this transition from bulk to molecular electronic properties is a subject of far-reaching impact. One class of nanomaterials that exhibit particularly interesting optoelectronic features at this size transition are coinage metal (i.e., group 11 elements copper, silver, and gold) nanoparticles with core diameters between approximately 1 to 3 nm (∼25-200 atoms). Coinage metal nanoparticles can exhibit red or near-infrared photoluminescence features that are not seen in either their molecular or larger nanoscale counterparts. This emission has been exploited both as a probe of electronic behavior at the nanoscale as well as in critical applications such as biological imaging and chemical sensing. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that their photoluminescence figures of merit such as emission quantum yield, energy, and lifetime are largely independent of particle diameter. Instead, emission from particles at this size range depends heavily on the particle surface chemistry, which includes both its metallic composition and the capping ligand architecture. The strong influence of surface chemistry on these emergent optoelectronic phenomena has powerful implications for both the study and use of these particles, primarily due to the theoretically limitless possible surface ligand architectures and metallic compositions. In this Account, we highlight recent work that studies and uses surface chemistry-mediated photoluminescence from coinage metal nanoparticles. Specifically, we emphasize the distinct, as well as synergistic, roles of the nanoparticle capping ligand and the nanoparticle core for controlling and/or enhancing their near-infrared photoluminescence. We then discuss the implications of surface chemistry-mediated photoluminescence as it relates to downstream applications such as energy transfer, sensing, and biological imaging. We conclude by discussing current challenges that remain in the field, including opportunities to develop new particle synthetic routes, analytical tools, and physical frameworks with which to understand small nanoparticle emission. Taken together, we anticipate that these materials will be foundational both in understanding the unique transition from molecular to bulk electronic structures and in the development of nanomaterials that leverage this transition.",Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Vertical MoS2 Nanosheets on p-GaN Nanorods for Photodetector Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742412,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Vertically oriented multilayered MoS2 nanosheets were successfully grown on p-GaN nanorod substrate using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The p-GaN nanorod substrate was fabricated by dry etching employing self-assembled nickel (Ni) nanopartical as mask. Photoluminescence (PL) and Raman characterizations demonstrate the multilayered structure of MoS2 nanosheet growth on p-GaN nanorods as compared with the referential monolayer MoS2 on GaN wafer substrate under the same growth procedure. The growth model of vertical MoS2 nanosheet formed on GaN nanorods is evidently proposed according to the first-principle calculations. More importantly, it is demonstrated here that the as-grown vertical MoS2 nanosheets/p-GaN nanorod heterostructure holds promising applications in photodetector device, where high optical gain and broad spectral response in the visible range have been obtained.",Exploring the Heterogeneity of Nanoparticles in Their Interactions with Plasma Coagulation Factor XII.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742411,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Tuning the characteristics of nanoparticles (NPs) would be promising in improving their biocompatibilities, regarding biosafety and nanodrug considerations. Due to the high priority of the artificial NPs in contacting the circulatory system, understanding their interactions with plasma zymogens is of great importance. Four kinds of NPs, including 5 nm gold NPs (GNP-5), 5 and 20 nm silver NPs (SNP-5, SNP-20), and 20 nm silica NPs (SiNP-20), were investigated for their interactions with the coagulation factor XII (FXII). GNP-5 adsorbed FXII in a standing-up mode, and exhibited high binding affinity for the heavy chain of the protein without altering its secondary structure or inducing its activation. In contrast to GNP-5, FXII adsorption on the other tested NPs was in a lying-down mode, and their interactions with FXII induced its conformational changes, thus causing the evident zymogen cleavage. The structural alterations and activation of FXII induced by the NPs exhibited in specific surface area dependent manners, which were related with different NP cores and sizes. Additionally, the enzymatic activity of α-FXIIa was also influenced by NP incubation, and the alterations were dependent on the specific characters of the NPs as evidenced by the enzymatic inhibition effect of GNP-5 (noncompetitive) and SNP-5 (competitive), and enhanced enzymatic catalysis abilities of SNP-20 and SiNP-20. The interesting findings on the heterogeneity of NPs in their interactions with plasma FXII not only revealed the underlying mechanism for NP-triggered hematological responses, but also suggested the crucial role of tuning NP parameters in their potential bioapplication, like nanodrug design.",3D-Printed Biodegradable Microswimmer for Theranostic Cargo Delivery and Release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742410,ACS nano,2019 03 27,"Untethered mobile microrobots have the potential to leverage minimally invasive theranostic functions precisely and efficiently in hard-to-reach, confined, and delicate inner body sites. However, such a complex task requires an integrated design and engineering, where powering, control, environmental sensing, medical functionality, and biodegradability need to be considered altogether. The present study reports a hydrogel-based, magnetically powered and controlled, enzymatically degradable microswimmer, which is responsive to the pathological markers in its microenvironment for theranostic cargo delivery and release tasks. We design a double-helical architecture enabling volumetric cargo loading and swimming capabilities under rotational magnetic fields and a 3D-printed optimized 3D microswimmer (length = 20 μm and diameter = 6 μm) using two-photon polymerization from a magnetic precursor suspension composed from gelatin methacryloyl and biofunctionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. At normal physiological concentrations, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) enzyme could entirely degrade the microswimmer in 118 h to solubilized nontoxic products. The microswimmer rapidly responds to the pathological concentrations of MMP-2 by swelling and thereby boosting the release of the embedded cargo molecules. In addition to delivery of the drug type of therapeutic cargo molecules completely to the given microenvironment after full degradation, microswimmers can also release other functional cargos. As an example demonstration, anti-ErbB 2 antibody-tagged magnetic nanoparticles are released from the fully degraded microswimmers for targeted labeling of SKBR3 breast cancer cells in vitro toward a potential future scenario of medical imaging of remaining cancer tissue sites after a microswimmer-based therapeutic delivery operation.",Nanostructuring Single-Molecule Polymeric Nanoparticles via Macromolecular Architecture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742409,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Heterogeneous polymer-based nanoparticles comprise a very promising family of materials for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a detailed study of structural heterogeneities in nanostructured single-molecule nanoparticles in various environments by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The nanoparticles consist of mikto-arm star copolymers with two types of chemically incompatible arms, namely poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polystyrene (PS), (PS) n,(PEO) n, where n is the number of arms. The immiscibility between the two components gives rise to intramolecularly nanostructured particles. The nanostructured objects resemble either ""Janus-like"" or ""patchy-like"" particles, depending on the number or the length of the arms (or both) as well as the interaction with the surrounding medium. The degree of intramolecular heterogeneity increases with increasing number of arms and with decreasing affinity of star components to the polymer host. We provide a detailed analysis of the internal structure of the star-shaped particles, focusing on the intramolecular packing and the spatial arrangement of the arms. The results of our study can be used to design heterogeneous, internally nanostructured particles with two phases of distinct static properties for challenging specific applications of next-generation materials.",Time-Resolved Spectroscopic Observation and Characterization of Water-Assisted Photoredox Reactions of Selected Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742408,Accounts of chemical research,2019 03 19,"In recent years, unusual and efficient self-photoredox reactions were detected for selected benzophenone derivatives (BPs) and anthraquinone derivatives (AQs) in aqueous environments by Wan and co-workers, where the carbonyl undergoes reduction to the corresponding alcohol and a side-chain alcohol group undergoes oxidation to the corresponding carbonyl. To unravel the photoredox reaction mechanisms of these types of BPs and AQs in aqueous environments, we have utilized a combination of time-resolved spectroscopy techniques such as femtosecond transient absorption, nanosecond transient absorption, and nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy to detect and characterize the electronic absorption and vibrational spectra of the intermediates and transient species from the femtosecond to microsecond time region after they are generated in the photoredox reactions. With the assistance of density functional theory calculations to simulate the electronic absorption and Raman spectra, the structural and kinetic information on the key reactive intermediates is described. Furthermore, the reaction pathways were calculated by finding the transition states connecting with the reactant and product complexes to better understand the photoredox reaction mechanism. In this Account, we summarize some of our time-resolved spectroscopic observations and characterization of water-assisted photoredox reactions of selected BPs and AQs. In the strong hydrogen-donor solvent isopropanol, the commonly studied photoreduction reaction for aromatic carbonyls via an intermolecular hydrogen atom tranfer process was observed for BPs and AQs. The photoredox reactions for the investigated BPs and AQs in aqueous environments occur on the triplet excited-state surface. Under moderately acidic aqueous conditions, the photoredox reactions for BPs and AQs are triggered by a proton transfer (PT) pathway. In neutral aqueous solutions, AQs may also undergo proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) leading to the photoredox reaction, while BPs generate the ketyl radical species. Both BPs and AQs prefer the photohydration reaction in high-proton-concentration aqueous solutions (pH 0). The PT and PCET processes were found to offer more possibilities for the aromatic carbonyl compounds to lead to new photochemical reactions like the unusual photoredox reactions associated with BPs and AQs described here. Clear characterization of the photophysical pathways and the photochemical reactions of representative aromatic carbonyl compounds in aqueous environments not only provides fundamental information to better understand the photochemistry of carbonyl-containing compounds but also will facilitate the development of applications of these systems, like photochemical synthesis, drugs, and photolabile protecting groups. In addition, the importance of water molecules in the photochemical reactions of interest here may also lead to further understanding of how water influences the photochemistry of related carbonyl-containing compounds in aqueous environments.",Nitrogen-Coordinated Boroxines Enable the Fabrication of Mechanically Robust Supramolecular Thermosets Capable of Healing and Recycling under Mild Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742407,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"The fabrication of mechanically robust polymeric materials capable of self-healing and recycling remains challenging because the mobility of polymer chains in such polymers is very limited. In this work, mechanically robust supramolecular thermosets capable of healing physical damages and recycling under mild conditions are fabricated by trimerization of bi-( ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)- and tri-( ortho-aminomethyl-phenylboronic acid)-terminated poly(propylene glycol) oligomers (denoted as Bi-PBA-PPG and Tri-PBA-PPG, respectively). The resultant supramolecular thermosets are cross-linked by dynamic covalent bonds of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines. The mechanical properties of the supramolecular thermosets can be systematically tailored by varying the ratios between Tri-PBA-PPG and Bi-PBA-PPG, which changes the cross-linking density of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the topology of the supramolecular thermosets. The mechanically strongest supramolecular thermosets with a molar ratio of Tri-PBA-PPG to Bi-PBA-PPG being 1:2 have a glass transition temperature of ∼36 °C, a tensile strength of ∼31.96 MPa, and a Young's modulus of ∼298.5 MPa. The high reversibility of nitrogen-coordinated boroxines and the flexibility of poly(propylene glycol) chains enable the supramolecular thermosets with the strongest mechanical strength to be highly efficiently healed at 55 °C and recycled under a pressure of 4 MPa at 60 °C to regain their original mechanical strength and integrity."

In most cases it requires major open surgery which leads to complications in 38% of patients and perioperative mortality of 4-10%. In recent years, the laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy have been gradually introduced. However, there are anecdotal reports about performing of such interventions in case of left-sided renal tumor with thrombus in the IVC. A description of technique and own experience of performing laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy from the IVC in 3 patients with tumor thrombus of levels II-III, originating from left kidney are presented. In one case distant metastases were detected preoperatively and in another patient an involvement of tail of the pancreas by the tumor was diagnosed. There was no conversion to open surgery. The maximum tumor size ranged from 5 to 16 cm. The length of tumor thrombus in the IVC was 2.4-7 cm and estimated blood loss was 300-2500 ml. In one case a blood transfusion was required postoperatively. The follow-up period was 4-26 months. One patient died from progression of the disease after 5 months, two other patients are alive without any signs of relapse. The initial experience of laparoscopic radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy from IVC in patients with left-sided renal cell cancer suggests that this technique is reproducible and relatively safe with respecting of basic principles of oncology and vascular surgery.

Whilst were either positive or neutral in attitude to the planned change some staff raised concerns that electronic devices could be used as weapons, and also that patients or visitors might misinterpret their use. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Views of staff and patients must be considered when introducing new technology into clinical practice, in order to make the change successful and sustainable. Inadequate or unclear information about the use and purpose of electronic devices may lead to misunderstandings as to their purpose and the security of their data, particularly in mental health settings. Further exploration across a range of services and countries would be useful in determining whether attitudes towards implementing similar technological change in mental health practice are commonly shared. ABSTRACT: Introduction Technological innovation offers opportunities to improve mental health care; however, little evidence exists regarding attitudes of inpatient staff and patients to such changes. We present a survey of staff and patients prior to introduction of a digital version of the National Early Warning Score (eNEWS) system for identifying physical deterioration. Aim To collate views of staff and inpatients related to prospective use of eNEWS, to inform the plan for implementation. Method Paper questionnaires were distributed to both groups in six wards prior to eNEWS implementation. Two discussion groups were then held. Results Eighty-two staff and 26 inpatients completed questionnaires. Some inpatients expressed concerns about data confidentiality. Most staff were neutral or positive about the planned change, but raised possible safety risks and the risk of electronic recording being misinterpreted by patients. The implementation plan was modified in response to this information, principally by improving communication processes with patients. Discussion This study adds to the existing evidence by reporting specific staff and patient concerns towards a form of information technology. Further evaluations would help determine the transferability of these findings. Implications for practice Listening to patient and staff views about planned technological innovation is essential for effective implementation.","Aqueous cadmium removal with ferrate: Influencing factors, removal mechanism, and effect of coexisting ions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742342,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 03 06,"The aim of the work was to evaluate the potential of potassium ferrate (K2 FeO4 , Fe(VI)) removing Cd(II) from aqueous solution and to primarily investigate the mechanism. Batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of various factors including dosage of K2 FeO4 , solution pH, the initial concentration of Cd(II), and coexisting ions. The results showed that increasing dosage of K2 FeO4 benefited the removal of Cd(II) with the efficiency up to 98.97%. The enhanced removal occurring at higher pH could be attributed to less self-decomposition of K2 FeO4 under alkaline conditions. The maximum specific removal capacity was 80 mg/(g K2 FeO4 ) under certain conditions. Surface properties of the Cd(II)-containing precipitations were characterized, and the results showed that the weakly crystalline ferrihydrite derived from self-decomposition of Fe(VI) benefited the adsorption capacity, and Cd(II) was removed via the adsorption of the hydrolysate nanoparticles. Moreover, the coexisting ions were found weakening the removal efficiency of Cd(II) due to the restricted activity of K2 FeO4 and competition for adsorption sites of hydrolysate. The interaction between the hydrolyzed products and the adsorbed Cd(II) was also weaken by compressing the thickness of the electric double layer because of the presence of coexisting ions. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Removing Cd(II) from aqueous solution as high as 98.97%. Removal efficiencies of Fe(VI) relied on chemical dose, pH and contaminant concentration. Co-exiting ions weaken the removal efficiency, such as Ca2+ and SO42- as well as ionic strength.",Air Quality in Association With Rural Coal Mining and Combustion in New South Wales Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742340,The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,2019 02 11,"Rural areas may face under-recognized threats to air quality.

Rv1410 was originally postulated to function as a drug efflux pump, but recent studies suggested that Rv1410 and LprG work in concert to insert triacylglycerides and lipoarabinomannans into the outer membrane. Here, we conducted microscopic analyses of Mycobacterium smegmatis lacking the operon and observed a cell separation defect, while surface rigidity measured by atomic force microscopy was found to be increased. Whereas Rv1410 expressed in Lactococcus lactis did not confer drug resistance, deletion of the operon in Mycobacterium abscessus and M. smegmatis resulted in increased susceptibility toward vancomycin, novobiocin and rifampicin. A homology model of Rv1410 revealed a periplasmic loop as well as a highly conserved aspartate, which were found to be essential for the operon's function. Interestingly, influx of the fluorescent dyes BCECF-AM and calcein-AM in de-energized M. smegmatis cells was faster in the deletion mutant. Our results unambiguously show that elevated drug susceptibility in the deletion mutant is caused by increased drug influx through a defective mycobacterial cell envelope and not by drug efflux mediated by Rv1410.",The histone variant H2A.Z and chromatin remodeler BRAHMA act coordinately and antagonistically to regulate transcription and nucleosome dynamics in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742338,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 03 19,"Plants adapt to environmental changes by regulating transcription and chromatin organization. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z and the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) have overlapping roles in positively and negatively regulating environmentally responsive genes in Arabidopsis, but the extent of this overlap was uncharacterized. Both factors have been associated with various changes in nucleosome positioning and stability in different contexts, but their specific roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization need further characterization. We show that H2A.Z and BRM co-localize at thousands of sites, where they interact both cooperatively and antagonistically in transcriptional repression and activation of genes involved in development and responses to environmental stimuli. We identified eight classes of genes that show distinct relationships between H2A.Z and BRM with respect to their roles in transcription. These include activating and silencing transcription both redundantly and antagonistically. We found that H2A.Z contributes to a range of different nucleosome properties, while BRM stabilizes nucleosomes where it binds and destabilizes or repositions flanking nucleosomes. We also found that, at many genes regulated by both BRM and H2A.Z, both factors overlap with binding sites of the light-regulated transcription factor FAR1-Related Sequence 9 (FRS9) and that a subset of these FRS9 binding sites are dependent on H2A.Z and BRM for accessibility. Collectively, we comprehensively characterized the antagonistic and cooperative contributions of H2A.Z and BRM to transcriptional regulation, and illuminated several interrelated roles in chromatin organization. The variability observed in their individual functions implies that both BRM and H2A.Z have more context-dependent roles than previously assumed.","Mapping mononuclear phagocytes in blood, lungs, and lymph nodes of sarcoidosis patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742337,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 03 22,"Sarcoidosis is a T-cell driven inflammatory disease characterized by granuloma formation. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs)-macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs)-are likely critical in sarcoidosis as they initiate and maintain T cell activation and contribute to granuloma formation by cytokine production. Granulomas manifest primarily in lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes (LLNs) but these compartments are less studied compared to blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Sarcoidosis can present with an acute onset (usually Löfgren's syndrome (LS)) or a gradual onset (non-LS). LS patients typically recover within 2 years while 60% of non-LS patients maintain granulomas for up to 5 years. Here, four LS and seven non-LS patients underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). From each patient, blood, BAL, endobronchial biopsies (EBBs), and LLN samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA were collected and MNPs characterized using multicolor flow cytometry. Six MNP subsets were identified at varying frequencies in the anatomical compartments investigated. Importantly, monocytes and DCs were most mature with migratory potential in BAL and EBBs but not in the LLNs suggesting heterogeneity in MNPs in the compartments typically affected in sarcoidosis. Additionally, in LS patients, frequencies of DC subsets were lower or lacking in LLNs and EBBs, respectively, compared to non-LS patients that may be related to the disease outcome. Our work provides a foundation for future investigations of MNPs in sarcoidosis to identify immune profiles of patients at risk of developing severe disease with the aim to provide early treatment to slow down disease progression.","Standard and Specialized Infant Formulas in Europe: Making, Marketing, and Health Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742336,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2019 02 11,"Infant formulas are the only suitable substitute for human milk. The most common infant formulas are standard formulas based on cow's milk. In addition, there are formulas for infants showing signs and symptoms of intolerance and for clinical conditions such as allergy, prematurity, and gastrointestinal diseases. A comprehensive review of the literature was made to review the composition of standard and specialized infant formulas and analyze indications for use, real or presumed nutrition differences and properties, and impact on infant growth. A brief consideration on costs is outlined for each formula. Over the past few years, industrial production and advertising of infant formulas have increased. Human milk still remains the most complete source of nutrition for infants and should be continued according to the current recommendations. Few differences exist between infant formulas, both for the nutrition action and the macronutrient/micronutrient composition. Specialized infant formulas have limited indications for use and high costs. The role of the pediatrician is crucial in the management of infant nutrition, promotion of breastfeeding, and prescribing of specialized formulas only in specific clinical conditions.",Similar relative decline in aerobic and anaerobic power with age in endurance and power master athletes of both sexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742335,Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2019 06 06,"Lower physical activity levels in old age are thought to contribute to the age-related decline in peak aerobic and anaerobic power. Master athletes maintain high levels of physical activity with advancing age and endurance or power training may influence the extent to which these physical functions decline with advancing age. To investigate, 37-90-year-old power (n = 20, 45% female) and endurance (n = 19, 58% female) master athletes were recruited. Maximal aerobic power was assessed when cycling two-legged (VO2 Peak2-leg ) and cycling one-legged (VO2 Peak1-leg ), while peak jumping (anaerobic) power was assessed by a countermovement jump. Men and women had a similar VO2 Peak2-leg (mL/kg/min, P = 0.138) and similar ratio of VO2 Peak1-leg to VO2 Peak2-leg (P = 0.959) and similar ratio of peak aerobic to anaerobic power (P = 0.261). The VO2 Peak2-leg (mL/kg/min) was 17% (P = 0.022) and the peak rate of fat oxidation (FATmax) during steady-state cycling was 45% higher in endurance than power athletes (P = 0.001). The anaerobic power was 33% higher in power than endurance athletes (P = 0.022). The VO2 Peak1-leg :VO2 Peak2-leg ratio did not differ significantly between disciplines, but the aerobic to anaerobic power ratio was 40% higher in endurance than power athletes (P = 0.002). Anaerobic power, VO2 Peak2-leg , VO2 Peak1-leg , and power at FATmax decreased by around 7%-14% per decade in male and female power and endurance athletes. The cross-sectional data from 37-90-year-old master athletes in the present study indicate that peak anaerobic and aerobic power decline by around 7%-14% per decade and this does not differ between athletic disciplines or sexes."

However, the 30-day readmission rates may be affected by other factors intrinsic to the patient and may not be a good measure of the quality of care provided by the hospital. In this review, we examined the quality of the 30-day readmissions rate as a quality metric for the quality of care provided to patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It has been shown that in this patient population, 30-day readmission rate primarily captures values, such as the number of comorbidities, disease severity, and discharge dispositions. There is little association between SAH 30-day readmission rates and mortality. However, 30-day readmissions may be reduced by increasing early discharge surveillance, providing readmission reduction programs to patients discharged to medical facilities as well as to home, and identifying patients most at risk for readmission.",Evolutionary concept of inflammatory response and stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742319,Journal of neuroscience research,2019 02 11,"The immune system plays an important role under both physiological and pathological conditions. Immune surveillance as well as defense and healing processes are crucial for the organism, but the immune system has a natural tendency to act aggressively when excessively stimulated. We may assume that the immune system is not designed to deal with severe conditions, such as polytrauma or severe stroke, because these are not compatible with life in the wilderness and evolution has no chance to act in such cases. These conditions are associated with exaggerated/deregulated inflammatory response, which may cause more damage than initial pathology. In this article, we would like to sketch a basic concept of the immune system-brain interactions from the evolutionary point of view and to discuss some implications related to stroke.",Significance of bronchiolocentric fibrosis in patients with histopathological usual interstitial pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742318,Histopathology,2019 05 10,To evaluate the clinical significance of bronchiolocentric fibrosis (BCF) in patients with a histopathological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).,"New Estimates of the Mean Ethanol Content of Beer, Wine, and Spirits Sold in the United States Show a Greater Increase in Per Capita Alcohol Consumption than Previous Estimates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742317,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2019 03 05,"Recent increases in alcohol-related morbidity and mortality have not occurred alongside notable increases in per capita alcohol consumption (PCC).

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is claimed to have a variety of beneficial effects, inducing a regular shedding of a thinner endometrium and inhibiting ovulation, thus having the effect of both treating HMB and providing contraception. More recently, a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) has been trialled to investigate whether this treatment can provide similar benefits to COCP while lessening hormonal systemic exposure. This review is an update of a review which originally focused on COCP alone. The scope of the review has been widened to consider other types of delivery of combined hormonal contraceptives for reduction of MBL.",Evaluation of treatment and outcomes for Hispanic patients with gastric cancer at Commission on Cancer-accredited centers in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742314,Journal of surgical oncology,2019 05 14,Gastric cancer in the Hispanic population commonly presents with poor clinical features.

The results showed that wild-type V. campbellii is pathogenic to grouper larvae, causing more than 50% mortality after 4 days of challenge. Furthermore, the mortality of larvae challenged with the mutant with maximally active quorum sensing was significantly higher than that of larvae challenged with the wild type, whereas a higher survival was observed in the larvae challenged to the mutant with a completely inactive quorum-sensing system. Grouper larvae challenged with either the signal molecule synthase triple mutant, the harveyi autoinducer-1 (HAI-1) synthase mutant and the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthase mutant showed higher survival than larvae challenged with the wild type. In contrast, larvae challenged with the cholerae autoinducer-1 (CAI-1) synthase mutant showed high mortality. This indicates that HAI-1 and AI-2, but not CAI-1, are required for full virulence of V. campbellii towards grouper larvae. Our data suggest that quorum-sensing inhibition could be an effective strategy to control V. campbellii infections in tiger grouper.","Proliferation dynamics of WSSV in crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, and the host responses at different temperatures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742312,Journal of fish diseases,2019 05 02,"The replication profile of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, at different water temperature was investigated in this study. The WSSV detections were negative at 15 ± 1°C, and the natural infection ratio increased at 19 ± 1°C (24.2% ± 2.25%), reached 100% at 25 ± 1°C and decreased at 30 ± 1°C (93.2% ± 3.37%). The WSSV genome copies number was much higher at 25 ± 1°C (≥5 × 106.45 ± 0.35 /mg) than at 15 ± 1°C (≤5 × 101.13 ± 0.12 /mg), 19 ± 1°C (≤5 × 102.74 ± 0.48 /mg) and 32 ± 1°C (≤5 × 103.18 ± 0.27 /mg). Meanwhile, the significant transcription signals of immediate early gene ie1 and late gene vp28 and a large number of virus particles were detected in epitheliums of stomach, gut and gill, hepatopancreas, heart and muscle cells at 25 ± 1°C by using in situ hybridization (ISH) and transmission electron microscopy.

The water temperature regulated the transcription of immune-related genes (crustin2, prophenoloxidase (proPO) and heat shock protein70 (Hsp70)), with some differences between WSSV treatments and control treatments. These results demonstrate that water temperature has effect on WSSV proliferation, which may due to transcriptional response of immune-related genes to temperature.",Multiple abiotic and biotic pathways shape biomass demographic processes in temperate forests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742311,Ecology,2019 04 29,"Forests play a key role in regulating the global carbon cycle, and yet the abiotic and biotic conditions that drive the demographic processes that underpin forest carbon dynamics remain poorly understood in natural ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4-25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA ), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change."

Although several major progresses have been made in mimicking the complexity of the MSC niche in vitro, there is need for comprehensive studies of fundamental mechanisms triggered by microenvironmental cues before moving to regenerative medicine cell therapy applications. The present comprehensive review extensively discusses the microenvironmental cues that influence MSC phenotype and function in health and disease - including cellular, chemical and physical interactions. The most recent and relevant illustrative examples of novel bioengineering approaches to mimic biological, chemical, and mechanical microenvironmental signals present in the native MSC niche are summarized, with special emphasis on the forefront techniques to achieve bio-chemical complexity and dynamic cultures. In particular, the skeletal MSC niche and applications focusing on the bone regenerative potential of MSC are addressed.

The patient underwent emergency surgery, which revealed active bleeding from a stomach tumor showing an exophytic pattern of growth. This patient was a 32-year-old male, and blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 23.500/mm³ and a hemoglobin level of 7.9 gr/dL. The heart rate was 110 beats/minute. The chest radiograph showed no subdiaphragmatic free air, and abdominal ultrasound showed impression of a mass that could not be distinguished from the liver, along with closed perforation or hemangioma. During the surgical procedure, 1200 cc of blood was suctioned, and the exophytic tumor was removed completely. Histological analysis of the tumor showed GIST, and it was considered to be a ruptured tumor by the oncology consultant. The patient was applied imatinib for 3 years after the surgery, and the disease did not re-occur during this period. Our goal in this case study is to emphasize that trauma may not be necessarily the cause of acute abdomen for emergency patients but that it also may be caused by hypotension-associated hypovolemic shock or other causes, bleeding from a GIST along with tumor torsion.",Management of enteroatmospheric fistula thanks to new isolation technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742292,Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,2019 04 04,"We aimed to present our method called as new isolation technique with stopper (NITS) to manage enteroatmospheric fistula (EAF) in an open abdomen (OA). The patient was a 71-year-old male with Hartmann colostomy and incisional hernia. A dual mesh was used for incisional hernia repair after colorectal anastomosis. The patient was urgently re-admitted to hospital due to EAF on the postoperative 30th day. The NITS application was performed twice at different times. General anesthesia was not required for the applications, but sterile conditions in operation room were provided. A Penrose drain was sutured with 5/0 polydioxanone onto the mucosa of EAF orifice. A small pool was created to protect enteric content from leakage. The leak test was performed by spilling saline into this pool. The sponge with visceral organ protector around the pool was adhered by adhesive sterile drape, and one opening was performed on drape. Negative pressure therapy was launched with -75 mmHg in continuous form. EAF was isolated from the OA wound and sponge with the help of stopper performed with adaptable and obstacle ring paste. After these two applications, EAF was converted to stoma. The anastomosis of small intestine was performed 45 days later. In our NITS system, control of EAF may be successfully provided besides prevention of loss of enteric fluid and electrolyte. Advantages of NITS: 1) Successful control in all types of EAF is possible with NITS. 2) The required material for NITS system can be found easily. 3) All types of EAF can be converted into stoma in a short time. Consequently, the therapy of EAF in Björck 4 OA patients may be carried out successfully with NITS method.",The ANK nail treatment of lateral malleolar fractures with syndesmosis injury: Clinical outcomes at 10 years of follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742291,Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,2019 04 04,Lateral malleolar fractures associated with syndesmotic injuries are common.

With the population of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required. Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking. Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Methods of Computational Analysis in Kidney Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742276,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 12,"This chapter reviews some currently available methodologies for constructing mathematical models in kidney development. Mammalian nephrogenesis is a complex biological process, which in its earliest stages involves migration, condensation, proliferation, and differentiation of metanephric mesenchymal (MM) cells interacting with the uroepithelial cells of the ureteric bud (UB). First, the mathematical modelling in biology is generally described. Secondly, some accounts to biological pattern formation in modelling are given in general, including models that transcend the Turing model. This is followed by a short assessment on the main branch of models in the kidney development, the evaluation of the branching morphogenesis of the kidney. Finally, two alternative models in the early kidney development processes are given as an example. They also elucidate the difficulties in the model building process. Firstly, a computational model building with the CompuCell3D program for the early nephron progenitor cell movements with the key extracellular signaling effectors is depicted. This collective migration leads to the first pretubular aggregate (PTA). The simulation parameters of the program imitate the program's cell sorting example with different adhesions and chemoattractants. The program utilizes Cellular Potts Model (CPM) to describe the development. Secondly, an example of PTA to renal vesicle (RV) transition modelling is described. In that case, the model is unique, where the model process is based on the chemoattractants from UB.",Analysis of the Teashirt Target Genes in Ureteric Bud Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742275,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 12,"Microarrays and RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) are powerful techniques to assess transcript abundance in biological samples and to improve our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of eribulin (Halaven®; Eisai Ltd) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of eribulin for treating LABC/MBC after one chemotherapy regimen in accordance with the institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. This article presents a summary of the company's evidence, Evidence Review Group (ERG) review and resulting NICE guidance (TA515), issued 28 March 2018. Clinical evidence for eribulin versus capecitabine in LABC/MBC was derived from a subgroup of 392 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-negative disease which had progressed after only one prior chemotherapy regimen for LABC/MBC in the phase III, randomised, controlled Study 301 (n = 1102). Overall survival (OS) but not progression-free survival (PFS) was improved for patients treated with eribulin versus capecitabine in this subgroup. Using the discounted patient access scheme price for eribulin, the company developed a de novo economic model. In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for eribulin versus capecitabine was £36,244 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, the ERG identified several problematic issues relating to modelling OS and PFS, drug costing and utility values, and made ten revisions to the company model. The overall impact of all ten revisions was to increase the ICER per QALY gained by £46,499. The Appraisal Committee (AC) accepted all changes made by the ERG except for the change to utility values; the AC considered that the value should be mid-way between the company's and the ERG's preferred values. A modified model was submitted by the company that included this utility value, but maintained some elements of the base case that the AC had been critical of (differential PFS between treatment arms and application of treatment cap). The new model also included a 'blended' comparator (capecitabine and vinorelbine). The AC noted there was no evidence to support a 'blended' comparator, differential PFS between treatment arms or a treatment cap. The AC therefore concluded that the most plausible ICER was likely to be £69,843 per QALY gained (derived from an ERG sensitivity analysis using the AC's preferred utility value, no differential PFS and no treatment cap). Therefore, eribulin was not recommended for treating LABC/MBC in adults who have had only one chemotherapy regimen.",Clinical Results and Complications of Shoulder Manipulation under Ultrasound-Guided Cervical Nerve Root Block for Frozen Shoulder: A Retrospective Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742255,Pain and therapy,2019 06 10,Manipulation under ultrasound-guided fifth and sixth cervical nerve root block (MUC) is a recognized form of treatment for patients with persistent frozen shoulder (FS).

The duration of rest may vary widely, from 24-48 h to several weeks or until the patient's symptoms have resolved or returned to near baseline levels. Following a period of rest, a stepwise progression of exercise is used for gradual return to play or to work. Previous research in healthy people suggested that prolonged periods of physical inactivity consistently induced deleterious physiological and psychological effects. A growing body of evidence indicates that initiating exercise earlier in the recovery process following a concussion may reduce symptom burden and lower the incidence of post-concussion syndrome. Preliminary findings appear promising, but data on the appropriate exercise prescription for patients who recently sustained a concussion are limited. We reviewed the literature in healthy individuals and patients with concussion and post-concussion syndrome to develop a physiologically based exercise prescription for the days following a concussion. Using this, practitioners may shorten the rest period and initiate controlled exercise earlier during the recovery process following a concussion.",Why institutional ethnography? Why now?

Numerous studies have focused on the synthesis of upconversion materials with different colors. However, an easier way to vary the upconversion colors without changing the materials' components has not been extensively studied. In this study, we realized the in situ color variation of the designed upconversion material with the help of a three-state fluorescence switching hybrid device. The device was composed of Prussian blue and upconversion materials; the former element functioned as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer acceptor and the latter acted as a donor. Smartly applying the RGB color model guaranteed multicolor of the device. Moreover, the highest fluorescence contrast of the three-state fluorescence switching system was 86% (larger than the result of a previous study), and the three-state reversibility was remarkable; this was probably owing to the unique layer-by-layer dripping/electrodepositing assembly method.

We have recently reported that a mixture of mono- and diglycerides is able to form sponge-like nanoparticles (L3-NPs) with large enough aqueous pores to encapsulate macromolecules such as proteins. Here we use small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to reveal morphology, structural and chemical composition of these polysorbate 80 (P80) stabilized sponge phase nanoparticles, not previously known. Our results suggest that L3-NPs have a core-shell sphere structure, with a shell rich in P80. It was also found that even if P80 is mostly located on the surface, it also contributes to the formation of the inner sponge phase structure. An important aspect for the application and colloidal stability of these particles is their interfacial properties. Therefore, the interfacial behaviour of the nanoparticles on hydrophilic silica was revealed by Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and neutron reflectivity (NR). Adsorption experiments reveal the formation of a thin lipid layer, with the dimension corresponding to a lipid bilayer after L3-NPs are in contact with hydrophilic silica. This suggests that the diglycerol monoleate/Capmul GMO-50/P80 particles reorganize themselves on this surface, probably due to interactions between P80 head group and SiO2.",Ultraviolet-pumped white light emissive carbon dot based phosphors for light-emitting devices and visible light communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742186,Nanoscale,2019 03 26,"Herein, we report UV-pumped white light emissive carbon dot (CD)-based phosphors to prevent blue light hazard in phosphor-converted WLEDs.

Herein, a high-brightness InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) nanoemitter array with an ultrahigh resolution of 31 750 dpi was achieved by combining a top-down fabrication with surface passivation of plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD)-grown AlN coating. With regard to the nanometer-level top-down etching, the surface damage or defects on the newly-formed sidewall play a significant role in the photoluminescence (PL) quality. Note that these arrays can be effectively passivated by the PEALD-grown AlN coating with an over 345% PL enhancement. In addition, a sharp band bending at the interface of the luminescent InGaN QW and the AlN coating layer can electrically drift away the photogenerated electrons from the surface traps; this leads to enhancement of the bulk PL radiative recombination with a fast PL decay rate. Therefore, we have demonstrated a feasible way for realizing an advanced nanoemitter array with both high brightness and ultrahigh resolution for future smart displays, high-resolution imaging, big-data optical information systems and so on.",Hybrid organic nanocrystal/carbon nanotube film electrodes for air- and photo-stable perovskite photovoltaics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742182,Nanoscale,2019 03 01,"We report on utilizing free-standing hybrid perylenediimide/carbon nanotube (PDI/CNT) films fabricated in air as back contacts for fully inorganic perovskite solar cells (glass/FTO/dense TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CsPbBr3/back electrode).

Based on thermodynamic analysis, free energy (FE) and free energy barrier (FEB) as well as equilibrium contact angle (ECA) and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) for four exact wetting states of semicircular micro/nanostructured surfaces are theoretically discussed in detail. Notably, the wetting behavior is closely related to the exact wetting state and the base radius or space of semicircular micro/nanostructure. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the stable wetting state of the semicircular micro/nanostructured surfaces depends on the microscale and nanoscale ratio of base space and radius. A suitable semicircular micro/nanostructure of the surface may lead to a droplet in the stable Cassie-Cassie (Cc) state. Moreover, an important role of the nanoscale semicircular surfaces in determining water super-repellence is effective in decreasing or increasing the ratio of microscale base space and radius for the Cassie or Wenzel state. Additionally, wetting behaviour of single semicircular micro- and nano-structured surfaces are comparatively investigated. The FE and ECA of micro/nanostructured surfaces are lower or higher than those of the single microstructured surfaces. However, the effects of nanoscale semicircular surfaces on the FEB and CAH mainly rely on the microscale wetting state. Finally, the related experimental results were used to verify our investigation. These results are in good agreement with the experiment, which are helpful in designing the wetting behavior of hierarchical semicircular micro/nano-structured surface.",Rotational dependence of the branching ratios and fragment angular distributions for the photodissociation of 12C16O in the Rydberg 4p(2) and 5p(0) complex region (92.84-93.37 nm).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742166,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 11,"12C16O shows complicated absorption structures in the wavelength range of 92.84-93.37 nm caused by the mutual interactions among the Rydberg 4p(2) and 5p(0) complexes, and several diffuse valence states.

Various patterns of rotational dependence for the photodissociation branching ratios have been observed for different vibronic states, and they are found to be consistent with previous spectroscopic investigations, revealing the complicated coupling schemes and predissociation dynamics in this region. Irregular angular distributions of the photofragments have been observed, especially in the Rydberg 5p(0) complex region. This has been attributed to the simultaneous excitation of multiple states with different symmetries in this region. The newly observed underlying continuum in the Rydberg 5p(0) complex region has been directly detected in the present study, and it is found to be of 1Σ+ symmetry and dissociates predominantly into the C(3P) + O(3P) channel.

Unfortunately, for some complex clinical fractures, such as osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, it is not possible to adopt such a strategy because of access restrictions. Systemic administration of growth factors is considered to be an appropriate alternative method due to its easy operability and precise spatiotemporal compatibility at fracture sites. But this therapy method was hampered by the poor in vivo stability, inefficient distribution at the fracture site and potential side effects of growth factors. To address these challenges, we conceived a systemic delivery platform of growth factors based on nanocapsules, taking advantage of the unique physiological character of bone fracture, i.e., the malformed blood vessels and the over-expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this work, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and the bisacryloylated VPLGVRTK peptide were respectively used as the model growth factor, monomer, and MMP-cleavable crosslinker. Nanocapsules were formed by in situ free radical polymerization on the surface of BMP-2 with MPC and peptides. The structure and function of BMP-2 were well maintained during the preparation process. BMP-2 nanocapsules (n(BMP-2)) were of uniform small size (∼30 nm) possessing a long circulation time (half-life is ∼48 h) and could be passively targeted to the fracture site through malformed blood vessels after systemic administration. Once accumulated at the fracture site, the shells of nanocapsules could be degraded by MMP and thus BMP-2 was released. Animal experiments proved that n(BMP-2) showed a better ability of bone repair than native BMP-2. In addition, n(BMP-2) showed a much lower inflammatory irritation. The results demonstrated that the systemic administration of growth factor nanocapsules could enhance their in vivo stability and fracture site delivery efficiency, realizing the efficient repair of a bone fracture. This rational delivery system may expand the bone repair types which can be administered with growth factors. Furthermore, the concept of taking advantage of the malformed vascular structure to deliver drugs potentially inspires researchers for the therapy of other diseases, especially sudden disease (such as cerebral hemorrhage).",Anionic and neutral 2D indium metal-organic frameworks as catalysts for the Ugi one-pot multicomponent reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742144,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 04,"Two metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) made of indium and 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3btb) and having a layered structure have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions: [In(btb)(H2O)(DMF)]·L (InPF-50) and [In2(btb)2Cl2]2-·[(CH3)2NH2]22+·L (InPF-51). The structures of both materials have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The synthetic study which has been carried out demonstrates the influence of the selected indium salt in obtaining each MOF. The structure of both materials consists of pairs of catenated layers, where the metal atoms display coordinated solvent ligands that provide potential open metal sites. The accessibility to these sites along with the presence of Lewis basic sites in the form of uncoordinated oxygen atoms make InPF-50 and -51 efficient catalysts for the four-component Ugi reaction. We attribute this high activity not only to the presence of both acid and basic sites, but also to their convenient locations in the MOF structures. This is further supported by the comparison with [In3O(btb)2(HCO2)]·L, InPF-110, a highly porous indium MOF that only displays Lewis acid sites, and shows lower activity.",In situ synthesis of a silicon flake/nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon composite from organoclay for high-performance lithium-ion battery anodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742143,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 04,"A silicon flake/nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon composite was prepared from organoclay via an in situ strategy, involving carbonization followed by low-temperature aluminothermic reduction.

Here we performed hybrid density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the electronic structures with polaronic redox behavior of polyanionic intercalation compounds similar to LiFePO4, such as in XMPO4 (X = Li, Na; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). It is proved that the replacement of Li ions does not eliminate the polaronic redox behavior of Fe ions during delithiation and hence does not lead to a significant improvement in electronic conductivity. By contrast, replacing Fe with Mn, Co or Ni can tune the polaronic redox behavior during delithiation by varying degrees. For Ni, the polaronic redox behavior has almost disappeared, and band gaps disappear during delithiation, indicating a better electronic conductivity. For Mn or Co, the polaronic redox behavior is still obvious with little improvement in the electronic conductivity. This study provides important clues to improve the electronic conductivity of LiFePO4-like cathode materials.",Application of molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles for degradation of the bacterial autoinducer N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742141,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 04,"A novel bacterial quorum quenching system is presented.

In nature, sulphated polysaccharides are highly diverse, possessing variations in the carbohydrate backbone, location of the sulphate group(s), and degree of sulphation. These compositional attributes lead to varied sulphated polymers with different negative charge densities and resultant structure-property-activity relationships. Sulphating naturally occurring polysaccharides and their synthetic analogs is challenging, and traditionally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times, often causing non-selective sulphation at different and/or multiple hydroxyl positions. In this Review, we begin with a discussion of both established and novel methods and reagents for sulphation of these polymers, along with the advantages and disadvantages of these various approaches. Next, we describe characterization methods to confirm sulphation. Finally, we provide examples of synthetically sulphated natural polysaccharides and sulphated synthetic polysaccharides, and discuss the utility of these novel polymers in various biomedical applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of synthetic sulphated polysaccharides, their current uses, and highlights biomedical opportunities.","Piezoelectric Device Versus Conventional Osteotomy Instruments in the Comparison of Three Different Bone Harvesting Methods: An Istomorphometric, Phonometric, and Chronometric Evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742138,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2019 02 11,"This study was conducted to compare the bone cutting performance of the piezoelectric device with traditional drills in terms of cut execution time, environmental noise produced, surface morphology characteristics, and residual cell vitality of the bone samples.","Characterization of the Leukocyte- and Platelet-Rich Fibrin Block: Release of Growth Factors, Cellular Content, and Structure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742137,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2019 02 11,"The leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin block (L-PRF block) is a composite graft that combines a xenograft that is acting as a scaffold with L-PRF membranes that serve as a bioactive nodule with osteoinductive capacity.

Such reporters provide information corresponding to wherever inside cells the enzyme is maximally active and preclude minor populations present in subcellular compartments. Here we describe a chemical imaging strategy to selectively interrogate minor, subcellular pools of enzymatic activity. This new technology confines the detection chemistry to a designated organelle, enabling imaging of enzymatic cleavage exclusively within the organelle. We have thus quantitatively mapped disulfide reduction exclusively in endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified that exchange is mediated by minor populations of the enzymes PDI-3 and TRX-1 resident in endosomes. Impeding intra-endosomal disulfide reduction by knocking down TRX-1 protects nematodes from infection by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, revealing the importance of this minor pool of endosomal TRX-1. TRX-1 also mediates endosomal disulfide reduction in human cells. A range of enzymatic cleavage reactions in organelles are amenable to analysis by this new reporter strategy."

However, they are often refractory to classical competitive inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that potent and selective inhibition of peripheral membrane proteins can be achieved by small molecules that target protein-membrane interactions by a noncompetitive mechanism. We show that the small molecule Bragsin inhibits BRAG2-mediated Arf GTPase activation in vitro in a manner that requires a membrane. In cells, Bragsin affects the trans-Golgi network in a BRAG2- and Arf-dependent manner. The crystal structure of the BRAG2-Bragsin complex and structure-activity relationship analysis reveal that Bragsin binds at the interface between the PH domain of BRAG2 and the lipid bilayer to render BRAG2 unable to activate lipidated Arf. Finally, Bragsin affects tumorsphere formation in breast cancer cell lines. Bragsin thus pioneers a novel class of drugs that function by altering protein-membrane interactions without disruption.",Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy promotes a survival benefit with intratumoral and systemic immune responses in recurrent glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742122,Nature medicine,2019 05 13,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor survival. The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival following neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in 35 patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Patients who were randomized to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, with continued adjuvant therapy following surgery, had significantly extended overall survival compared to patients that were randomized to receive adjuvant, post-surgical programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade alone. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cell- and interferon-γ-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell-cycle-related gene expression within the tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. Focal induction of programmed death-ligand 1 in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced clonal expansion of T cells, decreased PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T cells and a decreasing monocytic population was observed more frequently in the neoadjuvant group than in patients treated only in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that the neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances both the local and systemic antitumor immune response and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor.",Evaluation and accurate diagnoses of pediatric diseases using artificial intelligence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742121,Nature medicine,2019 05 13,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care.

Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.",Neoadjuvant nivolumab modifies the tumor immune microenvironment in resectable glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742120,Nature medicine,2019 05 13,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system malignancy and has a poor prognosis. Standard first-line treatment, which includes surgery followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy, produces only modest benefits to survival1,2. Here, to explore the feasibility, safety and immunobiological effects of PD-1 blockade in patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma, we conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial (NCT02550249) in which we tested a presurgical dose of nivolumab followed by postsurgical nivolumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in 30 patients (27 salvage surgeries for recurrent cases and 3 cases of primary surgery for newly diagnosed patients). Availability of tumor tissue pre- and post-nivolumab dosing and from additional patients who did not receive nivolumab allowed the evaluation of changes in the tumor immune microenvironment using multiple molecular and cellular analyses. Neoadjuvant nivolumab resulted in enhanced expression of chemokine transcripts, higher immune cell infiltration and augmented TCR clonal diversity among tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, supporting a local immunomodulatory effect of treatment. Although no obvious clinical benefit was substantiated following salvage surgery, two of the three patients treated with nivolumab before and after primary surgery remain alive 33 and 28 months later.",Immune and genomic correlates of response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742119,Nature medicine,2019 06 11,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment.",Reduced mitochondrial fusion and Huntingtin levels contribute to impaired dendritic maturation and behavioral deficits in Fmr1-mutant mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742117,Nature neuroscience,2019 06 13,"Fragile X syndrome results from a loss of the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).

Enhancing mitochondrial fusion partially rescued dendritic abnormalities in FMRP-deficient immature neurons. We show that FMRP deficiency leads to reduced Htt mRNA and protein levels and that HTT mediates FMRP regulation of mitochondrial fusion and dendritic maturation. Mice with hippocampal Htt knockdown and Fmr1-knockout mice showed similar behavioral deficits that could be rescued by treatment with a mitochondrial fusion compound. Our data unveil mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the impaired dendritic maturation of FMRP-deficient neurons and suggest a role for interactions between FMRP and HTT in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome.",Neutrophil adhesion in brain capillaries reduces cortical blood flow and impairs memory function in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742116,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions in Alzheimer's disease patients and related mouse models have been recognized for decades, but the underlying mechanisms and resulting consequences for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice we found that an increased number of cortical capillaries had stalled blood flow as compared to in wild-type animals, largely due to neutrophils that had adhered in capillary segments and blocked blood flow. Administration of antibodies against the neutrophil marker Ly6G reduced the number of stalled capillaries, leading to both an immediate increase in CBF and rapidly improved performance in spatial and working memory tasks. This study identified a previously uncharacterized cellular mechanism that explains the majority of the CBF reduction seen in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that improving CBF rapidly enhanced short-term memory function.

The molecular mechanisms of impaired mitochondrial homeostasis in AD are being investigated. Here we provide evidence that mitophagy is impaired in the hippocampus of AD patients, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human AD neurons, and in animal AD models. In both amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD, mitophagy stimulation (through NAD+ supplementation, urolithin A, and actinonin) reverses memory impairment through PINK-1 (PTEN-induced kinase-1)-, PDR-1 (Parkinson's disease-related-1; parkin)-, or DCT-1 (DAF-16/FOXO-controlled germline-tumor affecting-1)-dependent pathways. Mitophagy diminishes insoluble Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 and prevents cognitive impairment in an APP/PS1 mouse model through microglial phagocytosis of extracellular Aβ plaques and suppression of neuroinflammation. Mitophagy enhancement abolishes AD-related tau hyperphosphorylation in human neuronal cells and reverses memory impairment in transgenic tau nematodes and mice. Our findings suggest that impaired removal of defective mitochondria is a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis and that mitophagy represents a potential therapeutic intervention.",Landscape of B cell immunity and related immune evasion in human cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742113,Nature genetics,2019 05 18,Tumor-infiltrating B cells are an important component in the microenvironment but have unclear anti-tumor effects. We enhanced our previous computational algorithm TRUST to extract the B cell immunoglobulin hypervariable regions from bulk tumor RNA-sequencing data. TRUST assembled more than 30 million complementarity-determining region 3 sequences of the B cell heavy chain (IgH) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Widespread B cell clonal expansions and immunoglobulin subclass switch events were observed in diverse human cancers. Prevalent somatic copy number alterations in the MICA and MICB genes related to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity were identified in tumors with elevated B cell activity. The IgG3-1 subclass switch interacts with B cell-receptor affinity maturation and defects in the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Comprehensive pancancer analyses of tumor-infiltrating B cell-receptor repertoires identified novel tumor immune evasion mechanisms through genetic alterations. The IgH sequences identified here are potentially useful resources for future development of immunotherapies.

However, the role of nuclear transporter proteins in PCa progression has not been well defined. Here, we report that the KPNB1, a key member of Karyopherin beta subunits, is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancers. Further study showed that targeting KPNB1 suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The knockdown of KPNB1 reduced nuclear translocation of c-Myc, the expression of downstream cell cycle modulators, and phosphorylation of regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), a key protein for spindle assembly during mitosis. Meanwhile, CHIP assay demonstrated the binding of c-Myc to KPNB1 promoter region, which indicated a positive feedback regulation of KPNB1 expression mediated by the c-Myc. In addition, NF-κB subunit p50 translocation to nuclei was blocked by KPNB1 inhibition, which led to an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in tumor sphere formation of PCa cells. Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft tumor models with a stable knockdown of KPNB1 in C42B PCa cells validated that the inhibition of KPNB1 could suppress the growth of prostate tumor in vivo. Moreover, the intravenously administration of importazole, a specific inhibitor for KPNB1, effectively reduced PCa tumor size and weight in mice inoculated with PC3 PCa cells. In summary, our data established the functional link between KPNB1 and PCa prone c-Myc, NF-kB, and cell cycle modulators. More importantly, inhibition of KPNB1 could be a new therapeutic target for PCa treatment.","Serial genomic inversions induce tissue-specific architectural stripes, gene misexpression and congenital malformations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742094,Nature cell biology,2019 04 15,"Balanced chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions and translocations can cause congenital disease or cancer by inappropriately rewiring promoter-enhancer contacts1,2. To study the potentially pathogenic consequences of balanced chromosomal rearrangements, we generated a series of genomic inversions by placing an active limb enhancer cluster from the Epha4 regulatory domain at different positions within a neighbouring gene-dense region and investigated their effects on gene regulation in vivo in mice. Expression studies and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture from embryonic limb buds showed that the enhancer cluster activated several genes downstream that are located within asymmetric regions of contact, the so-called architectural stripes3. The ectopic activation of genes led to a limb phenotype that could be rescued by deleting the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) anchor of the stripe. Architectural stripes appear to be driven by enhancer activity, because they do not form in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we show that architectural stripes are a frequent feature of developmental three-dimensional genome architecture often associated with active enhancers. Therefore, balanced chromosomal rearrangements can induce ectopic gene expression and the formation of asymmetric chromatin contact patterns that are dependent on CTCF anchors and enhancer activity.",MicroRNA-dependent regulation of biomechanical genes establishes tissue stiffness homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742093,Nature cell biology,2019 06 10,"Vertebrate tissues exhibit mechanical homeostasis, showing stable stiffness and tension over time and recovery after changes in mechanical stress.

A comprehensive identification of Argonaute 2-associated microRNAs and mRNAs in endothelial cells identified a network of 122 microRNA families that target 73 mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal, contractile, adhesive and extracellular matrix (CAM) proteins. The level of these microRNAs increased in cells plated on stiff versus soft substrates, consistent with homeostasis, and suppressed targets via microRNA recognition elements within the 3' untranslated regions of CAM mRNAs. Inhibition of DROSHA or Argonaute 2, or disruption of microRNA recognition elements within individual target mRNAs, such as connective tissue growth factor, induced hyper-adhesive, hyper-contractile phenotypes in endothelial and fibroblast cells in vitro, and increased tissue stiffness, contractility and extracellular matrix deposition in the zebrafish fin fold in vivo.

Rheumatology,2019 02 23,"Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases, affecting 3% of the world's population, and approximately one-third of patients with psoriasis will eventually transition to having psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The evolution from cutaneous to synovio-entheseal inflammation in these patients presents an opportunity to investigate the critical events linked to arthritis development. The events responsible for progression to PsA are currently unclear. Genetic and clinical-demographic risk factors (most notably familial aggregation and psoriasis sub-phenotypes) provide relevant insights into the variables that promote transition. The specific underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, however, remain poorly defined. Intriguingly, although targeting the IL-23-IL-17 axis substantially improves psoriasis outcomes, this strategy is not more effective than TNF inhibitors in improving musculoskeletal symptoms in PsA. Major unmet needs in the field of PsA include defining those patients with psoriasis at increased risk of developing arthritis, improving our understanding of the natural history of disease and characterizing the immune, environmental and molecular subclinical events preceding PsA onset. Improving our knowledge of this transition is essential for designing clinical trials with treatments that can delay, attenuate or even prevent the development of PsA in patients with psoriasis.",Cell cycle arrest in mitosis promotes interferon-induced necroptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742091,Cell death and differentiation,2019 02 11,"Resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and deregulation of apoptosis often leads to chemoresistance. Therefore, new approaches to target apoptosis-resistant cancer cells are crucial for the development of directed cancer therapies. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cell cycle regulators on interferon (IFN)-induced necroptosis as an alternative cell death mechanism to overcome apoptosis resistance. Here, we report a novel combination treatment of IFNs with cell cycle arrest-inducing compounds that induce necroptosis in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Combination treatment of IFNs (i.e. IFNβ) with inhibitors of the cell cycle (e.g. vinorelbine (VNR), nocodazole (Noc), polo-like kinase-1 (Plk-1) inhibitor BI 6727) co-operate to induce necroptotic cell death upon caspase inactivation. The mode of cell death was confirmed by pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated downregulation of the key necroptotic factors receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed-lineage kinase-like (MLKL) in various cell lines. Mechanistically, we show that necroptosis upon VNR/IFNβ/zVAD.fmk treatment is RIP1-independent but relies on IFNβ-induced gene expression of Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as shown by quantitative RT-PCR and genetic knockdown experiments. Interestingly, we find that RIP3 is phosphorylated in response to compounds that trigger mitotic arrest, even in the absence of IFNβ signaling and necroptosis induction. Together, the identification of a novel combination treatment that triggers necroptosis has implications for the development of molecular-targeted therapies to circumvent apoptosis resistance and point to an underestimated role of cell cycle regulation in cell death signaling.",Phosphoinositides: multipurpose cellular lipids with emerging roles in cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742090,Cell death and differentiation,2019 04 11,"Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids, or phosphoinositides, critically regulate diverse cellular processes, including signalling transduction, cytoskeletal reorganisation, membrane dynamics and cellular trafficking.

However, recent studies have begun to highlight the importance of phosphoinositides in facilitating cell death execution. Here, we cover the latest phosphoinositide research with a particular focus on phosphoinositides in the mechanisms of cell death. This progress article also raises key questions regarding the poorly defined role of phosphoinositides, particularly during membrane-associated events in cell death such as apoptosis and secondary necrosis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) plays the master role in adipocyte differentiation for obesity development. However, optimum anti-obesity drug has yet been developed, mandating more investigation to identify novel regulator in obesity pathogenesis. Heat shock protein 12A (HSPA12A) encodes a novel member of the HSP70 family. Here, we report that obese patients showed increased adipose HSPA12A expression, which was positively correlated with increase of body mass index. Intriguingly, knockout of HSPA12A (Hspa12a-/-) in mice attenuated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced weight gain, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia compared to their wild type (WT) littermates. Increased insulin sensitivity was observed in Hspa12a-/- mice compared to WT mice. The HFD-induced upregulation of PPARγ and its target adipogenic genes in white adipose tissues (WAT) of Hspa12a-/- mice were also attenuated. Loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed that the differentiation of primary adipocyte precursors, as well as the expression of PPARγ and target adipogenic genes during the differentiation, was suppressed by HSPA12A deficiency whereas promoted by HSPA12A overexpression. Importantly, PPARγ inhibition by GW9662 reversed the HSPA12A-mediated adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, HSPA12A expression was downregulated by PPARγ inhibition but upregulated by PPARγ activation in primary adipocytes. A direct binding of PPARγ to the PPAR response element in the Hspa12a promoter region was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and this binding was increased after differentiation of primary adipocytes. These findings indicate that HSPA12A is a novel regulator of adipocyte differentiation and diet-induced obesity through a positive feedback regulation with PPARγ.

This demonstrates the direction and opportunities to further improve the cell voltage and energy density of the alkali-metal organic-oxygen batteries.",Anti-resonance features of destructive quantum interference in single-molecule thiophene junctions achieved by electrochemical gating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742083,Nature materials,2019 05 17,"Controlling the electrical conductance and in particular the occurrence of quantum interference in single-molecule junctions through gating effects has potential for the realization of high-performance functional molecular devices. In this work we used an electrochemically gated, mechanically controllable break junction technique to tune the electronic behaviour of thiophene-based molecular junctions that show destructive quantum interference features. By varying the voltage applied to the electrochemical gate at room temperature, we reached a conductance minimum that provides direct evidence of charge transport controlled by an anti-resonance arising from destructive quantum interference. Our molecular system enables conductance tuning close to two orders of magnitude within the non-faradaic potential region, which is significantly higher than that achieved with molecules not showing destructive quantum interference. Our experimental results, interpreted using quantum transport theory, demonstrate that electrochemical gating is a promising strategy for obtaining improved in situ control over the electrical performance of interference-based molecular devices.",Gate controlling of quantum interference and direct observation of anti-resonances in single molecule charge transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742082,Nature materials,2019 05 11,"Quantum interference can profoundly affect charge transport in single molecules, but experiments can usually measure only the conductance at the Fermi energy. Because, in general, the most pronounced features of the quantum interference are not located at the Fermi energy, it is highly desirable to probe charge transport in a broader energy range. Here, by means of electrochemical gating, we measure the conductance and map the transmission functions of single molecules at and around the Fermi energy, and study signatures associated with constructive and destructive interference. With electrochemical gate control, we tune the quantum interference between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and directly observe anti-resonance, a distinct feature of destructive interference. By tuning the molecule in and out of anti-resonance, we achieve continuous control of the conductance over two orders of magnitude with a subthreshold swing of ~17 mV dec-1, features relevant to high-speed and low-power electronics."

The receptor for AAV (AAVR; also named KIAA0319L) was recently identified, and the precise characterization of AAV-AAVR recognition is in immediate demand. Taking advantage of a particle-filtering algorithm, we report here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the AAV2-AAVR complex at 2.8 Å resolution. This structure reveals that of the five Ig-like polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains in AAVR, PKD2 binds directly to the spike region of the AAV2 capsid adjacent to the icosahedral three-fold axis. Residues in strands B and E, and the BC loop of AAVR PKD2 interact directly with the AAV2 capsid. The interacting residues in the AAV2 capsid are mainly in AAV-featured variable regions. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at the AAV2-AAVR interface reduces binding activity and viral infectivity.

Selenoproteins fulfil essential roles in many organisms1, yet are not ubiquitous across the tree of life3-7. In particular, fungi were deemed devoid of selenoproteins4,5,8. However, we show here that Sec is utilized by nine species belonging to diverse early-branching fungal phyla, as evidenced by the genomic presence of both Sec machinery and selenoproteins. Most fungal selenoproteins lack consensus Sec recoding signals (SECIS elements9) but exhibit other RNA structures, suggesting altered mechanisms of Sec insertion in fungi. Phylogenetic analyses support a scenario of vertical inheritance of the Sec trait within eukaryotes and fungi. Sec was then lost in numerous independent events in various fungal lineages. Notably, Sec was lost at the base of Dikarya, resulting in the absence of selenoproteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other well-studied fungi. Our results indicate that, despite scattered occurrence, selenoproteins are found in all kingdoms of life.",MSC-regulated lncRNA MACC1-AS1 promotes stemness and chemoresistance through fatty acid oxidation in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742067,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients and chemotherapy resistance is the major obstacle to effective cancer therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make important contributions to development of drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we discovered that abundant MSCs in tumor tissues predicted a poor prognosis in GC patients. MSCs promoted stemness and chemoresistance in GC cells through fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) secretion by MSCs activated SMAD2/3 through TGF-β receptors and induced long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MACC1-AS1 expression in GC cells, which promoted FAO-dependent stemness and chemoresistance through antagonizing miR-145-5p. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of FAO with etomoxir (ETX) attenuated MSC-induced FOLFOX regiment resistance in vivo. These results suggest that FAO plays an important role in MSC-mediated stemness and chemotherapy resistance in GC and FAO inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs present as a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance.",CAPS1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis via Snail mediated epithelial mesenchymal transformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742066,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common gastrointestinal cancer with high mortality rate mostly due to metastasis. Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) was originally identified as a soluble factor that reconstitutes Ca2+-dependent secretion. In this study, we discovered a novel role of CAPS1 in CRC metastasis. CAPS1 is frequently up-regulated in CRC tissues. Increased CAPS1 expression is associated with frequent metastasis and poor prognosis of CRC patients. Overexpression of CAPS1 promotes CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as liver metastasis in vivo, without affecting cell proliferation. CAPS1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including decreased E-cadherin and ZO-1, epithelial marker expression, and increased N-cadherin and Snail, mesenchymal marker expression. Snail knockdown reversed CAPS1-induced EMT, cell migration and invasion. This result indicates that Snail is required for CAPS1-mediated EMT process and metastasis in CRC. Furthermore, CAPS1 can bind with Septin2 and p85 (subunit of PI3K). LY294002 and wortmanin, PI3K/Akt inhibitors, can abolish CAPS1-induced increase of Akt/GSK3β activity, as well as increase of Snail protein level. Taken together, CAPS1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis through PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/Snail signal pathway-mediated EMT process.",Targeting LIN28B reprograms tumor glucose metabolism and acidic microenvironment to suppress cancer stemness and metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742065,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"The altered metabolism and acidic microenvironment plays an important role in promoting tumor malignant characteristics. A small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) were considered as a therapy target to reserve tumor relapse, resistance, and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates CSCs metabolism remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a fundamental role of stemness gene LIN28B in maintaining CSCs glycolysis metabolism. Using LIN28B-expressing cancer cell lines, we found that the rate of extracellular acidification, glucose uptake, and lactate secretion are all suppressed by LIN28B knockdown in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, metabolic analyses reveal that CSCs have enhanced aerobic glycolysis metabolic characteristics and the glycolytic product lactate further promotes cancer associated stemness properties. LIN28B silencing suppresses MYC expression that further increases miR-34a-5p level. Furthermore, the glycolysis metabolism of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 is suppressed by either MYC siRNA or miR-34a-5p mimic. Clinically, high MYC and low miR-34a-5p level are correlated with high LIN28B expression and poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients. Notably, blocking LIN28B/MYC/miR-34a-5p signaling pathway by LIN28B-specific inhibitor causes dramatic inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in immunodeficient orthotopic mouse models of human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231. Taken together, our findings offer a preclinical investigation of targeting LIN28B to suppress CSCs glycolysis metabolism and tumor progression that may improve the therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.",Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742064,Oncogene,2019 06 10,"Sustained reliance on androgen receptor (AR) after failure of AR-targeting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prevents effective treatment of castration-recurrent (CR) prostate cancer (CaP). Interfering with the molecular machinery by which AR drives CaP progression may be an alternative therapeutic strategy but its feasibility remains to be tested. Here, we explore targeting the mechanism by which AR, via RhoA, conveys androgen-responsiveness to serum response factor (SRF), which controls aggressive CaP behavior and is maintained in CR-CaP. Following a siRNA screen and candidate gene approach, RNA-Seq studies confirmed that the RhoA effector Protein Kinase N1 (PKN1) transduces androgen-responsiveness to SRF. Androgen treatment induced SRF-PKN1 interaction, and PKN1 knockdown or overexpression severely impaired or stimulated, respectively, androgen regulation of SRF target genes. PKN1 overexpression occurred during clinical CR-CaP progression, and hastened CaP growth and shortened CR-CaP survival in orthotopic CaP xenografts. PKN1's effects on SRF relied on its kinase domain. The multikinase inhibitor lestaurtinib inhibited PKN1 action and preferentially affected androgen regulation of SRF over direct AR target genes. In a CR-CaP patient-derived xenograft, expression of SRF target genes was maintained while AR target gene expression declined and proliferative gene expression increased. PKN1 inhibition decreased viability of CaP cells before and after ADT. In patient-derived CaP explants, lestaurtinib increased AR target gene expression but did not significantly alter SRF target gene or proliferative gene expression. These results provide proof-of-principle for selective forms of ADT that preferentially target different fractions of AR's transcriptional output to inhibit CaP growth.",Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies: kindred pathologic cascades and genetic pleiotropy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742063,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 03 05,"We review the literature on Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies in aged human brains and the relevant underlying pathogenetic cascades. Complex interacting pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), wherein multiple proteins tend to misfold in a manner that is ""reactive,"" but, subsequently, each proteinopathy may contribute strongly to the clinical symptoms. Tau proteinopathy exists in brains of individuals across a broad spectrum of primary underlying conditions-e.g., developmental, traumatic, and inflammatory/infectious diseases. TDP-43 proteinopathy is also expressed in a wide range of clinical disorders.  Although TDP-43 proteinopathy was first described in the central nervous system of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD/FTLD), TDP-43 proteinopathy is also present in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitively impaired persons in advanced age with hippocampal sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other diseases. We list known Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies.  There is also evidence of cellular co-localization between Tau and TDP-43 misfolded proteins, suggesting common pathways or protein interactions facilitating misfolding in one protein by the other. Multiple pleiotropic gene variants can alter risk for Tau or TDP-43 pathologies, and certain gene variants (e.g., APOE ε4, Huntingtin triplet repeats) are associated with increases of both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Studies of genetic risk factors have provided insights into multiple nodes of the pathologic cascades involved in Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Variants from a specific gene can be either a low-penetrant risk factor for a group of diseases, or alternatively, a different variant of the same gene may be a disease-driving allele that is associated with a relatively aggressive and early-onset version of a clinically and pathologically specific disease type. Overall, a complex but enlightening paradigm has emerged, wherein both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies are linked to numerous overlapping upstream influences, and both are associated with multiple downstream pathologically- and clinically-defined deleterious effects.",Association between TDP-43 and mitochondria in inclusion body myositis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742062,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 03 07,"Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common cause of primary myopathy in individuals aged 50 years and over, and is pathologically characterized by protein aggregates of p62 and mislocalized cytoplasmic TDP-43, as well as mitochondrial abnormalities in affected muscle fibers. Our recent studies have shown the accumulation of TDP-43 in mitochondria in neurons from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), and revealed mitochondria as critical mediators of TDP-43 neurotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the association between mitochondria and TDP-43 in biopsied skeletal muscle samples from IBM patients. We found that IBM pathological markers TDP-43, phosphorylated TDP-43, and p62 all coexisted with intensively stained key subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I-V in the same skeletal muscle fibers of patients with IBM. Further immunoblot analysis showed increased levels of TDP-43, truncated TDP-43, phosphorylated TDP-43, and p62, but decreased levels of key subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I and III in IBM patients compared to aged matched control subjects. This is the first demonstration of the close association of TDP-43 accumulation with mitochondria in degenerating muscle fibers in IBM and this association may contribute to the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and pathological protein aggregates.","MAPT mutations, tauopathy, and mechanisms of neurodegeneration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742061,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 02 27,"In multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prominent pathological feature is the aberrant aggregation and inclusion formation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Because of the pathological association, these disorders are often referred to as tauopathies. Mutations in the MAPT gene that encodes tau can cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), providing the clearest evidence that tauopathy plays a causal role in neurodegeneration. However, large gaps in our knowledge remain regarding how various FTDP-17-linked tau mutations promote tau aggregation and neurodegeneration, and, more generally, how the tauopathy is linked to neurodegeneration. Herein, we review what is known about how FTDP-17-linked pathogenic MAPT mutations cause disease, with a major focus on the prion-like properties of wild-type and mutant tau proteins. The hypothesized mechanisms by which mutations in the MAPT gene promote tauopathy are quite varied and may not provide definitive insights into how tauopathy arises in the absence of mutation. Further, differences in the ability of tau and mutant tau proteins to support prion-like propagation in various model systems raise questions about the generalizability of this mechanism in various tauopathies. Notably, understanding the mechanisms of tauopathy induction and spread and tau-induced neurodegeneration has important implications for tau-targeting therapeutics.",A new model for predicting intravenous immunoglobin-resistant Kawasaki disease in Chongqing: a retrospective study on 5277 patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742060,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,Accurate evaluation of individual risk of intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG)-resistance is critical for adopting regimens for the first treatment and prevention of coronary artery lesions (CALs) in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD).

Together with its oxysterol ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, EBI2 mediates migration and differentiation of immune cells. However, the role of EBI2 in the colonic immune system remains insufficiently studied. We found increased mRNA expression of EBI2 and oxysterol-synthesizing enzymes (CH25H, CYP7B1) in the inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis and mice with acute or chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. Accordingly, we detected elevated levels of 25-hydroxylated oxysterols, including 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol in mice with acute colonic inflammation. Knockout of EBI2 or CH25H did not affect severity of DSS colitis; however, inflammation was decreased in male EBI2-/- mice in the IL-10 colitis model. The colonic immune system comprises mucosal lymphoid structures, which accumulate upon chronic inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice and in chronic DSS colitis. However, EBI2-/- mice formed significantly less colonic lymphoid structures at baseline and showed defects in inflammation-induced accumulation of lymphoid structures. In summary, we report induction of the EBI2-7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol axis in colitis and a role of EBI2 for the accumulation of lymphoid tissue during homeostasis and inflammation.

Unfortunately, the trigger leading to the development of intestinal fibrosis in the context of CD remains elusive. Here, we show that colonization by a CD-associated pathobiont adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) promotes the development of intestinal fibrosis. Exogenously inoculated AIEC strain LF82 and commensal E. coli HS were gradually eradicated from the intestine in healthy mice. In Salmonella- or dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis models, AIEC exploited inflammation and stably colonize the gut. Consequently, persistent colonization by AIEC LF82 led to substantial fibrosis. In contrast, commensal E. coli HS was unable to derive a growth advantage from inflammation, thereby failing to colonize the inflamed intestine or promote intestinal fibrosis. AIEC colonization potentiated the expression of the IL-33 receptor ST2 in the intestinal epithelium, which is crucial for the development of intestinal fibrosis. The induction of ST2 by AIEC LF82 was mediated by flagellin, as the ΔfliC mutant failed to induce ST2. These observations provide novel insights into pathobiont-driven intestinal fibrosis and can lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of intestinal fibrosis in the context of CD that target AIEC and/or its downstream IL-33-ST2 signaling.",Noninvasive monitoring of single-cell mechanics by acoustic scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742041,Nature methods,2019 05 22,"The monitoring of mechanics in a single cell throughout the cell cycle has been hampered by the invasiveness of mechanical measurements.

To demonstrate the noninvasiveness of SNACS over successive cell cycles, we used measurements that resulted in deformations of < 15 nm. The cells maintained constant SNACS throughout interphase but showed dynamic changes during mitosis. Our work provides a basis for understanding how growing cells maintain mechanical integrity, and demonstrates that acoustic scattering can be used to noninvasively probe subtle and transient dynamics.",Fast interpolation-based t-SNE for improved visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742040,Nature methods,2019 05 22,"t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for visualizing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, but it scales poorly to large datasets.

We found that vascularized kidney organoids cultured under flow had more mature podocyte and tubular compartments with enhanced cellular polarity and adult gene expression compared with that in static controls. Glomerular vascular development progressed through intermediate stages akin to those involved in the embryonic mammalian kidney's formation of capillary loops abutting foot processes. The association of vessels with these compartments was reduced after disruption of the endogenous VEGF gradient.

Palaeozoic Botryococcus fossils which contribute up to 90% of oil shales and approximately 1% of crude oil, co-localise with diagnostic geolipids from the degradation of source-signature hydrocarbons. However more recent Holocene sediments demonstrate no such association. Consequently, Botryococcus are identified in younger sediments by morphology alone, where potential misclassifications could lead to inaccurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Here we show that a combination of flow cytometry and ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing can unambiguously identify Botryococcus microfossils in Holocene sediments with hitherto unparalleled accuracy and rapidity. The application of aDNA sequencing to microfossils offers a far-reaching opportunity for understanding environmental change in the recent geological record.

Vacuolar iron transporter 1 (VIT1) is important for iron homeostasis in plants, by transporting cytoplasmic ferrous ions into vacuoles. Modification of the VIT1 gene leads to increased iron content in crops, which could be used for the treatment of human iron deficiency diseases. Furthermore, a VIT1 from the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium is considered as a potential drug target for malaria. Here we report the crystal structure of VIT1 from rose gum Eucalyptus grandis, which probably functions as a H+-dependent antiporter for Fe2+ and other transition metal ions. VIT1 adopts a novel protein fold forming a dimer of five membrane-spanning domains, with an ion-translocating pathway constituted by the conserved methionine and carboxylate residues at the dimer interface. The second transmembrane helix protrudes from the lipid membrane by about 40 Å and connects to a three-helical bundle, triangular cytoplasmic domain, which binds to the substrate metal ions and stabilizes their soluble form, thus playing an essential role in their transport.

Previously, it was only possible to image features much larger than the illuminating wavelength with table-top ptychography although knife-edge tests suggested sub-wavelength resolution. However, most real-world imaging applications require resolving of the smallest and closely-spaced features of a sample in an extended field of view. In this work, resolving features as small as 2.5 λ (45 nm) using a table-top ptychography setup is demonstrated by employing a high-order harmonic XUV source with record-high photon flux. For the first time, a Rayleigh-type criterion is used as a direct and unambiguous resolution metric for high-resolution table-top setup. This reliably qualifies this imaging system for real-world applications e.g. in biological sciences, material sciences, imaging integrated circuits and semiconductor mask inspection."

Our findings reveal a significant relation between the ""stare-in-the-crowd"" effect and social and attachment, but not trait anxiety, and therefore provide preliminary cues for personality influences on visual processing of eye gaze and head orientation.",Interference phase-contrast imaging technology without beam separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742014,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Interferometers are widely used in science and industry to measure small displacements, changes in refractive index, and surface irregularities. In all interferometers, including phase-contrast microscopes and DICs (differential interference contrast microscopes), light from a single source is split into two beams that travel along different optical paths. They are then recombined to produce interference. The fundamental operation of beam separation makes device configuration more complex and adds to the bulk of the equipment. In this study we propose a new method of observing phase-contrast images without beam separation by using self-interference inside a grating coupler structure disposed on the observation plane. We experimentally demonstrate that the self-interference principle can generate phase-contrast images using a simple configuration. From measurements using a multilevel phase plate, we confirm its phase-contrast depth resolution to approach one- tenth of a wavelength.",Correction: Nutritional status in chronic spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742013,Spinal cord,2019 04 02,"The authors noted that there were two typographical errors in Table 2.

Subjects included 41 patients who were diagnosed with a VS and underwent translabyrinthine microsurgery (TLM) between January 2015 and May 2016. All patients underwent related examinations and were asked to answer the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scale and a visual analog scale (VAS) of tinnitus severity both pre- and postoperatively. Of the 41 patients, 31 (75.6%) suffered from tinnitus before surgery. Microsurgery was associated with an overall decrease in tinnitus (p < 0.001). There was a significant improvement in THI and VAS scores after surgery (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). The decrease in THI scores in the low-frequency group was significantly larger than that of the mid- and high-frequency groups after surgery (p = 0.034 and p = 0.001, respectively). The loudness of tinnitus decreased significantly after surgery (p = 0.031). Tinnitus in patients with VS improved after TLM. Patients with mid-/high-frequency tinnitus and louder tinnitus preoperatively seemed to have a worse prognosis than those with low-frequency and quieter tinnitus.",Impact of TP53 immunohistochemistry on the histological grading system for endometrial endometrioid carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742011,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2019 02 11,"Endometrial endometrioid carcinoma is usually divided into three histological subgroups: grade 1 (G1), grade 2 (G2), and grade 3 (G3). Most cases of endometrial endometrioid carcinoma G1/2 have a favorable prognosis, although some can have unfavorable outcomes, especially when they involve elderly patients, with similarities to endometrioid carcinoma G3 and serous carcinoma. This retrospective study evaluated whether TP53 abnormalities in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma could be used to supplement the current grading system and improve its ability to predict clinical outcomes. Immunohistochemical expression of TP53 was analyzed using tissue microarrays from the surgically resected specimens of 475 patients with endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. Weak or moderate expression was defined as TP53-normal expression, while absent or strongly positive expression was defined as TP53-aberrant expression. The endometrial endometrioid carcinomas had originally been diagnosed as G1 (69%), G2 (18%), and G3 (13%). Univariate analyses revealed that TP53-aberrant expression was associated with poor survival in G1 and G2 cases, but not G3 cases. In addition, age (<60 years vs. ≥60 years) was correlated with TP53-aberrant expression in G1 cases (3% vs. 16%, p = 0.001), but not in G2 or G3 cases. Based on immunohistochemical TP53 expression, the endometrial endometrioid carcinomas were reclassified using a prognostic grading system as high-grade (G1 or G2 with TP53- aberrant expression, and G3 with TP53-normal or -aberrant expression) or low-grade (G1 or G2 with TP53-normal expression). The multivariate analyses revealed that the prognostic grading system (using histological grade and TP53 expression) could independently predict poor progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.91, p < 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 3.62, p < 0.001). Therefore, combining immunohistochemical TP53 expression with the traditional histological grading system for endometrial endometrioid carcinoma may help improve its ability to accurately predict the patient's prognosis.",See-through observation of malaria parasite behaviors in the mosquito vector.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742010,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Although it is known that malaria parasites proliferate in the midgut of mosquito vector, their detailed behaviors, from gamete maturation to formation of next generation sporozoite, have not been fully understood at cellular or molecular level. This is mainly attributed to technical difficulties of dissection and whole-mount observation, of delicate and opaque mosquito body contents. In addition, blood pigment surrounding parasites immediately after blood meal also complicates tracing mosquito-stage parasites. Recent revolutionary studies have overcome such negative factors in tissue observation by clearing organisms. CUBIC reagents succeeded to remove both light scattering and blood pigment from various mouse tissues, and to whole-organ image fluorescence-labeled cell structures. In this study, we utilized the advanced version of CUBIC technology and high sensitivity fluorescent markers for see-through observation of mosquito vector after engulfment of rodent malaria parasites to clarify their behaviors during mosquito stage. As a result, we succeeded to visualize oocysts, sporozoites, female gametes and ookinetes in the mosquito bodies without any dissection.",Nkx2-5 Second Heart Field Target Gene Ccdc117 Regulates DNA Metabolism and Proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742009,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"The cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5 is essential for normal outflow tract (OFT) and right ventricle (RV) development. Nkx2-5-/- null mouse embryos display severe OFT and RV hypoplasia and a single ventricle phenotype due to decreased proliferation of Second Heart Field (SHF) cells, a pool of cardiac progenitors present in anterior pharyngeal arch mesoderm at mid-gestation. However, definition of the precise role of Nkx2-5 in facilitating SHF expansion is incomplete. We have found that Nkx2-5 positively and directly regulates a novel target gene, Ccdc117, in cells of the SHF at these stages. The nuclear/mitotic spindle associated protein Ccdc117 interacts with the MIP18/MMS19 cytoplasmic iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly (CIA) complex, which transfers critical FeS clusters to several key enzymes with functions in DNA repair and replication. Loss of cellular Ccdc117 expression results in reduced proliferation rates associated with a delay at the G1-S transition, decreased rates of DNA synthesis, and unresolved DNA damage. These results implicate a novel role for Nkx2-5 in the regulation of cell cycle events in the developing heart, through Ccdc117's interaction with elements of the CIA pathway and the facilitation of DNA replication during SHF expansion.",Early-life epigenetic changes along the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene influence resilience or vulnerability to heat stress later in life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742007,Molecular psychiatry,2019 02 11,"Stressful events in early life might lead to stress resilience or vulnerability, depending on an adjustable stress-response set-point, which can be altered during postnatal sensory development and involves epigenetic regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). During the critical developmental period of thermal-control establishment in 3-day-old chicks, heat stress was found to affect both body temperature and expression of CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Both increased during heat challenge in vulnerable chicks, whereas they decreased in resilient chicks. Our aim was to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism underlying the regulation of stress resilience or vulnerability. Accordingly, DNA CpG methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) at the CRH intron, which we found to serve as a repressor element, displayed low 5mc% alongside high 5hmc% in resilient chicks, and high 5mc% with low 5hmc% in vulnerable ones. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which has a binding site on this intron, bound abundantly during acute heat stress and was nearly absent during moderate stress, restricting repression by the repressor element, and thus activating CRH gene transcription. Furthermore, REST assembled into a protein complex with TET3, which bound directly to the CRH gene. Finally, the adjacent histone recruited the histone acetylation enzyme GCN5 to this complex, which increased H3K27ac during harsh, but not moderate heat conditioning. We conclude that an epigenetic mechanism involving both post-translational histone modification and DNA methylation in a regulatory segment of CRH is involved in determining a resilient or vulnerable response to stress later in life.",In-situ synthesized and pattern Ag/Bi2Se3 composite structure by LDW and photothermal conversion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742006,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Bi2Se3 nanofilm has exhibited many promising potentials application in the field of photo-to-heat conversion. A highly-efficient photo-to-heat conversion system of Ag/Bi2Se3 composite nanofilm is successfully fabricated through laser direct writing (LDW) technique. The localized heat induced by laser simultaneously achieve Ag particles synthesis, transfer and patterning in a single processing step. The thermal reaction process includes the forming of nanoparticles based on the process of the thermal reduction, laser ablation, sputtering deposition and so on. The thermal storage capability and photothermal conversion stability have been greatly improved through preventing the heat from loss and efficient LSPR enhancing. The photothermal conversion mechanism of composition film is discussed in detail. This work suggests that the laser-assisted transfer technique give rise to a new expectation of functional composite nanofilm application for energy conversion.",Faecal bacterial and short-chain fatty acids signature in hypercholesterolemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30742005,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Gut microbiota has been suggested to affect lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to characterize the faecal microbiota signature and both short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids (BA) profile of hypercholesterolemic subjects. Microbiota composition, SCFAs, BA and blood lipid profile from male volunteers with hypercholesterolemia (HC) and normocholesterolemia (NC) were determined by 16S rDNA sequencing, HPLC, GC and NMR, respectively. HC subjects were characterized by having lower relative abundance of Anaeroplasma (0.002% vs 0.219%, p-value = 0.026) and Haemophilus (0.041% vs 0.078%, p-value = 0.049), and higher of Odoribacter (0.51% vs 0.16%; p-value = 0.044). Correlation analysis revealed that Anaeroplasma and Haemophilus were associated to an unfavourable lipid profile: they correlated negatively to cholesterol and triglycerides related biomarkers and the ratio total to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and positively to HDL size. Odoribacter displayed an opposite behaviour. Faecal SCFAs profile revealed higher abundance of isobutyric (2.76% vs 0.82%, p-value = 0.049) and isovaleric acid (1.32% vs 0.06%, p-value = 0.016) in HC. Isobutyric acid correlated positively with Odoribacter and lipid parameters indicative of an unfavourable profile. BA profile did not show differences between groups. It was concluded that HC subjects showed a particular faecal bacterial signature and SCFAs profile associated with their lipid profile."

However, while certain fibril morphologies have been linked to downstream pathological phenotypes, others appear less harmful, leading to the concept of fibril strains, originally described in relation to prion disease. Indeed, the presence of fibrils does not associate directly with neurotoxicity. Rather, it has been suggested that the toxic compounds are soluble amyloidogenic oligomers, potentially co-existing with fibrils. Here, combining synchrotron radiation circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and binding assays on native plasma membrane sheets, we reveal distinct biological and biophysical differences between initial and matured fibrils, transformed within the timespan of few days. Immature fibrils are reservoirs of membrane-binding species, which in response to even gentle experimental changes release into solution in a reversible manner. In contrast, mature fibrils, albeit macroscopically indistinguishable from their less mature counterparts, are structurally robust, shielding the solution from the membrane active soluble species. We thus show that particular biological activity resides transiently with the fibrillating sample, distinct for one, but not the other, spontaneously formed fibril polymorph. These results shed new light on the principles of fibril polymorphism with consequent impact on future design of assays and therapeutic development.",Flexible PVC materials grafted with castor oil derivative containing synergistic flame retardant groups of nitrogen and phosphorus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741993,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Internally plasticized PVC by replacement of chlorine with castor oil derivative containing synergistic flame retardant groups of nitrogen and phosphorus, that is, castor oil derivative grafted onto PVC matrix, is reported.

The combination of castor oil derivative containing synergistic flame retardant groups of nitrogen and phosphorus with PVC matrix through modifying PVC materials with click reaction prepared flexible PVC materials with zero migration and enhanced flame retardant property.",Functional expression of the mechanosensitive PIEZO1 channel in primary endometrial epithelial cells and endometrial organoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741991,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Successful pregnancy requires the establishment of a complex dialogue between the implanting embryo and the endometrium. Knowledge regarding molecular candidates involved in this early communication process is inadequate due to limited access to primary human endometrial epithelial cells (EEC). Since pseudo-pregnancy in rodents can be induced by mechanical scratching of an appropriately primed uterus, this study aimed to investigate the expression of mechanosensitive ion channels in EEC. Poking of EEC provoked a robust calcium influx and induced an increase in current densities, which could be blocked by an inhibitor of mechanosensitive ion channels. Interestingly, RNA expression studies showed high expression of PIEZO1 in EEC of mouse and human. Additional analysis provided further evidence for the functional expression of PIEZO1 since stimulation with Yoda1, a chemical agonist of PIEZO1, induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and current densities in EEC. Moreover, the ion channel profile of human endometrial organoids (EMO) was validated as a representative model for endometrial epithelial cells. Mechanical and chemical stimulation of EMO induced strong calcium responses supporting the hypothesis of mechanosensitive ion channel expression in endometrial epithelial cells. In conclusion, EEC and EMO functionally express the mechanosensitive PIEZO1 channel that could act as a potential target for the development of novel treatments to further improve successful implantation processes.",Fourth finger dependence of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder in multi-digit force coordination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741990,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"A number of studies have reported that the digit ratio 2D:4D (length of the second finger divided by length of the fourth finger) is smaller (longer fourth digit) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in typically developed (TD) controls. Because form and function are closely related in biological systems, we hypothesized that the 4D dominance occurs in not only finger morphology but also physical performance in ASD. Individuals with ASD and TD controls participated in a multi-digit force-producing task. Individuals with ASD showed a significant 4D dependence compared to TD controls in the task. We found a significant correlation between 4D dependence and scores of the standard diagnostic instrument across individuals with ASD. Our analysis of functional connectivity in resting-state functional MRI suggests that connectivity between the visual cortex and the cerebellum contributes to the 4D dependence. Collectively, these results extend the 2D:4D ratio beyond being a morphological marker to being involved in motor functions in the form of 4D dependence in a multi-digit force task.",Use of item response theory to develop a shortened version of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 scales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741988,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"It is important that questionnaires are as short as possible while still capturing the scope of problems relevant in an effective and reliable manner, to minimize the response burden. The purpose of our study was to develop a shortened version of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 for using in breast cancer survivors. Our data come from 10794 breast cancer survivors who completed the EORTC QLQ-BR23. Two-thirds of the sample was randomly selected from the original sample for development, and the remaining was used for validation. Item response theory methods were applied to shorten scales. The graded response model of Samejima was used to fit the item responses. The shortened scale was evaluated with the validation set by examining the mean difference, the proportion of respondents correctly predicted, correlation and weighted kappa between the shortened form and the original observed scores. Results reveal that a three-item BRBI, a four-item BRST, a three-item BRBS and a two-item BRAS forecast the scores on the original scales with wonderful consistency and are alike in measurement precision with no loss or only little loss in detecting group differences.

The marked regions formed by deposits from the correction pen demonstrate ubiquitous flow resistances to typical aqueous solutions and organic solvents in the transverse direction, resulting in a preferential bulk flow along the axial direction of the paper channels 'fabricated' in the process. Considering the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of this platform, it is deemed to be ideal for (bio) chemical sensing and point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings.",Spatial distribution of prokaryotic communities in hypersaline soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741985,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Increasing salinization in wetland systems is a major threat to ecosystem services carried out by microbial communities. Thus, it is paramount to understand how salinity drives both microbial community structures and their diversity. Here we evaluated the structure and diversity of the prokaryotic communities from a range of highly saline soils (EC1:5 from 5.96 to 61.02 dS/m) from the Odiel Saltmarshes and determined their association with salinity and other soil physicochemical features by analyzing 16S rRNA gene amplicon data through minimum entropy decomposition (MED). We found that these soils harbored unique communities mainly composed of halophilic and halotolerant taxa from the phyla Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Balneolaeota, Bacteroidetes and Rhodothermaeota. In the studied soils, several site-specific properties were correlated with community structure and individual abundances of particular sequence variants. Salinity had a secondary role in shaping prokaryotic communities in these highly saline samples since the dominant organisms residing in them were already well-adapted to a wide range of salinities. We also compared ESV-based results with OTU-clustering derived ones, showing that, in this dataset, no major differences in ecological outcomes were obtained by the employment of one or the other method.",A comparison of different GRACE solutions in terrestrial water storage trend estimation over Tibetan Plateau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741984,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) estimations provide valuable information for the monitoring of land water resources changes. Multiple parameters and strategies for inversion of the water storage changes have been explored. The explorations on differences between GRACE solutions in local regions and basins are fundamental and important. This study focuses on comparisons of TWSA trends between different GRACE solutions over Tibetan Plateau (TP), both storage and flux among solutions were compared. Results show that great discrepancies exist in TWSA between GRACE solutions derived from the standard spherical harmonic approach (SSH) and the mascon approach. Three SSH-based GRACE solutions (JPL, CSR, and GFZ) detect no significant TWSA changes for the whole area of Tibetan Plateau, whereas JPL mascon solution (JPL-M) and CSR mascon solution (CSR-M) gave decreasing trends of 3.10 km3/yr and 3.77 km3/yr, respectively. This difference also exists in the Yangtze River-Yellow River basin (YYR basin) in the TP. Although five solutions derived consistent TWSA trends in northwest river basin (NWR basin) and southwest river basin (SWR basin) in the TP, the variations between different solutions are 2.88 km3/yr and 4.75 km3/yr for NWR and SWR basin respectively, which could not be neglected. The JPL-M solution, as a result, would overestimate both TWSA decreasing and increasing trends comparing with other GRACE solutions. The results of this study are expected to provide references for the studies of water resource dynamics over Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding areas based on GRACE TWSA products.",Increasing trends in fecundity and calf survival of bottlenose dolphins in a marine protected area.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741983,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Estimates of temporal variation in demographic rates are critical for identifying drivers of population change and supporting conservation. However, for inconspicuous wide-ranging species, births may be missed and fecundity rates underestimated. We address this issue using photo-identification data and a novel robust design multistate model to investigate changes in bottlenose dolphin fecundity and calf survival. The model allows for uncertainty in breeding status, and seasonal effects. The best model estimated an increase in the proportion of females with newborn calves from 0.16 (95% CI = 0.11-0.24) in 2001 to 0.28 (95% CI = 0.22-0.36) in 2016. First year calf survival also increased over this period from 0.78 (95% CI = 0.53-0.92) to 0.93 (95% CI = 0.82-0.98). Second year calf survival remained lower, but also showed an increase from 0.32 (95% CI = 0.19-0.48) to 0.55 (95% CI = 0.44-0.65). Females with newborn calves had a slightly higher mortality than those with older calves, but further work is required to evaluate potential costs of reproduction.

Recent studies have suggested that host plant genotypes control, at least partly, plant-associated microbiome compositions. However, we still have limited knowledge of how microbiome structures are determined in/on grafted crop plants, whose above-ground (scion) and below-ground (rootstock) genotypes are different with each other. By using eight varieties of grafted tomato plants, we examined how rootstock genotypes could determine the assembly of leaf endophytic microbes in field conditions. An Illumina sequencing analysis showed that both bacterial and fungal community structures did not significantly differ among tomato plants with different rootstock genotypes: rather, sampling positions in the farmland contributed to microbiome variation in a major way. Nonetheless, a further analysis targeting respective microbial taxa suggested that some bacteria and fungi could be preferentially associated with particular rootstock treatments. Specifically, a bacterium in the genus Deinococcus was found disproportionately from ungrafted tomato individuals. In addition, yeasts in the genus Hannaella occurred frequently on the tomato individuals whose rootstock genotype was ""Ganbarune"". Overall, this study suggests to what extent leaf microbiome structures can be affected/unaffected by rootstock genotypes in grafted crop plants."

Current advances in producing printable ITO inks are reducing the volume of wasted indium during thin film patterning. However, their applicability to flexible electronics is hindered by the need for high temperature processing that results in damage to conventional polymer substrates. Here, we detail the conditions under which laser heating can be used as a replacement for oven and furnace treatments. Measurements of the optical properties of both the printed ITO film and the polymer substrate (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) identify that in the 1.5-2.0 μm wavelength band there is absorption in the ITO film but good transparency in PET. Hence, laser light that is not absorbed in the film does not go on to add a deleterious energy loading to the substrate. Localization of the energy deposition in the film is further enhanced by using ultrashort laser pulses (~1 ps) thus limiting heat flow during the interaction. Under these conditions, laser processing of the printed ITO films results in an improvement of the conductivity without damage to the PET.",Clinical relevance of non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolated from respiratory specimens: seven year experience in a UK hospital.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741969,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"The frequency of isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species from respiratory specimens is increasing, however the clinical relevance of such identifications vary by mycobacterial species and geographical location.

Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) was the species most likely to cause clinically significant disease and be sputum smear positive, thus warranting particular attention.",Long-range temporal correlation in Auditory Brainstem Responses to Spoken Syllable/da/.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741968,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"The speech auditory brainstem response (sABR) is an objective clinical tool to diagnose particular impairments along the auditory brainstem pathways. We explore the scaling behavior of the brainstem in response to synthetic /da/ stimuli using a proposed pipeline including Multifractal Detrended Moving Average Analysis (MFDMA) modified by Singular Value Decomposition. The scaling exponent confirms that all normal sABR are classified into the non-stationary process. The average Hurst exponent is H = 0:77 ± 0:12 at 68% confidence interval indicating long-range correlation which shows the first universality behavior of sABR. Our findings exhibit that fluctuations in the sABR series are dictated by a mechanism associated with long-term memory of the dynamic of the auditory system in the brainstem level. The q-dependency of h(q) demonstrates that underlying data sets have multifractal nature revealing the second universality behavior of the normal sABR samples. Comparing Hurst exponent of original sABR with the results of the corresponding shuffled and surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractality is almost due to the long-range temporal correlations which are devoted to the third universality. Finally, the presence of long-range correlation which is related to the slow timescales in the subcortical level and integration of information in the brainstem network is confirmed.",Dense genotyping-by-sequencing linkage maps of two Synthetic W7984×Opata reference populations provide insights into wheat structural diversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741967,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum) genetic maps are a key enabling tool for genetic studies. We used genotyping-by-sequencing-(GBS) derived markers to map recombinant inbred line (RIL) and doubled haploid (DH) populations from crosses of W7984 by Opata, and used the maps to explore features of recombination control. The RIL and DH populations, SynOpRIL and SynOpDH, were composed of 906 and 92 individuals, respectively. Two high-density genetic linkage framework maps were constructed of 2,842 and 2,961 cM, harboring 3,634 and 6,580 markers, respectively. Using imputation, we added 43,013 and 86,042 markers to the SynOpRIL and SynOpDH maps. We observed preferential recombination in telomeric regions and reduced recombination in pericentromeric regions. Recombination rates varied between subgenomes, with the D genomes of the two populations exhibiting the highest recombination rates of 0.26-0.27 cM/Mb. QTL mapping identified two additive and three epistatic loci associated with crossover number. Additionally, we used published POPSEQ data from SynOpDH to explore the structural variation in W7984 and Opata. We found that chromosome 5AS is missing from W7984. We also found 2,332 variations larger than 100 kb. Structural variants were more abundant in distal regions, and overlapped 9,196 genes. The two maps provide a resource for trait mapping and genomic-assisted breeding.",Synthesis of [18F]Favipiravir and Biodistribution in C3H/HeN Mice as Assessed by Positron Emission Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741966,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Favipiravir (T705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) is a pyrazine analog that has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of viruses in multiple in vivo disease models. To better understand the compounds anti-viral activity, assessment of the drug's biodistribution and kinetics in vivo may lend insight into how best to evaluate the compound efficacy preclinically and to contribute to the design of clinical studies to take into account the compound's pharmacokinetic distribution and kinetics. In the current study, a method for synthesis of [18F]favipiravir was developed and the biodistribution in mice naïve to and pre-dosed with favipiravir was assessed by PET and gamma counting of tissue samples. Fluorine-18 labeling of favipiravir was achieved in a one-pot, two-step synthesis using a commercially available precursor, methyl-5-chloroisoxazolo[4,5-b]pyrazine-3-carboxylate, with an overall radiochemical yield of 15-24%, a molar activity of 37-74 GBq/µmol in a 70 minute synthesis time. [18F]favipiravir tissue uptake and distribution was similar in naïve and pre-dosed mice; however, in the pre-dosed animals plasma clearance was more rapid and tissue clearance appeared to be prolonged. In conclusion, application of PET to the evaluation of favipiravir has demonstrated the importance of dosing regimen on the distribution and tissue uptake and clearance of the molecule. Favipiravir is cleared through the kidney as previously reported but the liver and intestinal excretion may also play an important role in compound elimination. Measurement of the tissue uptake of favipiravir as determined by PET may be a more important indicator of a compound's potential efficacy than purely monitoring plasma parameters such as viremia and drug levels.",Noise tailoring for quantum circuits via unitary 2t-design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741965,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Because of environmental variations and imperfect operations, real-world quantum computers produce different coherent errors that are difficult to estimate. Here, we propose a method whereby the twirled noise over a unitary 2t-design (a set of unitary matrices that approximate the entire unitary group) for quantum circuits can be tailored into stochastic noise. Then, we prove that local random circuits for twirling separable noisy channel over the Clifford group can be used to construct a unitary 2t-design, which is easy to implement in experiments. Moreover, we prove that our method is robust to gate-dependent and gate-independent noise. The stochastic noise can be both estimated by average fidelity and directly obtained by randomized benchmarking via unitary 2t-designs. Obtaining such tailored noise is an important guarantee for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation.",Colour lightness of butterfly assemblages across North America and Europe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741964,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Melanin-based dark colouration is beneficial for insects as it increases the absorption of solar energy and protects against pathogens. Thus, it is expected that insect colouration is darker in colder regions and in regions with high humidity, where it is assumed that pathogen pressure is highest. These relationships between colour lightness, insect distribution, and climate between taxa and subtaxa across continents have never been tested and compared. Here we analysed the colour lightness of nearly all butterfly species of North America and Europe using the average colour lightness of species occurring within 50 km × 50 km grid cells across both continents as the dependent variable and average insolation, temperature and humidity within grid cells as explanatory variables. We compared the direction, strength and shape of these relationships between butterfly families and continents. On both continents, butterfly assemblages in colder and more humid regions were generally darker coloured than assemblages in warmer and less humid regions. Although these relationships differed in detail between families, overall trends within families on both continents were similar. Our results add further support for the importance of insect colour lightness as a mechanistic adaptation to climate that influences biogeographical patterns of species distributions.","A comparative in vitro study of the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of human dental pulp stem cells, gingival fibroblasts and foreskin fibroblasts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741963,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Human teeth contain a variety of mesenchymal stem cell populations that could be used for cell-based regenerative therapies. However, the isolation and potential use of these cells in the clinics require the extraction of functional teeth, a process that may represent a significant barrier to such treatments. Fibroblasts are highly accessible and might represent a viable alternative to dental stem cells. We thus investigated and compared the in vitro differentiation potential of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs), gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) and foreskin fibroblasts (hFFs). These cell populations were cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation media, followed by Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining to visualize cytodifferentiation. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the expression of markers specific for stem cells (NANOG, OCT-4), osteogenic (RUNX2, ALP, SP7/OSX) and adipogenic (PPAR-γ2, LPL) differentiation. While fibroblasts are more prone towards adipogenic differentiation, hDPSCs exhibit a higher osteogenic potential. These results indicate that although fibroblasts possess a certain mineralization capability, hDPSCs represent the most appropriate cell population for regenerative purposes involving bone and dental tissues.",Atypical biological features of a new cold seep site on the Lofoten-Vesterålen continental margin (northern Norway).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741962,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"A newly discovered cold seep from the Lofoten-Vesterålen margin (Norwegian Sea) is dominated by the chemosymbiotrophic siboglinid Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis like other high latitude seeps, but additionally displays uncharacteristic features. Sulphidic bottom water likely prevents colonization by cnidarians and sponges, resulting in fewer taxa than deeper seeps in the region, representing a deviation from depth-related trends seen among seeps elsewhere. O. haakonmosbiensis was present among carbonate and barite crusts, constituting the first record of frenulates among hard substrates. The presence of both adults and egg cases indicate that Ambylraja hyperborea skates use the site as an egg case nursery ground. Due to sub-zero ambient temperatures (-0.7 °C), we hypothesize that small, seepage related heat anomalies aid egg incubation and prevent embryo mortality. We place our results within the context of high-latitude seeps and suggest they exert evolutionary pressure on benthic species, thereby selecting for elevated exploitation and occupancy of high-productivity habitats."

A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was proposed within the NutriNet-Santé population-based e-cohort launched in France in 2009. Participants were 43,060 French volunteers aged 18 y and over with Internet access. A self-report questionnaire assessing sleep characteristics was administered in 2014. The main outcome (dependent) variable was weekday or weekend napping (yes/no). The main exposure (independent) variables were overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depressive disorders, incident major cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina), and incident cancer (breast and prostate). The associations of interest were investigated with multivariable logistic regression analysis. No significant associations were found between major cardiovascular diseases or breast or prostate cancer and napping. Instead, we found that napping was more common among males (46.1%) than among females 36.9% (p < 0.0001). Individuals who were overweight or obese or had hypertension, diabetes, depression or anxiety disorders had an increased likelihood of napping compared with their healthy peers. The adjusted ORs ranged from 1.14 to 1.28″. In conclusion, most chronic conditions were independently associated with napping. Future longitudinal analyses are needed to elucidate causality.","A mutation in the AdhE alcohol dehydrogenase of Clostridium thermocellum increases tolerance to several primary alcohols, including isobutanol, n-butanol and ethanol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741948,Scientific reports,2019 02 19,"Clostridium thermocellum is a good candidate organism for producing cellulosic biofuels due to its native ability to ferment cellulose, however its maximum biofuel titer is limited by tolerance. Wild type C. thermocellum is inhibited by 5 g/L n-butanol. Using growth adaptation in a chemostat, we increased n-butanol tolerance to 15 g/L. We discovered that several tolerant strains had acquired a D494G mutation in the adhE gene. Re-introducing this mutation recapitulated the n-butanol tolerance phenotype. In addition, it increased tolerance to several other primary alcohols including isobutanol and ethanol. To confirm that adhE is the cause of inhibition by primary alcohols, we showed that deleting adhE also increases tolerance to several primary alcohols.",Revealing the role of lattice distortions in the hydrogen-induced metal-insulator transition of SmNiO3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741947,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"The discovery of hydrogen-induced electronic phase transitions in strongly correlated materials such as rare-earth nickelates has opened up a new paradigm in regulating materials' properties for both fundamental study and technological applications. However, the microscopic understanding of how protons and electrons behave in the phase transition is lacking, mainly due to the difficulty in the characterization of the hydrogen doping level. Here, we demonstrate the quantification and trajectory of hydrogen in strain-regulated SmNiO3 by using nuclear reaction analysis. Introducing 2.4% of elastic strain in SmNiO3 reduces the incorporated hydrogen concentration from ~1021 cm-3 to ~1020 cm-3. Unexpectedly, despite a lower hydrogen concentration, a more significant modification in resistivity is observed for tensile-strained SmNiO3, substantially different from the previous understanding. We argue that this transition is explained by an intermediate metastable state occurring in the transient diffusion process of hydrogen, despite the absence of hydrogen at the post-transition stage.",Genome-wide association scan identifies new variants associated with a cognitive predictor of dyslexia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741946,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 13,"Developmental dyslexia (DD) is one of the most prevalent learning disorders, with high impact on school and psychosocial development and high comorbidity with conditions like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. DD is characterized by deficits in different cognitive skills, including word reading, spelling, rapid naming, and phonology. To investigate the genetic basis of DD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these skills within one of the largest studies available, including nine cohorts of reading-impaired and typically developing children of European ancestry (N = 2562-3468). We observed a genome-wide significant effect (p < 1 × 10-8) on rapid automatized naming of letters (RANlet) for variants on 18q12.2, within MIR924HG (micro-RNA 924 host gene; rs17663182 p = 4.73 × 10-9), and a suggestive association on 8q12.3 within NKAIN3 (encoding a cation transporter; rs16928927, p = 2.25 × 10-8). rs17663182 (18q12.2) also showed genome-wide significant multivariate associations with RAN measures (p = 1.15 × 10-8) and with all the cognitive traits tested (p = 3.07 × 10-8), suggesting (relational) pleiotropic effects of this variant. A polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed significant genetic overlaps of some of the DD-related traits with educational attainment (EDUyears) and ADHD. Reading and spelling abilities were positively associated with EDUyears (p ~ [10-5-10-7]) and negatively associated with ADHD PRS (p ~ [10-8-10-17]). This corroborates a long-standing hypothesis on the partly shared genetic etiology of DD and ADHD, at the genome-wide level. Our findings suggest new candidate DD susceptibility genes and provide new insights into the genetics of dyslexia and its comorbities.",Suppressed phase separation of mixed-halide perovskites confined in endotaxial matrices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741944,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"The functionality and performance of a semiconductor is determined by its bandgap. Alloying, as for instance in InxGa1-xN, has been a mainstream strategy for tuning the bandgap. Keeping the semiconductor alloys in the miscibility gap (being homogeneous), however, is non-trivial. This challenge is now being extended to halide perovskites - an emerging class of photovoltaic materials. While the bandgap can be conveniently tuned by mixing different halogen ions, as in CsPb(BrxI1-x)3, the so-called mixed-halide perovskites suffer from severe phase separation under illumination. Here, we discover that such phase separation can be highly suppressed by embedding nanocrystals of mixed-halide perovskites in an endotaxial matrix. The tuned bandgap remains remarkably stable under extremely intensive illumination. The agreement between the experiments and a nucleation model suggests that the size of the nanocrystals and the host-guest interfaces are critical for the photo-stability. The stabilized bandgap will be essential for the development of perovskite-based optoelectronics, such as tandem solar cells and full-color LEDs.",Oxidation induced strain and defects in magnetite crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741943,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"Oxidation of magnetite (Fe3O4) has broad implications in geochemistry, environmental science and materials science. Spatially resolving strain fields and defect evolution during oxidation of magnetite provides further insight into its reaction mechanisms. Here we show that the morphology and internal strain distributions within individual nano-sized (~400 nm) magnetite crystals can be visualized using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI). Oxidative dissolution in acidic solutions leads to increases in the magnitude and heterogeneity of internal strains. This heterogeneous strain likely results from lattice distortion caused by Fe(II) diffusion that leads to the observed domains of increasing compressive and tensile strains. In contrast, strain evolution is less pronounced during magnetite oxidation at elevated temperature in air. These results demonstrate that oxidative dissolution of magnetite can induce a rich array of strain and defect structures, which could be an important factor that contributes to the high reactivity observed on magnetite particles in aqueous environment.",Cation-swapped homogeneous nanoparticles in perovskite oxides for high power density.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741942,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"Exsolution has been intensively studied in the fields of energy conversion and storage as a method for the preparation of catalytically active and durable metal nanoparticles. Under typical conditions, however, only a limited number of nanoparticles can be exsolved from the host oxides. Herein, we report the preparation of catalytic nanoparticles by selective exsolution through topotactic ion exchange, where deposited Fe guest cations can be exchanged with Co host cations in PrBaMn1.7Co0.3O5+δ. Interestingly, this phenomenon spontaneously yields the host PrBaMn1.7Fe0.3O5+δ, liberating all the Co cations from the host owing to the favorable incorporation energy of Fe into the lattice of the parent host (ΔEincorporation = -0.41 eV) and the cation exchange energy (ΔEexchange = -0.34 eV). Remarkably, the increase in the number of exsolved nanoparticles leads to their improved catalytic activity as a solid oxide fuel cell electrode and in the dry reforming of methane.",Selective photocatalytic conversion of methane into carbon monoxide over zinc-heteropolyacid-titania nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741940,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"Chemical utilization of vast fossil and renewable feedstocks of methane remains one of the most important challenges of modern chemistry. Herein, we report direct and selective methane photocatalytic oxidation at ambient conditions into carbon monoxide, which is an important chemical intermediate and a platform molecule. The composite catalysts on the basis of zinc, tungstophosphoric acid and titania exhibit exceptional performance in this reaction, high carbon monoxide selectivity and quantum efficiency of 7.1% at 362 nm. In-situ Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggest that the catalytic performance can be attributed to zinc species highly dispersed on tungstophosphoric acid /titania, which undergo reduction and oxidation cycles during the reaction according to the Mars-van Krevelen sequence. The reaction proceeds via intermediate formation of surface methyl carbonates.",Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior and spinon confinement in YbAlO3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741939,Nature communications,2019 03 21,"Low dimensional quantum magnets are interesting because of the emerging collective behavior arising from strong quantum fluctuations. The one-dimensional (1D) S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a paradigmatic example, whose low-energy excitations, known as spinons, carry fractional spin S = 1/2. These fractional modes can be reconfined by the application of a staggered magnetic field. Even though considerable progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of such magnets, experimental realizations of this low-dimensional physics are relatively rare. This is particularly true for rare-earth-based magnets because of the large effective spin anisotropy induced by the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling and crystal field splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the rare-earth perovskite YbAlO3 provides a realization of a quantum spin S = 1/2 chain material exhibiting both quantum critical Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior and spinon confinement-deconfinement transitions in different regions of magnetic field-temperature phase diagram.","Most canine ameloblastomas harbor HRAS mutations, providing a novel large-animal model of RAS-driven cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741938,Oncogenesis,2019 02 14,"Canine acanthomatous ameloblastomas (CAA), analogs of human ameloblastoma, are oral tumors of odontogenic origin for which the genetic drivers have remained undefined.

However, most CCA exhibit no K-Ras mutations. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of PD901, either alone or in combination with the pan-mTOR inhibitor MLN0128, for the treatment of K-Ras wild-type CCA in vitro using human CCA cell lines, and in vivo using AKT/YapS127A CCA mouse model. We discovered that in vitro, PD901 treatment strongly inhibited CCA cell proliferation, and combined PD901 and MLN0128 therapy further increased growth inhibition. In vivo, treatment of PD901 alone triggered tumor regression, which was not further increased when the two drugs were administered simultaneously. Mechanistically, PD901 efficiently hampered ERK activation in vitro and in vivo, leading to strong inhibition of CCA tumor cell cycle progression. Intriguingly, we discovered that PD901, but not MLN0128 treatment resulted in changes affecting the vasculature and cancer-associated fibroblasts in AKT/YapS127A mouse lesions. It led to the decreased hypoxia within tumor lesions, which may further enhance the anti-cell proliferation activities of PD901.

Efficient therapies have improved patient care; however, many challenges remain including late diagnosis, disease recurrence, and resistance to therapies. Mechanisms responsible for these aforementioned challenges are numerous. This review focuses on neurotrophins, including NGF, BDNF, and NT3, and their specific tyrosine kinase receptors called tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk A, B, C, respectively), associated with sortilin and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and their implication in digestive cancers. Globally, p75NTR is a frequently downregulated tumor suppressor. On the contrary, Trk and their ligands are considered oncogenic factors. New therapies which target NT and/or their receptors, or use them as diagnosis biomarkers could help us to combat digestive cancers.","Targeted Education and Trends in Pediatric Nurses Perceptions of Barriers, Facilitators, Confidence, and Attitudes Toward Research and Evidence-Based Practice Over Time.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741920,Journal for nurses in professional development,2019 04 09,"The purpose of this repeated cross-sectional study was to periodically assess perceptions of pediatric nurses' confidence, attitudes, barriers, and facilitators to research utilization and evidence-based practice as changes to the nursing research environment and a targeted curriculum were implemented.

Effects of different athletic playing surfaces on jump height, force, and power. J Strength Cond Res 33(4): 965-973, 2019-Artificial turfs (ATs) have become more commonplace. Some aspects of performance such as speed seem to be better on ATs, but there are few published studies on the effects of playing surfaces on performance. Furthermore, there is no research that compares performance on ATs, hard surfaces (HSs), and different composite natural surfaces. Forty-three subjects, 21 men (age: 20 ± 1.82 years; height: 177.53 ± 5.87 cm; body mass: 78.44 ± 11.59 kg; and body fat: 11.17 ± 4.45%) and 22 women (age: 25 ± 1.32 years; height: 161.37 ± 6.47 cm; body mass: 60.94 ± 10.24 kg; and body fat: 27.16 ± 7.08%) performed a single countermovement jump (SCMJ), repeated CMJs (RCMJs), and single depth jump (SDJ) on 4 different playing surfaces (peat soil composition turf [NT1], sandy loam composition turf [NT2], 1 AT, and 1 HS. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc was used to calculate differences in performance across playing surfaces. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Force and jump height were not different across different surfaces. Men had significantly higher force, power, and jump height on all surfaces. Only SCMJ power was lower on NT1 compared with all other surfaces. The difference in power between surfaces was not reproduced when RCMJ and SDJ were performed, and may be due to the increased reactiveness of the stretch-shortening cycle during those jumps. Because of marginal differences between athletic performance and playing surface type, future research comparing playing surface type and other aspects of athletic success such as rate of injury should be considered.",Effects of Equal Volume But Different Plyometric Jump Training Intensities on Components of Physical Fitness in Physically Active Young Males.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741877,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Ramirez-Campillo, R, Moran, J, Drury, B, Williams, M, Keogh, JW, Chaabene, H, and Granacher, U. Effects of equal volume but different plyometric jump training intensities on components of physical fitness in physically active young males. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-An 8-week single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of separate programs of equal volume, but different intensity, plyometric jump training (PJT), on physical fitness in healthy adults. Thirty-eight physically active males (mean age: 21.8 ± 2.5 years) participated. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 3 PJT groups or a control (CON, n = 9) according to their jump performance. Plyometric jump training was conducted at maximal (PJT-100, n = 10), high (PJT-80, n = 9), or moderate (PJT-65, n = 10) intensity within each group. Baseline and follow-up tests were performed for the assessment of countermovement jump (CMJ) height, CMJ height with arm swing (CMJA), and drop jump height from a 20-cm drop box (DJ20), linear speed (30 m), and change-of-direction speed (CODS) (the Illinois CODS test). Results revealed significant group × time interactions for CMJ, CMJA, DJ20, 30-m sprint, and CODS (all p < 0.001; d = 0.39-0.76). Post hoc analyses showed significant improvements in all 5 fitness measures for PJT-100 (all p < 0.01, Δ3.7-13.5%, d = 0.26-1.4). For PJT-80, 3 of 5 fitness tests demonstrated significant change (CMJ: p < 0.001, Δ5.9%, d = 0.33; CMJA: p < 0.001, Δ7.0%, d = 0.43; CODS: p < 0.001, Δ3.9%, d = 0.9), and for PJT-65, only 1 test was significant (CMJ: p < 0.05, Δ2.8%, d = 0.15). No significant changes were observed in CON. Except for similar gains in DJ20 and 30-m sprint in PJT-100 and PJT-80, gains in physical fitness were, in general, greater (p < 0.05) after PJT-100 vs. PJT-80 vs. PJT-65 vs. CON. Therefore, maximal PJT intensity may induce larger physical fitness gains, although high and moderate intensities may also be useful, but to a lesser extent.",Bilateral Deficit During Jumping Tasks: Relationship With Speed and Change of Direction Speed Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741876,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Bishop, C, Berney, J, Lake, J, Loturco, I, Blagrove, R, Turner, A, and Read, P. Bilateral deficit during jumping tasks: relationship with speed and change of direction speed performance. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Research to date has investigated the phenomenon of the bilateral deficit (BLD); however, limited research exists on its association with measures of athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the magnitude of the BLD and examine its relationship with linear speed and change of direction speed (CODS) performance. Eighteen physically active and healthy university students performed double- and single-leg countermovement jumps (CMJs), drop jumps (DJs), and standing broad jumps (SBJs) to calculate the BLD across jump tasks. Subjects also performed 10- and 30-m sprints and a 505 CODS test, which were correlated with all BLD metrics. Results showed varying levels of BLD across CMJ metrics (jump height, peak force, eccentric impulse, concentric impulse, and peak power), DJ metrics (ground contact time and flight time), and the SBJ (distance). However, a bilateral facilitation was shown for jump height and reactive strength index during the DJ test. The main findings of this study were that: (a) a larger BLD in CMJ height related to a faster 505 COD (left leg) (r = -0.48; p = 0.04), 505 COD (right leg) (r = -0.53; p = 0.02), and COD deficit (right leg) (r = -0.59; p = 0.01), (b) a larger BLD in CMJ concentric impulse related to faster 505 COD (left leg) (r = -0.51; p = 0.03), 505 COD (right leg) (r = -0.64, p = 0.01), and COD deficit (right leg) (r = -0.60; p = 0.01), and (c) a larger BLD in DJ flight time related to a faster 505 COD (left leg) (r = -0.48; p = 0.04). These results suggest that a larger BLD is associated with faster CODS performance, but not linear speed. This highlights the individual nature of the BLD and may support the notion of developing movement competency on one limb for enhanced CODS performance.",Validity of Different Velocity-Based Methods and Repetitions-to-Failure Equations for Predicting the 1 Repetition Maximum During 2 Upper-Body Pulling Exercises.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741875,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Pérez-Castilla, A, Suzovic, D, Domanovic, A, Fernandes, JFT, and García-Ramos, A. Validity of different velocity-based methods and repetitions-to-failure equations for predicting the 1 repetition maximum during 2 upper-body pulling exercises. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study aimed to compare the accuracy of different velocity-based methods and repetitions-to-failure equations for predicting the 1 repetition maximum (i.e., maximum load that can be lifted once; 1RM) during 2 upper-body pulling exercises. Twenty-three healthy subjects (twelve men and eleven women) were tested in 2 sessions during the lat pull-down and seated cable row exercises. Each session consisted of an incremental loading test until reaching the 1RM followed by a set of repetitions-to-failure against the 80% 1RM load. The 1RM was estimated from the individual load-velocity relationships modeled through 4 (∼40, 55, 70, and 85% 1RM; multiple-point method) or 2 loads (∼40 and 85% 1RM; 2-point method). Mean velocity was recorded with a linear position transducer and a Smartphone application. Therefore, 4 velocity-based methods were used as a result of combining the 2 devices and the 2 methods. Two repetitions-to-failure equations (Mayhew and Wathan) were also used to predict the 1RM from the load and number of repetitions completed. The absolute differences with respect to the actual 1RM were higher for the repetitions-to-failure equations than velocity-based methods during the seated cable row exercise (p = 0.004), but not for the lat pull-down exercise (p = 0.200). The repetitions-to-failure equations significantly underestimated the actual 1RM (p < 0.05; range: -6.65 to -2.14 kg), whereas no systematic differences were observed for the velocity-based methods (range: -1.75 to 1.65 kg). All predicted 1RMs were highly correlated with the actual 1RM (r ≥ 0.96). The velocity-based methods provide a more accurate estimate of the 1RM than the Mayhew and Wathan repetitions-to-failure equations during the lat pull-down and seated cable row exercises.",Electromyographic Analysis of the Surf Paddling Stroke Across Multiple Intensities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741874,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 05 10,"Nessler, JA, Ponce-Gonzalez, JG, Robles-Rodriguez, C, Furr, H, Warner, M, and Newcomer, SC.

The purpose of this study was to examine activity in 5 muscles that contribute to paddling at different velocities and to characterize oxygen use, paddling cadence, and surfboard motion at each velocity. Twelve recreational surfers completed an incremental paddling test on a short surfboard in a swim flume. Surface electromyography was recorded bilaterally from latissimus dorsi, upper and mid trapezius, and posterior and mid deltoid. Electromyographic activity increased as water velocity increased for all muscles, but the change in activation between endurance and sprint paddling was greatest for latissimus dorsi (p < 0.001). At higher water velocities, the middle deltoid was activated earlier in the paddling stroke (p = 0.005). Oxygen use, paddling cadence, and surfboard roll/yaw increased with increasing water velocity. These data may be useful for athletes, trainers, and equipment designers interested in increasing power and efficiency of the paddling stroke.",Posterior Thigh Foam Rolling Increases Knee Extension Fatigue and Passive Shoulder Range-of-Motion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741873,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 05 14,"Monteiro, ER, Costa, PB, Corrêa Neto, VG, Hoogenboom, BJ, Steele, J, and da Silva Novaes, J.

Twelve recreationally active women were recruited for participation in 2 experiments separated by 3 weeks, and the same subjects performed all procedures in each experiment. In experiment 1, subjects performed 3 sets of knee extensions using a predetermined 10 repetition maximum load to momentary concentric failure: control condition (CG) with passive rest and 2 FR conditions for the hamstrings using 2 volumes (60 and 120 seconds; FR60 and FR120, respectively). Experiment 2 consisted of 2 shoulder flexion and extension baseline PROM tests. Following baseline measures, subjects performed a single 60-second bout of FR on the hamstrings. Outcome PROM measures were measured through manual goniometry immediately (post-0), 10 minutes (post-10), 20 minutes (post-20), 30 minutes (post-30), 24 hours (post-24), and 48 hours (post-48) after the intervention to assess the effects on PROM over an extended period. Fatigue index indicated significantly greater fatigue resistance for CG when compared with FR60 (p = 0.035; [INCREMENT]% = 6.49) and FR120 (p = 0.002; [INCREMENT]% = 9.27), and there were no significant differences between FR60 and FR120 (p = 0.513; [INCREMENT]% = 2.78). Shoulder flexion PROM increased in post-0 as compared to baseline 1 (p = 0.002; d = 1.58), baseline 2 (p < 0.001; d = 1.92), and baseline higher measurement (p < 0.001; d = 1.59) and remained increased for post-10 as compared to baseline 2 (p = 0.017; d = 1.55). Shoulder extension PROM increased in post-0 as compared to baseline 1 (p < 0.001; d = 2.61), baseline 2 (p < 0.001; d = 2.83), and baseline higher measurement (p < 0.001; d = 2.59) and remained increased for post-10 as compared to baseline 1 (p < 0.001; d = 1.93), baseline 2 (p < 0.001; d = 2.16), and baseline higher measurement (p < 0.001; d = 1.91) and post-20 as compared to baseline 1 (p = 0.008; d = 1.58), baseline 2 (p = 0.001; d = 1.85), and baseline higher measurement (p = 0.011; d = 1.55). Foam rolling volumes equal to or greater than 60 seconds are detrimental to the ability to continually produce force in the lower extremity and should not be applied to the hamstrings muscle group between sets of knee extensions. PROM results indicate that FR applied to the hamstrings demonstrates an increase in both shoulder flexion and extension PROM. This work may have important clinical (rehabilitation) implications, as it demonstrates global effects of FR on functional outcomes.",Faster Heart Rate Recovery Correlates With High-Intensity Match Activity in Female Field Hockey Players-Training Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741872,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Harry, K and Booysen, MJ. Faster heart rate recovery correlates with high-intensity match activity in female field hockey players-training implications. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The physical match demands of female field hockey are intense and may differ according to playing positions. In addition, conducting sports-specific field tests can assist coaches in determining their players' preparedness for competition. There is limited research regarding the match demands and relevance of field testing at premier league levels. Therefore, the aims were to describe the physical match demands of female premier league (amateur) field hockey, and to determine the relationships between match activity patterns and physical performance tests. Match activity and heart rate data were collected from 32 female participants using the Zephyr BioHarness 3 system. Participants also performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (level 1) (n = 22), repeated sprint ability (n = 21), and the heart rate recovery (n = 16) tests. Moderate to large effect sizes were observed when defenders were compared with midfielders and forwards for time spent (%) in standing/walking and jogging (d = 0.64-1.30) in addition to the playing time (%) spent in the low-to-moderate and very high heart rate zones (d = 0.69-0.85). Heart rate recovery (10 s) correlated with the playing time (%) spent in sprinting (r = 0.73, p = 0.002). Heart rate recovery (60 s) and the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test both correlated with the playing time (%) spent in running (r = 0.77, p = 0.0006 and r = 0.54, p = 0.01). The differences in physical match demands between positions emphasize the importance of training specificity at premier league levels. The heart rate recovery test can be used to assess a female field hockey player's capability to perform high-intensity match activity.","Comparison of Physiological and Perceptual Responses to Upper-, Lower-, and Whole-Body Exercise in Elite Cross-Country Skiers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741871,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 05 10,"Undebakke, V, Berg, J, Tjønna, AE, and Sandbakk, Ø. Comparison of physiological and perceptual responses to upper-, lower-, and whole-body exercise in elite cross-country skiers. J Strength Cond Res 33(4): 1086-1094, 2019-The primary purpose of the present study was to compare physiological and perceptual responses to maximal and submaximal exercise between upper-, lower-, and whole-body exercise modes in elite cross-country (XC) skiers. Twelve elite XC skiers performed 5-7 submaximal 5-minute stages and an incremental test to exhaustion using upper-body poling (UP), running (RUN), and diagonal skiing (DIA), randomized on 3 separate days. Here, power output, cardiorespiratory variables, heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLa), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were determined. Peak power output increased gradually from UP to RUN and DIA, whereas peak oxygen uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak), peak HR, O2pulse, and total RPE were clearly lower in UP than RUN and DIA (p < 0.05). At submaximal workloads matched for either RPE, %HR, or BLa, the main pattern was that BLa was higher and V[Combining Dot Above]O2 and HR lower in UP compared with RUN and DIA (p < 0.05). DIA showed ∼10 and 35% higher V[Combining Dot Above]O2 than RUN and UP at RPE 10-13 and had lower muscular RPE values than UP and RUN at a given % of peak HR (p < 0.05). Most of the differences in cardiorespiratory variables between modes were eliminated when they were normalized to V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak or peak HR in the respective mode. Because of the low power production in UP, endurance training in this mode exhibits too low values of V[Combining Dot Above]O2 to tax the cardiovascular system sufficiently. In RUN and DIA, the similar V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak values indicate that both modes can be effectively used during high-intensity training and to determine V[Combining Dot Above]O2max in elite XC skiers. However, the relatively high V[Combining Dot Above]O2 values at low perceptual stress with submaximal DIA indicate that the large amount of power produced when combining upper- and lower-body work exhibits high oxidative flux even during low-intensity training. Overall, these findings should be taken into account when athletes and coaches are monitoring and prescribing training in future approaches, in particular in sports where athletes vary between training with upper-, lower-, and whole-body exercise modes.","Training Experience and Maturational, Morphological, and Fitness Attributes as Individual Performance Predictors in Male and Female Under-14 Portuguese Elite Basketball Players.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741870,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Ramos, S, Volossovitch, A, Ferreira, AP, Fragoso, I, and Massuça, LM.

A total of 416 under-14 Portuguese elite basketball players (male, n = 224; female, n = 192) were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Maturational parameters (maturity offset and predicted age at peak height velocity), morphological attributes (body mass, stature, skinfolds, and lengths), and fitness (sprint, agility, jump, and upper-body strength) attributes were measured. In addition, basketball game performance was assessed using technical statistics (rebounds and point averages) and the performance index rating (PIR). Correlation analyses indicated that male players with better PIR/minute were taller, had a longer hand span, had more free-fat mass, and demonstrated better results in all jumping tests, upper-body strength tests, 20-m speed test, and agility T-test. Female players with better PIR/minute were significantly older, more matured, heavier, taller, and had longer arm and hand span. They also demonstrated better results in jumping tests, medicine ball throw, had greater practice experience, and were subjected to higher training loads. Multiple regression analysis showed that combined stature, handgrip strength, agility, and countermovement jump (with arm swing power) can be considered strong predictors of PIR per time played for male players. The prediction model for female players indicated that maturity offset, practice experience, and agility were the strongest predictors of basketball performance. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that around puberty, physical fitness attributes of elite basketball players of both sexes are associated with game performance parameters. Two regression models have been estimated to predict the performance of youth basketball players of both genders.","Unilateral Isometric Squat: Test Reliability, Interlimb Asymmetries, and Relationships With Limb Dominance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741869,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Bishop, C, Read, P, Lake, J, Loturco, I, Dawes, J, Madruga, M, Romero-Rodrigues, D, Chavda, S, and Turner, A.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to determine test reliability, establish interlimb asymmetries and their associations with force production capability on the dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) limbs during the unilateral isometric squat test. Twenty-eight recreational sport athletes attended a single-test session after familiarization and performed 3 trials on each limb with 140° of hip and knee flexion, to assess peak force (PF), rate of force development (RFD), and impulse at different time intervals. Reliability, interlimb asymmetries, and Pearson's r correlations were computed thereafter. Test reliability was metric-dependent with only PF showing good levels of reliability on both limbs (coefficient of variation = 5.44-5.70; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93-0.94). Interlimb asymmetries ranged from 8.36 to 25.46%, with a tendency for RFD and impulse asymmetries to reduce as time intervals increased. Three significant negative relationships of a possible 49 (r = -0.43 to -0.47; p < 0.05) were found between asymmetries and performance on the D limb. However, 31 significant negative correlations (r = -0.42 to -0.71; p < 0.05) were found between asymmetries and performance on the ND limb. These findings demonstrate that practitioners may only be able to use PF as a reliable test metric during a unilateral isometric strength test. Furthermore, the negative association between asymmetries and strength performance on the ND limb may indicate that the reduction of imbalances through targeted training interventions may be warranted."

Principal component analysis of the associations between kinetic variables in cutting and jumping, and cutting performance outcome. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The primary aim of this study was to determine which features within the ground reaction force (GRF) trace during cutting are related to performance outcome in different angled cuts. The secondary aim was to understand the relationship between GRF features in a series of maximum strength, explosive strength, and reactive strength tests, and cutting performance outcome. Twenty-five male intercounty Gaelic football players (23.5 ± 4.2 years, 183 ± 6 cm, and 83 ± 6.9 kg) participated in the study. Participants completed 110 and 45° cutting tasks, single leg squat jumps, drop landings, drop jumps, and isometric midthigh pulls. A principal component (PC) analysis and simulation approach were applied to the data and correlations between PCs and cutting performance outcome measured. Lower vertical to horizontal impulse ratios (r = -0.70 to -0.46) in both cuts and greater forces over the first 50 ms of ground contact (r = -0.44) in the 110° cut correlated with enhanced cutting performance outcomes. Greater reactive strength index and height in the drop jump (r = -0.51 and -0.54) and greater impulses over the first 25 ms of ground contact in the drop landing (r = 0.49 and 0.70) correlated with enhanced cutting performance outcomes. These results highlight the importance of greater horizontal and rapid force production in cutting and greater reactive strength qualities to enhance cutting performance.",Exercise Supervision Is Important for Cardiometabolic Health Improvements: A 16-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741856,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 11,"Hunter, JR, Gordon, BA, Bird, SR, and Benson, AC.

A total of 102 female netball players (mean ± SD: age 13.3 ± 0.50 years, height 166.95 ± 5.72 cm, and body mass 60.94 ± 12.80 kg) participated in this study. Measurements included anthropometry, horizontal and vertical jump performance, balance, core strength, change-of-direction speed, and split sprint times. Magnitude-based inferences were used to determine differences in all measures. Grade 1 players jumped further and higher (effect size [ES] = 0.41-1.37) and ran faster with small to moderate differences. They demonstrated faster change-of-direction speed (ES = -0.73 to -1.31), greater core strength (ES = 0.28-1.17), and a faster time-to-stabilization (ES = -0.69). Grade 2 circle players jumped further (ES = -0.29), compared with noncircle players who jumped higher (ES = 0.35). Noncircle players had faster sprint and change-of-direction speed (ES = -0.33 to -0.55) and measures of balance (ES = -0.47 to 0.55). Grade 1 circle players were found to be faster over 20 m (ES = 0.75). The results of this study showed differences in the physical performance capabilities between youth netball players competing in different grades, as well as differences between playing positions.

For 5 years our clinical diagnostic practice has evaluated all women with any type of uSMT for FH-d morphology (defined, at low magnification, as staghorn shaped blood vessels and alveolar pattern edema and, at high magnification, as tumor macronucleoli surrounded by a halo and cytoplasmic eosinophilic globules) and, when present, used the pathology report to advise genetic counseling to further evaluate for HLRCC syndrome. We now report the results of this prospective screening strategy, with emphasis on the incidence and clinicopathologic features of FH-d morphology in uSMT, the rate of patient uptake of referral to genetic counseling, and the results of genetic testing for FH germline mutation. Among 2060 women with a uSMT, FH-d morphology was reported in 1.4% (30 women). Ten women elected to undergo FH genetic testing and 6 of 10 (60%) had a FH germline mutation: 5 were pathogenic mutations and 1 was a mutation variant of unknown significance. Therefore, the screening program led to a confirmed genetic diagnosis of HLRCC syndrome in 0.24% of all women with any type of uSMT. The women with a pathogenic mutation were ages 24 to 40 years. Although the majority of leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei exhibited FH-d morphology, the uSMT were conventional leiomyomas with FH-d morphology in 2 of 5 women found to have a pathogenic FH germline mutation. Relying on an abnormal FH immunostain result to trigger genetic counseling referral would have resulted in 2 of 5 (40%) cases with pathogenic FH germline mutation but normal FH immunoexpression going undetected, both of which were missense type mutations. There was no difference in the incidence of pathogenic FH germline mutation between FH-d morphology uSMT with an abnormal versus a normal FH immunostain result. Overall, this study demonstrates that prospective morphology-based screening, integrated with referral for genetic counseling, can result in the diagnosis of HLRCC syndrome in otherwise unselected women with uSMT. We conclude that this strategy should be incorporated in the routine pathologic examination of all uterine smooth muscle tumors.",Computed Tomography Appearance of Uncorrected Congenital Heart Disease in Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741756,Journal of thoracic imaging,2019 04 22,"The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) is about 4 to 10 per 1000 live births.

This function is dependent on maintenance of a high intracellular cAMP concentration. A number of microRNAs are implicated in the maintenance of Tregs. In this study, we demonstrate that peripheral immune tolerance is critically dependent on posttranscriptional repression of the cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme phosphodiesterase-3b (Pde3b) by microRNA-142-5p (miR-142-5p). In this manner, miR-142-5p acts as an immunometabolic regulator of intracellular cAMP, controlling Treg suppressive function. Mir142 was associated with a super enhancer bound by the Treg lineage-determining transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and Treg-specific deletion of miR-142 in mice (TregΔ142) resulted in spontaneous, lethal, multisystem autoimmunity, despite preserved numbers of phenotypically normal Tregs. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of PDE3B prevented autoimmune disease and reversed the impaired suppressive function of Tregs in TregΔ142 animals. These findings reveal a critical molecular switch, specifying Treg function through the modulation of a highly conserved, cell-intrinsic metabolic pathway. Modulation of this pathway has direct relevance to the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmunity and cancer.",Environmental exposures and mechanisms in allergy and asthma development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741719,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 04 06,"Environmental exposures interplay with human host factors to promote the development and progression of allergic diseases. The worldwide prevalence of allergic disease is rising as a result of complex gene-environment interactions that shape the immune system and host response. Research shows an association between the rise of allergic diseases and increasingly modern Westernized lifestyles, which are characterized by increased urbanization, time spent indoors, and antibiotic usage. These environmental changes result in increased exposure to air and traffic pollution, fungi, infectious agents, tobacco smoke, and other early-life and lifelong risk factors for the development and exacerbation of asthma and allergic diseases. It is increasingly recognized that the timing, load, and route of allergen exposure affect allergic disease phenotypes and development. Still, our ability to prevent allergic diseases is hindered by gaps in understanding of the underlying mechanisms and interaction of environmental, viral, and allergen exposures with immune pathways that impact disease development. This Review highlights epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence linking environmental exposures to the development and exacerbation of allergic airway responses.",APOE4-mediated amyloid-β pathology depends on its neuronal receptor LRP1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741718,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 06 10,"Carrying the ε4 allele of the APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE4) markedly increases the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which APOE4 exacerbates the brain accumulation and subsequent deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. While the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a major apoE receptor in the brain, we found that its levels are associated with those of insoluble Aβ depending on APOE genotype status in postmortem AD brains. Thus, to determine the functional interaction of apoE4 and LRP1 in brain Aβ metabolism, we crossed neuronal LRP1-knockout mice with amyloid model APP/PS1 mice and APOE3-targeted replacement (APO3-TR) or APOE4-TR mice. Consistent with previous findings, mice expressing apoE4 had increased Aβ deposition and insoluble amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice compared with those expressing apoE3. Intriguingly, such effects were reversed in the absence of neuronal LRP1. Neuronal LRP1 deficiency also increased detergent-soluble apoE4 levels, which may contribute to the inhibition of Aβ deposition. Together, our results suggest that apoE4 exacerbates Aβ pathology through a mechanism that depends on neuronal LRP1. A better understanding of apoE isoform-specific interaction with their metabolic receptor LRP1 on Aβ metabolism is crucial for defining APOE4-related risk for AD.",Probing the happy place.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741717,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 03 10,"A variety of neurological procedures, including deep brain stimulation and craniotomies that require tissue removal near elegant cortices, require patients to remain awake and responsive in order to monitor function.

However, the TV regularization can also produce staircase effect and tend to over-smooth the reconstructed images due to its piecewise constant assumption. In this study, we proposed to use the structure tensor total variation (STV) that penalizes the eigenvalues of the structure tensor for CBCT reconstruction. The STV penalty extends the TV penalty, with many important properties maintained such as convexity and rotation and translation invariance. The STV penalty utilizes gradient information more effectively and has a stronger ability to capture local image structural variation. The objective function was constructed with the penalized weighted least-square (PWLS) strategy and the gradient descent (GD) method was used to optimize the objective function. Besides, we investigated whether the norms involved in the STV penalty affected the reconstruction performance and found that the l1-norm gave the better performance than the l2-norm and l ∞-norm. We also examined performance of the STV penalties constructed using different kernel functions and found that the STV with the Gaussian kernel had the best performance, and the STVs with Uniform, Logistic, and Sigmoid kernels had similar performance to each other. We evaluated our reconstruction method with the STV penalty on computer simulated phantoms and physical phantoms. The results demonstrated that STV led to better reconstruction performance than TV, both visually and quantitatively. For the Catphan 600 physical phantom, the STV1 penalty was 175% and 623% better than the low-dose FDK and the high-dose FDK, and 14% better than the TV penalty at the matched noise level, according to the average contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); while for the Compressed Sensing simulation phantom, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of reconstructed results using STV1, STV2, and STV ∞ were 40.67 dB, 38.72 dB, and 37.40 dB, respectively, all being significantly better than 36.84 dB using TV.",Quality of life and functional capability of elderly Brazilian women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741715,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2019 04 22,"Quality of life is important at all ages, but maintaining a high quality of life is especially crucial to improve the functional capabilities of elder populations.",Job satisfaction and job-related stress among nurses: The moderating effect of mindfulness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741714,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2019 04 22,"Job stress can positively influence individuals' work motivation; however, it is more typical for job stress to have adverse physical and psychological effects, which in turn undermine job satisfaction.",Relative deprivation and job satisfaction in Army officers: A moderated mediation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741713,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2019 04 22,"Despite income growth and improvement in Chinese soldiers' social status, indicators related to occupational well-being have not improved significantly, such as job satisfaction and occupational commitment.",Slip resistance and wearability of safety footwear used on icy surfaces for outdoor municipal workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741712,"Work (Reading, Mass.)",2019 04 22,Outdoor workers experience high injury rates in the winter due to slipping on ice and snow.

A key feature is the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn). No current treatment is on the market that slows or halts disease progression. Previous studies have shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have neuroprotective effects in animal models of PD. In addition, in a phase II clinical trial, the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 has shown good protective effects in PD patients. In the present study, we have investigated the neuroprotective effects of the GLP-1 analogues semaglutide (25 nmol/kg ip. once every two days for 30 days) and liraglutide (25 nmol/kg ip. once daily for 30 days) in the chronic MPTP mouse model of PD. Both drugs are currently on the market as a treatment for Type II diabetes. Our results show that both semaglutide and liraglutide improved MPTP-induced motor impairments. In addition, both drugs rescued the decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, reduced the accumulation of α-syn, alleviated the chronic inflammation response in the brain, reduced lipid peroxidation, and inhibited the mitochondrial mitophagy signaling pathway, and furthermore increased expression of the key growth factor GDNF that protects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. Moreover, the long- acting GLP-1 analogue semaglutide was more potent compared with once daily liraglutide in most parameters measured in this study. Our results demonstrate that semaglutide may be a promising treatment for PD.

As PD is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the brain, it is nearly impossible for researchers to access and extract these cells from living patients. Thus, in the past PD research has focused on the use of patients' post-mortem tissues, animal models, or immortalized cell lines to dissect cellular pathways of interest. While these strategies deepened our knowledge of pathological mechanisms in PD, they failed to faithfully capture key mechanisms at play in the human brain. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology is revolutionizing PD research, as it allows for the differentiation and growth of human DA neurons in vitro, holding immense potential not only for modelling PD, but also for identifying novel therapies. However, to reproduce the complexity of the brain's environment, researchers are recognizing the need to further develop and refine iPSC-based tools. In this review, we provide an overview of different systems now available for the study of PD, with a particular emphasis on the potential and limitations of iPSC as research tools to generate more relevant models of PD pathophysiology and advance the drug discovery process.","Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of LY2599666, a PEG-Linked Antigen Binding Fragment that Targets Soluble Monomer Amyloid-β.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741684,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 03 18,"LY2599666 is a humanized, affinity-optimized monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment linked to a PEG molecule and targets soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) monomers.

Although no disease-modifying treatments are currently available for AD, earlier diagnosis and proper management of the disease could have considerable impact on patient and caregiver quality of life and functioning. Drugs currently approved for AD treat the cognitive, behavioral, and functional symptoms of the disease and consist of three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. Treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD is generally initiated with a ChEI. Patients who show progression of symptoms while on ChEI monotherapy may be switched to another ChEI and/or memantine can be added to the treatment regimen. In recent years, putative disease-modifying therapies have emerged that aim to slow the progression of AD instead of only addressing its symptoms. However, many therapies have failed in clinical trials in patients with established AD, suggesting that, once developed, disease-modifying agents may need to be deployed earlier in the course of illness. The goal of this narrative literature review is to discuss present treatment algorithms and potential future therapies in AD."

This technology has demonstrated similar efficacy and usability for mobile outpatients when compared with electrically powered negative pressure wound therapy devices. It was designed for patients with smaller, low to moderately exudating wounds and does not require batteries or a power source. However, very few studies address best practices for using dNPWT in a variety of wound types. There is a need for comprehensive clinical recommendations to better direct clinicians and patients in using this therapy. In addition, it is critical that providers are knowledgeable about processes for obtaining reimbursement for placement of dNPWT since codes and procedures differ drastically from standard NPWT. A panel meeting of experts with a high level of experience with dNPWT in varied wound types was convened to develop clinical recommendations and summarize current US reimbursement coding guidelines for the use of dNPWT. This publication summarizes the recommendations from panel members, in addition to supporting evidence, to help guide appropriate use of dNPWT. Panel recommendations regarding optimal patient and wound selection, wound preparation, proper patient training, and use of dNPWT in various wound types are included as well as clinical techniques for dressing application, bridging under offloading devices and compression, maintaining a seal, and protecting intact skin. Processes and codes for obtaining reimbursement for dNPWT are reviewed by care setting.

Flow cytometry was used to assess how quickly we could detect changes in cell size, number, membrane energization (using a carbocyanine dye) and DNA distribution. It transpired that while the lag phase observable macroscopically via bulk OD measurements could be as long as 4 h, the true lag phase could be less than 15-20 min, and was accompanied by many observable biochemical changes. Antibiotics to which the cells were sensitive affected these changes within 20 min of re-inoculation, providing the possibility of a very rapid antibiotic susceptibility test on a timescale compatible with a visit to a GP clinic. The strategy was applied successfully to genuine potential urinary tract infection (UTI) samples taken from a doctor's surgery.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of edaravone in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated by emergent endovascular reperfusion therapy. Methods- We conducted a retrospective observational study using a national administrative database. Patients with acute ischemic stroke treated by emergent endovascular reperfusion therapy were identified and dichotomized by whether edaravone was used within 2 days of admission. We compared the functional independence at hospital discharge, in-hospital mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage after admission between groups, adjusted by a well-validated case-mix adjustment model, in multivariate mixed-effect regression and propensity score matching analyses. Results- Of 11 508 patients eligible for analysis, 10 281 (89.3%) received edaravone therapy. The established risk adjustment model had good predictability for functional independence at hospital discharge, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74. In the mixed-effect regression analysis, edaravone use was significantly associated with greater functional independence at hospital discharge (32.3% in the edaravone group versus 25.9% in the control group; adjusted odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.41), lower in-hospital mortality (9.9% in the edaravone group versus 17.4% in the control group; adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.62), and reduced intracranial hemorrhage after admission (1.4% in the edaravone group versus 2.7% in the control group; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.82). Results of the propensity score matching analysis corroborated these results. Conclusions- This retrospective analysis of a Japanese nationwide administrative database suggested that combination therapy with edaravone and endovascular reperfusion therapy could be a promising therapeutic strategy in acute ischemic stroke. Further randomized control trials are warranted.",Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Survival After Ischemic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741622,Stroke,2019 02 27,"Background and Purpose- China bears a heavy burden of stroke because of its large population of elderly people and the propensity for stroke. Previous studies have examined the association between air pollution and stroke mortality or hospital admission. However, the global evidence for adverse effects of air pollution on survival after stroke is scarce. Methods- We used the first national hospital-based prospective registry cohort of stroke in China, which included 12 291 ischemic stroke patients who visited hospitals during 2007 to 2008. All patients were followed for 1-year poststroke. Deaths during the follow-up period were recorded. Participants' 3-year prestroke exposures to ambient PM1, PM2.5, PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤1, ≤2.5, and ≤10 μm, respectively) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were estimated by machine learning algorithms with satellite remote sensing, land use information, and meteorological data. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between air pollution and survival after ischemic stroke. Results- In total, 1649 deaths were identified during the 1-year follow-up period. After controlling for potential confounders, significant associations were observed between exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 and incident fatal ischemic stroke. The corresponding hazard ratios and 95% CIs associated with 10 µg/m3 increase in PM1 and PM2.5 were 1.05 (1.02-1.09) and 1.03 (1.00-1.06), respectively. No significant association was observed for PM10 or NO2 (hazard ratios and 95% CIs, 1.01 [1.00-1.03] and 1.03 [0.99-1.06], respectively). Higher hazard ratios (and 95% CIs) were observed for male, elderly and obese individuals. Conclusions- Prestroke exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 was associated with increased incident fatal ischemic stroke in the year following an ischemic stroke in China. Improved air quality may be beneficial for people to recover from stroke.",VAMP associated proteins are required for autophagic and lysosomal degradation by promoting a PtdIns4P-mediated endosomal pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741620,Autophagy,2019 06 07,"Mutations in the ER-associated VAPB/ALS8 protein cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Previous studies have argued that ER stress may underlie the demise of neurons. We find that loss of VAP proteins (VAPs) leads to an accumulation of aberrant lysosomes and impairs lysosomal degradation. VAPs mediate ER to Golgi tethering and their loss may affect phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) transfer between these organelles. We found that loss of VAPs elevates PtdIns4P levels in the Golgi, leading to an expansion of the endosomal pool derived from the Golgi. Fusion of these endosomes with lysosomes leads to an increase in lysosomes with aberrant acidity, contents, and shape. Importantly, reducing PtdIns4P levels with a PtdIns4-kinase (PtdIns4K) inhibitor, or removing a single copy of Rab7, suppress macroautophagic/autophagic degradation defects as well as behavioral defects observed in Drosophila Vap33 mutant larvae. We propose that a failure to tether the ER to the Golgi when VAPs are lost leads to an increase in Golgi PtdIns4P levels, and an expansion of endosomes resulting in an accumulation of dysfunctional lysosomes and a failure in proper autophagic lysosomal degradation.

However, there was no study for incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with IV acyclovir administration. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 287 patients who were medicated IV acyclovir from January 2008 to May 2013 in Gyeongsang National University Hospital. All had documented medical histories and underwent medical review. Demographic data, risk factors, concomitant drugs, laboratory findings and outcome were gathered from the medical records and analyzed. AKI occurred in 51 patients (17.8%). As per RIFLE classification, renal injury was graded as either at risk of renal dysfunction (62.7%), renal injury (15.6%), and renal failure (21.6%). There was no significant difference in age, sex, total dose, drug duration, and presence of hydration between AKI and non-AKI group. However, systolic pressure, underlying diabetes, concomitant vancomycin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use was positively correlated with AKI occurrence (p = .04, p < .001, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively). Two patients underwent hemodialysis and these patients died. Higher mortality was observed in AKI patients (p < .001). Multivariate analysis also presented that presence of diabetes, concomitant NSAIDs, and vancomycin use was independent risk factor of acyclovir associated with AKI (p = .001, OR 3.611 (CI: 1.708-7.633), p = .050, OR 2.630 (CI: 1.000-6.917), and p = .009, OR 4.349 (CI: 1.452-13.022), respectively). AKI is relatively common in patients administrating acyclovir injection.

Thirty male SD rats were randomly equally divided into Sham, IRI, and Curcumin groups (n = 10). The model of IRI was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 45 min followed by 24 h reperfusion with the contralateral nephrectomy. ELISA was used to examine the expression of Cr, BUN, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the serum; RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of IL-8,TNF-α, and IL-6 in the kidney; The morphology of kidney was examined by Periodic Acid-Schiff stain (PAS). The expression of JAK2, p-JAK2, STAT3, p-STAT3, p65, and p-p65 in kidney were detected by Western blotting. The result displayed that Curcumin pretreatment can significantly increase the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 and reduce the expression of Cr, BUN, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, and p-p65. In addition, Curcumin can attenuate the kidney pathological injury and have no effect on the expression of JAK2, STAT3, and p65. Our findings showed the protective effect of Curcumin in I/R injury is associated with suppressing NF-κB mediating inflammation by activating JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway.","Hemoglobin targets for the anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741617,Renal failure,2019 03 19,"Anemia is extremely common among dialysis patients and underlies some of the symptoms associated with reduced kidney function, including fatigue, depression, reduced exercise tolerance, and dyspnea."

The transgender community has not been well understood by medical and mental health fields. As such, this marginalized and vulnerable community faces multiple barriers to receiving health maintenance and specialized care, both at the community and patient-specific level. Many transgender individuals undergo some form of transition to the gender that matches their gender identity. Transition efforts look different for each patient because gender and gender identity occur along a continuum. Transition may include social, hormonal, and/or surgical components. As providers are caring for transgender patients, it is imperative to understand where a patient is in their gender transition and how hormonal and/or surgical therapies affect their cancer risk and screening.

We analyzed the long-term survival after HKT x, the influence of age and dialysis status, the rates of cardiac rejection, and the influence of sensitization. Methods and Results From June 1992 to December 2016, we performed 100 HKT x procedures. We compared older (≥60 years, n=53) with younger (<60 years, n=47) recipients, and recipients on preoperative dialysis (n=49) and not on dialysis (n=51). We analyzed actuarial freedom from any cardiac rejection, acute cellular rejection, and antibody-mediated rejection, and survival rates by sensitized status with panel-reactive antibody levels <10%, 10% to 50%, and >50%, and compared these survival rates with those from the United Network for Organ Sharing database. There was no difference in 15-year survival between the 2 age groups (35±12.4% and 49±17.3%, ≥60 versus <60 years; P=0.45). There was no difference in 15-year survival between the dialysis and nondialysis groups (44±13.4% and 37±15.2%, P=0.95). Actuarial freedom from any cardiac rejection ( acute cellular rejection >0 or antibody-mediated rejection >0) was 92±2.8% and 84±3.8%, acute cellular rejection (≥2R/3A) 98±1.5% and 94±2.5%, and antibody-mediated rejection (≥1) 96±2.1% and 93±2.6% at 30 days and 1 year after HKT x. There was no difference in the 5-year survival among recipients by sensitization status with panel-reactive antibody levels <10%, 10% to 50%, and >50% (82±5.9%, 83±10.8%, and 92±8.0%; P=0.55). There was no difference in 15-year survival after HKT x between the United Network for Organ Sharing database and our center (38±3.2% and 40±10.1%, respectively; P=0.45). Conclusions HKT x is safe to perform in patients 60 years and older or younger than 60 years and with or without dialysis dependence, with excellent outcomes. The degree of panel-reactive antibody sensitization did not appear to affect survival after HKT x.",Self-Reported Everyday Psychosocial Stressors Are Associated With Greater Impairments in Endothelial Function in Young Adults With Major Depressive Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741602,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 01,"Background Despite the epidemiological associations between psychological stress, depression, and increased cardiovascular disease risk, no studies have examined the relation between naturally occurring psychosocial stressors and directly measured microvascular function in adults with major depressive disorder ( MDD ). We tested the hypothesis that young adults with MDD exposed to everyday psychosocial stressors would exhibit more severe impairments in endothelium-dependent dilation ( EDD ) compared with: (1) healthy nondepressed adults ( HCs ); and (2) adults with MDD without acute psychosocial stress exposure. Methods and Results Twenty HCs (22±1 years) and 23 otherwise healthy adults with MDD (20±0.3 years) participated in the study. Participants completed a psychosocial experiences survey to document their exposure to any of 6 stressors over the preceding 24 hours (eg, arguments, work stressors). Red cell flux (laser Doppler flowmetry) was measured during graded intradermal microdialysis perfusion of acetylcholine (10-10 to 10-1mol/L). EDD was expressed as a percentage of maximum vascular conductance (flux/mm Hg). Multiple linear regression was used to determine the associations between stress, EDD , and MDD . Adults with MDD reported a greater number and severity of psychosocial stressors compared with HCs (all P<0.05). EDD was blunted in adults with MDD ( HCs : 91±2 versus MDD : 74±3%; P<0.001). Exposure to any stressor was related to more severe impairments in EDD in patients with MDD (no stressor: 81±3 versus 1+ stressors: 69±5%; P=0.04) but not in HCs ( P=0.48). Conclusions These data indicate that exposure to everyday psychosocial stressors is associated with greater impairments in endothelial function in patients with MDD , suggesting a potential mechanistic link between daily stress and depression in increased cardiovascular risk.",Human NOC3 is essential for DNA replication licensing in human cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741601,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 04 26,"Noc3p (Nucleolar Complex-associated protein) is an essential protein in budding yeast DNA replication licensing. Noc3p mediates the loading of Cdc6p and MCM proteins onto replication origins during the M-to-G1 transition by interacting with ORC (Origin Recognition Complex) and MCM (Minichromosome Maintenance) proteins. FAD24 (Factor for Adipocyte Differentiation, clone number 24), the human homolog of Noc3p (hNOC3), was previously reported to play roles in the regulation of DNA replication and proliferation in human cells. However, the role of hNOC3 in replication licensing was unclear. Here we report that hNOC3 physically interacts with multiple human pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) proteins and associates with known replication origins throughout the cell cycle. Moreover, knockdown of hNOC3 in HeLa cells abrogates the chromatin association of other pre-RC proteins including hCDC6 and hMCM, leading to DNA replication defects and eventual apoptosis in an abortive S-phase. In comparison, specific inhibition of the ribosome biogenesis pathway by preventing pre-rRNA synthesis, does not lead to any cell cycle or DNA replication defect or apoptosis in the same timeframe as the hNOC3 knockdown experiments. Our findings strongly suggest that hNOC3 plays an essential role in pre-RC formation and the initiation of DNA replication independent of its potential role in ribosome biogenesis in human cells.",Impact of Pyridyl Moieties on the Inhibitory Properties of Prominent Acyclic Metal Chelators Against Metallo-β-Lactamase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae: Investigating the Molecular Basis of Acyclic Metal Chelators' Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741600,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs)-mediated infections remain a huge public health concern. CREs produce enzymes such as metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), which inactivate β-lactam antibiotics. Hence, developing efficient molecules capable of inhibiting these enzymes remains a way forward to overcoming this phenomenon. In this study, we demonstrate that pyridyl moieties favor the inhibitory activity of cyclic metal-chelating agents through in vitro screening, molecular modeling, and docking assays. Di-(2-picolyl) amine and tris-(2-picolyl) amine exhibited great efficacy against different types of MBLs and strong binding affinity for NDM-1, whereas 2-picolyl amine did not show activity at a concentration of 64 mg/L in combination with meropenem; it further showed the lowest binding affinity from computational molecular analysis, commensurating with the in vitro screening assays. The findings revealed that the pyridyl group plays a vital role in the inhibitory activity of the tested molecules against CREs and should be exploited as potential MBL inhibitors.",Variation in Corticosterone Levels in Two Species of Breeding Albatrosses with Divergent Life Histories: Responses to Body Condition and Drivers of Foraging Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741599,Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,2019 03 20,"Corticosterone (CORT) is a glucocorticoid hormone that maintains energy balance and can modulate foraging behaviors in seabirds. However, CORT responses are not always predictable under similar biophysical conditions and do not necessarily influence the same behaviors across breeding stages and species. To enhance our understanding of CORT's role as a proximate determinant of foraging behavior and energy maintenance, we examined the relationships between body condition, CORT, foraging behavior, and foraging success between two sympatric breeding albatross species with differing foraging strategies and life histories, the Campbell albatross (Thalassarache impavida) and the gray-headed albatross (Thalassarache chrysostoma), from Campbell Island, New Zealand. Pre- and postforaging CORT did not differ between species or stage, potentially as a result of behavioral plasticity or different functional roles of CORT across stages. Unexpectedly, body condition did not correlate with preforaging CORT during incubation, although a negative correlation was observed in Campbell albatrosses during the guard stage. Furthermore, CORT mediated foraging success in both species and stages, but CORT mediated foraging behavior only in incubation-stage Campbell albatrosses that had shorter foraging ranges with higher pretrip CORT. Additionally, CORT positively correlated with mass gain and the time elapsed since the last feeding event in guard-stage albatrosses. Our results highlight the complexity of CORT in mediating energy balance in free-ranging animals. Our results also support that if CORT is to be usefully interpreted, breeding stage must be considered because the physiological and behavioral functionality of CORT may differ across stages, with enhanced sensitivity to energy reserves during chick rearing.","Structural and Microbiological Characterization of 5-Hydroxy-3,7,4'-Trimethoxyflavone: A Flavonoid Isolated from Vitex gardneriana Schauer Leaves.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741597,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 04 05,"Staphylococcus aureus represents the most common etiologic agent of purulent infections, affecting humans and animals.

We evaluated the impact of living in FDs on incident cardiovascular events. Methods and Results We recruited 4944 subjects (age 64±12, 64% male) undergoing cardiac catheterization into the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank. Using the US Department of Agriculture definition of FD , we determined whether their residential addresses had (1) poor access to healthy food, (2) low income, or (3) both (= FD ). Subjects were prospectively followed for a median of 3.2 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard models for MI and Cox proportional hazard models for death/ MI were used to examine the association between area characteristics ( FD , poor access, and low income) and the rates of adverse events after adjusting for traditional risk factors. A total of 981 (20%) lived in FDs and had a higher adjusted risk of MI (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.06-1.95]) than those living in non- FDs . In a multivariate analysis including both food access and area income, only living in a low-income area was associated with a higher adjusted risk of MI (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.40 [1.06-1.85]) and death/ MI (hazard ratio, 1.18 [1.02-1.35]) while living in a poor-access area was not significantly associated with either (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.05 [0.80-1.38] and hazard ratio, 0.99 [0.87-1.14], respectively). Conclusions Living in an FD is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events in those with coronary artery disease.

It is unclear whether blacks truly have less AF or simply more undiagnosed AF . Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient claims from 2009 to 2015 for a 5% nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. We included patients aged ≥66 years with at least 1 documented Current Procedural Terminology code for interrogation of an implantable pacemaker, cardioverter-defibrillator, or loop recorder and no documented history of AF , atrial flutter, or stroke before their first device interrogation. Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between black race and the composite outcome of AF or atrial flutter while adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors. Among 47 417 eligible patients, the annual incidence of AF /atrial flutter was 12.2 (95% CI , 11.5-13.1) per 100 person-years among blacks and 17.6 (95% CI , 17.4-17.9) per 100 person-years among non-black beneficiaries. After adjustment for confounders, black beneficiaries faced a lower hazard of AF /atrial flutter than non-black beneficiaries (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI , 0.70-0.80). Despite the lower risk of AF , black patients faced a higher hazard of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI , 1.22-1.53).

Background:
 Given its high incidence, thyroid nodule (TN) warrants public attention. Thyroid volume (TV) has also been associated with multiple factors, such as iodine deficiency and supply and body mass index. It is well known that metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises many metabolic disturbances, with insulin resistance being its major component. 
Materials and Methods:
 The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TN and TV and MetS and its components in an iodine-adequate area in Asia. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire. After excluding 938 individuals based on the exclusion criteria, we reviewed data from 927 of 1865 participants. Adopting MetS diagnostic criteria, we found 437 subjects to be MetS positive [MetS(+)] and 490 subjects to be MetS negative [MetS(-)], respectively. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between TNs and MetS. Moreover, univariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the associations between different variables and TNs. 
Results:
 A total of 232 females and 205 males were MetS(+), as diagnosed using the International Diabetes Federation criteria. However, there were 330 females and 160 males in the group of MetS(-) individuals. The prevalence of TNs was 38.29% in the MetS(+) group and 17.79% in the MetS(-) group. After adjusting for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and gender, only high-density lipoprotein, waist circumference (WC), and age were related to TNs (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.75, P = 0.0023; OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, P = 0.0036). The TV of all participants was 13.98 (11.24, 17.01) mL; 13.26 (10.62, 16.17) mL for females and 14.96 (11.83, 18.01) mL for males. It was found that only WC was related to TV, after controlling for sex and age (P = 0.02). 
Conclusions:
 The morbidity among TN patients in the MetS(+) group was higher than that among the MetS(-) group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol emerged as a protective factor, and WC was a risk factor for TN. Moreover, TV was related to MetS, and WC was an independent risk factor for TV."

Proportional condylectomy with a 14-mm resection of the left condylar head improved the CPD from 11.5 mm to 7.8 mm and resolved the posterior open bite on the left side.

One initiative is preregistration of quantitative research. We investigate whether the preregistration format could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative research, data are used to decide which way interpretation should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be tracked using preregistration, and that preregistration would provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualize preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit. Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivize qualitative researchers to report constantly on their study's development. We conclude with suggested modifications to the Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for qualitative studies.",Comparison of the content of tobacco alkaloids and tobacco-specific nitrosamines in 'heat-not-burn' tobacco products before and after aerosol generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741569,Inhalation toxicology,2019 04 30,"Standardized methods for collecting smoke and for measuring smoke components in heat not burn tobacco product (HTP) are yet to be established, and there is a lack of consensus as to whether the content of HTP cigarettes can be assayed in the same manner as for conventional cigarettes. Since HTPcigarettes do not generate ash when smoked, we compared the levels of tobacco alkaloids (TAs) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) of HTP cigarettes before and after aerosol generation. HTP cigarettes were smoked according to two international standardization methods. The TAs and TSNAs contents of the cigarettes were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF and UPLC-MSMS, respectively. Smoking was found to significantly decrease the content of nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, and anabasine by 53 ∼ 100% in all samples, and the maximum inhalable amounts of these entities were determined to be 4.24 mg/cig, 103.52 μg/cig, 258.72 μg/cig, and 33.03 μg/cig, respectively. By contrast, smoking significantly increased the content of NNK and NAB. we suggested that the reduced nicotine content minus the nicotine content remaining in the filter is an amount that could potentially be inhaled during smoking. The increase of NNK and NAB in HTP cigarette after aerosol generation is expected to be caused by the precursor, but more specific behavioral studies should be performed."

Food safety should exclude the possibility of consumer exposure to its virulence traits through consumption of dairy products. In this study, an integrated approach based on both phenotypic and genotypic methods was applied to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity potential in 40 E. faecalis isolated from 10 Italian raw milk cheeses over a 13-year period (1997-2009). Among the 14 tested antibiotics, resistance to tetracycline, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin was observed, whereas vancomycin-resistant enterococci were not found. A high incidence (90% of strains) of the tet(M) gene emerged, whereas tet(K), tet(S), tet(L), int, and ermB genes were occasionally amplified (12.5%, 10%, 7.5%, 2.5% and 30%, respectively). No strain was positive for vancomycin-resistant determinants. Among the seven virulence determinants considered, the asa1, gelE, esp, and efaA genes were harbored. No other gene encoding for either different virulence factors (cylA, hyl, and ace) or amino acid decarboxylase activity (hdc, tdc, and odc) was detected. Consequently, E. faecalis isolated from raw milk cheeses does not represent a substantial reservoir of antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors if compared with clinical strains. However, this species occasionally harbors detrimental traits; thus, the possibility that it could be a route for transmission of pathogenic genes through dairy products should never be disregarded.",Zn-Alloyed CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Highly Efficient Perovskite Light-Emitting Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741555,Nano letters,2019 03 20,"We alloyed Zn2+ into CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals by partial substitution of Pb2+ with Zn2+, which does not change their crystalline phase.

They also showed an enhanced stability, which correlated with improved effective Goldschmidt tolerance factors, by the incorporation of Zn2+ ions with a smaller radius than the Pb2+ ions. Simultaneously, the nanocrystals switched from n-type (for CsPbI3) to nearly ambipolar for the alloyed nanoparticles. The hole injection barrier of electroluminescent LEDs was effectively eliminated by using alloyed CsPb0.64Zn0.36I3 nanocrystals, and a high peak external quantum efficiency of 15.1% has been achieved.","Theoretical Studies on Hexanuclear [M3(μ3-O/OH)]2 (M = Fe(III), Mn(III), and Ni(II)) Clusters: Magnetic Exchange, Magnetic Anisotropy, and Magneto-Structural Correlations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741554,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"Controlling spin Hamiltonian parameters such as magnetic exchange and magnetic anisotropy of polynuclear clusters is of great interest in the area of single molecule magnets (SMMs). Among large polynuclear clusters, hexanuclear clusters offer the best compromise in terms of size as they are often rigid, solution stable, and chemically amenable. The {M6O2} core is one of the common architectures known for many hexanuclear clusters and generally reported to possess a diamagnetic ST = 0 spin ground state, barring a few exceptions. In these clusters, there are several open questions that are poorly understood: (a) What controls the nature of magnetic exchange, which in turn dictates the ground state spin values? (b) For clusters possessing a nonzero spin ground state, what dictates the magnetic anisotropy? Here, using density functional methods, we have attempted to shed light on these two question by evaluating the exchange coupling constants in [Fe6IIIO2(OH)2{(C4N2H2SMe)2C(OH)O}2( tBuCO2)10] (1), [Fe6III(O)2(O2CH2)(O2CCH2tBu)12(py)2] (2), [Fe6III(O2)(O)2(O2CCMe3)12(py)2] (3), [FeIII6O3(O2CMe)9(OEt)2(bpy)2]ClO4 (4), [MnIII6O2(O2CH2)(O2CPe t)11(HO2CPe t)2(O2CMe)] (5), and [NiII6(OH)4(O2C tBu)8( tBuCO2H)4] (6) complexes. We have estimated all the eight near-neighbor exchange coupling constants in these clusters. Our calculations not only agree with the experimental results but also offer insight on the origin of the spin ground state. Extensive magneto-structural correlations developed by varying M-O-M angles and M-O distances reveal that J values are extremely sensitive to small structural distortions. Correlations developed indicate that both the parameters are important for Fe(III), but for Mn(III) and Ni(II), the angles were found to play a dominant role. Quite interestingly, the computed zero-field splitting parameter D S=5 of complex 1 reveals that the exchange contribution to the anisotropy controls the sign of the ground state D value-an observation which differs from the general perception that the ground state D is controlled by the single-ion zero-field splitting parameter.",Chelating Surfaces for Oriented Human Serum Albumin Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741553,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 05,"Protein immobilization in a specific conformation or orientation at an interface is influenced by specific interactions with the outer layer of the surface. A strategy to build-up a complex construct which is able to orient protein molecules, based on metal-cation chelation processes, is reported. The proposed methodology implies the formation of a mercaptoundecanoic acid monolayer on a gold surface that is activated to attach covalently the tripeptide glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) on the surface, whose sites are then employed to chelate copper ions, providing a selective platform for the orientation of human serum albumin (HSA) molecules. The protein adsorption process on GHK and GHK-Cu(II)-complex surfaces was monitored by the in situ quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and force spectroscopy technique. The changes in frequency and dissipation factor as well as the D- f plots from QCM-D measurements help to characterize the changes in the protein conformation and are confirmed by force curve spectroscopy results.

In mild alkaline conditions, autoxidation processes occur and a firm monolayer is formed. Up to now, thicker coatings are obtained in only a cross-linked multilayer fashion. This study presents an alternative method to form continuous TA coatings using orthosilicic acid (Siaq). Adsorption kinetics and physical properties of TA coatings in the presence of Siaq were determined using a quartz-crystal microbalance and nanoplasmonic spectroscopy. An in situ TA layer thickness of 200 nm was obtained after 24 h in solutions supplemented with 80 μM Siaq. Dry-state measurements indicated a highly hydrated layer in situ. Furthermore, chemical analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed possible complexation of TA by Siaq, whereas UV-vis spectroscopy did not indicate an interaction of Siaq in the autoxidation process of TA. Investigation of additional metalloid ions showed that germanic acid was also able to initiate a continuous coating formation of TA, whereas boric acid prevented the polymerization process. In comparison to that of TA, the coating formation of pyrogallol (PG) and gallic acid (GA) was not affected by Siaq. PG formed continuous coatings also without Siaq, whereas GA formed only a monolayer in the presence of Siaq. However, Siaq induced a continuous layer formation of ellagic acid. These results indicate the specific importance of orthosilicic acid in the coating formation of polyphenolic molecules with multiple ortho-dihydroxy groups and open new possibilities to deposit TA on interfaces.",MoS2 Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy Through Clean and Fast Polymer-Free MoS2 Transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741548,Nano letters,2019 03 20,"Two dimensional (2D) materials have found various applications because of their unique physical properties.

This provides the opportunity to investigate the growth of Pt nanocrystals on MoS2 substrates, which elucidates the formation mechanisms of such heterostructured 2D materials. We find that Pt nanocrystals formed in MoS2 liquid cells have a strong tendency to align their crystal lattice with that of MoS2, suggesting a van der Waals epitaxial relationship.

The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the ""target"" properties, we also find lower errors for ""off-target"" properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution."

Among the fabrication approaches for such structures, the rolling circle techniques have emerged as particularly promising, producing morphologically round, flower-shaped nucleic acid particles: typically hybrid composites of long nucleic acid strands and inorganic magnesium pyrophosphate (Mg2PPi). These constructs are known to form via anisotropic nucleic acid-driven crystallization in a sequence-independent manner, rendering monodisperse and densely packed RNA or DNA-inorganic composites. However, it still remains to fully explore how flexible polymer-like RNA or DNA strands (acting as biomolecular additives) mediate the crystallization process of Mg2PPi and affect the structure and properties of the product crystals. To address this, we closely examined nanoscale details to mesoscopic features of Mg2PPi/DNA hybrid composites fabricated by two approaches, namely rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based in situ synthesis and long synthetic DNA-mediated crystallization. Similar to the DNA constructs fabricated by RCA, the rapid crystallization of Mg2PPi was retarded on a short-range order when we precipitated the crystals in the presence of presynthesized long DNA, which resulted in effective incorporation of biomolecular additives such as DNA and enzymes. These findings further provide a more feasible way to encapsulate bioactive enzymes within DNA constructs compared to in situ RCA-mediated synthesis, i.e., by not only protecting them from possible denaturation under the reaction conditions but also preventing nonselective association of proteins arising from the RCA reaction mixtures.",Noninvasive Tracking and Regenerative Capabilities of Transplanted Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Labeled with I-III-IV Semiconducting Nanocrystals in Liver-Injured Living Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741534,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 14,"Acute liver injury is a critical syndrome ascribed to prevalent death of hepatocytes and imperatively requires liver transplantation. Such a methodology is certainly hampered due to the deficit of healthy donors. In this regard, stem cell-based regenerative therapies are attractive in repairing injured tissues and organs for medical applications. However, it is crucial to understand the migration, engraftment, and regeneration capabilities of transplanted stem cells in the living animal models. For the first time, we demonstrate rapid labeling of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with near-infrared (NIR)-fluorescent CuInS2-ZnS nanocrystals (CIZS-NCs) to develop innovative nanobioconjugates (MSCs-CIZS-NBCs) that exhibit 98% labeling efficiency. Before nanobioconjugate synthesis, the pristine CIZS-NCs were prepared via a two-step, hot-injection, rapid and low-cost domestic-microwave-refluxing (MW-R) method within 6 min. The as-synthesized CIZS-NCs display high photoluminescence quantum yield (∼88%) and long-lived lifetime (23.4 μs). In contrast to unlabeled MSCs, the MSCs-CIZS nanobioconjugates show excellent biocompatibility without affecting the stemness, as confirmed by cell viability, immunophenotyping (CD44+, CD105+, CD90+), multi-lineage-specific gene expressions, and differentiation into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. The in vivo fluorescence tracking analyses revealed that the MSCs-CIZS-NBCs after tail-vein injection were initially trapped in the lungs and gradually engrafted in the injured liver within 2 h. The regeneration potential of MSCs-CIZS-NBCs was confirmed via renewal of the portal tract composed of portal veins, bile ducts, and hepatic arteries around the hepatocytes. Consequently, no apparent inflammations, necrosis, or apoptosis was observed in the acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver-injured BALB/c mice model over 3 days after transplantation, as corroborated using laser-scanning confocal microscopy and histopathological and hematological analyses. Hence, our innovative NIR-fluorescent MSCs-CIZS-NBCs offer an off-the-self technology for noninvasive tracking of transplanted MSCs in an acute-liver-injured animal model for future image-guided cell-therapies.",Effect of Charge Transfer upon Li- and Na-Ion Insertion in Fine-Grained Graphitic Material as Probed by NMR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741532,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"We investigated the insertion-extraction behaviors of Li and Na ions in graphitic materials using solid-state NMR. A unique advantage of high-degree 13C-isotope enrichment of graphitic material allowed sensitive and metastable graphite intercalation compounds to be measured in a short time. Ex situ 13C magic-angle spinning NMR spectra of 13C fine-grained graphite are presented as a function of state-of-charge. The observations are discussed with respect to graphite intercalation phenomena, which include the effects of charge transfer and the demagnetizing field. Dramatic narrowing of the 13C NMR signal in metal-intercalated graphite evidences quasi-complete charge transfer occurring between lithium and graphite host material and resulting in reducing the macroscopic field effects. Upon Na insertion, incomplete charge transfer is observed and explained by inaccessibility of graphitic interlayer space for Na ions in our study. In addition, critical issues of reversibility of Li- and Na-ion electrochemical cells and solid electrolyte interphase formation are considered on the atomic scale. The knowledge gained in the present work can be applied to advanced high-power-density electrode materials for safe and fast-charging metal-ion batteries or for novel spintronic concepts with controlled spin-polarized charge carrier injection and transport combined with the possibility to manipulate magnetic anisotropy.",Pickering Emulsion-Templated Encapsulation of Ionic Liquids for Contaminant Removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741531,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Ionic liquids (ILs) have received attention for a diverse range of applications, but their liquid nature can make them difficult to handle and process and their high viscosities can lead to suboptimal performance. As such, encapsulated ILs are attractive for their ease of handling and high surface area and have potential for improved performance in energy storage, gas uptake, extractions, and so forth. Herein, we report a facile method to encapsulate a variety of ILs using Pickering emulsions as templates, graphene oxide (GO)-based nanosheets as particle surfactants, and interfacial polymerization for stabilization. The capsules contain up to 80% IL in the core, and the capsule shells are composed of polyurea and GO. We illustrate that capsules can be prepared from IL-in-water or IL-in-oil emulsions and explore the impact of monomer and IL identity, thereby accessing different compositions. The spherical, discrete capsules are characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. We illustrate the application of these IL capsules as a column material to remove phenol from oil, demonstrating ≥98% phenol removal after passage of >170 column volumes. This simple method to prepare capsules of IL will find widespread use across diverse applications.",Microdialysis Sampling of Quorum Sensing Homoserine Lactones during Biofilm Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741530,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 19,"Bacteria communicate chemically through a system called quorum sensing. In this work, microdialysis sampling procedures were optimized to collect quorum sensing molecules produced during in situ biofilm formation directly on the polymeric semipermeable membrane of the microdialysis probe. V. harveyi, a Gram-negative bacterium, was used as the model organism and releases variable chain length acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and acyl-oxohomoserine lactones (AOHLs) as signaling molecules during quorum sensing. Eliciting biofilm formation required coating fetal bovine serum onto the poly(ether sulfone) microdialysis membrane. Dialysates were collected in different experiments either during or after biofilm formation directly on a microdialysis probe. Continuous sampling of C4-AHL, C6-AHL, C8-AHL, C6-OXO-AHL, and C12-OXO-AHL was achieved over a period of up to 4 days. The AHLs and AOHLs in dialysates were concentrated with solid-phase extraction and quantified using LC-MS. Dialysate concentrations obtained for the AOHLs and AHLs ranged between 1 and 100 ppb (ng/mL) and varied between sampling days.

Despite recent technological advances, metabolomics studies still result in the detection of a disproportionate number of features that cannot be confidently assigned to a chemical structure. This inadequacy is driven by the single most significant limitation in metabolomics, the reliance on reference libraries constructed by analysis of authentic reference materials with limited commercial availability. To this end, we have developed the in silico chemical library engine (ISiCLE), a high-performance computing-friendly cheminformatics workflow for generating libraries of chemical properties. In the instantiation described here, we predict probable three-dimensional molecular conformers (i.e., conformational isomers) using chemical identifiers as input, from which collision cross sections (CCS) are derived. The approach employs first-principles simulation, distinguished by the use of molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, and ion mobility calculations, to generate structures and chemical property libraries, all without training data. Importantly, optimization of ISiCLE included a refactoring of the popular MOBCAL code for trajectory-based mobility calculations, improving its computational efficiency by over 2 orders of magnitude. Calculated CCS values were validated against 1983 experimentally measured CCS values and compared to previously reported CCS calculation approaches. Average calculated CCS error for the validation set is 3.2% using standard parameters, outperforming other density functional theory (DFT)-based methods and machine learning methods (e.g., MetCCS). An online database is introduced for sharing both calculated and experimental CCS values ( metabolomics.pnnl.gov ), initially including a CCS library with over 1 million entries. Finally, three successful applications of molecule characterization using calculated CCS are described, including providing evidence for the presence of an environmental degradation product, the separation of molecular isomers, and an initial characterization of complex blinded mixtures of exposure chemicals. This work represents a method to address the limitations of small molecule identification and offers an alternative to generating chemical identification libraries experimentally by analyzing authentic reference materials.

However, aqueous chloride-ion redox materials are limitedly reported owing to their instability or dissolution in aqueous electrolyte. Here, we synthetize a new electrochemical chloride-ion material, Sb4O5Cl2, investigate its electrochemical performance in aqueous NaCl electrolyte, and assemble into aqueous chloride-ion battery with silver as cathode. During the battery charge process, Sb4O5Cl2 anode electrochemically releases chloride ions, which are captured by Ag cathode with the formation of silver chloride while the discharging reverses the process. The battery demonstrates favorable electrochemical performance. With current density of 600 mA g-1, the battery discharge capacity of 34.6 mAh g-1 can be maintained for 50 cycles. This work is greatly significant for the development of anion electrochemical energy storage.",Reagent-Free and Rapid Assessment of T Cell Activation State Using Diffraction Phase Microscopy and Deep Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741527,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 29,"CD8+ T cells constitute an essential compartment of the adaptive immune system. During immune responses, naı̈ve T cells become functional, as they are primed with their cognate determinants by the antigen presenting cells. Current methods of identifying activated CD8+ T cells are laborious, time-consuming and expensive due to the extensive list of required reagents. Here, we demonstrate an optical imaging approach featuring quantitative phase imaging to distinguish activated CD8+ T cells from naı̈ve CD8+ T cells in a rapid and reagent-free manner. We measured the dry mass of live cells and employed transport-based morphometry to better understand their differential morphological attributes. Our results reveal that, upon activation, the dry cell mass of T cells increases significantly in comparison to that of unstimulated cells. By employing deep learning formalism, we are able to accurately predict the population ratios of unknown mixed population based on the acquired quantitative phase images. We envision that, with further refinement, this label-free method of T cell phenotyping will lead to a rapid and cost-effective platform for assaying T cell responses to candidate antigens in the near future.",Cdh1-Mediated Metabolic Switch from Pentose Phosphate Pathway to Glycolysis Contributes to Sevoflurane-Induced Neuronal Apoptosis in Developing Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741526,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 05 15,"Cdh1 is a regulatory subunit of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), known to be involved in regulating neuronal survival. The role of Cdh1 in volatile anesthetics-induced neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain is unknown. In this study, we used postnatal day 7 (P7) and day 21 (P21) mice exposed to 2.3% sevoflurane for 6 h to investigate at which age and duration of exposure sevoflurane affects the expression of Cdh1 and glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and that of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Furthermore, we tested whether the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) inhibitor roscovatine could counteract the effects caused by exposure to sevoflurane. Finally, we applied the glycolysis inhibitor 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3-PO), G6PD inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and exogenous reduced glutathione to examine the contribution of the glycolysis pathway and PPP to sevoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis. We found that prolonged sevoflurane anesthesia significantly reduces the Cdh1 level in P7 mice compared to in the P21 ones; moreover, the decrease in Cdh1 level results in a switch in glucose metabolism from the PPP to neuronal glycolysis. This leads to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and reduced glutathione level in the developing brain, which is more susceptible to oxidative stress. As a result, sevoflurane induces neuroapoptosis through Cdh1-mediated glucose metabolism reprogramming. Our study demonstrates a critical role of Cdh1 in sevoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis by shifting PPP to the glycolytic pathway in the developing brain. These findings suggest that Cdh1 may be a novel target for preventing volatile anesthetics-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment.",Cytocompatible Modification of Thermoresponsive Polymers on Living Cells for Membrane Proteomic Isolation and Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741525,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 05,"Efficient strategies for enriching and separating proteins are important and challenging for membrane proteomics. Many existing methods are caught in the dilemma of preserving maximal membrane proteins while avoiding the contamination of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. Here, we report a polymer anchoring strategy for the selective preparation of membrane proteins through cell surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. The cytocompatible polymerization strategy enables thermoresponsive poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPPAm) chains to be grown from a specific protein on the surface of living cells. The polymer tagged membrane protein could be easily separated and enriched by thermoprecipitation. This method led to the identification of 1825 proteins of which 1036 (71.7%) were specific membrane proteins in E. coli. The separated proteins were identified by 2-DE and mass spectrometry. Among the 12 protein spots from the gel slice, eight were identified as outer membrane proteins. The described strategy opens up a new avenue for membrane protein enrichment and separation and may expedite the future development of membrane proteomics."

Additionally, secondhand smoke, which was declared carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2004, is a major source of morbidity and premature death in nonsmokers, particularly children. Negative health effects associated with exposure to secondhand smoke have been well documented and include lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other respiratory diseases. International and national policies to implement cost-effective strategies to curtail smoking will have a significant impact on population health and will protect nonsmokers. Effective interventions, such as smoking bans, tobacco price increases, easy access to tobacco cessation treatments, and anti-tobacco media campaigns, should continue.

The aim of this study was to review the evidence on lung cancer epidemiology, including data of international scope with comparisons of economically, socially, and biologically different patient groups. In industrialized nations, evolving social and cultural smoking patterns have led to rising or plateauing rates of lung cancer in women, lagging the long-declining smoking and cancer incidence rates in men. In contrast, emerging economies vary widely in smoking practices and cancer incidence but commonly also harbor risks from environmental exposures, particularly widespread air pollution. Recent research has also revealed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlates, leading to greater knowledge in molecular profiling and targeted therapeutics, as well as an emphasis on the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma histology. Furthermore, emergent evidence about the benefits of lung cancer screening has led to efforts to identify high-risk smokers and development of prediction tools. This review also includes a discussion on the epidemiologic characteristics of special groups including women and nonsmokers. Varying trends in smoking largely dictate international patterns in lung cancer incidence and mortality. With declining smoking rates in developed countries and knowledge gains made through molecular profiling of tumors, the emergence of new risk factors and disease features will lead to changes in the landscape of lung cancer epidemiology.",Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Latin America.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741508,Annals of global health,2019 02 11,"The PLATINO and PREPOCOL population-based studies documented the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in several Latin American (Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Montevideo, Santiago and Caracas) and Colombian (Medellin, Bogota, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga and Cali) cities. COPD ranged between 6.2 and 19.6% in individuals ≥40 years of age, with substantial rates of underdiagnosis (up to 89%) but also overdiagnosis, mostly due to the lack of spirometric confirmation. The main risk factor was tobacco smoking, but male gender and age were also associated with COPD. COPD in never smokers represented about one third of the cases and was associated with previous history of tuberculosis or a diagnosis of asthma. COPD associated with biomass smoke exposure was a common clinical phenotype in Latin America, found as a risk factor in PREPOCOL and other observational studies in the region. Smoking has been decreasing in Latin America and efforts have been made to implement cleaner biomass stoves. Unfortunately, treatment of COPD in Latin America remains highly variable with low rates of smoking cessation counselling, low use of inhaled bronchodilators and influenza vaccination.

Although asthma is recognized as the most common chronic disease in children, issues of underdiagnosis and undertreatment persist. There are substantial global variations in the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children, with up to 13-fold differences between countries. The rising number of hospital admissions for asthma may reflect an increase in asthma severity, poor disease management and/or the effect of poverty. The financial burden of asthma is relatively high within developed countries (those for which data is available) spending 1 to 2% of their healthcare budget on this condition. Established in 1989, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) attempts to raise awareness about the increasing prevalence of asthma, improve management and reduce the burden of asthma worldwide. Despite global efforts, GINA has not achieved its goal, even among developed nations. There are multiple barriers to reducing the global burden of asthma, including limited access to care and/or medications, and lack of prioritization as a public healthcare priority.

Asbestosis and other pneumoconiosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), chronic beryllium disease, and smoking-related ILD are specifically linked to inhalational exposure of environmental agents. The recent Global Burden of Disease Study reported that ILD rank 40th in relation to global years of life lost in 2013, which represents an increase of 86% compared to 1990. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the prototype of fibrotic ILD. A recent study from the United States reported that the incidence and prevalence of IPF are 14.6 per 100,000 person-years and 58.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively. These data suggests that, in large populated areas such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the BRIC region), there may be approximately 2 million people living with IPF. However, studies from South America found much lower rates (0.4-1.2 cases per 100,000 per year). Limited access to high-resolution computed tomography and spirometry or to multidisciplinary teams for accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment are common challenges to the management of ILD in developing countries."

Consequently, the sum of phthalimide and folpet, expressed as folpet-residue definition, is highly prone to false-positive levels of folpet in tea. An analytical method is thus urgently needed to investigate the residue level and source of phthalimide in tea. In this work, we developed an accurate method of determining phthalimide and phthalic acid (the indicator of phthalic anhydride) by acetonitrile extraction and 3-bromopropyltrimethylammonium bromide derivatization coupled with ultra high performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The method was validated, and linearity (correlation coefficients > 0.99) was obtained. Satisfactory recoveries at 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/kg ranged from 76 to 117%, and the intra- and interday accuracies were <23%. The limit of quantification for phthalimide and phthalic acid was 10 μg/kg. The developed method was further successfully used to determine phthalimide and phthalic acid in some tea samples. The positive rate of phthalimide and phthalic acid detected in the tea samples ranged from 30-75 and 50-90%, respectively.","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia and exercise capacity, a longitudinal evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741484,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 04 26,Children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) suffer from long-term pulmonary morbidity.

A recurrent finding is that there is a pronounced discrepancy between level of cognitive ability and adaptive functioning, and this is particularly prominent among higher-ability individuals. However, the key clinical and demographic associations of these discrepancies remain unclear. This study included a sample of 417 children, adolescents, and adults with ASD as part of the EU-AIMS LEAP cohort. We examined how age, sex, IQ, levels of ASD symptom and autistic trait severity and psychiatric symptomatology are associated with adaptive functioning as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition and IQ-adaptive functioning discrepancies. Older age, lower IQ and higher social-communication symptoms were associated with lower adaptive functioning. Results also demonstrate that older age, higher IQ and higher social-communication symptoms are associated with greater IQ-adaptive functioning discrepancy scores. By contrast, sensory ASD symptoms, repetitive and restricted behaviors, as well as symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression, were not associated with adaptive functioning or IQ-adaptive functioning discrepancy scores. These findings suggest that it is the core social communication problems that define ASD that contribute to adaptive function impairments that people with ASD experience. They show for the first time that sensory symptoms, repetitive behavior and associated psychiatric symptoms do not independently contribute to adaptive function impairments. Individuals with ASD require supportive interventions across the lifespan that take account of social-communicative ASD symptom severity. Autism Res 2019, 12: 645-657. © 2019 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: This study investigated key clinical and demographic associations of adaptive functioning impairments in individuals with autism. We found that older age, lower IQ and more severe social-communicative symptoms, but not sensory or repetitive symptoms or co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, are associated with lower adaptive functioning and greater ability-adaptive function discrepancies. This suggests that interventions targeting adaptive skills acquisition should be flexible in their timing and intensity across developmental periods, levels of cognitive ability and take account of social-communicative ASD symptom severity.","Daily activity, mood, and quality of life in colorectal cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A mediation effect analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741481,Cancer medicine,2019 04 09,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) with restriction of daily activity (RDA) was common consequence of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients. CIPN with RDA and negative mood may impact the quality of life (QoL). However, the relationships among RDA, mood, and QoL remain unclear. This was a cross-sectional relative study in which four instruments were used: the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory was used to measure the severity of CIPN; the Screening of Activity Limitation and Safety Awareness scale was used to evaluate RDA; the Profile of Mood States Short Form was used to assess negative mood; and the Functional Assessment Cancer Center Therapy-Colorectal scale version 4 was used to evaluate QoL. Relationships among the variables were analyzed by bivariate correlation, hierarchical multiple linear regression, and Baron and Kenny's mediation testing. One hundred three colorectal adenocarcinoma patients with CIPN after receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients had mild-to-moderate CIPN and mild RDA. Significant correlations were found between CIPN and mood (r = 0.425, P < 0.001), between RDA and mood (r = 0.343, P < 0.001), and between RDA and QoL (r = 0.285, P < 0.01). RDA and mood may impact QoL. Under mediation effect analysis, mood mediated 38.48% of the effect of RDA on QoL (P < 0.001). Negative mood is the major factor impacting QoL in colorectal cancer patients with CIPN. Although the management of CIPN and RDA can prevent irreversible functional problems, enhancing the adaption of mood disturbance can strongly promote their QoL.",Genetic Architecture of Human Obesity Traits in the Rhesus Macaque.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741480,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2019 02 27,"Whereas the metabolic consequences of obesity have been studied extensively in the rhesus macaque, corollary genetic studies of obesity are nonexistent.

Current research focuses on patients' perceptions of uncertainty related to genomic sequencing, but there is limited knowledge of the perspectives of providers. The aim of this study was to explore how professionals in genomics perceive uncertainties involved in genomic sequencing, and if or how this impacts their approach to pretest counseling. We performed 20 semi-structured interviews with genetic counselors in the United States and Canada who provide pretest genetic counseling for genomic sequencing. Interviews explored participating genetic counselors' views of uncertainty regarding genomic sequencing, how they classify it, how it manifests, and how they manage it during pretest counseling. Thematic analysis showed that genetic counselors acknowledge concepts of uncertainty that map to existing frameworks of uncertainty for genomic sequencing. Genetic counselors also perceived incongruencies between patients' and providers' expectations of genomic sequencing, which prompted them to modify patients' perceptions of uncertainty related to genomic sequencing. All genetic counselors agreed that guidance and strategies for genomic sequencing pretest counseling would be helpful, particularly for novice genetic counselors and non-genetics providers. These findings highlight the need and potential for conceptual models of uncertainty and uncertainty management strategies to facilitate patient-centered pretest counseling for genomic sequencing.","Design of Luminescent, Heteroleptic, Cyclometalated PtII and PtIV Complexes: Photophysics and Effects of the Cyclometalated Ligands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741462,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 12,"Neutral pentafluorophenyl benzoquinolinyl PtII [Pt(bzq)(HC^N-κN)(C6 F5 )] (1 a-g) complexes, bearing nonmetalated N-heterocyclic HC^N ligands [HC^N=2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (Hoxd) a, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy) b, 2-phenylbenzo[d]thiazole (pbt) c, 2-(4-bromophenyl)benzo[d]thiazole (Br-pbt) d, 2-phenylquinoline (pq) e, 2-thienylpyridine (thpy) f, 1-(2-pyridyl)pyrene (pypy) g], and heteroleptic bis(cyclometalated) PtIV fac-[Pt(bzq)(C^N)(C6 F5 )Cl] (2 b-g, bzq: benzo[h]quinolinyl) derivatives, generated by oxidation of 1 b-g with PhICl2 , are reported.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial step of acquisition of ""stemness"" properties in tumor cells. However, the mechanism of esophageal cancer metastasis remains unclear. This research was designed to explore the role and mechanism of SMAD4 and miR-130a-3p in the progression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced EMT in vivo and in vitro. The expression of miR-130a-3p in ESCC cell line and normal esophageal epithelial cell was determined by RT-qPCR. The protein expression levels of TGF-β-induced changes in EMT were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Dual-luciferase report assays were used to validate the regulation of miR-130a-3p-SMAD4 axis. The effect of miR-130a-3p and SMAD4 in TGF-β-induced migration, invasion in the ESCC cell line EC-1 was investigated by wound healing assays and Transwell assays. Here we found that knocked down SMAD4 could partially reverse TGF-β-induced migration, invasion, and EMT progression in the ESCC cell line EC-1. miR-130a-3p, which directly targets SMAD4, is down-regulated in ESCC. miR-130a-3p inhibits the migration and invasion of EC-1 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, miR-130a-3p inhibits TGF-β-induced EC-1 cell migration, invasion, and EMT progression in a SMAD4-dependent way.

The sputum smear microscopy remains the primary diagnostic laboratory test. However, microscopic examination is always time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, an effective computer-aided image identification system is needed to provide timely assistance in diagnosis. The current identification system usually suffers from complex color variations of the images, resulting in plentiful of false object detection. To overcome the dilemma, we propose a two-stage Mycobacterium tuberculosis identification system, consisting of candidate detection and classification using convolution neural networks (CNNs). The refined Faster region-based CNN was used to distinguish candidates of M. tuberculosis and the actual ones were classified by utilizing CNN-based classifier. We first compared three different CNNs, including ensemble CNN, single-member CNN, and deep CNN. The experimental results showed that both ensemble and deep CNNs were on par with similar identification performance when analyzing more than 19,000 images. A much better recall value was achieved by using our proposed system in comparison with conventional pixel-based support vector machine method for M. tuberculosis bacilli detection.",Synthesis of Annulated Indolines by Reductive Fischer Indolization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741459,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 12,"Cyclic β-oxoesters and arylhydrazine derivatives were converted at ambient temperature under modified Fischer indolization conditions to furnish annulated indolines with quaternary bridgehead carbon center.

Further, the platform is applied to sense thiols in specific environments. The developed method can efficiently filter signals of thiols in intracellular conditions and measure cysteine levels quantitatively in serum conditions. The visual readout makes the method particularly suitable for point-of-care testing. The supramolecule-based platform illustrates not only an incremental advance for the construction of programmable molecular logic systems, but also viable applications in intelligent thiol analysis.","Aggregation, segregation, and dispersal of homotypic germ plasm RNPs in the early zebrafish embryo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741457,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,2019 04 14,"In zebrafish and many other organisms, specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) requires the transmission of maternally-derived germ plasm.

To complete the synthesis, the side chain was attached through Ru-catalyzed cross-metathesis employing an alkene derived from (R,R)-hexahydrofarnesol. To suppress epimerization during the final hydrogenation, PtO2 had to be used as a catalyst instead of Pd/C.

The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of resveratrol have been documented in over 244 clinical trials, with an additional 27 clinical trials currently ongoing. Resveretrol is reported to potentially improve the therapeutic outcome in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, obesity, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, inflammatory diseases, and rhinopharyngitis. The polyphenol is reported to be safe at doses up to 5 g/d, when used either alone or as a combination therapy. The molecular basis for the pleiotropic activities of resveratrol are based on its ability to modulate multiple cell signaling molecules such as cytokines, caspases, matrix metalloproteinases, Wnt, nuclear factor-κB, Notch, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule, sirtuin type 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, Ras association domain family 1α, pAkt, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase 2, nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2, and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1.

HPL manufacturing as a cell expansion supplement is currently not yet uniformly standardized with regard to platelet source and production methodology. There are very few reports of HPL preparations manufactured specifically for direct clinical use. There exists an urgent need for controlled clinical studies for HPL and for standardization of product definition.

We argue that without taking into account the level of satisfaction with a method, many women are classified as having a met need, when in fact they have an unmet need. They are using a method that does not meet their preferences, either because it causes side effects they find untenable or has other characteristics they do not like. Given the large number of contraceptive episodes that end in discontinuation, reportedly often due to the experience of side effects, we argue that the current definition of unmet need undercounts the number of women with a true unmet need for contraception as it misses the many women who are using a method that does not meet their preferences. We suggest the addition of satisfaction questions in national surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys to more fully assess the level of true met need for contraception.",Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized clinical trial of early versus deferred endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux in patients with venous ulceration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741425,The British journal of surgery,2019 03 25,Treatment of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression therapy accelerates venous leg ulcer healing and reduces ulcer recurrence.

Cells were irradiated by 650 and 808 nm laser light at different power densities and doses and the obtained effect was compared with that caused by the pharmacological agents. The laser light was found to elevate Ca2+ influx into cell cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner without changes of the NMDAR functioning. Furthermore, the light of both wavelengths demonstrated the ability to elevate Ca2+ influx under the pharmacological blockade of NMDARs and also might partially abolish the blockade enhancing Ca2+ influx after selective stimulation of the receptors with NMDA. Simultaneously, the light at moderate doses demonstrated a photobiostimulating effect on cells. Based on our experiments and data reported in the literature, we suggest that the low-power visible and NIR light can instigate a cell membrane depolarization via nonthermal activation, resulting in the fast induction of Ca2+ influx into cells. The obtained results also demonstrate that NIR light can be used for nonthermal and nonpharmacological stimulation of NMDARs in cancer cells.",Nicotine induces cell survival and chemoresistance by stimulating Mcl-1 phosphorylation and its interaction with Bak in lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741422,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 11,"Nicotine is a major carcinogen in cigarettes, which can enhance cell proliferation and metastasis and increase the chemoresistance of cancer cells. Our previous data found that nicotine promotes cell survival in lung cancer by affecting the expression of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, suggesting that the Mcl-1 may be a therapeutic target for patients with lung cancer. In this study, we found that the effects of drug resistance on nicotine-induced lung cancer cell lines were shown to influence the phosphorylation of Mcl-1. Moreover, nicotine induces Mcl-1 phosphorylation exclusively at the T163 site, which results in enhancement of the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 and increased cell survival. Meanwhile, nicotine can reduce the sensitivity of H1299 cells to CDDP via enhancement of the binding of Mcl-1 to Bak, which inhibits the proapoptotic effect of Bak and ultimately leads to increased survival and drug resistance of lung cancer cells. Thus, nicotine-induced cell survival and chemoresistance may occur in a mechanism by stimulating Mcl-1 phosphorylation and its interaction with Bak, which may contribute to improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in the treatment of human lung cancer."

This review provides an overview on the modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathways by proteins of hepatitis B and C viruses. One of the major NF-κB events that are modulated by these viruses is the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma.

At present, cardiac imaging modalities provide the possibility to evaluate the whole ischaemic cascade noninvasively. In asymptomatic patients, the evaluation of the calcium score may be beneficial and also guide the individual preventive strategy. Furthermore, the calcium score provides complimentary information to the information as assessed by functional testing. Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is an excellent tool to exclude CAD, having a negative predictive value of 97&ndash;99%. Comparably, a normal functional cardiac imaging test (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET); myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS); cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR); and stress echocardiography) is consistent with a good prognosis and in general an annual cardiac death rate &lt;1%. If a patient has an abnormal imaging test, it is important for risk stratification to evaluate the severity and extent of the abnormality (e.g., the extent and severity of the perfusion defect, or of the wall motion abnormality, which is consistent with the extent of myocardial scar and ischaemia). The patient&rsquo;s symptoms and the extent of ischaemia, scar and decrease of ejection fraction will guide the strategy, either to an optimal medical therapy or to a further invasive evaluation. If more than 10% of the myocardium are ischaemic, it is very likely that patients will benefit from revascularisation. The current guidelines leave a lot of room as to which test to choose for noninvasive CAD evaluation and risk stratification. The selection of the particular modality is, in part, led by the pretest probability of CAD and local availability, expertise and preference. However, whenever possible, an imaging-based test rather than a &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; stress ECG should be used. Cardiac imaging has higher sensitivities and specificities to diagnose or exclude CAD compared with stress testing alone. Using a hybrid approach, integrating complimentary information to that given by functional testing (e.g., PET/CT) provides the highest noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic accuracies in CAD evaluation available so far."

Senescent cells adopt a secretory phenotype (the SASP) which comprises a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases. The SASP itself is thought to be causative in many pathologies of age-related diseases, and there is growing interest in developing seno-modifying agents that can suppress the SASP. However, in order to identify new agents, it is necessary to conduct moderate to high throughput screening with robust assays for the required outcome. Here, we describe optimisation and validation of a cell-based biosensor HEK cell line for measurement of IL-6 concentrations within the range secreted into conditioned medium by primary senescent fibroblasts, adapted for a 384 well plate format suitable for library screening applications. We further show that the assay can measure changes in IL-6 secretion dependent on cell population age, and that the assay is responsive to mTOR inhibition in the senescent cells, which reduces the SASP, including IL-6. Hence, we propose that this optimised biosensor, which we term HEK-SASP, may prove of value in studies requiring robust, renewable and relatively inexpensive assays for measuring SASP factors.",Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation of a Bayesian mixture model for gene network inference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741379,Genes & genomics,2019 04 26,"Simultaneous measurement of gene expression level for thousands of genes contains the rich information about many different aspects of biological mechanisms.

Evaluation capacity building efforts are gaining attention in the prevention field; however, there is limited knowledge about how components of the health promotion and primary prevention system (e.g., funding, administrative arrangements, and the policy environment) may facilitate or hinder this work. We sought to identify the important influences on evaluation practice within the Australian primary prevention and health promotion system. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with experienced practitioners and managers (n = 40) from government and non-government organizations, and used thematic analysis to identify the main factors that impact on prevention program evaluation. Firstly, accountability and reporting requirements impacted on evaluation, especially if expectations were poorly aligned between the funding body and prevention organization. Secondly, the funding and political context was found to directly and indirectly affect the resources available and evaluation approach. Finally, it was found that participants made use of various strategies to modify the prevention system for more favorable conditions for evaluation.

This study was conducted in 109 healthy controls and 57 HIV-infected individuals to investigate CNS regions associated with neuropathy. An index of objective neuropathy was computed based on 4 measures: deep tendon ankle reflex, vibration sense (great toes), position sense (great toes), and 2-point discrimination (feet). Subjective neuropathy (self-report of pain, aching, or burning; pins and needles; or numbness in legs or feet) was also evaluated. Structural MRI data were available for 126/166 cases. The HIV relative to the healthy control group was impaired on all 4 signs of neuropathy. Within the HIV group, an objective neuropathy index of 1 (bilateral impairment on 1 measure) or 2 (bilateral impairment on at least 2/4 measures) was associated with older age and a smaller volume of the cerebellar vermis. Moderate to severe symptoms of neuropathy were associated with more depressive symptoms, reduced quality of life, and a smaller volume of the parietal precuneus. This study is consistent with the recent contention that ART-treated HIV-related neuropathy has a CNS component. Distinguishing subjective symptoms from objective signs of neuropathy allowed for a dissociation between the precuneus, a brain region involved in conscious information processing and the vermis, involved in fine tuning of limb movements.

Fifty-seven lactations from cows that calved from 1998 to 2001 were used. The functions were quadratic without intercept, three with two segments (both segments linear, the first segment quadratic and the second linear, and both segments quadratic), and three classical growth functions (Gompertz, logistic, and Richards). The Akaike information criterion corrected (AICC) was used as criterion of fit, being the function with the best fit the one with the lowest AICC value. The best fit was for the segmented function with both segments quadratic, followed closely by the Richards function. The derivatives of these functions give the daily milk yield curve (kg/cow/day), so the former results in a straight line per segment and the latter in the usual shape of the typical lactation. However, as cumulative records produce a monotonic increasing line, neither function can distinguish a priori the presence of a lactation peak. For this reason, it is advisable to examine the common dispersion plot of daily milk yield of each cow, and if a peak is not evident, then proceed to fit the segmented function; otherwise, the function of Richards should be used. The need to study the causes for the absence of a lactation peak in tropical dual-purpose cows is highlighted.",Updates on Minimally Invasive Surgery in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741372,Current treatment options in oncology,2019 02 26,"Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become widely used since the 1990s and has become a standard treatment approach mainly for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

These studies provide comprehensive data demonstrating the lower morbidity, shorter chest tube duration, and shorter hospital stay of VATS than thoracotomy during the postoperative course. Moreover, VATS shows equivalent oncological outcome as thoracotomy and therefore should be performed for lobectomy as much as possible. Importantly, VATS has recently been applied to advanced cases and previously contraindicated complex procedures such as bronchoplasty and chest wall resection. Attention has also been paid to reduced port surgery performed by frontier surgeons. Thus, the indications of VATS have seen a significant expansion. This major development logically negates any hesitation to change to the VATS technique as any doubt will likely constrain its wider applications.

Prior to the SPARTAN and PROSPER trials, men with nmCRPC were commonly treated with first-generation androgen receptor antagonists, such as bicalutamide or flutamide, or with estrogens or ketoconazole, none of which were associated with any proven survival benefit. The SPARTAN trial evaluated apalutamide versus placebo for men with nmCRPC and found that apalutamide significantly improved metastasis-free survival (MFS), the primary endpoint of this trial. Similarly, the PROSPER trial showed that enzalutamide significantly improved MFS compared with placebo for men with nmCRPC. In both trials, the data for overall survival was immature at the time of analysis. The SPARTAN and PROSPER trials led to the approval of apalutamide and enzalutamide, respectively, for men with nmCRPC. More recently, the phase 3 trial ARAMIS showed that darolutamide, a novel androgen receptor antagonist, also improves MFS compared with placebo for men with nmCRPC, and this trial is expected to garner regulatory approval for darolutamide in the nmCRPC setting. Novel imaging modalities are becoming more prevalent for the diagnostic evaluation of men with prostate cancer and are more sensitive than conventional bone or CT scans for detection of oligometastatic disease that previously was undetected. These modalities are likely to reduce the incidence and prevalence of nmCRPC in the near future. Ultimately, the treatment options for men with nmCRPC have significantly improved over the past 2 years.",Palliative Cancer Care in the Outpatient Setting: Which Model Works Best?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741353,Current treatment options in oncology,2019 02 26,"Multiple randomized controlled trials have underscored the importance of timely referral to palliative care for patients with advanced cancer. Outpatient palliative care can facilitate timely referral and is increasingly available in many cancer centers. The key question is which model of outpatient palliative care is optimal. There are currently many variations for how palliative care is delivered in the outpatient setting, including (1) Interdisciplinary Specialist Palliative Care in Stand-Alone Clinics, (2) Physician-Only Specialist Palliative Care in Stand-Alone Clinics, (3) Nurse-Led Specialist Palliative Care in Stand-Alone Clinics, (4) Nurse-Led Specialist Palliative Care Telephone-Based Interventions, (5) Embedded Specialist Palliative Care with Variable Team Makeup, and (6) Advanced Practice Providers-Based Enhanced Primary Palliative Care. It is important to make a clear distinction among these delivery models of outpatient palliative care because they have different structures, processes, and outcomes, along with unique strengths and limitations. In this review article, we will provide a critical appraisal of the literature on studies investigating these models. At this time, interdisciplinary specialist palliative care in stand-alone clinics remains the gold standard for ambulatory palliative care because this approach has the greatest impact on multiple patient and caregiver outcomes. Although the other models may require fewer resources, they may not be able to provide the same level of comprehensive palliative care as an interdisciplinary team. Further research is needed to evaluate the optimal model of palliative care delivery in different settings.",The Art of Selective Cannulation at ERCP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741352,Current gastroenterology reports,2019 05 28,ERCP is undergoing its 50th anniversary with a steady conversion from a diagnostic procedure to a therapeutic procedure.

Inspired by the anglerfish, we designed an electromagnetic anglerfish-shaped millirobot that can receive energy and transform it into light to attract algae cells to specific locations. The small wireless powered robot can receive about 658 mW of power from external energy supply coils, and light LEDs (light-emitting diodes). The wireless power generation and moving control of the robot are analyzed systematically. Transmitting electric energy to smaller scale receivers to endow milli or micro robots with wireless power function is an interesting and promising research direction. With this function, the wireless powered robot is expected to be extensively used at the small scale in the near future, such as to provide electricity to drive microdevices (microgrippers, microsensors, etc.), provide light or heat in small-scale space, stimulate/kill pathological cells in minimally invasive treatment and so on.",Automated quantitative morphometry of vertebral heights on spinal radiographs: comparison of a clinical workflow tool with standard 6-point morphometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741350,Archives of osteoporosis,2019 02 11,A workflow tool for measurements of vertebral heights on lateral spine radiographs based on automated placements of 6 points per vertebra was evaluated.

The results showed that the estuary presented similar characteristics in the expeditions, reflecting the oil dispersion pattern through the formation of OSAs, being 92.86% dispersed in the column in the first and 85.71% in the second expedition. The results also pointed to the possibility of pollution in the food chain, reduced fertility, the emergence of abnormalities and the gradual disappearance of species across the whole river in a possible oil spill."

Research aimed at making electronic components smaller has pointed to the possible use of nanosized solder joints in the future. In this study, for the first time, molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze the thermomechanical properties of SAC solder materials at the nanoscale. The modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potential was utilized in the simulations of the SAC solder materials. The dimensions of the structures considered were 55 × 55 × 59 Å. Four different SAC solders were studied, with Ag percentages ranging from 1% to 4% (SAC105, SAC205, SAC305, and SAC405). Thus, the effects of the Ag percentage on the thermomechanical properties of the solder at the nanoscale were identified. The impacts of the temperature on the uniaxial tensile properties and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values of the SAC solder materials were investigated by performing simulations of the materials at different temperatures. Results suggest that as the Ag percentage increases, the uniaxial tensile strength and CTE of the solder increase whereas the failure strain and thermal conductivity decrease. The results presented should prove useful in the electronic packaging industry.",Optimising Radiation Therapy Dose to the Swallowing Organs at Risk: An In Silico Study of feasibility for Patients with Oropharyngeal Tumours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741335,Dysphagia,2019 02 11,"Recent evidence suggests that reducing radiotherapy dose delivered to specific anatomical swallowing structures [Swallowing Organs at Risk (SWOARs)] may improve swallowing outcomes post-treatment for patients with head and neck cancer. However, for those patients with tumours of the oropharynx, which typically directly overlap the SWOARs, reducing dose to these structures may be unachievable without compromising on the treatment of the disease. To assess the feasibility of dose reduction in this cohort, standard IMRT plans (ST-IMRT) and plans with reduced dose to the SWOARs (SW-IMRT) were generated for 25 oropharyngeal cancer patients (Brouwer et al. in Radiother Oncol 117(1):83-90, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2015.07.041 , 2015; Christianen et al. in Radiother Oncol 101(3):394-402, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2011.05.015 , 2011). ST-IMRT and SW-IMRT plans were compared for: mean dose to the SWOARs, volume of pharynx and larynx receiving 50 Gy and 60 Gy (V50 and V60 respectively) and overlap between the tumour volume and the SWOARs. Additionally, two different SWOARs delineation guidelines (Brouwer et al. in Radiother Oncol 117(1):83-90, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2015.07.041 , 2015; Christianen et al. in Radiother Oncol 101(3):394-402, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2011.05.015 , 2011) were used to highlight differences in calculated volumes between existing contouring guidelines. Agreement in SWOARs volumes between the two guidelines was calculated using a concordance index (CI). Despite a large overlap between the tumour and SWOARs, significant (p < 0.05) reductions in mean dose to 4 of the 5 SWOARs, and V50/V60 for the pharynx and larynx were achieved with SW-IMRT plans. Low CIs per structure (0.15-0.45) were found between the two guidelines highlighting issues comparing data between studies when different guidelines have been used (Hawkins et al. in Semin Radiat Oncol 28(1):46-52, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semradonc.2017.08.002 , 2018; Brodin et al. in Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 100(2):391-407, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.09.041 , 2018). This study found reducing dose to the SWOARs is a feasible practice for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. However, future prospective research is needed to determine if the extent of dose reduction achieved equates to clinical benefits.",Enrichment of anaerobic heterotrophic thermophiles from four Azorean hot springs revealed different community composition and genera abundances using recalcitrant substrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741334,Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions,2019 04 11,"DGGE analysis combined with a metagenomic approach was used to get insights into heterotrophic anoxic enrichment cultures of four hot springs of Vale das Furnas, Portugal, using the recalcitrant substrate spent coffee ground (SCG). Parallel enrichment cultures were performed using the major components of spent coffee ground, namely arabinogalactan, galactomannan, cellulose, and proteins. DGGE revealed that heterotrophic thermophilic bacteria are highly abundant in the hydrothermal springs and significant differences in community composition depending on the substrate were observed. DNA, isolated from enrichment cultures of different locations that were grown on the same substrate were pooled, and the respective metagenomes were analyzed. Results indicated that cultures grown on recalcitrant substrate SCG consists of a totally different thermophilic community, dominated by Dictyoglomus. Enrichments with galactomannan and arabinogalactan were dominated by Thermodesulfovibrio, while cultures with casein and cellulose were dominated by Thermus. This study indicates the high potential of thermophilic bacteria degrading recalcitrant substrate such as SCG and furthermore how the accessibility to complex polymers shapes the bacterial community.",The influence of microgravity on cerebral blood flow and electrocortical activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741333,Experimental brain research,2019 03 29,"Changes in gravity conditions have previously been reported to influence brain hemodynamics as well as neuronal activity. This paper attempts to identify a possible link between changes in brain blood flow and neuronal activity during microgravity. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAv) was measured using Doppler ultrasound. Brain cortical activity (i.e., cortical current density) was measured using electroencephalography. Finger blood pressure was recorded and exported to generate beat-by-beat systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi). Seventeen participants were evaluated under normal gravity conditions and microgravity conditions, during 15 bouts of 22-s intervals of weightlessness during a parabolic flight. Although MAP decreased and CO increased, MCAv remained unchanged in the microgravity condition. CVCi as the quotient of MCAv and MAP increased in microgravity. Cortical current density showed a global decrease. Our data support earlier data reporting a decrease in the amplitude of event-related potentials recorded during microgravity. However, the general decrease in neural excitability in microgravity seems not to be dependent on hemodynamic changes.","Tepidicella baoligensis sp. nov., A Novel Member of Betaproteobacterium Isolated from an Oil Reservoir.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741332,Current microbiology,2019 03 29,"A Gram-negative, non-pigmented, aerobic bacterium, designated strain B18-50T was isolated from oil-well production water in Baolige oilfield, China.

The place for microcirculation-targeted therapy is debated as well as the use of alternative techniques (blood purification) and therapies (vitamin C). The implications of hemodynamic alterations on antibiotic doses is discussed. Finally, the specific challenges in low- and middle-income countries are addressed.

Although the role of the immune system in cancer initiation process was experimentally well established, the prognostic value of cellular blood immunological parameters (CBIPs) for BC onset prediction was not demonstrated either in clinics or in mouse models. In this study, we focused on revealing informative CBIPs for mammary cancer (MC) onset prediction in the BLRB/BYRB mouse model with a high incidence of natural MC development. Blood samples were collected from 80 aging females of these original mouse strains, 12 basic CBIPs were estimated by flow cytometry. Then mice were followed up for 28 weeks, and the outcome of females (MC diagnosis, death without MC or MC-free survival) was registered. We estimated the patterns of changes in CBIPs with age and in accordance with the outcome. An increasing imbalance in 11 CBIPs during natural aging of females clearly resembled human immunosenescence phenomenon and several patterns corresponded to the results obtained on cancer-free members of BC-affected families. We stratified heterogeneous female population into middle-aged and old subgroups. Low NK-cell levels in middle-aged mice and low B-cell along with high T-helper levels in old mice distinguished females with developed MC from the other groups. We found a reliable correlation of several CBIPs with age at MC diagnosis and survival of cancer-bearing females. Thus, we demonstrated the predictive potential of CBIPs as a basis for the development of prognostic models for BC onset in clinics."

Here, we investigate the influence of isovalent As substitution on the Sb site on the structural and transport properties (5-700 K) of the two solid solutions Cu12Sb4-xAsxS13 and Cu10Co2Sb4-yAsyS13 (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 4). Electronic band structure calculations predict that As has only a weak influence on the valence bands and hence, on the p-type metallic character of Cu12Sb4S13. In agreement with these predictions, all the samples of the series Cu12Sb4-xAsxS13 exhibit p-type metallic behavior with relatively low electrical resistivity and moderate thermopower values that only slightly evolve with the As content. In contrast, the substitution of Co for Cu in As-rich samples seems less favorable as suggested by a decrease in the Co concentration with increasing the As content. This trend leads to a concomitant increase in the electrical resistivity and thermopower leaving the ZT values practically unchanged with respect to purely Cu-based samples. As a result, peak ZT values ranging between 0.60 and 0.75 are achieved at 700 K for both series. The lack of significant variations in the ZT values confirms the robustness of the thermoelectric performances of tetrahedrites with respect to variations in the Sb-to-As ratio.",Enhanced cluster order-disorder transition-induced dilatancy in silane-functionalized nanosilica colloids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741304,Soft matter,2019 03 04,"Herein, we report a novel nanosilica-based shear-thickening fluid, whose shear-thickening performance has been largely augmented by surface functionalizing silica employing silane chains. The functionalized shear-thickening colloids were transparent; this suggested that they have promise for application. An enhancement in viscosity was observed by over an order of magnitude by the usage of functionalized particles, which could be explained on the basis of enhanced hydroclustering and an order-to-disorder transition of the particles due to physical bonding of the silane with the base polymer. It was also observed that the shear-thickening behavior was grossly modified due to the presence of the functionalized nanoparticles. Oscillatory analysis showed that the functionalized colloids exhibited an improved dynamic response, with enhanced elastic behavior under variant strain and frequency conditions. Additionally, impact resistance tests revealed that the thickening of the viscosity upon impact was augmented by over an order of magnitude; this established these functionalized colloids as excellent candidates for liquid armors. The viscoelastic behavior was modeled based on the Cox-Merz formalism. Additionally, three-element viscoelastic modeling was performed, and it was observed that while the silica-based colloids conformed to the predominantly viscous model, the functionalized system transited to a predominantly elastic model.

Several reviews and studies have hypothesized that in vivo PAT toxicity is related to gut barrier dysfunction, but evidence for this is not substantial. The goal of the present study was to further demonstrate the role of the gut barrier in food-borne PAT toxicity. In vitro assays showed that PAT exposure induced significant cell death, inhibited the mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins and increased gut permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers. An acute PAT exposure animal trial reported for the first time an association between PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and endotoxemia in mice. Sub-chronic PAT exposure also inhibited the expression of ZO-1 in the gut and induced both intestinal and systematic inflammation in mice. Dietary supplements with previously reported protective effects on the gut barrier, such as docosahexaenoic acid and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610, were able to recover the PAT-induced gut barrier dysfunction and significantly alleviate PAT toxicity in vivo. Another L. plantarum strain, CCFM11, with poor gut barrier modulation ability, failed to exhibit identical protective effects against PAT toxicity to L. plantarum CCFM8610. Our results indicated that PAT-induced disruption of the gut barrier and bacterial translocation may be another toxic mechanism of PAT besides its inherent cytotoxicity. Gut barrier protection may be considered an important target for the prevention of PAT toxicity.",Approaching the Yablonovitch limit with free-floating arrays of subwavelength trumpet non-imaging light concentrators driven by extraordinary low transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741299,Nanoscale,2019 03 01,"Metamaterials based on arrays of subwavelength dielectric structures have recently proved to be a viable research tool towards the realization of various photonic devices. In the current study we introduce a new approach towards efficient light trapping and broadband absorption of solar radiation based on silicon surface arrays composed of subwavelength trumpet non-imaging light concentrators (henceforth, trumpet arrays). In geometrical optics, a three-dimensional trumpet non-imaging light concentrator is a hyperboloid of revolution with an ideal light concentration ratio. We use finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic calculations to examine the optical response of an infinite cubic-tiled substrate-less silicon trumpet array under normal illumination. The absorptivity spectra of trumpet arrays are characterized by strong absorption peaks, some of which are just below the Yablonovitch limit. The enhanced light trapping is attributed solely to the efficient occupation of the array Mie modes, and we show absorption enhancement at near infrared that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the optimized nanopillar (NP) arrays. We show superior broadband absorption of solar radiation in trumpet arrays (with unoptimized geometry) compared with that of the optimized NP arrays (∼26% enhancement). The higher optical absorption in the trumpet array is governed by low transmissivity, in contrast to the NP array in which the absorption is governed by low reflectivity. Finally, we show that low reflectivity in trumpet arrays is governed by modal excitation at the upper part of the trumpets (which is also supported by the weak dependency of the reflectivity on the array height), whereas the transmissivity is governed by modal excitation at the lower part of the trumpets."

In the FERA method, flap endonuclease (FEN) catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage at the junction of single- and double-stranded DNAs which is formed only in the presence of target nucleic acids, and releases short oligonucleotides to promote the cyclic enzymatic repairing amplification (ERA) combined with FEN-based amplification. As a result, a large amount of single- and double-stranded DNAs are generated under the isothermal conditions, leading to the high fluorescence intensity from the SYBR I green dye. Relying on the powerful amplification method, we successfully determined the target nucleic acids with a limit of detection as low as 15.16 aM, which corresponds to approximately 180 molecules in 20 μL reaction volume, and verified the practical applicability by detecting long target nucleic acids derived from Chlamydia trachomatis.",Carbonate and phosphite encaged in frameworks constructed from square lanthanum aminopolycarboxylates and sodium chloride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741287,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 04,"Novel additives of lanthanum aminopolycarboxylates with inorganic anions, Na12n[La(edta)L]4n·8nNaCl·4nH2O (1: L = HPO32-; 2: L = CO32-) and K12n[La(cdta)(CO3)]4n·35nH2O (3) (H4edta = ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; H4cdta = cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid), were obtained in alkaline solution.

These new materials and devices should be evaluated against clear and rigorous metrics, primarily based on the evidence of real performances. A series of criteria are commonly used to characterize and report performance of EES systems in the literature. However, as advanced EES systems are becoming more and more sophisticated, the methodologies to reliably evaluate the performance of the electrode active materials and EES devices need to be refined to realize the true promise as well as the limitations of these fast-moving technologies, and target areas for further development. In the absence of a commonly accepted core group of metrics, inconsistencies may arise between the values attributed to the materials or devices and their real performances. Herein, we provide an overview of the energy storage devices from conventional capacitors to supercapacitors to hybrid systems and ultimately to batteries. The metrics for evaluation of energy storage systems are described, although the focus is kept on capacitive and hybrid energy storage systems. In addition, we discuss the challenges that still need to be addressed for establishing more sophisticated criteria for evaluating EES systems. We hope this effort will foster ongoing dialog and promote greater understanding of these metrics to develop an international protocol for accurate assessment of EES systems.","A new tri-nuclear Cu-carbonate cluster utilizing CO2 as a C1-building block - reactive intermediates, a probable mechanism, and EPR and magnetic studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741285,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 13,"This work demonstrates that simple copper-bipyridine compounds and atmospheric CO2 react to produce useful/complex materials under appropriate conditions.

The high-pressure Raman scattering studies show crystal instabilities in the 4.0-4.4 GPa and 2.0-2.5 GPa ranges for DMANaCr and DMAKCr, respectively. The mechanism is similar in the two compounds and involves strong deformation of the metal-formate framework, especially pronounced for the subnetwork of CrO6 octahedra, accompanied by substantial compressibility of the DMA+ cations. Comparison with previous high-pressure Raman studies of sodium-chromium heterometallic MOFs show that the stability depends on the templated cation and increases as follows: ammonium < imidazolium < DMA+. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to get a better understanding of the structural properties leading to the existence of phase transitions. We calculate the energy of the hydrogen bonds (HBs) between the DMA+ cation and the metal formate cage, revealing a stronger interaction in the DMAKCr compound due to a HB arrangement that primarily involves the energetically preferred bonding to KO6 octahedra. This material however also has a smaller structural tolerance factor (TF) and a higher vibrational entropy than DMANaCr. This indicates a more flexible crystal structure, explaining the lower phase transition pressure, as well as the previously observed phase transition at 190 K, which is absent in the DMANaCr compound. The DFT high-pressure simulations show the largest contraction to be along the trigonal axis, leading to a minimal distortion of the HBs formed between the DMA+ cations and the metal-formate sublattice.","Robust synthesis routes and porosity of the Al-based metal-organic frameworks Al-fumarate, CAU-10-H and MIL-160.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741280,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 04,"Aluminum-based metal-organic frameworks, Al-MOFs, have developed into one of the most promising MOFs for potential applications because of, inter alia, their hydrothermal stability and comparatively easy synthesis, and the availability of abundant, inexpensive and non-poisonous metal.

The three Al-MOFs exhibit proven hydrothermal stability and water uptake to make them eligible for heat transformation applications. At the same time, it is important for applications that the synthesis and porous properties of these MOFs are robust, that is readily reproducible within certain limits. The typical solution synthesis of these MOFs was carried out with slight variations and compared with the literature to check if indeed the reported porosity data can readily be reproduced. Furthermore, dry-gel conversion (DGC) was implemented here for the synthesis of these MOFs and yielded products with higher total pore volumes due to the inherent aggregate formation under dry-gel synthesis conditions. The evaluation and our added syntheses ascertain that these Al-MOFs can be reproducibly synthesized with robust porosity properties, which are independent of the synthesis method, underscoring the potential of these MOFs for applications.",A study of di(amino)stibines with terminal Sb(iii) hydrogen-ligands by X-ray- and neutron-diffraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741279,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 04,"The bis(amidodimethyl)disiloxane ligands [O{SiMe2NR}2]2- (R = 2,6-Me2C6H3 (Ar') and 2,6-iPr2C6H3 (Ar), abbreviated [NONR]2-, are a stable support for Sb(iii) complexes of general formula Sb(NONR)X (X = Cl, H).

It is a double-stranded (ds) RNA virus and forms a genetically diverse population, known as quasispecies, owing to their high mutation rate. Here, we describe how to measure the specific growth rate and the cell-binding ability of rotavirus as its phenotypes. Rotavirus is treated with trypsin to recognize the cell receptor and then inoculated into MA104 cell culture. The supernatant, including viral progenies, is collected intermittently. The plaque assay is used to confirm the virus titer (plaque-forming unit: pfu) of each collected supernatant. The specific growth rate is estimated by fitting time-course data of pfu/mL to the modified Gompertz model. In the assay of cell-binding, MA104 cells in a 24-well plate are infected with rotavirus and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C for rotavirus adsorption to cell receptors. A low temperature restrains rotavirus from invading the host cell. After washing to remove unbound virions, RNA is extracted from virions attached to cell receptors followed by cDNA synthesis and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). These protocols can be applied for investigating the phenotypic differences among viral strains.",Shaping the Amplitude and Phase of Laser Beams by Using a Phase-only Spatial Light Modulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741262,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"The aim of this article is to visually demonstrate the utilization of an interferometric method for encoding complex fields associated with coherent laser radiation. The method is based on the coherent sum of two uniform waves, previously encoded into a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) by spatial multiplexing of their phases. Here, the interference process is carried out by spatial filtering of light frequencies at the Fourier plane of certain imaging system. The correct implementation of this method allows arbitrary phase and amplitude information to be retrieved at the output of the optical system. It is an on-axis, rather than off-axis encoding technique, with a direct processing algorithm (not an iterative loop), and free from coherent noise (speckle). The complex field can be exactly retrieved at the output of the optical system, except for some loss of resolution due to the frequency filtering process. The main limitation of the method might come from the inability to operate at frequency rates higher than the refresh rate of the SLM. Applications include, but are not limited to, linear and non-linear microscopy, beam shaping, or laser micro-processing of material surfaces.",A Controlled Mouse Model for Neonatal Polymicrobial Sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741260,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"Neonatal sepsis remains a global burden. A preclinical model to screen effective prophylactic or therapeutic interventions is needed. Neonatal mouse polymicrobial sepsis can be induced by injecting cecal slurry intraperitoneally into day of life 7 mice and monitoring them for the following week. Presented here are the detailed steps necessary for the implementation of this neonatal sepsis model. This includes making a homogeneous cecal slurry stock, diluting it to a weight- and litter-adjusted dose, an outline of the monitoring schedule, and a definition of observed health categories used to define humane endpoints. The generation of a homogeneous cecal slurry stock from pooled donors allows for the administration into many litters over time, reducing the variation between donors, and preventing the use of potentially toxic glycerol. The monitoring strategy used allows for the anticipation of survival outcome and the identification of mice that would later progress to death, allowing for an earlier identification of the humane endpoint. Two main behavioral features are used to define the health scores, namely, the ability of the neonatal mice to right themselves when placed on their back and their level of mobility. These criteria could potentially be applied to address humane endpoints in other studies of neonatal disease in mice, as long as a pilot study is performed to confirm accuracy. In conclusion, this approach provides a standardized method to model newborn sepsis in mice, while providing resources to assess animal welfare used to define early humane endpoints for challenged animals.",Immunization of Alpacas (Lama pacos) with Protein Antigens and Production of Antigen-specific Single Domain Antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741259,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"In this manuscript, a method for the immunization of alpaca and the use of molecular biology methods to produce antigen-specific single domain antibodies is described and demonstrated. Camelids, such as alpacas and llamas, have become a valuable resource for biomedical research since they produce a novel type of heavy chain-only antibody which can be used to produce single domain antibodies. Because the immune system is highly flexible, single domain antibodies can be made to many different protein antigens, and even different conformations of the antigen, with a very high degree of specificity. These features, among others, make single domain antibodies an invaluable tool for biomedical research. A method for the production of single domain antibodies from alpacas is reported. A protocol for immunization, blood collection, and B-cell isolation is described. The B-cells are used for the construction of an immunized library, which is used in the selection of specific single domain antibodies via panning. Putative specific single domain antibodies obtained via panning are confirmed by pull-down, ELISA, or gel-shift assays. The resulting single domain antibodies can then be used either directly or as a part of an engineered reagent. The uses of single domain antibody and single domain antibody-based regents include structural, biochemical, cellular, in vivo, and therapeutic applications. Single domain antibodies can be produced in large quantities as recombinant proteins in prokaryotic expression systems, purified, and used directly or can be engineered to contain specific markers or tags that can be used as reporters in cellular studies or in diagnostics.",Confocal Imaging of Double-Stranded RNA and Pattern Recognition Receptors in Negative-Sense RNA Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741258,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 06 10,"Double-stranded (ds) RNA is produced as a replicative intermediate during RNA virus infection. Recognition of dsRNA by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the retinoic acid (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) leads to the induction of the innate immune response. The formation and intracellular distribution of dsRNA in positive-sense RNA virus infection has been well characterized by microscopy. Many negative-sense RNA viruses, including some arenaviruses, trigger the innate immune response during infection. However, negative-sense RNA viruses were thought to produce low levels of dsRNA, which hinders the imaging study of PRR recognition of viral dsRNA. Additionally, infection experiments with highly pathogenic arenaviruses must be performed in high containment biosafety level facilities (BSL-4). The interaction between viral RNA and PRRs for highly pathogenic RNA virus is largely unknown due to the additional technical challenges that researchers need to face in the BSL-4 facilities. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (Mab) (clone 9D5) originally used for pan-enterovirus detection has been found to specifically detect dsRNA with a higher sensitivity than the traditional J2 or K1 anti-dsRNA antibodies. Herein, by utilizing the 9D5 antibody, we describe a confocal microscopy protocol that has been used successfully to visualize dsRNA, viral protein and PRR simultaneously in individual cells infected by arenavirus. The protocol is also suitable for imaging studies of dsRNA and PRR distribution in pathogenic arenavirus infected cells in BSL4 facilities.",Flow Cytometric Detection of Newly-formed Breast Cancer Stem Cell-like Cells After Apoptosis Reversal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741257,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"Cancer recurrence has long been studied by oncologists while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, we and others found that a phenomenon named apoptosis reversal leads to increased tumorigenicity in various cell models under different stimuli. Previous studies have been focused on tracking this process in vitro and in vivo; however, the isolation of real reversed cells has yet to be achieved, which limits our understanding on the consequences of apoptosis reversal. Here, we take advantage of a Caspase-3/7 Green Detection dye to label cells with activated caspases after apoptotic induction. Cells with positive signals are further sorted out by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for recovery. Morphological examination under confocal microscopy helps confirm the apoptotic status before FACS. An increase in tumorigenicity can often be attributed to the elevation in the percentage of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells. Also, given the heterogeneity of breast cancer, identifying the origin of these CSC-like cells would be critical to cancer treatment. Thus, we prepare breast non-stem cancer cells before triggering apoptosis, isolating caspase-activated cells and performing the apoptosis reversal procedure. Flow cytometry analysis reveals that breast CSC-like cells re-appear in the reversed group, indicating breast CSC-like cells are transited from breast non-stem cancer cells during apoptosis reversal. In summary, this protocol includes the isolation of apoptotic breast cancer cells and detection of changes in CSC percentage in reversed cells by flow cytometry.",Probiotic Studies in Neonatal Mice Using Gavage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741256,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"Adult mouse models have been widely used to understand the mechanism behind disease progression in humans. The applicability of studies done in adult mouse models to neonatal diseases is limited. To better understand disease progression, host responses and long-term impact of interventions in neonates, a neonatal mouse model likely is a better fit. The sparse use of neonatal mouse models can in part be attributed to the technical difficulties of working with these small animals. A neonatal mouse model was developed to determine the effects of probiotic administration in early life and to specifically assess the ability to establish colonization in the newborn mouse intestinal tract. Specifically, to assess probiotic colonization in the neonatal mouse, Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) was delivered directly into the neonatal mouse gastrointestinal tract. To this end, LP was administered to mice by feeding through intra-esophageal (IE) gavage. A highly reproducible method was developed to standardize the process of IE gavage that allows an accurate administration of probiotic dosages while minimizing trauma, an aspect particularly important given the fragility of newborn mice. Limitations of this process include possibilities of esophageal irritation or damage and aspiration if gavaged incorrectly. This approach represents an improvement on current practices because IE gavage into the distal esophagus reduces the chances of aspiration. Following gavage, the colonization profile of the probiotic was traced using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the extracted intestinal DNA with LP specific primers. Different litter settings and cage management techniques were used to assess the potential for colonization-spread. The protocol details the intricacies of IE neonatal mouse gavage and subsequent colonization quantification with LP.",Multi-Modal Home Sleep Monitoring in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741255,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 20,"The gold standard for sleep monitoring is attended in-lab polysomnography; however, this method may be cost-prohibitive and inconvenient for patients and research participants. Home sleep testing has gained momentum in the field of sleep medicine due to its convenience and lower cost, as well as being more naturalistic. The accuracy and quality of home sleep testing, however, may be variable because studies are not monitored by sleep technologists. There has been some success in improving the accuracy of home sleep studies by having trained sleep technicians assist participants inside their homes with putting on the devices, but this can be intrusive and time-consuming for those involved. In this protocol, participants undergo at-home sleep monitoring with multiple devices: 1) a single-channel EEG device; 2) a home sleep test for sleep-disordered breathing and periodic limb movements; 3) actigraphy; and 4) sleep logs. A major challenge of this study is obtaining high-quality sleep monitoring data on the first attempt in order to minimize participant burden.

MSCs are originally isolated and characterized from bone marrow (BM), then acquired from tissues including adipose tissue, synovium, skin, dental pulp, and fetal appendages such as placenta, umbilical cord blood (UCB), and umbilical cord (UC). MSCs are a heterogeneous cell population with the capacity for (1) adherence to plastic in standard culture conditions, (2) surface marker expression of CD73+/CD90+/CD105+/CD45-/CD34-/CD14-/CD19-/HLA-DR- phenotypes, and (3) trilineage differentiation into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, as currently defined by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT). Although BM is the most widely used source of MSCs, the invasive nature of BM aspiration ethically limits its accessibility. Proliferation and differentiation capacity of MSCs obtained from BM generally decline with the age of the donor. In contrast, fetal MSCs obtained from UC have advantages such as vigorous proliferation and differentiation capacity. There is no ethical concern for UC sampling, as it is typically regarded as medical waste. Human UC starts to develop with continuing growth of the amniotic cavity at 4-8 weeks of gestation and keeps growing until reaching 50-60 cm in length, and it can be isolated during the whole newborn delivery period. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of intractable diseases, we have used UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) from infants delivered at various gestational ages. In this protocol, we describe the isolation and characterization of UC-MSCs from fetuses/infants at 19-40 weeks of gestation.",Sexual Transmission of American Trypanosomes from Males and Females to Naive Mates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741253,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 02 11,"American trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans by triatomine bugs through the ingestion of contaminated food, by blood transfusions or accidently in hospitals and research laboratories. In addition, the Trypanosoma cruzi infection is transmitted congenitally from a chagasic mother to her offspring, but the male partner's contribution to in utero contamination is unknown. The findings of nests and clumps of amastigotes and of trypomastigotes in the theca cells of the ovary, in the goniablasts and in the lumen of seminiferous tubules suggest that T. cruzi infections are sexually transmitted. The research protocol herein presents the results of a family study population showing parasite nuclear DNA in the diploid blood mononuclear cells and in the haploid gametes of human subjects. Thus, three independent biological samples collected one year apart confirmed that T. cruzi infections were sexually transmitted to progeny. Interestingly, the specific T. cruzi antibody was absent in the majority of family progeny that bore immune tolerance to the parasite antigen. Immune tolerance was demonstrated in chicken refractory to T. cruzi after the first week of embryonic growth, and chicks hatched from the flagellate-inoculated eggs were unable to produce the specific antibody. Moreover, the instillation of the human semen ejaculates intraperitoneally or into the vagina of naive mice yielded T. cruzi amastigotes in the epididymis, seminiferous tubule, vas deferens and uterine tube with an absence of inflammatory reactions in the immune privileged organs of reproduction. The breeding of T. cruzi-infected male and female mice with naive mates resulted in acquisition of the infections, which were later transmitted to the progeny. Therefore, a robust education, information and communication program that involves the population and social organizations is deemed necessary to prevent Chagas disease."

The need for adverse event detection methodology has been repeatedly noted but standard AE detection methods are not in place in the US. At present, there are several widely enforced strategies for AE detection but none are both highly successful and computational. In order to maximize AE detection, we have conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis of these approaches.

POm triggered not only a stronger fast-onset depolarization but also a delayed all-or-none persistent depolarization, lasting up to 1 s and exhibiting alpha/beta-range oscillations. Inactivating POm somata abolished persistent but not initial depolarization, indicating a recurrent circuit mechanism. We conclude that secondary thalamus can enhance L2/3 responsiveness over long periods. Such timescales could provide a potential modality-specific substrate for attention, working memory, and plasticity.",Case Study: Gaining Physician Involvement in Quality Improvement Initiatives: An Organizational Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741159,"Healthcare quarterly (Toronto, Ont.)",2019 05 20,"Hôpital Montfort adopted the Lean methodology in 2008 to improve its services in the emergency department.

Part A,2019 02 26,"Campomanesia xanthocarpa leaves are used as tea to treat diarrhea, inflammation, and hypercholesterolemia. Some pharmacological studies noted its beneficial uses of C. xanthocarpa; however, few investigations examined the toxicological profile of this plant. The aim of this study was to determine the chemical composition, genotoxic, and mutagenic potential of an aqueous extract of C. xanthocarpa leaves (CxAE), and potential protective effects against oxidative damage. Phytochemical constituents were determined using HPLC, and antioxidant effect in vitro was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical assay. Genotoxic effects and chromosomic mutations were assessed using comet assay and micronucleus (MN) test in Wistar rats treated with CxAE at 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days. Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in several tissues. CxAE induced mutations in TA98, TA97a, and TA102 strains. However, in the presence of metabolic activation, data were negative for all strains tested. Lack of mutagenicity was also observed in the MN test. This extract did not induce DNA damage, except when the highest concentration was used. DNA oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decreased in blood after treatment with CxAE. Lipid peroxidation levels were reduced while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in kidneys. The inhibitory concentration of CxAE required to lower DPPH levels to 50% was 38.47 ± 2.06 μg/ml. In conclusion, frameshift and oxidative mutations were observed only in the absence of metabolic activation which may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids such as quercetin. It is of interest that CxAE also showed protective effects against DNA oxidative damage associated with presence of ellagic acid, a phenolic acid with antioxidant activities. CxAE did not induce in vivo mutagenicity, suggesting that this extract poses a low toxic hazard over the short term.",Removal of inorganic chemical species and organic matter from slaughterhouse wastewater via calcium acetate synthesized from eggshell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741124,"Journal of environmental science and health. Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering",2019 04 24,"The physicochemical treatment (PT) of slaughterhouse wastewater (SWW) was investigated. In the first stage, calcium acetate (Ca(Ac)2) was synthesized in five different ways: (1) acetic acid (HAc) and chicken eggshell (CaAc1), (2) lime (CaAc2), (3) a 1:1 eggshell and lime mixture (CaAc3), (4) a 1:2 eggshell and lime mixture (CaAc4), and (5) calcium oxide via the calcination of eggshell (CaAc5). The synthesized Ca(Ac)2 samples were characterized by IR, SEM, XRD, and EDS. Subsequently, the samples were used to precipitate oxyanions and organic matter. The experiments were carried out at pH 4 and 12. For the treatment with CaAc1 at pH 4, an acid (HCl, H2SO4, or HAc) was also added. The best results for CaAc1 in acid media were attained with HCl, where removal efficiencies of 82.23% total suspended solids, 76% turbidity, 81.43% color, 53.86% Fe, 69.74% Cu, and 14.64% Na were observed. This treatment also removed ∼99% fecal and total coliforms, 26.49% COD, and 78.39% TOC. The experiments were also performed at pH 12 using CaAc1.

Part A,2019 03 18,"Safety issues regarding consumer products contaminated with trace amounts of chemicals are of great concern to consumers, with the degree of concern occasionally escalating to the psychological syndrome, chemophobia (i.e., the fear of chemicals). Hazardous substances frequently implicated in safety concerns include heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead), volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene and o-toluidine, pesticides, carcinogens, radioactive substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) such as bisphenol A and phthalates. To improve communication of risk to society, members of academia, government, consumer organizations, and industry participated in this workshop to discuss and exchange perspectives on trace chemical safety. From the perspective of academia, integrated risk assessments need to be implemented to encompass various exposure sources and routes. The identification and investigation of new exposure-related biomarkers are also recommended to verify direct causal relationships between specific chemical exposure and effects on human health. As for regulation, governments need to establish and maintain acceptable limits for trace chemicals in products. In addition, harmonized efforts need to be undertaken among government agencies to share regulatory limits and effectively control trace chemicals in consumer products. Manufacturers need to faithfully abide by Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines, monitor sources of contamination, and minimize these for consumer safety. To effectively resolve safety issues arising from trace chemicals exposure, collaborative efforts are needed involving academia, government, consumer organizations, and industry. Further, scientific evidence-based risk assessment is a critical approach to effectively manage trace chemical safety issues.",Interpersonal positive reframing in the daily lives of couples coping with breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741121,Journal of psychosocial oncology,2019 04 24,This study examined word use as an indicator of interpersonal positive reframing in daily conversations of couples coping with breast cancer and as a predictor of stress.,Alef and Shem: Original artwork.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741119,Journal of lesbian studies,2019 03 25,"Artist and scientist Sharon Gershoni presents here two works of her art in different mediums.

Our case study describes the middle fossa approach for the management of bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss in a female child with multiple external, middle and inner ear malformations. The middle fossa approach has been reported sporadically and has been used inconsistently in patients with chronic otitis media and inner ear malformations. Case study: A 3-year-old female child presented with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, bilateral anotia, right cochlear nerve agenesis, right facial paralysis, bilateral mild inner ear dysplasia and an aberrant left facial nerve covering the left round window. Further tests indicated that she was a suitable candidate for cochlear implantation and was medically cleared for surgery. In view of the multiple malformations and high risk of injury to her only functioning left facial nerve on the side with a cochlear nerve, cochlear implantation via a middle fossa approach was performed. Conclusion: Middle fossa approach to cochlear implantation is challenging but can be safely performed even in children and offers an option in patients when a routine mastoidectomy, facial recess and round window approach cannot be undertaken.",Weight loss effect of sweet orange essential oil microcapsules on obese SD rats induced by high-fat diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741117,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2019 04 19,"Obesity is one of the most common and major health concerns worldwide. Weight management through dietary supplements with natural plant extracts has become the focus of current research. Sweet orange essential oil (SOEO) is a natural plant extract, with many bioactivities. In order to evaluate the weight loss effect of SOEO microcapsules and investigate the underlying mechanism, we fed high-fat diet-induced obese SD rats with SOEO microcapsules for 15 days and found that SOEO microcapsules reduced body weight gain by 41.4%, decreased total cholesterol level, alleviated liver and adipose tissue pathological alteration. The results of fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that decreasing the expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ, upregulating of uncoupling protein 2, hormone sensitive lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, inhibiting the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase appear to be the mechanism of SOEO microcapsules to lose weight.

Therefore, understanding the regulation of muscle mass is of significant importance. Resistance exercise training (RET) combined with supportive nutrition is an effective strategy to achieve muscle hypertrophy by driving chronic elevations in muscle protein synthesis (MPS). The regulation of muscle protein synthesis is a coordinated process, in requiring ribosomes to translate mRNA and sufficient myonuclei density to provide the platform for ribosome and mRNA transcription; as such MPS is determined by both translational efficiency (ribosome activity) and translational capacity (ribosome number). Moreover, as the muscle protein pool expands during hypertrophy, translation capacity (i.e. ribosomes and myonuclei content) could theoretically become rate-limiting such that an inability to expand these pools through ribosomal biogenesis and satellite cell (SC) mediated myonuclear addition could limit growth potential. Simple measures of RNA (ribosome content) and DNA (SC/Myonuclei number) concentrations reveal that these pools do increase with hypertrophy; yet whether these adaptations are a pre-requisite or a limiting factor for hypertrophy is unresolved and highly debated. This is primarily due to methodological limitations and many assumptions being made on static measures or correlative associations. However recent advances within the field using stable isotope tracers shows promise in resolving these questions in muscle adaptation."

Excusing rape serves to reduce abusers' culpability for their offending, and ascribing blame to victims, while justifying rape is associated with a sense of sexual entitlement. The distinct effects of these factors on rape judgments have not yet been investigated. We examined whether these belief clusters differentially explained judgments of perpetrator innocence after priming cues related to each of them. We used a cross-sectional design ( N = 217) to test our hypotheses. As predicted, we found that excusing rape cognitions contributed to exaggerated innocence judgments when the victim paid the bill on a first date (potentially indicative of romantic or sexual interest). However, contrary to expectations, there was no evidence that participants justified rape when the perpetrator paid the bill. Implications for conceptualizing the functions of rape-supportive cognitions are discussed.",The Blind Men and the Elephant: Meta-Ethnography 30 Years On.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741098,Qualitative health research,2019 02 11,"In the 30 years since its introduction, meta-ethnography has become a critical tool for synthesizing qualitative health research and providing a holistic understanding of complex health and social phenomena.

In this population, standard cardiovascular (CV) risk assessment could be underrated with the predictive capacity of the Framingham Risk Score. At present, cardiac computed tomography (CT) provides a high diagnostic performance for the detection of coronary atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data concerning the prognostic value of this technology in apparently healthy relatives of patients with premature coronary events.

Environmental risk and prior victimization history impact concerns about personal safety. However, few studies include stalking as part of the victimization history. Two reasons studies may not include stalking are that adding more questions to a research assessment increases participant burden and measurement of stalking has not always been clear. The current study used a community sample of 2,719 men and women and a five-item stalking assessment to examine the prevalence and impact of stalking and stalking-related fear on concern about personal safety, perceived vulnerability to an attack, perceptions that risk of victimization is higher due to personal characteristics, discomfort when thinking about safety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms controlling for victimization history, age, and environment risk by gender. Overall, 30% of women and 12% of men experienced stalking using the extreme fear standard which is double the national rates. Stalking-related fear, for both women and men, was associated with all of the outcome measures. Furthermore, there were significant main effects of gender after controlling for stalking-related fear on three of the outcomes consistent with the gender fear gap. Based on these results, research studies should consider including stalking as part of the victimization history as it is likely to impact health and mental health outcomes as well as personal safety concerns and responses for both men and women.",Approaches to Photoprotection and Normalization in Highly Adherent Families of Children With Xeroderma Pigmentosum in the United Kingdom.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741094,Qualitative health research,2019 02 11,"In this study, we examine photoprotection for children with Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare genetic skin disease requiring rigorous photoprotection, to reduce risks of severe burning and skin cancers from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).

Qualitative semistructured interviews were undertaken with 12 child-parent dyads recruited from the National XP Specialist service in London. We employed a framework approach to analysis. This identified a high level of photoprotection based either on ""protection"" to facilitate normal activities or ""avoidance"" of outdoor activity with priority given to normality in the future. These approaches were shaped by perceptions of clinical risk, the emphasis given to a normal family life and families' circumstances and resources. The findings contribute to notions of normalization and coping with demanding care regimens and inform approaches to working with families."

The aim of this study was to investigate wrist surgeons' experiences and perceptions regarding treatment of triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries and to explore the rationale behind clinical decision-making. A purposive sample of consultant wrist surgeons ( n = 10) was recruited through 'snow-balling' until data saturation was reached. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two researchers independently analysed data using an iterative/thematic approach. Findings suggest that surgeons rely more on their own training and experience, and patient-related factors such as individual expectations, to inform their decision-making, rather than on published material. Current classification systems are largely considered to be unhelpful.

Stem cells therapy for infertility has a great interest nowadays especially for cancer survivors at pre-reproductive and reproductive age.  Thirty-two adult male albino rats were used, divided equally into four groups; Group I (Control group) received isotonic saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) as vehicle. Group II (Cisplatin-treated group) received Cisplatin (i.p.) at a single dose of 7 mg/kg, and then were sacrificed after 5 days. Group III (Stem-cell-treated group) received Cisplatin (i.p.) at a single dose of 7 mg/kg, then after 5 days received adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) (1 × 106). Cells were injected in the rete testis, then after 60 days, the animals were sacrificed. Group IV (Auto healing group) received Cisplatin (i.p.) at a single dose of 7 mg/kg, and then left for 65 days then the animals were sacrificed. Cisplatin administration resulted in degenerative changes in the testicular architecture in the form of thickened irregular BM of seminiferous tubules. The germinal epithelium showed disorganization and marked reduction in the thickness, associated with Sertoli cells preservation. Features of apoptosis assured by elevated caspase-3 expression were noticed. The interstitium showed cellular infiltration and distorted Leydig cells. Injection of (ADMSCs) resulted in great improvement of testicular architecture and increase in the testosterone level associated with strong immune reaction of the CD-44. ADMSCs are recommended as a new treatment modality for male infertility.

A previous study demonstrated that abscisic acid, a phytohormone involved in stress responses, inhibits root growth by delaying the onset of cell elongation. In contrast, we recently reported that cytokinins promote elongation of root cells by enhancing actin bundling. However, the control of root cell elongation through the interaction between abscisic acid and cytokinin signaling has not yet been uncovered. Here, we show that abscisic acid-induced delay in cell elongation requires inhibition of cytokinin signaling; further, stress is signaled to cell elongation by the pathway mediated by B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 2 (ARR2), which retards root growth.",Correlations between dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormal metabolic network activity in REM sleep behavior disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741074,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 02 11,"Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) deficiency and abnormal expression of Parkinson's disease (PD)-related pattern (PDRP) have been observed in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD). This study aimed to investigate the correlations between these two measures with comparison to PD using a dual tracer imaging design. Age-matched 37 IRBD patients, 86 PD patients, and 15 control subjects underwent concurrent PET scans with 11C-CFT to quantify dopaminergic dysfunction and 18F-FDG to quantify PDRP expression. IRBD patients were divided into two subgroups: those with relatively normal (IRBD-RN) or abnormal (IRBD-AB) striatal DAT binding. Significantly decreased DAT binding and increased PDRP scores were present in all patient groups, except for IRBD-RN, relative to the controls. There was a significant effect of hemisphere and hemisphere × group interaction for DAT binding but not for PDRP expression. Significant correlations were observed between DAT binding and PDRP expression in the IRBD-AB and PD groups but not in the IRBD-RN group. IRBD patients present with an intermediate state in striatal DAT distribution and PDRP activity between PD and normal controls. The modest correlations between the two measures in both IRBD and PD suggest that differences in network activity cannot be fully explained by nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation.",The Risk of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients Receiving Concomitant Vancomycin With Piperacillin-Tazobactam or Cefepime.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741072,Journal of intensive care medicine,2019 02 11,The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among critically ill patients receiving combination therapy with vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam (VPT) against patients receiving vancomycin plus cefepime (VC).,"""It Doesn't Freak Us Out the Way It Used to"": An Evaluation of the Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation Program to Inform Practice and Policy Screening for IPV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741071,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 02 11,"The Domestic Violence Enhanced Home Visitation (DOVE) intervention used in the Perinatal Nurse Home Visiting Intervention Enhanced With mHealth Technology (RCT: R01HD071771) is a nurse-lead evidenced-based intervention that has been shown to decrease violence overtime. This summative mixed-methods impact evaluation is intended to provide insight to enhance the DOVE IPV protocol for screening and intervention by (a) identifying which core aspects of DOVE facilitated or inhibited its success and what was most critical to optimal IPV (intimate partner violence) screening and intervention practices, (b) informing how DOVE IPV screening and intervention were influenced by the experiences of home visitor (HV), and (c) identifying policy considerations and best practice recommendations for the DOVE protocol. Participants were HVs and managers ( N = 13) in rural/urban home visiting programs delivering DOVE across three states. The sample had a mean age of 48.76. Three fourths were baccalaureate-prepared nurses with an average of 10.5 years of home visiting experience. The method used in this study was one-to-one qualitative in-depth interviews with HVs. Data were interpretively analyzed using Nvivo 10 to generate three themes. Participants endorsed screening women for IPV with DOVE being the approach of choice to facilitate IPV screening and intervening with women. HVs found DOVE helped enhance their IPV knowledge, screening, and intervening capabilities while filling an existing void in this type of preparation of HV nurses. Establishing a relationship with the women before initiating screening was an important aspect in delivering DOVE as was the training, support, and increased comfort level in addressing IPV. The evidence offers an understanding of which core aspects of DOVE contributed to its success and what was most critical to optimal IPV screening and intervention practices. Furthermore, this evaluation provided multilevel insights into how best to advance home visiting practices and policies when screening and intervening with perinatal women exposed to IPV.",Cardiovascular events in hospitalised patients with schizophrenia: a survival analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741069,International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,2019 06 03,"Objective: To evaluate the occurrence of cardiovascular (CV), cerebrovascular events and mortality rates, and compare the predictive ability of two scores, Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD), of detecting a cardiovascular event in a cohort of schizophrenic patients.

The development of innovative strategies and safe sensitizers is required to overcome MDR. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, the application of which has been learn to understand MDR. However, the application and use are severely restricted because of this MDR. Cyclodextrins (CDs) of many carriers, additionally have shown anti-cancer capability in MDR cancer cells. In this study, novel paclitaxel/hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin complex-loaded liposomes (PTXCDL) have been developed in an attempt to overcome MDR in a PTX-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma (A549/T) cell line. The in vitro application of PTXCDL exhibited pH-sensitive PTX release, potent cytotoxicity, and enhanced intracellular accumulation. In comparison to in vivo, PTXCDL also show a stronger inhibition of tumor growth. In comparison, these findings suggest that the PTXCDL provide a novel strategy for effective therapy of resistant cancers by overcoming the drug resistance.",Glutathione accelerates osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone destruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741054,Free radical research,2019 05 10,"Chronic inflammation associated with bone tissues often destructs bones, which is essentially performed by osteoclasts in the presence of immunoregulatory molecules. Hence, regulating osteoclastogenesis is crucial to develop therapeutics for bone-destructive inflammatory diseases. It is believed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation, and, therefore, glutathione (GSH), the most abundant endogenous antioxidant, suppresses osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by RANKL. Interestingly, GSH also contributes to inflammatory responses, and the effects of GSH on osteoclast differentiation and bone destruction under inflammatory conditions have not yet been determined. Here, we investigated how GSH affects inflammatory cytokine-stimulated osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in a mouse model of inflammatory bone destruction. We found that GSH significantly promoted TNFα-stimulated osteoclast formation, while an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, buthionine sulfoximine, suppressed it. GSH facilitated the nuclear localisation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) protein, a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, as well as the expression of osteoclast marker genes in a dose-dependent manner. N-acetylcysteine, a substrate of GSH synthesis, also stimulated osteoclast formation and NFATc1 nuclear localisation. GSH did not suppress cell death after osteoclast differentiation. In mouse calvaria injected with lipopolysaccharide, GSH treatment resulted in a fivefold increase in the osteolytic lesion area. These results indicate that GSH accelerates osteoclast differentiation and inflammatory bone destruction, suggesting GSH appears to be an important molecule in the mechanisms responsible for inflammatory bone destruction by osteoclasts.",Potential role of resveratrol-loaded elastic sorbitan monostearate nanovesicles for the prevention of UV-induced skin damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741053,Journal of liposome research,2019 03 07,"This study was aiming to improve the effect of the water-insoluble drug, resveratrol, by encapsulating it in surfactant-based elastic vesicles (spanlastics). Spanlastics (SLs) were prepared by thin film hydration method using different ratios of Span 60 (S60) and edge activators (EAs). The prepared SLs were subjected to full in-vitro evaluation. All the SLs showed improved properties compared to the drug suspension (p < 0.05). SL5 composed of S60: Brij 35 (7:3) attained the highest drug entrapment efficiency (79.10%±5.56), the smallest particle size (201.30 nm ± 2.45), the best in-vitro anti-oxidant effect and a fast drug release pattern, thus was selected for further investigation. Based on the Draize test, the selected spanlastics (SL5), as well as the drug suspension, showed to be safe to be applied on the skin (PII <2). In-vivo studies were done to test the photoprotective effect of the designed nanovesicles compared to the drug suspension. Evaluation was done based on visual examination and analysis of some anti-oxidant markers (CAT, GSH and SOD), anti-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8 and NF-κB) and anti-wrinkling markers (MMP-1 and GM-CSF) after UVB-irradiation. The drug showed a good prophylactic effect, however, that of SL5 was superior compared to that of the drug suspension as recorded by the level of all biochemical markers (p < 0.05). These results were also confirmed by histopathological examination. This study proves that elastic nanovesicles seem to be a promising approach to overcome the low drug solubility and to improve its efficacy.","Preimplantation embryos sex ratios in couples with four or more children of same sex, what should be expected from a preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycle?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741052,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 13,"Our aim was to assess the preimplantation embryos' sex ratios in couples with four or more children of same sex, undergoing sex selection for nonmedical reasons. We conducted a cohort-historical study of all consecutive patients admitted to the IVF-PGD program in a large tertiary center. We reviewed the computerized files of all consecutive women admitted to our IVF for sex selection for nonmedical reasons. Patients and their PGD cycle characteristics were compared according to the desired sex of their embryo and the mode of fertilization. Nine patients underwent a total of 19 PGD cycle attempts during the study period. Of the 77 embryos with complete molecular diagnosis, 41 revealed a male embryo and 36 a female embryo. Thirty-five percent of all the diagnosed embryos were of the desired sex. For couples desiring a boy, IVF cycles achieved a higher ratio of the desired embryonal sex compared to ICSI (52% vs 18.7%, p = .03). For couples desiring a girl, ICSI cycles had a higher percentage of the desired embryonal sex compared to IVF cycles (38% vs 23%). Moreover, 29.7% of ICSI and 40% of IVF embryos achieved the desired sex. In conclusion, PGD for sex selection results in a relatively low percentage (35%) of embryos demonstrating the desired sex. Nonetheless, selecting the mode of fertilization (ICSI/IVF) might improve the success rate. Further studies are required to explore the appropriate and cost-effective method for sex selection for nonmedical reasons.",Misoprostol combined with cervical single or double balloon catheters versus misoprostol alone for labor induction of singleton pregnancies: a meta-analysis of randomized trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741051,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 02 11,To compare the effect of misoprostol combined with a cervical single or double-balloon catheter versus misoprostol alone for labor induction of singleton pregnancies with an unfavorable cervix.,The risk of abnormal placentation and hemorrhage in subsequent pregnancy following primary elective cesarean delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741050,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 02 27,"We aimed to evaluate the relationship between mode of first delivery with subsequent placenta previa, placenta accreta/increta, and significant postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).",Biotin anchored nanostructured lipid carriers for targeted delivery of doxorubicin in management of mammary gland carcinoma through regulation of apoptotic modulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741049,Journal of liposome research,2019 03 07,"Mammary gland tumour has the highest incidence rate and mortality in women, worldwide. The present study envisaged a molecularly targeted nanostructured lipid carrier (NLCs) for doxorubicin (Dox) delivery capable of inducing cellular apoptosis in mammary gland tumour. NLCs were prepared utilizing Perilla frutescens oil (54-69% ω3-fatty acid) as liquid lipid to enhance entrapment of Dox through molecular ion pairing. Biotin decorated NLCs (b-Dox-NLCs) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The b-Dox-NLCs showed particle size of 105.2 ± 3.5 nm, zeta potential -35 ± 2 mV, entrapment 99.15 ± 1.71%, drug content 19.67 ± 2.6 mg.g-1, biotin content 5.85 ± 0.64 µg.g-1 and drug release 98.67 ± 2.43% (facilitated by acidic microenvironment) respectively. MTT assay and Flow cytometric analysis revealed higher anti-proliferative capability of b-Dox-NLCs to force apoptosis in MCF-7 cell line vis-à-vis marketed Dox, evidenced by reactive oxygen species level and mitochondrial membrane potential mediated apoptosis. Enhanced antitumor targeting, therapeutic safety and efficacy was exhibited by b-Dox-NLCs, as investigated through tumour volume, animal survival, weight variation, cardiotoxicity and biodistribution studies in 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene induced mammary gland tumour. Immunoblotting assay demonstrated b-Dox-NLCs downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins, i.e. bcl-2, MMP-9 while upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins, i.e. caspase-9, p16 and BAX. The experimental results suggest that biotinylated ω3-fatty acid augmented NLCs loaded with Dox are capable of inducing programmed cell death in mammary tumour and can be utilized as safe and effective delivery system with enhanced potential for mammary gland carcinoma therapy.",Impact of causal explanations for social anxiety disorder on stigma and treatment perceptions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741047,"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",2019 02 11,There is evidence to suggest that biogenetic explanations for symptoms of mental disorders have become increasingly popular.
