In addition to their widespread use as stand-alone affinity binding reagents in analytical chemistry, aptamers have been engineered into a variety of ligand-specific biosensors, termed aptasensors. One of the most common aptasensor formats is the duplexed aptamer (DA). As defined herein, DAs are aptasensors containing two nucleic acid elements coupled via Watson-Crick base pairing: (i) an aptamer sequence, which serves as a ligand-specific receptor, and (ii) an aptamer-complementary element (ACE), such as a short DNA oligonucleotide, which is designed to hybridize to the aptamer. The ACE competes with ligand binding, such that DAs generate a signal upon ligand-dependent ACE-aptamer dehybridization. DAs possess intrinsic advantages over other aptasensor designs. For example, DA biosensing designs generalize across DNA and RNA aptamers, DAs are compatible with many readout methods, and DAs are inherently tunable on the basis of nucleic acid hybridization. However, despite their utility and popularity, DAs have not been well defined in the literature, leading to confusion over the differences between DAs and other aptasensor formats. In this review, we introduce a framework for DAs based on ACEs, and use this framework to distinguish DAs from other aptasensor formats and to categorize cis- and trans-DA designs. We then explore the ligand binding dynamics and chemical properties that underpin DA systems, which fall under conformational selection and induced fit models, and which mirror classical SN1 and SN2 models of nucleophilic substitution reactions. We further review a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications of DAs in the chemical and biological sciences, including riboswitches and riboregulators. Finally, we present future directions of DAs as ligand-responsive nucleic acids. Owing to their tractability, versatility and ease of engineering, DA biosensors bear a great potential for the development of new applications and technologies in fields ranging from analytical chemistry and mechanistic modeling to medicine and synthetic biology.",Accurate many-body calculation of electronic and optical band gap of bulk hexagonal boron nitride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707213,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"Many-body perturbational GW approximation in conjunction with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) has been employed to calculate accurate electronic and optical band gaps of bulk hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in the two most important stacking configurations, AA' and AB. The carefully converged results revealed h-BN as an indirect material (indirect gap ≈ 6.1 eV) with a huge excitonic effect (≈0.8 eV) in perfect agreement with recent experiments [Nat. Photonics, 2016, 10, 262; Appl. Phys. Lett., 2016, 109, 122101]. The K-H region of the first Brillouin zone has been shown as the most important for lowest optical excitations in h-BN.

Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for these patients despite a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-mandated boxed warning about the heightened risk of death in patients with dementia treated with antipsychotic drugs. This boxed warning does not prevent clinicians from prescribing antipsychotics to patients with dementia. However, it serves as a heightened warning to prescribers to include the specific risks mentioned in the boxed warning in their discussion of risks and benefits of the proposed therapy with their patients or their patients' health care proxy and to document this informed consent conversation in the medical record. By documenting that the risks of the treatment, including those the FDA has deemed serious enough to include in a boxed warning, were discussed and accepted by the medical decision maker, the prescriber also reduces the risk of liability should an adverse event ensue."

Duration-specific peak average running speeds of European Super League Academy rugby league match play. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-This study aimed to quantify the duration-specific peak average running speeds of Academy-level rugby league match play, and compare between playing positions. Global positioning system data were collected from 149 players competing across 9 teams during 21 professional Academy (under-19) matches. Players were split into 6 positions: hookers (n = 40), fullbacks (n = 24), halves (n = 47), outside backs (n = 104), middles (n = 118), and backrow forwards (n = 104). Data were extracted and the 10-Hz raw velocity files exported to determine the peak average running speeds, via moving averages of speed (m·min), for 10- and 30-second, and 1- to 5- and 10-minute durations. The data were log transformed and analyzed using linear mixed-effect models followed by magnitude-based inferences, to determine differences between positions. Differences in the peak average running speeds are present between positions, indicating the need for position-specific prescription of velocity-based training. Fullbacks perform possibly to most likely greater average running speeds than all other positions, at each duration, except at 10 seconds vs. outside backs. Other differences are duration dependent. For 10 seconds, the average running speed is most likely greater for outside backs vs. the hookers, middles, and backrow forwards, but likely to most likely lower for 10 minutes. Hookers have possibly trivial or lower average speed for 10 seconds vs. middles and backrow forwards, but very likely greater average running speed for 10 minutes. The identified peak average running speeds of Academy-level match play seem similar to previously reported values of senior professional level.",Passive Heat Maintenance After an Initial Warm-up Improves High-Intensity Activity During an Interchange Rugby League Movement Simulation Protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707136,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 01,"Fairbank, M, Highton, J, Twist, C. Passive heat maintenance after an initial warm-up improves high-intensity activity during an interchange rugby league movement simulation protocol. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study examined using passive heat maintenance (PHM) to maintain core temperature after a warm-up and its effect on simulated first half running performance in rugby players. Thirteen male rugby players completed this randomized crossover study. Tympanic temperature was taken before a warm-up and then after a further 15 minutes of passive recovery either with (PHM) or without (CON) a PHM garment. Participants then completed 23 minutes of the rugby league movement simulation protocol (RLMSP-i). Differences in tympanic temperature were unclear between CON and PHM before (35.7 ± 1.3 cf. 36.0 ± 1.1° C; effect size [ES] = 0.20) and during exercise (34.5 ± 0.1 cf. 35.2 ± 0.1° C; ES = 0.26-0.35). High-intensity running (ES = 0.27) and peak sprint speed were higher (ES = 0.46-0.56) during the PHM compared with the CON trial. Time spent above 20 W·kg also increased in the first quartile of the PHM compared with the CON trial (ES = 0.18). All other between trial comparisons of performance were unclear. HRmean (ES = 0.38) was higher in PHM compared with CON, while differences in RPEmean (ES = -0.19) were unclear. There are small to large increases in high-intensity activity performed during a playing bout when rugby players wear a PHM garment after a warm-up. Rugby players should consider PHM during extended periods between a warm-up and starting a match.",Breakfast Omission Reduces Subsequent Resistance Exercise Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707135,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 01,"Bin Naharudin, MN, Yusof, A, Shaw, H, Stockton, M, Clayton, DJ, and James, LJ. Breakfast omission reduces subsequent resistance exercise performance. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Although much research has examined the influence of morning carbohydrate intake (i.e., breakfast) on endurance performance, little is known about its effects on performance in resistance-type exercise. Sixteen resistance-trained men (age 23 ± 4 years, body mass 77.56 ± 7.13 kg, and height 1.75 ± 0.04 m) who regularly (≥3 day/wk) consumed breakfast completed this study. After assessment of 10 repetition maximum (10RM) and familiarization process, subjects completed 2 randomized trials. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed either a typical breakfast meal (containing 1.5 g of carbohydrate/kg; breakfast consumption [BC]) or a water-only breakfast (breakfast omission [BO]). Two hours later, subjects performed 4 sets to failure of back squat and bench press at 90% of their 10RM. Sensations of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption were collected before, as well as immediately, 1 hour and 2 hours after BC/BO using 100-mm visual analogue scales. Total repetitions completed were lower during BO for both back squat (BO: 58 ± 11 repetitions; BC: 68 ± 14 repetitions; effect size [ES] = 0.98; p < 0.001) and bench press (BO: 38 ± 5 repetitions; BC: 40 ± 5 repetitions; ES = 1.06; p < 0.001). Fullness was greater, whereas hunger, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption were lower after a meal for BC compared with BO (p < 0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that omission of a pre-exercise breakfast might impair resistance exercise performance in habitual breakfast consumers. Therefore, consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal before resistance exercise might be a prudent strategy to help maximize performance.",Assessment of a Novel Algorithm to Determine Change-of-Direction Angles While Running Using Inertial Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707134,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 02 01,"Balloch, AS, Meghji, M, Newton, RU, Hart, NH, Weber, JA, Ahmad, I, and Habibi, D. Assessment of a novel algorithm to determine change-of-direction angles while running using inertial sensors. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The ability to detect and quantify change-of-direction (COD) movement may offer a unique approach to load-monitoring practice. Validity and reliability of a novel algorithm to calculate COD angles for predetermined COD movements ranging from 45 to 180° in left and right directions was assessed. Five recreationally active men (age: 29.0 ± 0.5 years; height: 181.0 ± 5.6 cm; and body mass: 79.4 ± 5.3 kg) ran 5 consecutive predetermined COD trials each, at 4 different angles (45, 90, 135, and 180°), in each direction. Participants were fitted with a commercially available microtechnology unit where inertial sensor data were extracted and processed using a novel algorithm designed to calculate precise COD angles for direct comparison with a high-speed video (remotely piloted, position-locked aircraft) criterion measure. Validity was assessed using Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement and mean bias. Reliability was assessed using typical error (expressed as a coefficient of variation [CV]). Concurrent validity was present for most angles. Left: (45° = 43.8 ± 2.0°; 90° = 88.1 ± 2.0°; 135° = 136.3 ± 2.1°; and 180° = 181.8 ± 2.5°) and Right: (45° = 46.3 ± 1.6°; 90° = 91.9 ± 2.2°; 135° = 133.4 ± 2.0°; 180° = 179.2 ± 5.9°). All angles displayed excellent reliability (CV < 5%) while greater mean bias (3.6 ± 5.1°, p < 0.001), weaker limits of agreement, and reduced precision were evident for 180° trials when compared with all other angles. High-level accuracy and reliability when detecting COD angles further advocates the use of inertial sensors to quantify sports-specific movement patterns.",Testing Specific Physical Performance in Male Team Handball Players and the Relationship to General Tests in Team Sports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707133,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 05 10,"Wagner, H, Sperl, B, Bell, JW, and von Duvillard, SP. Testing specific physical performance in male team handball players and the relationship to general tests in team sports. J Strength Cond Res 33(4): 1056-1064, 2019-Team handball is exemplified by frequent changes in intensities and different complex movements during games, whereas physical performance has often been tested predominantly using standardized general tests. The study aimed (a) to determine the relationship between specific and general physical performance as well as between specific aerobic capacity and agility, and (b) to ascertain the relevance of these tests for strength and conditioning professionals. Seventy-two male indoor court players performed a game-based performance test (GBPT) including team handball-specific techniques, upper-body and lower-body strength tests, a 30-m sprint test, a countermovement jump Abalakov (CMJA) test (with arm swing), and an incremental treadmill-running test. To assess the specific physical performance using the general test performance, we used linear regression calculations. In addition, a principal component factor analysis was calculated. Linear regression analyses revealed a low correlation (R < 0.5) between specific and general aerobic performance, 30-m sprinting time and specific agility in the GBPT, jump height in the CMJA test and jump height in the jump shot, as well as isokinetic shoulder rotation torque and ball velocity in the jump shot. However, a moderate correlation (R > 0.5) was found between specific aerobic performance and specific agility in the GBPT. Principal component factor analysis yielded separate components for specific and general physical performance with a cumulative variance of 69%. The results of this study clearly indicated that general and team handball-specific performance are separate components. Recommendations to strength and conditioning professionals and coaches in team handball were presented.",The Use of Telemedicine for the Postoperative Urological Care of Children: Results of a Pilot Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707132,The Journal of urology,2019 06 13,"For postoperative visits, which are often brief interactions between family and clinician, patients may prefer the convenience of receiving postoperative care from home.

Modern patient-specific management can often permit consistent restoration of elbow flexion and shoulder stability with the potential of prehension of the hand. Understanding the basic concepts of management of this injury is essential for all orthopaedic surgeons who treat trauma patients.",Donor-Specific Human Leukocyte Antigen Antibody Formation After Distal Tibia Allograft and Subsequent Graft Resorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707112,Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,2019 02 01,"The association between donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody formation and small bone allograft resorption has not been studied. We present the case of a patient treated for glenoid bone loss using a distal tibial allograft with Bankart repair who formed donor-specific HLA antibodies against the allograft and had subsequent graft resorption. X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed before and after surgery at standard checkpoints. Patient blood and serum samples were collected before and after surgery for HLA typing and HLA antibody testing. Human leukocyte antigen antibodies against the donor-specific HLA-A2 antigens were identified 6 weeks after surgery and were still detected at 5 months after surgery. At 6 months after surgery, a CT arthrogram revealed significant graft resorption. This case shows a temporal correlation between HLA antibody formation and clinical findings, potentially suggesting an association between HLA antibody formation and graft resorption. Further study is required to confirm this.",Path analysis for key factors influencing long-term quality of life of patients following a percutaneous coronary intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707110,Coronary artery disease,2019 02 01,This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the long-term quality of life (QOL) influencing of patients following a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as its influencing factors.,Transcription factor mutations as a cause of familial myeloid neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707109,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 02 13,"The initiation and evolution of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are driven by genomic events that disrupt multiple genes controlling hematopoiesis. Human genetic studies have discovered germline mutations in single genes that instigate familial MDS/AML. The best understood of these genes encode transcription factors, such as GATA-2, RUNX1, ETV6, and C/EBPα, which establish and maintain genetic networks governing the genesis and function of blood stem and progenitor cells. Many questions remain unanswered regarding how genes and circuits within these networks function in physiology and disease and whether network integrity is exquisitely sensitive to or efficiently buffered from perturbations. In familial MDS/AML, mutations change the coding sequence of a gene to generate a mutant protein with altered activity or introduce frameshifts or stop codons or disrupt regulatory elements to alter protein expression. Each mutation has the potential to exert quantitatively and qualitatively distinct influences on networks. Consistent with this mechanistic diversity, disease onset is unpredictable and phenotypic variability can be considerable. Efforts to elucidate mechanisms and forge prognostic and therapeutic strategies must therefore contend with a spectrum of patient-specific leukemogenic scenarios. Here we illustrate mechanistic advances in our understanding of familial MDS/AML syndromes caused by germline mutations of hematopoietic transcription factors.",Misactivation of Hedgehog signaling causes inherited and sporadic cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707108,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 02 13,"The Hedgehog pathway is critical for the development of diverse organs.

Food intake absence and excess are the two main types of energy malnutrition that predispose to the appearance of diseases in adulthood, according to the hypothesis of 'developmental origins of health and disease'. Epidemiological data have shown an association between early-life malnutrition and the metabolic syndrome in later life. Evidence has also demonstrated that nutrition during this period of life can affect the development of the immune system through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, epigenetics has an essential role in the complex interplay between environmental factors and genetics. Altogether, this leads to the inflammatory response that is commonly seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. In conjunction, DNA methylation, covalent modification of histones and the expression of non-coding RNA are the epigenetic phenomena that affect inflammatory processes in the context of NAFLD. Here, we highlight current understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental programming of NAFLD linked to epigenetic modulation of the immune system and environmental factors, such as malnutrition.","Coaching Efficacy, Player Perceptions of Coaches' Leadership Styles, and Team Performance in Premier League Soccer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707091,Research quarterly for exercise and sport,2019 03 04,"The coaching competency research has demonstrated the role of coaching efficacy and coaching behaviors on various athlete outcomes.

As the reliability associated with its measurement has not been reported, the aim of this study was to examine the test-retest reliability of segment KE measures in the golf swing. On two occasions, seven male golfers hit five shots with three different clubs. Body segment inertia parameters were estimated for 17 rigid bodies and 3D kinematic data were collected during each swing. The magnitude and timing of peak total, linear and angular kinetic energies were then calculated for each rigid body and for four segment groups. Regardless of club type, KE was measured with high reliability for almost all rigid bodies and segment groups. However, significantly larger magnitudes of peak total (p = 0.039) and linear (p = 0.021) lower body KE were reported in test 2 than in test 1. The high reliability reported in this study provides support for the use of analyses of segment kinetic energy.

Biomechanical studies have shown that throwing a fastball rather than a curveball results in greater elbow moments, despite some epidemiological studies and pitcher self-report indicating the opposite. This leads to the following question: Are biomechanical studies missing something that could explain this discrepancy? This study evaluated the association between elbow kinematics of baseball pitchers during the deceleration phase of the pitch and the elbow varus moment. Eighty-seven uninjured collegiate pitchers were analysed using 3-dimensional motion capture techniques. Results indicated that pitchers who remained in greater elbow flexion had greater post ball release elbow varus moments (EVMPBR) (p = 0.001). Regression analysis indicated that for every 10° of increased elbow flexion during follow-through the EVMPBR increased by 5.4 Nm for the fastball and 8.2 Nm for the curveball (p < 0.001). This suggests a concerning second stress on the elbow joint occurring during the deceleration phase of the pitch. The results showed that maintaining greater elbow flexion during the deceleration phase of the pitch can substantially increase the elbow varus moment after ball release (BR), especially when pitching the curveball. The results reinforce the need to emphasise appropriate pitching mechanics.",Impact of prehospital stroke code in a public center in Paraguay: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707084,International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,2019 02 01,"Prehospital stroke code activation results in reduced pre- and in-hospital delays and triage and transport of stroke patients to the right centers.

In this present study, a series of microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out in order to reveal the dynamic, atomic-level events which may contribute to the activation of these proteins via the binding of calcium ions. In addition to previously conducted in vitro and crystallographic studies, further suggestions have been made concerning the calcium binding features of these enzymes. The different systems used for running the simulations were based on the zymogen, computationally cleaved and even the activation peptide (AP-FXIII) free FXIII-A2' homodimer form. The effects of various ionic environments have also been explored in the simulations of FXIII-A2. Our results suggest that the presence of calcium ions can cause increased AP fluctuations, which ultimately could lead to their relocation on the homodimer surface. The release of these APs seems to be crucial for rotation of the A subunits based on equilibrium MD simulations. The primary evidence for this assumption comes from the predicted principal component eigenvector which is considered as the first, large-scale event of the overall activation process. To get a more accurate atomic-level description, the calcium binding sites of TG2 have also been investigated in our extensive in silico experiments, which suggests the presence of previously unidentified binding sites as well.

Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) activation has been shown to mitigate some of the deleterious tubular effects due to AKI, but its role on the renal vasculature has not been fully described. In this study, we investigated the effects of our novel CB2 receptor agonist, SMM-295, on renal vasculature by assessing cortical perfusion with laser Doppler flowmetry and changes in luminal diameter with isolated afferent arterioles. In this study, intravenously infused SMM-295 (6 mg/kg) significantly increased cortical renal perfusion (13.8 ± 0.6%; P < 0.0001; n = 7) compared with vehicle (0.1 ± 1.5%; n = 10) normalized to baseline values in anesthetized C57BL/6J mice. This effect was not dependent upon activation of the CB1 receptor (met-anandamide; 6 mg/kg iv) and was predominantly abolished in Cnr2 knockout mice with SMM-295 (6 mg/kg iv). Ablation of the renal afferent nerves with capsaicin blocked the SMM-295-dependent increase in renal cortical perfusion, and the increased renal blood flow was not dependent upon products synthesized by cyclooxygenase or nitric oxide synthase. The increased renal perfusion by CB2 receptor activation is also attributed to a direct vascular effect, since SMM-295 (5 μM) engendered a significant 37 ± 7% increase ( P < 0.0001; n = 4) in luminal diameters of norepinephrine-preconstricted afferent arterioles. These data provide new insight into the potential benefit of SMM-295 by activating vascular and nonvascular CB2 receptors to promote renal vasodilation, and provide a new therapeutic target to treat renal injuries that impact renal blood flow dynamics.",The assistance of coblation in arytenoidectomy for vocal cord paralysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707045,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 03 08,"There are many causes for vocal cord paralysis, which can cause difficulty in breathing in serious cases.

Methods: We reviewed the published pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) clinical data that report potential -or absence of- drug interactions between second-generation agents (SGAs) and CVD drugs most commonly used in cardiology, including antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants, statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and the antiarrhythmic drugs amiodarone and digoxin. We also reviewed the cardiovascular safety profile that has been published for each class of SGAs and side effects reported by patients with CVD. Results: Most relevant PK/PD data about SGAs and CVD drugs are based on small studies or detailed case reports. In many cases, the drug interactions are at most assessed in healthy volunteers so that the clinical relevance of findings needs further investigation in patients with CVD. Case reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions due to concomitant administration of certain drugs require careful consideration. The major cardiac side effects of SGAs include HR increase, postural hypotension and slight prolongation of the intraventricular conduction time and QT interval. On normal dosage of antidepressants, both advanced heart block and ventricular arrhythmias could occur in patients with severe heart disease, together with clinically important loss of myocardial contractile force. Conclusions: Data reported in the present review should help physicians about their decision-making processes that govern SGAs use in CVD patients.",Neurodegeneration and the Intersubjectivities of Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707041,Medical anthropology,2019 02 04,"Caring for a family member or friend with a serious health condition is a common feature of social life.

Abdominoplasty materials were divided into two equal parts from middle following excusion during the operations. Traditional SAL was performed to the right part of the abdominoplasty materials therewithal. Each side of the material was then divided into five parts enumarated from one to five and aspiration procedure time for each area was defined according to this ranking. The aspiration periods for each area were as follows: the transition intervals of 30 seconds between each zone were calculated as preoperative preparation time for surgical equipment in every area, and for discharging the lipoaspirates from collecting container. Red blood cell amount, a rate of degeneration in vasculary tissues, adipocyte cell amount with nuclear conformation, a rate of septal structure loss in fibroblast cells and septal fibroblast amount were the histopatological parametres of the study which observed and analysed by the pathologists. Based on the results of statistically analysis we proved that obtaining more surviving fat graft is possible by keeping aspiration period less than 2 minute in operation zone. In case of elongation of stated period clinical accomplishment of fat graft application reduces due to the downward of viable adipocyte cell amount and accelerating injury on tissues. Consequently, keeping the aspiration duration less than two minutes in planned liposuction area in both liposuction methods is favourable for providing maximum viable autologous fat graft.",Home Oxygen Therapy for Children.

DON contamination can cause a serious health threat to humans and farm animals. DON has been reported to exert significant toxicity effects on the male reproductive system. However, the causes and mechanisms underlying efforts of DON on sperm and testicular damage remain largely unclear. In the present study, we thoroughly investigated this issue. Eighty male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into a control group ( n = 40) and DON treatment group (2.4 mg/kg of body weight, n = 40). The ratio of testes and seminal vesicle to body, sperm survival and motility, and morphology of sperm and testis were observed in DON-treated and control mice. In addition, the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), and also the expression levels of JNK/c-Jun signaling and apoptotic factors such as caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bim, and Bid were analyzed and compared between the two groups. The results demonstrated that a single topical application of DON significantly increased the percentage of abnormal sperm and decreased the motility of sperm, indicating the sperms are damaged by DON. Additionally, the reduced relative body weight of testis and severe destruction of testicular morphology were observed. Moreover, the increased levels of ROS and MDA levels and decreased activities of SOD and GSH were found in testicular tissues, suggesting that oxidative stress is induced by DON treatment. Furthermore, DON upregulated the expression of stress-induced JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway proteins as well as JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation proteins. In addition, DON could enhance testicular apoptosis by increasing expression levels of apoptotic genes including Bim, cytochrome c, caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9. These results suggest that DON exposure can cause sperm damage, oxidative stress, testicular apoptosis, and phosphorylation of JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway. The underlying mechanisms may be that DON induces sperm damage by exacerbating oxidative stress-mediated testicular apoptosis via JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway.",Probing the Dynamics of the Imine-Based Pentafoil Knot and Pentameric Circular Helicate Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707020,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 29,"We investigate the self-assembly dynamics of an imine-based pentafoil knot and related pentameric circular helicates, each derived from a common bis(formylpyridine)bipyridyl building block, iron(II) chloride, and either monoamines or a diamine. The mixing of circular helicates derived from different amines led to the complete exchange of the N-alkyl residues on the periphery of the metallo-supramolecular scaffolds over 4 days in DMSO at 60 °C. Under similar conditions, deuterium-labeled and nonlabeled building blocks showed full dialdehyde building block exchange over 13 days for open circular helicates but was much slower for the analogous closed-loop pentafoil knot (>60 days). Although both knots and open circular helicates self-assemble under thermodynamic control given sufficiently long reaction times, this is significantly longer than the time taken to afford the maximum product yield (2 days). Highly effective error correction occurs during the synthesis of imine-based pentafoil molecular knots and pentameric circular helicates despite, in practice, the systems not operating under full thermodynamic control.",Analysis of Protein-Protein Interaction in a Single Live Cell by Using a FRET System Based on Genetic Code Expansion Technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707019,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 13,"Hsp70 is known to directly bind to Bax for suppression of apoptosis. However, mechanisms on how Bax is dissociated from its complex with Hsp70 during apoptosis remain largely unknown. In the current study, we developed the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system which consisted of Hsp70-YFP and fluorescent amino acid (ANAP)-incorporated Bax, which was generated by using genetic code expansion technology, and applied the FRET system to elucidate mechanisms on how apoptosis-inducing substances dissociate Bax from Hsp70. Time-dependent analysis of single live cell images showed that Bax activators binding to Bax trigger sites inhibited the Bax-Hsp70 interaction but a Bax activator, which blocks phosphorylation of S184 via binding to the C-terminal S184 site, did not affect this interaction. Additionally, an inhibitor for Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction blocked the Bax-Hsp70 interaction. Furthermore, p53 activators promoted the dissociation of Bax from Hsp70 by reactivating p53 which disrupted the Bax-Hsp70 interaction. We also found that death ligands and a Bcl-2 inhibitor enhanced the dissociation of Bax from Hsp70 by activating activator BH3-only proteins. Results from this effort suggest that FRET systems consisting of the ANAP-incorporated protein and the YFP fusion protein will be valuable tools to gain an understanding of other types of protein-protein interactions.","Regioselective Carbonylation of 2,2-Disubstituted Epoxides: An Alternative Route to Ketone-Based Aldol Products.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707018,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 02 13,"We report the regioselective carbonylation of 2,2-disubstituted epoxides to β,β-disubstituted β-lactones. Mechanistic studies revealed epoxide ring-opening as the turnover limiting step, an insight that facilitated the development of improved reaction conditions using weakly donating, ethereal solvents. A wide range of epoxides can be carbonylated to β-lactones, which are subsequently ring-opened to produce ketone-based aldol adducts, providing an alternative to the Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Enantiopure epoxides were demonstrated to undergo the carbonylation/ring-opening process with retention of stereochemistry to form enantiopure β-hydroxy esters.",Trithia-diborinane and Bis(bridging-boryl) Complexes of Ruthenium Derived from a [BH3(SCHS)]- Ion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707017,Inorganic chemistry,2019 02 26,"The field of diborinane is sparsely explored area, and not many compounds are structurally characterized. The room-temperature reaction of [{Cp*RuCl(μ-Cl)}2] (Cp* = η5-C5Me5) with Na[BH3(SCHS)] yielded ruthenium dithioformato [{Cp*Ru(μ,η3-SCHS)}2], 1, and 1-thioformyl-2,6-tetrahydro-1,3,5-trithia-2,6-diborinane complex, [(Cp*Ru){(η2-SCHS)CH2S2(BH2)2}], 2. To investigate the reaction pathway for the formation of 2, we carried out the reaction of [(BH2)4(CH2S2)2], 3, with 1 that yielded compound 2. To the best of our knowledge, it appears that compound 2 is the first example of a ruthenium diborinane complex where the central six-membered ring [CB2S3] adopts the chair conformation. Furthermore, room temperature reaction of 1 with [BH3·thf] resulted in the isolation of agostic-bis(σ-borate) complex, [Cp*Ru(μ-H)2BH(S-CH═S)], 4. Thermolysis of 4 with trace amount of tellurium powder led to formation of bis(bridging-boryl) complex, [{Cp*Ru(μ,η2-HBS2CH2)}2], 5, via dimerization of 4 followed by dehydrogenation. Compound 5 can be considered as a bis(bridging-boryl) species, in which the boryl units are connected to two ruthenium atoms. Theoretical studies and chemical bonding analyses demonstrate the reason for exceptional reactivity and stability of these complexes.",Lithiophilic Ag Nanoparticle Layer on Cu Current Collector toward Stable Li Metal Anode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707016,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Intractable hurdles of low Coulombic efficiency and dendritic Li formation during a repeated deposition/stripping process hinder the commercial use of  Li metal anode for next-generation battery systems. Achieving uniform Li nucleation is one of the effective strategies to address these issues, and it is of practical importance to realize this on a commercial Cu current collector that is lithiophobic. Herein, we design a nanostructured Ag lithiophilic layer on a Cu foil via an electroless plating process for a Li metal current collector. The deposition of lithiophilic Ag particles that are homogeneously distributed on the Cu foil can reduce the nucleation overpotential, realizing uniform Li nucleation and subsequently flat Li plating. As a result, a stable cycle stability of up to 360 h (1 mA cm-2) and an average Columbic efficiency of 94.5% for 100 cycles (1 mA cm-2) are achieved. Furthermore, CuAg full cells with LiFePO4 as a cathode exhibit good cycle performances and low polarization voltage. This approach provides another facile way for a stable lithium metal anode."

Private incentives to exclude generally exceed social incentives, as the insurer benefits from substantially lower negotiated hospital rates. Regulation prohibiting exclusion increases prices and premiums and lowers consumer welfare without significantly affecting social surplus. However, regulation may prevent harm to consumers living close to excluded hospitals.",Beyond Balancing: Rethinking the Law of Embryo Disposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707003,The American University law review,2019 02 27,"Actress Sofia Vergara became the center of a new round of conflict about the disposition of embryos created using assisted reproductive technologies (ART): the conflict about the difference that abortion jurisprudence should make to case law on ART. This Article argues that the history of abortion jurisprudence sheds light on the problems with the leading approach to embryo-disposition cases like Vergara's. In many instances, courts first look for a clear, binding agreement and look to a balancing analysis if no such agreement exists. As this Article shows, this is not the first time that courts have applied a balancing analysis to deal with clashing rights to seek and avoid genetic parenthood. The Article explores the history of two balancing approaches that have played a pivotal role in abortion law. These approaches have led to inconsistent results and cater to the prejudices of judges who are asked to weigh the relative merits of individual parties' views on reproduction. This Article recommends that states adopt legislation detailing the requirements of an enforceable embryo disposition similar to the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act (UPMAA). In the embryo-disposition context, states should require parties to disclose legal rights and responsibilities rather than only finances. These disclosures should cover the preservation, implantation, or destruction of the embryos and the financial and legal responsibility for any resulting child. States should enforce an embryo-disposition agreement if it is voluntary, if the parties had counsel or the opportunity to access counsel, and if the parties had a full disclosure of the constitutional and common law rights implicated by the agreement.",Metabolic Syndrome Interferes with Packaging of Proteins within Porcine Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707002,Stem cells translational medicine,2019 06 10,"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which shuttle proteins to recipient cells, promoting cellular repair. We hypothesized that cardiovascular risk factors may alter the pattern of proteins packed within MSC-derived EVs. To test this, we compared the protein cargo of EVs to their parent MSCs in pigs with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Lean controls. Porcine MSCs were harvested from abdominal fat after 16 weeks of Lean- or MetS-diet (n = 5 each), and their EVs isolated. Following liquid chromatography mass spectrometry proteomic analysis, proteins were classified based on cellular component, molecular function, and protein class. Five candidate proteins were validated by Western blot. Clustering analysis was performed to identify primary functional categories of proteins enriched in or excluded from EVs. Proteomics analysis identified 6,690 and 6,790 distinct proteins in Lean- and MetS-EVs, respectively. Differential expression analysis revealed that 146 proteins were upregulated and 273 downregulated in Lean-EVs versus Lean-MSCs, whereas 787 proteins were upregulated and 185 downregulated in MetS-EVs versus MetS-MSCs. Proteins enriched in both Lean- and MetS-EVs participate in vesicle-mediated transport and cell-to-cell communication. Proteins enriched exclusively in Lean-EVs modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation, as well as transforming growth factor-β signaling. Contrarily, proteins enriched only in MetS-EVs are linked to proinflammatory pathways, including acute inflammatory response, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cytokine production. Coculture with MetS-EVs increased renal tubular cell inflammation. MetS alters the protein cargo of porcine MSC-derived EVs, selectively packaging specific proinflammatory signatures that may impair their ability to repair damaged tissues.

Typically, heterologous systems are used to study them. Immature eggs (oocytes) of the South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis are considered an ideal expression system for such studies. These large oocytes have a low number of endogenous transport systems in their plasma membranes and highly express foreign mRNA; the oocyte plasma membrane is the default destination of integral membrane proteins that lack recognized organellar sorting signals. These features facilitate almost background-free characterization of putative plant membrane transporters. Here we describe how to isolate Xenopus laevis oocytes, prepare capped sense RNA (cRNA) of the maize boron importer TASSEL-LESS1 (TLS1) as an example, microinject the cRNA into the isolated oocytes, and functionally assess the boron import capabilities of TLS1 in an oocyte swelling assay. These protocols can be easily adapted to study other plant and non-plant transporters with putative import function. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",A review of screening tools for the identification of autism spectrum disorders and developmental delay in infants and young children: recommendations for use in low- and middle-income countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707000,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2019 02 09,"Without intervention, developmental delay (DD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) severely restrict children from reaching their developmental potential. Monitoring child development through the use of screening tools can help identify children who need further assessment or intervention. Screening has been widely encouraged to identify children with ASD or DD, and a large variety of screening instruments are suggested in the literature. There is a lack of consensus around which screening tools are most effective, especially where tools are used in cultures other than those in which they were created. We conducted a review of the literature for screening tools for DD and autism to make recommendations for tool selection and use in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We included 99 screening tools in the review and created profiles for each tool to evaluate their properties and determine which tools could be effectively used in various LMIC. Our review identified a substantial number (35 for DD and 6 for ASD) of screening tools from LMIC. We identified 10 tools which show promise for use across settings; these tools are brief, low-cost and can be implemented by paraprofessionals or lay community health workers. Routine screening is an important first step toward addressing the need for services in LMIC, but high-quality tools take time to be conceptualized, developed, piloted, and validated, before implementation can happen. A focus on improving the scientific rigor of early detection approaches and on enhancing the reach to underserved populations should be prioritized. Autism Res 2019, 12: 176-199 © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Screening tools are short questionnaires or brief assessments used to identify children at risk of a developmental disability such as autism. Many screening tools exist, but there is uncertainty about which tools work best in non-Western cultures or low-resource settings. We reviewed over 90 screening tools to identify which tools can be easily used in these settings. Selecting tools that are affordable and easy to use will make it easier to identify and support children with developmental difficulties.",Intranasal Administration of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Teeth Stem Cells Improves Motor Symptoms and Normalizes Tyrosine Hydroxylase Expression in the Substantia Nigra and Striatum of the 6-Hydroxydopamine-Treated Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706999,Stem cells translational medicine,2019 04 28,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. At present, there is no effective cure for PD; treatments are symptomatic and do not halt progression of neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the blood-brain barrier and represent promising alternative to the classical treatment strategies. In the present study, we examined therapeutic effects of intranasal administration of EVs derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth stem cells (SHEDs) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) medial forebrain bundle (MFB) rat model of PD. CatWalk gait tests revealed that EVs effectively suppressed 6-OHDA-induced gait impairments. All tested gait parameters (stand, stride length, step cycle, and duty cycle) were significantly improved in EV-treated animals when compared with 6-OHDA-lesion group rats. Furthermore, EVs slowed down numbers of 6-OHDA-induced contralateral rotations in apomorphine test. Improvements in motor function correlated with normalization of tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. In conclusion, we demonstrated, for the first time, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal administration of EVs derived from SHEDs in a rat model of PD induced by 6-OHDA intra-MFB lesion. Our findings could be potentially exploited for the development of new treatment strategies against PD.",Mitochondrial oxidative stress impairs contractile function but paradoxically increases muscle mass via fibre branching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706998,"Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",2019 04 23,"Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and muscle weakness occur in parallel in multiple pathological conditions.

The use of exome and genome sequencing in clinical care has expanded the reach and diversity of genetic testing. Regardless of the setting where genetic counselors are performing variant interpretation or reporting, most of them have learned these skills from colleagues, while on the job. Though traditional, lecture-based learning around these topics is important, there has been growing need for the inclusion of case-based, experiential training of genomics and variant interpretation for genetic counseling students, with the goal of creating a strong foundation in variant interpretation for new genetic counselors, regardless of what area of practice they enter. To address this need, we established a genomics and variant interpretation rotation for Stanford's genetic counseling training program. In response to changes in the genomics landscape, this has now evolved into three unique rotation experiences, each focused on variant interpretation in the context of various genomic settings, including clinical laboratory, research laboratory, and healthy genomic analysis studies. Here, we describe the goals and learning objectives that we have developed for these variant interpretation rotations, and illustrate how these concepts are applied in practice.",An examination of the factors contributing to the expansion of subspecialty genetic counseling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706979,Journal of genetic counseling,2019 06 04,"In recent years, genetic counselors have moved into increasingly varied areas of patient care. Yet limited information is known about how these genetic counselors transitioned from more general clinical practice to subspecialized practice. This study was designed to answer three research questions: (1) What common factors establish a need for a genetic counselor in a subspecialty setting? (2) How do genetic counselors in subspecialties establish their positions? (3) Once established, how do the positions of these genetic counselors evolve as the subspecialty expands? Phone interviews with subspecialized genetic counselors led to the development of an online survey distributed through the National Society of Genetic Counselors ListServ. Sixty-eight of the 144 initial participants met eligibility criteria for participation as subspecialty genetic counselors in a clinical role. Physician interest in hiring a genetic counselor, clinical need, genetic counselor interest in subspecialty area, and available genetic testing were commonly reported as contributing factors to position creation. Most subspecialty genetic counseling positions were created as new positions, rather than evolved from a previous position. Over time, subspecialty positions drew more departmental funding and included increased clinical coordination or administrative responsibilities. The results of this study can encourage genetic counselors to collaborate with their medical institutions to utilize their skill-set in diverse areas of patient care.",Dissociating the neural substrates for inhibition and shifting in domain-general cognitive control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706976,The European journal of neuroscience,2019 03 07,"Inhibition and shifting are two key components of domain-general cognitive control. Numerous studies have investigated the neural substrates of both components, but it is still unclear whether the relevant brain regions are specifically involved in one specific component or commonly engaged in both components. Here, we addressed this question by using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a modified saccade paradigm that was effective to disentangle inhibition and shifting in one experiment. The results showed that both the middle frontal gyrus and left parietal lobe were involved in both components but the middle frontal gyrus was more active for the inhibition while the inferior parietal lobe was more active for the shifting processing. The outcome suggests that, although both regions are engaged in inhibition and shifting, each plays a dominant role in one component. These findings provide a further insight into the neural dissociation in inhibition and shifting, as well as a better explanation on the framework of unity and diversity from a neuropsychological viewpoint.","""As Needed"" nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for infrequent atrial fibrillation episodes following atrial fibrillation ablation guided by diligent pulse monitoring: A feasibility study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706975,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,2019 06 06,"After atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended if stroke risk as assessed by CHA2 DS 2 -VASc score is high.

Dawson.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706974,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,2019 03 19,"Upon the death of Peter H. Dawson in 2015, mass spectrometry lost a major figure. Within the area of radiofrequency quadrupole electric fields applied to mass spectrometry, Dawson stands alongside its pioneers Wolfgang Paul, Nobelist and inventor of the technology, and Wilson Brubaker, who identified and overcame the deleterious effects of fringing electric fields on quadrupole mass filter performance. Seventy-one of Dawson's 97 scientific publications are concerned with quadrupole mass analysers, ion traps and monopole mass spectrometers. Of especial note are his book and review articles in which he disseminated information on the theoretical fundamentals and practicalities of these systems to a wider audience, thereby having a major impact on the development of this important field of endeavour. The scientific researches of Dr Dawson, and his advice and counsel, influenced to a major degree, and to the better, the research careers, teachings and the lives of the authors of this piece. Their combined researches on quadrupole devices led to the commercialization of the ion trap as a mass spectrometer by which mass spectral information became available at greatly reduced cost. Thus, the advent of commercial ion trapping instruments permitted a greater use of mass spectrometry in both technically advanced countries and those less well advanced. The greatest impact in health services was mass spectrometric analysis of environmental problems, well and stream water, food free of pesticides, etc., and forensic sciences. Our combined indebtedness to Dr Dawson is manifested by this appreciation of his scientific work, the highlighting of his main contributions, and creation of a substantive reference source to his work that can be used by other scientists. A comprehensive list of Dr Dawson's publications, including abstracts or summaries, has been arranged in chronological order of date of submission.","Wanted, dead and alive: Why a multidisciplinary approach is needed to unlock hair treatment potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706973,Experimental dermatology,2019 05 15,"Human recorded history is littered with attempts to improve the perceived appearance of scalp hair. Throughout history, treatments have included both biological and chemical interventions. Hair ""quality"" or ""perceived appearance"" is regulated by multiple biological intervention opportunities: adding more hairs by flipping follicles from telogen to anagen, or delaying anagen follicles transiting into catagen; altering hair ""apparent amount"" by modulating shaft diameter or shape; or, in principle, altering shaft physical properties changing its synthesis. By far the most common biological intervention strategy today is to increase the number of hairs, but to date this has proven difficult and has yielded minimal benefits. Chemical intervention primarily consists of active material surface deposition to improve shaft shine, fibre-fibre interactions and strength. Real, perceptible benefits will best be achieved by combining opportunity areas across the three primary sciences: biology, chemistry and physics. Shaft biogenesis begins with biology: proliferation in the germinative matrix, then crossing ""Auber's Critical Line"" and ceasing proliferation to synthesize shaft components. Biogenesis then shifts to oxidative chemistry, where previously synthesized components are organized and cross-linked into a shaft. We herein term the crossing point from biology to chemistry as ""The Orwin Threshold.""

The two metals were added to water samples collected from the Kalamazoo River and examined for bacterial abundance and leucine aminopeptidase activities at various time intervals over a 48 h incubation period in the dark. Results revealed no concentration effects on the bacterial populations in the presence of both Fe and Cu, although the bacterial numbers varied significantly over time in both microcosms. Conversely, leucine aminopeptidase activities based on post-hoc tests using Bonferroni correction revealed significant differences to increasing concentrations of both metals over the study period. These results further validate previous knowledge regarding the importance of various metal ions in regulating bacterial community structures and also suggest that aminopeptidase have the potential of effectively functioning using diverse trace and heavy metals as extracellular peptidase cofactors in aquatic systems.",Is bullying and teasing associated with eating disorders?

Some theories propose that language evolved to help meet the demands of managing complex social relationships. Examining the associations between sociality and communication in the great apes can help to identify the specific selection pressures that may have been important for language evolution. In particular, gestural communication is believed to be important because it is a relatively recent trait seen only in primates and particularly in the great apes. However, the extent to which more complex gestural communication plays a role in managing social relationships, as compared to less complex gestural communication, is not well understood. Using social network analysis, we examined the association between complex gesturing (indexed as repertoire size) and complexity of social relationships indexed as proximity (the duration of time spent within 10 m, per hour spent in same party) in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Repertoire size (the total number of gesture types a focal subject produced toward other individuals) and dyadic repertoire size (the number of gesture types produced toward the dyad partner, per hour spent within 10 meters) were positively associated with proximity at the level of the group (centrality in the proximity network) and the dyad (proximity duration between dyads), respectively. Further, the repertoire size of visual and auditory short-range gestures was positively associated with proximity, while the repertoire size of tactile gesture was negatively associated with proximity. Overall these results suggest that gestural repertoire size has important implications for maintaining social relationships in wild chimpanzees and more broadly that gestural communication may have played an important role in language evolution.","Alliance, technique, both, or more?

Dopamine and serotonin deficits might explain brain damage and progressive neuropsychiatric impairment in adult PKU patients. Ten early treated adult PKU patients (mean age 38.2 years) and 15 age-matched controls entered the study. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Phe, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were analyzed. Voxel-based morphometry statistical nonparametric mapping was used to test the age-corrected correlation between gray matter atrophy and CSF biogenic amines levels. 5-HIAA and 5-HTP were significantly reduced in PKU patients compared to controls. Significant negative correlations were found between CSF 5-HIAA, HVA, and 5-HTP and Phe levels. A decrease in 5-HIAA and 5-HTP concentrations correlated with precuneus and frontal atrophy, respectively. Lower HVA levels correlated with occipital atrophy. Biogenic amines deficits correlate with specific brain atrophy patterns in adult PKU patients, in line with serotonin and dopamine projections. These findings may support a more rigorous Phe control in adult PKU to prevent neurotransmitter depletion and accelerated brain damage due to aging.",Children with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa in a tertiary care pediatric eating disorder program: A comparative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706952,The International journal of eating disorders,2019 05 29,The purpose of this study was to examine the medical and psychological characteristics of children under the age of 13 years with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and anorexia nervosa (AN) from a Canadian tertiary care pediatric eating disorders program.,Needle-free pneumatic injection device; histologic assessment using a rat model and parameter comparison in predicting collagen synthesis degree.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706951,Lasers in surgery and medicine,2019 03 19,"Needle-free pneumatic injections have been recently introduced to the field of dermatology to inject such substances as hyaluronic acid.

Foam drainage is primarily governed by the flow of liquid in the channels and junctions that form between bubbles, which are known as Plateau borders (PBs) and nodes respectively. Existing theoretical work predicts the surface rheology of the PB and node air-liquid interface to influence liquid flow rates; however, direct experimental observations of this phenomenon remain scarce. This study recognises the clear need for a reproducible, accurate and standardised approach to directly studying liquid flow at the scale of a theoretically 'ideal' PB-node architecture. Measurements of PB geometric profiles and their apparent surface shear viscosities, μs, were made for an aqueous solution of Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) at varying PB lengths, l1, and liquid flow rates in the range 10 μl min-1 ≤ Q ≤ 200 μl min-1. Geometric profiles displayed previously unobserved transitions between PB relaxation and expansion towards the node, with expansion dominating under conditions approaching conventional foam drainage. Average values of μs in the PB relaxation regions showed virtually inviscid behaviour, with magnitudes of 10-8 g s-1 < μs < 10-4 g s-1 for l1 in the range 27.5 mm ⪆ l1 ⪆ 8.0 mm. Decreasing magnitudes of μs and degrees of shear thinning were observed with increasing l1. This was attributed to a compressibility of the interface that was limited by an SDS concentration dependence on l1. Numerical evaluation predicted the appearance of Marangoni forces that scaled strongly with liquid shear rates, and could therefore have been responsible for the apparent shear thinning behaviour.","A carbazole-functionalized metal-organic framework for efficient detection of antibiotics, pesticides and nitroaromatic compounds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706938,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 30,"Organic pollutants, such as antibiotics, pesticides, and nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), have posed a great threat to human health and sustainable development. Therefore, the detection of these organic pollutants is of great importance but challenging. In this work, we synthesized a rigid conjugated tricarboxylic acid ligand 4,4'-(9-(4'-carboxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)dibenzoic acid (H3CBCD), and employed this ligand to react with Cd(ii) ions to construct a Cd-LMOF, namely [Cd3(CBCD)2(DMA)4(H2O)2]·10DMA (Cd-CBCD). Cd-CBCD features a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular framework based on two-dimensional (2D) layer structures through ππ stacking interactions. The fluorescence sensing measurements demonstrate that Cd-CBCD can detect nitrofurans (NFs), 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCN) with high selectivity and sensitivity.

Here, we describe five new chorismatases, two of them members of a new subfamily, which has been discovered through correlation analysis of homologous protein sequences. The enzymes from the new subfamily produce exclusively 4-hydroxybenzoate, the same compound as produced by the structurally unrelated chorismate lyases. This showcase of convergent evolution is an example of the existence of more than one pathway to central building blocks. In contrast to chorismate lyases, however, chorismatases do not suffer from product inhibition (up to 2 mM 4-HBA), while the remaining kinetic parameters are in the same range; this makes them an interesting alternative for biocatalytic applications.",Correction: Multifunctional mixed valence N-doped CNT@MFe2O4 hybrid nanomaterials: from engineered one-pot coprecipitation to application in energy storage paper supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706935,Nanoscale,2019 06 07,"Correction for 'Multifunctional mixed valence N-doped CNT@MFe2O4 hybrid nanomaterials: from engineered one-pot coprecipitation to application in energy storage paper supercapacitors' by Clara Pereira et al., Nanoscale, 2018, 10, 12820-12840.",A mechanism study on the photocatalytic inactivation of Salmonella typhimurium bacteria by CuxO loaded rhodium-antimony co-doped TiO2 nanorods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706934,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 05 16,"This study presents the first report on the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism for a Salmonella typhimurium pathogen by visible-light active CuxO loaded rhodium-antimony co-doped TiO2 nanorods (CuxO/Rh-Sb-TiO2 NRs) under visible light irradiation (cutoff filter, λ ≥ 420 nm). Remarkably higher pathogenic inactivation of 4 log within 40 min by a CuxO supported Rh-Sb-TiO2 NR photocatalyst was observed. The visible light active photocatalyst mainly produced reduced Cu+ in the lattice of CuxO by charge separation. By this means, photo-generated electrons at the conduction band of Rh-Sb-TiO2 NRs play an important role in reducing Cu2+ to Cu+ through the photocatalytic reduction reaction (PRR), and at the valence band of Rh-Sb-TiO2 NRs, photo-generated holes generate OH˙ radicals through the photocatalytic oxidation reaction (POR). This Cu+ copper species is lethal to microbial pathogens. The inactivation mechanism for the Salmonella typhimurium pathogen was investigated by protein oxidation, HCHO production, and the API-ZYM system. To investigate the role of OH˙ radicals, t-BuOH and MeOH as hole scavengers were used in photocatalytic inactivation reactions. Our experimental results confirmed that the reduced Cu+ species play a major role in bacterial inactivation, while ROS have a major effect on the degradation of organic pollutants.",Transformable bubble-filled alginate microfibers via vertical microfluidics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706933,Lab on a chip,2019 05 02,"A novel buoyancy-assisted vertical microfluidic setup has been developed to fabricate a new class of transformable bubble-filled hydrogel microfibers.

This induced instantaneous gelation and produced bubble-filled calcium-alginate fibers. The surface-morphology of the resulting fibers was controlled from smooth to wavy by slowing down the gelation kinetics. The advantage of the buoyancy force acting on the fibers by the trapped air bubbles was taken not only to shape the fibers, but to transform them into several other novel hydrogel structures, such as water-filled segmented fibers, beaded microfibers, and threaded capsules. The ultimate transformability was demonstrated by the fibers being allowed to elongate and then undergo controlled destruction to produce uniform anisotropic micro-particles with a wide range of sizes and shapes from frustums to barrel and cylindrical types.",High photoresponsivity and broadband photodetection with a band-engineered WSe2/SnSe2 heterostructure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706932,Nanoscale,2019 02 15,"van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by stacking different two-dimensional layered materials have been demonstrated as a promising platform for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic devices due to their tailorable band-engineering properties.

Rheological characterizations reveal that the use of mixed-solvent media (e.g., DMAc/NMP with 1 : 1 in volume fraction, designated as 1 : 1 DMAc/NMP) leads to a substantial reduction in the solution viscosity while altering the fluid attribute from gel-like (G' > G'') to critical-gel-like (G' ∼ G'' ∼ ωn, with n ≅ 0.5). To gain insight into these peculiar rheological features, dynamic light scattering analysis of the representative 1 : 1 DMAc/NMP medium indicates that the fraction and mean hydrodynamic radius of the micrometer-sized cluster alter substantially, too. Multiscale static light/X-ray scattering characterizations further reveal that only the NMP and 1 : 1 DMAc/NMP media (and not the DMAc) are capable of producing hierarchical structures of the cluster interior that are beneficial to mesoscale ion conduction, as supported by ac conductivity measurements. Overall, the present findings suggest that an appropriate selection of mixed-solvent media may offer an exceptional opportunity to promote the rheological, structural, and ion-conduction properties of a polyelectrolyte solution beyond the reach of the corresponding pure-solvent media.",Enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of planar perovskite solar cells by perovskite cluster engineering using an interfacial energy modifier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706930,Nanoscale,2019 02 15,"The grain size and quality of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) films greatly affect the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

A cluster interfacial modifier, chlorobenzene (CB), is added to precursor solution. The modifier increases the interfacial energy between the precursor cluster and the solvent. The increased interfacial energy suppresses the nucleation and gives rise to HOIP films with large grains and high crystallinity.

The modulator is composed of strongly coupled double-layer graphene and double rectangle cross-sectional metal nanoribbons separated by three Al2O3 spacers, which are interpolated in a SiO2 waveguide. Owing to the unique strong coupling of HSPPs between metal nanoribbons, the subwavelength confinement, the in-plane electric field component, the light-graphene interaction, and the modulation effect of the modulator are significantly enhanced. The results show the proposed modulator achieves an outstanding performance with a modulation depth (MD) over 2.3 dB μm-1 and a small normalized mode area of ∼10-5 in a wide range of wavelength from 1.3 to 1.8 μm. By optimizing the separation of the double rectangle metal nanoribbons at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55 μm, the modulator exhibits a high MD of 3.12 dB μm-1, a small footprint of 1.8 μm2, an ultra-wide 3 dB modulation bandwidth of 380.23 GHz, and an ultra-low energy consumption of 29.39 fJ per bit. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a modulator based on two properly apart semicircular (rhombus) metal nanoribbons with a drastically enhanced MD of 11.3 (6.32) dB μm-1 at 1.55 μm.

However, very few studies are available on growth performance, microbial community, and the intestinal immune and inflammatory status in response to d- and l-aspartate (l-Asp). Thus, in this study, we mainly investigated the effects of dietary 1% d- and l-Asp on growth performance, inflammation, and microbial community in young pigs. Twenty-eight young pigs were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7): a control group, in which piglets were fed a basal diet, and other three groups, in which piglets received 1% d-Asp, 1% l-Asp, and 1% dl-aspartate (dl-Asp) for 35 days. The results showed that dietary 1% d-Asp significantly inhibited average daily feed intake and average daily weight gain. Gut microbes were tested and the results showed that l-Asp enhanced bacterial diversity (Shannon and Simpson). At the phylum level, l-Asp enhanced intestinal Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes abundance but decreased Firmicutes abundance. In contrast, dl-Asp decreased intestinal Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes abundance and increased Firmicutes abundance. At the genus level, d-Asp enhanced Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Intestinibacter abundance. Metagenomic predictions by PICRUSt suggested that the altered microbiota were mainly involved in membrane transport, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, replication and repair, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. In addition, dl-Asp markedly increased the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. Also, dietary d- and dl-Asp down-regulated TLR 4, NOD1, and MyD88 in the jejunum to mediate the inflammatory response. Collectively, these results indicated that dietary d-Asp and l-Asp affect the growth performance and inflammation in piglets, which might be associated with gut microbiota.","Synthesis of 9-borafluorene analogues featuring a three-dimensional 1,1'-bis(o-carborane) backbone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706915,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 12,"The synthesis of [1,1'-bis(o-carboranyl)]boranes was achieved through the deprotonation of 1,1'-bis(o-carborane) reagents followed by salt metathesis with (iPr)2NBCl2.

To determine the liver protective effect of Auricularia auricula melanin, mice were administered with the melanin once daily for 3 weeks before ethanol induced liver injury. Biochemical parameters of liver function, histopathological sections, mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant enzyme were compared between mice with or without the melanin administered. Results showed that A. auricula melanin was a eumelanin and the average molecular weight was 48.99 kDa. The melanin can protect the mice from ethanol-induced liver injury by extending the duration of the righting reflex, and shortening the duration of the recovery. The liver index, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in mice treated with the melanin were significantly decreased. At the same time, the levels of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and antioxidase such as catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased. Its protective effect may be related to the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream antioxidant enzymes such as glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), and NADP(H) quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). These results suggested that A. auricula melanin may be an effective strategy to alleviate alcohol-induced liver damage.",Valley polarization and ferroelectricity in a two-dimensional GaAsC6 monolayer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706913,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"Valley polarization and ferroelectricity are the two basic concepts in electronic device applications. However, the coexistence of these two scenarios in one material has not been reported. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the two-dimensional GaAsC6 monolayer which is a hybrid structure of GaAs and graphene has a pair of inequivalent valleys with opposite Berry curvatures and an intrinsic out-of-plane spontaneous electric polarization. It also has a direct band gap of about 1.937 eV and a high carrier mobility of about 1.80 × 105 cm2 V-1 s-1, which are promising for electronic device applications. The integration of valley polarization and ferroelectricity in a single material offers a promising platform for the design of electronic devices.","On/off fluorescence emission induced by encapsulation, exchange and reversible encapsulation of a BODIPY-guest in self-assembled organometallic cages.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706912,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"A dynamic guest-binding study of BODIPY-derivative 3 (3 = 1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) with two Cp*RhIII-based organometallic cages [Cp*6Rh6(μ-CA)3(tpt)2](OTf)61 (H2CA = chloranilic acid, tpt = 2,4,6-tripyridyl-1,3,5-triazine) and [Cp*6Rh6(μ-DHNA)3(tpt)2](OTf)62 (H2DHNA = 6,11-dihydroxynaphthacene-5,12-dione) have been demonstrated. While guest 3 displays a strong green fluorescence emission, the host-guest complexes 3⊂1 and 3⊂2 exhibit almost no emission. However, fluorescence emission can be again 'turned on' by adding coronene (4) or pyrene (5) into the solution of 3⊂1 and 3⊂2. Guests 4 and 5 show stronger binding affinities toward the organometallic cages 1 and 2 due to the strong electrostatic interactions between the electron-rich guest and electron-deficient tpt resulting in the displacement of 3 by 4 or 5, which eventually helps the fluorescence enhancement. Further guest-binding studies using a Job's plot experiment illustrate the formation of discrete 1 : 1 host-guest complexes which are also supported by 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The anion-exchange study with sodium chloride reveals that the chloride ion can effectively disassemble the host frameworks of 1 and 2 releasing the fluorescent guest 3 which can be again encapsulated into the cavity of reassembled cages promoted by the addition of silver triflate.",A stoichiometric CdS interlayer for the photovoltaic performance enhancement of quantum-dot sensitized solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706911,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"The CdS interlayer plays an important role as the seed layer and energy barrier in photovoltaic performance enhancement of CdSe quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). However, the CdS (CdS-CBD) interlayer is generally synthesized by the chemical bath deposition method (CBD) and suffers from excessive Cd2+ due to the poor controllability of interfacial chemical reactions. Here, we employed a sol-gel method to prepare a CdS interlayer (CdS-SG) with a stoichiometric ratio of Cd2+ to S2- on a TiO2 mesoporous photoanode and then fabricated CdSe QDSCs. A power conversion efficiency of 3.37% was obtained in the CdS-SG QDSCs (Cell-SG), which is higher than that of 2.64% in the CdS-CBD QDSCs (Cell-CBD) under AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm-2. Charge extraction measurements showed that the Cell-SG contained fewer trap states than the Cell-CBD. A comprehensive study of the electron dynamics based on open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements revealed that the stoichiometric CdS-SG interlayer significantly reduced the charge recombination and prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in contrast to the CdS-CBD interlayer in the QDSCs.",Phase selectivity triggered by nanoconfinement: the impact of corral dimensions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706910,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 15,"By using a novel protocol to spatially confine molecules in well-defined small 2D areas, the so-called nanocorrals, we show using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) how this kind of confinement affects self-assembled molecular network (SAMN) formation at a liquid-solid interface.

Detailed studies of the sample after different time intervals in the second crystallization with and without additional morpholine were carried out, which offered insight into crystal degradation and re-crystallization phenomena. The samples with different morpholine concentrations during the second hydrothermal treatment were also prepared, in which the sample with 80% MOR aqueous solution exhibited the smallest crystal size and the longest MTO lifetime. Furthermore, the investigation on the additional amount of mother liquor (from the first crystallization) required for the second crystallization showed that the presence of half the amount of the mother liquor (nutrients) could give us the required results effectively."

We present the results of an experimental investigation of tree frog attachment to rough substrates, and of the role of mechanical interlocking between superficial toe pad structures and substrate asperities in the tree frog species Litoria caerulea and Hyla cinerea. Using a rotation platform setup, we quantified the adhesive and frictional attachment performance of whole frogs clinging to smooth, micro-, and macrorough substrates. The transparent substrates enabled quantification of the instantaneous contact area during detachment by using frustrated total internal reflection. A linear mixed-effects model shows that the adhesive performance of the pads does not differ significantly with roughness (for nominal roughness levels of 0-15 µm) in both species. This indicates that mechanical interlocking does not contribute to the attachment of whole animals. Our results show that the adhesion performance of tree frogs is higher than reported previously, emphasising the biomimetic potential of tree frog attachment. Overall, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay of attachment mechanisms in the toe pads of tree frogs, which may promote future designs of tree-frog-inspired adhesives.","Temporal identity establishes columnar neuron morphology, connectivity, and function in a Drosophila navigation circuit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706848,eLife,2019 03 29,"The insect central complex (CX) is a conserved brain region containing 60 + neuronal subtypes, several of which contribute to navigation. It is not known how CX neuronal diversity is generated or how developmental origin of subtypes relates to function. We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.",Emergence of trait variability through the lens of nitrogen assimilation in Prochlorococcus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706847,eLife,2019 02 19,"Intraspecific trait variability has important consequences for the function and stability of marine ecosystems. Here we examine variation in the ability to use nitrate across hundreds of Prochlorococcus genomes to better understand the modes of evolution influencing intraspecific allocation of ecologically important functions. Nitrate assimilation genes are absent in basal lineages but occur at an intermediate frequency that is randomly distributed within recently emerged clades. The distribution of nitrate assimilation genes within clades appears largely governed by vertical inheritance, gene loss, and homologous recombination. By mapping this process onto a model of Prochlorococcus' macroevolution, we propose that niche-constructing adaptive radiations and subsequent niche partitioning set the stage for loss of nitrate assimilation genes from basal lineages as they specialized to lower light levels. Retention of these genes in recently emerged lineages has likely been facilitated by selection as they sequentially partitioned into niches where nitrate assimilation conferred a fitness benefit.",Promises and Challenges of the Type Three Secretion System Injectisome as an Antivirulence Target.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706846,EcoSal Plus,2019 05 01,"Antibiotic resistance is a major public health threat that has stimulated the scientific community to search for nontraditional therapeutic targets.

While many small-molecule lead compounds have been identified in whole-cell-based high-throughput screens (HTSs), only a few protein targets of these compounds are known; such knowledge is an important step to developing more potent and specific inhibitors. Evaluation of the efficacy of compounds in animal studies is ongoing.

In addition to changes in sex hormone levels associated with menopause, its timing is another predictor of future health outcomes such as duration of the presence of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the risk of hormone-related cancers. With ageing of the population, it is estimated that worldwide 1·2 billion women will be menopausal by the year 2030. Previously the effects of reproductive factors (e.g. parity, age at menarche, pregnancy) and socio-demographic factors on intermediate and long-term health outcomes of menopause have been widely documented. However, little is known about whether diet could have an impact on these. Therefore, we review current evidence on the associations of diet with menopause, presence of VMS and the risk of hormone-related cancers such as ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer. Dietary factors could influence the lifespan of the ovaries and sex-hormones levels, hence the timing of natural menopause. Few studies reported an association between diet, in particular soya consumption, and a reduced risk of VMS. Sustained oestrogen exposure has been associated with a higher risk of hormone-related cancers and thus high-fat and meat diets have been linked with an increased risk of these cancers. However, to better understand the mechanistic pathways involved and to make stronger conclusions for these relationships, further studies investigating the associations of dietary intakes and dietary patterns with menopause, presence of VMS and the risk of hormone-related cancers are required.",Preventative and medical treatment of ear disease in remote or resource-constrained environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706843,The Journal of laryngology and otology,2019 02 01,"Important ear problems can affect the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear.

Changes in acquisition parameters such as laser energy and detection rate are evaluated in terms of their effect on background noise, ionization state, hit-multiplicity, and thermal tails. Higher laser energy results in the formation of more complex molecular ions and affects the ionization charge state. At lower energies, background noise and hit-multiplicity increase, but thermal tails shorten. There are also correlations between the acquisition voltage and several of these metrics, which remain to be fully understood. The results observed when varying the acquisition parameters will be discussed in detail in the context of utilizing APT analysis of rutile within geology."

It remains one of the most common non-communicable chronic diseases and underlying risk factor for cardiovascular diseases worldwide. There are different underlying mechanisms that play a role in the development of pathologies associated with the disease such as hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress, obesity, inflammation and hypercoagulation. Each of which are interlinked. Hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress and obesity play a huge role in the activation of inflammation and coagulation. Activation of inflammatory pathways increases the production of thrombin which predisposes the development of thrombotic related diseases. One of the factors that contribute to the increase of thrombin is the impairment of the fibrinolysis process due to decreased expression of tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) by increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), a transglutaminase that is composed of subunits A and B (FXIII-A2B2), is essential for the last step of fibrin clot formation in the coagulation pathway. Genetic variation of FXIII-A in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alters the activity of FXIII, altering clot properties which influence disease outcomes. This review discusses the link between underlying mechanisms of T2DM, well known FXIII-A variants and coagulation.","Near Full-length Genomic Sequencing and Molecular Analysis of HIV-Infected Individuals in a Network-based Intervention (TRIP) in Athens, Greece: Evidence that Transmissions Occur More Frequently from those with High HIV-RNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706819,Current HIV research,2019 04 26,"TRIP (Transmission Reduction Intervention Project) was a network-based, contact tracing approach to locate and link to care, mostly people who inject drugs (PWID) with recent HIV infection.",Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Induced Hypertension: Role of Hypertension as a Biomarker in Cancer Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706818,Current vascular pharmacology,2019 02 01,"Cancer treatment is an area of continuous improvement.

Three current hypotheses of TKI-associated HTN are highlighted in this narrative review. These include nitric oxide decrease, a change in endothelin-1 levels and capillary rarefaction. Several studies have investigated HTN as a potential biomarker of TKI efficacy. HTN is easy to measure and adding this factor to prognostic models has been shown to improve specificity. HTN may become a potential biomarker in clinical practice involving treating advanced cancers. However, data are currently limited by the number of studies and knowledge of the mechanism of action.","Xenobiotic Metabolising Enzymes: Impact on Pathologic Conditions, Drug Interactions and Drug Design.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706817,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2019 04 24,"The biotransformation of xenobiotics is a homeostatic defensive response of the body against bioactive invaders. Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, important for the metabolism, elimination and detoxification of exogenous agents, are found in most tissues and organs and are distinguished into phase I and phase II enzymes, as well as phase III transporters. The cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes plays a major role in the biotransformation of most xenobiotics as well as in the metabolism of important endogenous substrates such as steroids and fatty acids. The activity and the potential toxicity of numerous drugs are strongly influenced by their biotransformation, mainly accomplished by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, one of the most versatile enzyme systems.","Design, Synthesis, Evaluation of Antimicrobial Activity and Docking Studies of New Thiazole-based Chalcones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706816,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2019 06 04,"Thiazole derivates as well as chalcones, are very important scaffold for medicinal chemistry.

We speculate that a common brain pathway is involved in these two behaviors. Hippocampus seems to control the signals coming from the external environment, while the amygdale and the hypothalamus control the response to social stimuli. Stimulation of amygdala increase sexual performace, while it triggers violent emotional responses. Stimulation of the hypothalamus causes reactions of violent anger and increases sexual activity. Catecholaminergic stimulation of the amygdala and hypothalamus increases emotional and sexual behavior, while serotonin plays an inhibitory role. Cholinergic inhibition suppress copulatory activity, while the animal becomes hyperemotive. Opioids, as β-endorphin and met-enkephalin, reduce copulatory activity and induce impotence. Gonadal steroid hormones, as estrogen in female and testosterone in male, play a major role in the control of sexual behavior. In addition, also non-ovarian hormones, as adrenal steroids, control sexual behavior, because adrenalectomy induces profound decrease in sexual activity in human and primate females, while androstenedione, as replacement therapy, is able to restore sexual receptivity in female.

Action potential generation in the peripheral nociceptor terminal and its transmission through various types of nociceptors corresponding to mechanical, chemical or thermal stimuli lead to the activation of receptors and further neuronal processing produces the sensation of pain. Numerous types of receptors are activated in pain sensation which vary in their signaling pathway. These signaling pathways can be regarded as a site for modulation of pain by targeting the pain transduction molecules to produce analgesia. On the basis of their anatomic location, transient receptor potential ion channels (TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPM8), Piezo 2, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), purinergic (P2X and P2Y), bradykinin (B1 and B2), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), neurokinin 1 (NK1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors are activated during pain sensitization. Various inhibitors of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPM8, Piezo 2, ASICs, P2X, P2Y, B1, B2, AMPA, NMDA, mGlu, NK1 and CGRP receptors have shown high therapeutic value in experimental models of pain. Similarly, local inhibitory regulation by the activation of opioid, adrenergic, serotonergic and cannabinoid receptors has shown analgesic properties by modulating the central and peripheral perception of painful stimuli. This review mainly focused on various classes of nociceptors involved in pain transduction, transmission and modulation, site of action of the nociceptors in modulating pain transmission pathways and the drugs (both clinical and preclinical data, relevant to targets) alleviating the painful stimuli by exploiting nociceptor-specific channels and receptors.",Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy and their Relation to Redox Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706779,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 04 11,"Redox homeostasis is important for the maintenance of cell survival.

However, in some cases, this process can become chronic , causing much harm to the body. Therefore, over the years, many anti-inflammatory drugs have been developed aiming to decrease the concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the organism, which is a way of controlling these abnormal chain reactions. The main target of conventional anti-inflammatory drugs is the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, but its use implies several side effects. Thus, based on these limitations, many studies have been performed, aiming to create new drugs, with new action mechanisms. In this sense, the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes stand out. Among all the existing isoforms, secretory PLA2 is the major target for inhibitor development, since many studies have proven that this enzyme participates in various inflammatory conditions, such as cancer, Alzheimer and arthritis. Finally, for the purpose of developing anti-inflammatory drugs that are sPLA2 inhibitors, many molecules have been designed. Accordingly, this work presents an overview of inflammatory processes and mediators, the current available anti-inflammatory drugs, and it briefly covers the PLA2 enzymes, as well as the diverse structural array of the newest sPLA2 inhibitors as a possible target for the production of new anti-inflammatory drugs.","Thioredoxin, glutathione and related molecules in tumors of the nervous system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706774,Current medicinal chemistry,2019 02 01,"Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors have a poor survival prognosis due to their invasive and heterogeneous nature, in addition to the resistance to multiple treatments.",Peptides 2020: A Clear Therapeutic Vision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706773,Protein and peptide letters,2019 02 19,,Foot-and-mouth disease virus O/ME-SA/Ind 2001 lineage outbreak in vaccinated Holstein Friesian cattle in Saudi Arabia in 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706772,The Veterinary quarterly,2019 04 24,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly contagious viral infection of large ruminants.

However, a general ability to implicitly learn visual-phonological associations (or cross-modal bindings) in children with reading difficulties (RD) has not been deeply explored. The present paper examined this issue in two studies comparing groups of children with RD with matched groups of control children in a working memory binding task involving sequences of variable combinations of nonsense shapes and nonwords (odd trials), as well as fixed combinations (even trials). Stimuli presentation was followed by a recognition test in which the nonwords were given one at a time and the children were required to mouse click on their respective shapes. In Study 1, fixed bindings were presented in random sequences across even trials, and the recognition test presented the nonwords at random. In Study 2, fixed bindings were presented in the same order across even trials, and the recognition test presented the nonwords following the same sequence order. In both studies, a consistent and strong learning effect of fixed bindings was observed for the control groups, with significantly better performance than the groups with RD. Such results suggest that poor cross-modal binding learning is associated with reading difficulties.

The signals obtained from a publicly available database, recorded from the abdominal surface during the second trimester, are used in this study. The signals are preprocessed and converted to shuffle and surrogate series to examine the source of multifractality. Multifractal detrended moving average algorithm is applied on all the signals. The presence of multifractality is verified using scaling exponents, and multifractal spectral features are extracted from the spectrum. The variation of multifractal features in term and preterm conditions is analyzed statistically using Student's t-test. The results of scaling exponents show that the uterine electromyography or electrohysterography signals reveal multifractal characteristics in term and preterm conditions. Further investigation indicates the existence of long-range correlation as the primary source of multifractality. Among all extracted features, strength of multifractality, exponent index, and maximum and peak singularity exponents are statistically significant ( p < 0.05) in differentiating term and preterm conditions. The coefficient of variation is found to be lower for strength of multifractality and peak singularity exponent, which reveal that these features exhibit less inter-subject variance. Hence, it appears that multifractal analysis can aid in the diagnosis of preterm or term delivery of pregnant women.",Multidisciplinary Care for Critical Limb Ischemia: Current Gaps and Opportunities for Improvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706755,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,2019 03 22,"Critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined as ischemic rest pain or nonhealing ulceration due to arterial insufficiency, represents the most severe and limb-threatening manifestation of peripheral artery disease.

A prospective study in the Danish diet, Cancer and Health Cohort.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706752,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2019 05 24,"Background: The cancer diagnosis is regarded as a stressful life event that is thought to trigger a teachable moment to induce health behavior changes among cancer patients. However, this may also hold true for their partners. We assessed if partners of cancer patients make more health behavior changes compared to persons whose partner remained cancer-free. Methods: Lifestyles was assessed in the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess health behavior change among partners of cancer patients (n = 672) compared to partners of persons who remained cancer-free (n = 5534). Additionally, associations in two subgroups were assessed: bereaved partners and partners of patients who remained alive after cancer. Results: Partners of cancer patients were more likely to decrease their alcohol intake compared to partners of persons who remained cancer free. This finding could mainly be attributed to bereaved partners. Moreover, bereaved partners were also more likely to decrease their BMI. In contrast to our hypothesis, bereaved partners were more likely to decrease fruit intake and increase sugared beverages compared to partners of persons who remained cancer free. In general, men tended to improve their physical activity, while women tended to worsen their physical activity following the cancer diagnosis of their partner. Conclusions: A cancer diagnosis in the partner does seem to improve health behavior change only for alcohol intake. Bereaved partners tend to worsen dietary behaviors after the patient's death.",The LhrC sRNAs control expression of T cell-stimulating antigen TcsA in Listeria monocytogenes by decreasing tcsA mRNA stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706751,RNA biology,2019 04 11,"The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes encodes seven homologous small regulatory RNAs, named the LhrC family of sRNAs. The LhrCs are highly induced under infection-relevant conditions and are known to inhibit the expression of multiple target mRNAs encoding virulence-associated surface proteins. In all cases studied so far, the LhrCs use their CU-rich regions for base pairing to complementary AG-rich sequences of the ribosomal binding site (RBS) of specific target mRNAs. Consequently, LhrC-mRNA interaction results in inhibition of translation followed by mRNA degradation, corresponding to the canonical model for sRNA-mediated gene regulation in bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that the LhrC sRNAs employ a different regulatory mechanism when acting to down-regulate the expression of tcsA, encoding a T cell-stimulating antigen. In this case, LhrC base pairs to an AG-rich site located well upstream of the RBS in tcsA mRNA. Using an in vitro translation assay, we found that LhrC could not prevent the ribosome from translating the tcsA messenger. Rather, the LhrC sRNAs act to decrease the half-life of tcsA mRNA in vivo. Importantly, LhrC-mediated destabilization of tcsA mRNA relies on an intact LhrC binding site near the 5´-end of the tcsA mRNA and occurs independently of translation. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative mechanism for LhrC-mediated control in L. monocytogenes that relies solely on sRNA-induced degradation of a target mRNA.",Effects of prophylactic antibiotics before peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation on the clinical outcomes of peritoneal dialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706749,Renal failure,2019 02 19,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) related infections, such as peritonitis, are still the main obstacle for the development of PD.

Because romantic partners' coping efforts are intimately connected, the way one partner copes with the other's miscarriage has important implications for individual and relational well-being. Grounded in the communicated sense-making (CSM) model, the current study investigated how cis-gender men in heterosexual marriages (n = 45) communicatively constructed the meaning of their wife's miscarriage through metaphors. Analysis of interview data revealed two supra-themes-metaphors of miscarriage and metaphors of men's role as a husband. Metaphors of lost gift, cataclysm, death of a loved one, emptiness, and chaotic movement animated husbands' CSM about their wife's miscarriage. Men drew upon discourses of masculinity to make sense of their role as a husband in the miscarriage process as a rock, guard, repair man, and secondary character. We explore these findings in light of the master narrative of birth and propose an expansion of the CSM model to include metaphors as a key CSM device.",Intervene: Modeling Pro-Social Bystander Behavior in College Students through Online Video.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706733,Health communication,2019 02 01,"This study evaluates the impact of a theory- and empirical evidence- based 20-minute video, Intervene, on college students' intentions to intervene on behalf of others in multiple problematic situations: an alcohol emergency, emotional distress, hazing, intimate partner violence, racial bias, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. A randomized controlled trial of undergraduate and graduate students (N = 1,243) was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the video as an intervention for increasing students' self-reported likelihood to engage in pro-social bystander behavior across these various situations. Results showed that participants who viewed the video online reported higher likelihood at 4 weeks post-viewing to intervene in situations involving hazing, intimate partner violence, racial bias, and sexual harassment than did their control group counterparts. Intervene is the first video-based bystander education intervention shown to be effective, even 4 weeks after viewing, at increasing college students' self-reported likelihood to intervene in multiple problematic social situations.

The present study explored the developmental hematotoxic and immunotoxic properties of aluminum sulfate (AS) in rats' offspring. Methods: Forty female offspring (10 rats each) were given three incremental AS doses plus a control group, from conception through lactation and after weaning until reached eight weeks old (near adults). Spleen relative weights along with total and differential blood counts were evaluated. Spectroscopic Al levels in spleen and brain were analyzed. Three immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgE) and two cytokines, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, were measured through the ELISA technique. Results: The results revealed a significant relative increase in splenic weights mostly observed in the highest AS dose treated group. Reduction in the total leukocytic count was noticed in the three AS treated groups with relative lymphocytosis. Additionally, a significant decline in RBCs counts and hemoglobin concentrations were recorded. Tumor necrosis factor-α was significantly elevated in the three Al treated groups, while, interferon- γ showed a non-significant reduction compared to the control group. A significant increment in IgG and decline in IgE concentrations with no change in IgM level among groups were observed. Conclusion: Perinatal AS exposure caused mostly non-linear dose-dependent hematotoxicity and immunological impairment especially for the acquired immunity either cellular or humoral. Further studies can examine the immunotoxic effect of Al on male offspring during different stages of immune development.","Pioglitazone: The forgotten, cost-effective cardioprotective drug for type 2 diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706731,Diabetes & vascular disease research,2019 04 24,"Type 2 diabetes individuals are at high risk for macrovascular complications: myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated that agents in two antidiabetic classes (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists) reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. However, there is strong evidence that an older and now generically available medication, the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, can retard the atherosclerotic process (PERISCOPE and Chicago) and reduce cardiovascular events in large randomized prospective cardiovascular outcome trials (IRIS and PROactive). Pioglitazone is a potent insulin sensitizer, preserves beta-cell function, causes durable reduction in HbA1c, corrects multiple components of metabolic syndrome and improves nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adverse effects (weight gain, fluid retention, fractures) must be considered, but are diminished with lower doses and are arguably outweighed by these multiple benefits. With healthcare expenses attributable to diabetes increasing rapidly, this cost-effective drug requires reconsideration in the therapeutic armamentarium for the disease.",Studying the efficacy of a new radical treatment for acne vulgaris using a surgical technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706730,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 05 01,"Despite the numerous treatments available for acne vulgaris, not all are efficacious, and many patients experience psychological distress and various side effects from medications used to treat this condition.

Recently, entrustment has been highlighted as an essential element of trainee-supervisor interactions. Despite the growing body of knowledge concerning entrustment in medical education, how supervisors conceptualize the oral case presentation as a contributor to entrustment decision making during clinical supervision remains unknown. Given their widespread use, oral case presentations may represent a potential tool for future frameworks of workplace-based assessment. This study sought to explore what factors influence supervisors' expectations of oral case presentation content and how the oral case presentation may contribute to entrustment decision making. Approach: Using qualitative methodology, semistructured interviews were conducted from a purposive sample of attending emergency medicine physicians at an academic medical center from 2015 to 2016. Thematic analysis of the semistructured interview transcripts was conducted by 2 investigators using line-by-line coding and constant comparative analysis. Key themes were identified through consensus. Theoretical sampling occurred until thematic saturation was reached. Findings: Twenty-one attending physicians were interviewed. Four factors were found to influence supervisor expectations pertaining to oral case presentation content (trainee level, trainee familiarity, clinical context, and clinical task). Further, the oral case presentation was found to serve as a means of indirect observation and an entrustment check point informing future decisions relating to trainee supervision. Insights: The oral case presentation represents a core activity within the trainee-supervisor relationship in which entrustment plays a central role. Given the numerous factors influencing oral case presentation content, we caution supervisors against relying solely on the oral case presentation as an entrustment check point, as this may lead to inaccurate judgments of trainee competence. We recommend that the oral case presentation be used in conjunction with other means of direct and indirect observation to assist with entrustment decisions relating to trainee supervision.","Patients of Our Own: Defining ""Ownership"" of Clinical Care in Graduate Medical Education.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706725,Teaching and learning in medicine,2019 02 01,"Phenomenon: Learning to assume ownership of patient care is a critical objective of medical training. However, little is known about how ownership is best defined and measured or about its value to trainees. The authors aimed to define ownership and elucidate the significance of developing ownership skills over the course of pediatric residency training. Approach: Focus groups and phone interviews were held with pediatric residency program directors (N = 18) and pediatric residents (N = 14). Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Program directors and residents characterized ownership as essential to good patient care. Ownership was defined as including personal responsibility, a connection to patients/families, and follow-up and follow-through. For many, ownership was most conspicuous in its absence. Respondents found meaning in their work when exerting ownership and lack of ownership was linked to burnout and frustration. Ownership was recognized as a critical skill that requires development during training to form a professional identity, avoid burnout, become an independent practitioner and function as an integral member of medical teams. Insights: Pediatric residents and faculty considered ownership a cornerstone of patient care and critical to forming a professional identity. The defining characteristics of patient care ownership-personal responsibility, connections with patients and families, and continuity of care-can be used to develop an instrument to assess trainee development of ownership. These findings reinforce the value of ownership in graduate medical education and support creating curricular interventions to foster ownership."

Recent studies have identified an important role for celastrol, a proteasome inhibitor isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F., in obesity-related metabolic disorders. However, the exact influences of celastrol on lipid metabolism remain largely unknown. Celastrol inhibited the terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and decreased the levels of triglycerides in wild-type mice. Lipidomics analysis revealed that celastrol increased the metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Further, celastrol reversed the tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia induced associated with increased plasma LPCs, PCs, SMs, and ceramides (CMs). Among these lipids, LPC(16:0), LPC(18:1), PC(22:2/15:0), and SM(d18:1/22:0) were also decreased by celastrol in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mice, and tyloxapol-treated mice. The mRNAs encoded by hepatic genes associated with lipid synthesis and catabolism, including Lpcat1, Pld1, Smpd3, and Sptc2, were altered in tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, and significantly recovered by celastrol treatment. The effect of celastrol on lipid metabolism was significantly reduced in Fxr-null mice, resulting in decreased Cers6 and Acer2 mRNAs compared to wild-type mice. These results establish that FXR was responsible in part for the effects of celastrol in controlling lipid metabolism and contributing to the recovery of aberrant lipid metabolism in obesity-related metabolic disorders.",Mechanistic Understanding of Cu-CHA Catalyst as Sensor for Direct NH3-SCR Monitoring: The Role of Cu Mobility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706712,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"The concept to utilize a catalyst directly as a sensor is fundamentally and technically attractive for a number of catalytic applications, in particular, for the catalytic abatement of automotive emission. Here, we explore the potential of microporous copper-exchanged chabazite (Cu-CHA, including Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34) zeolite catalysts, which are used commercially in the selective catalytic reduction of automotive nitrogen oxide emission by NH3 (NH3-SCR), as impedance sensor elements to monitor directly the NH3-SCR process. The NH3-SCR sensing behavior of commercial Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34 catalysts at typical reaction temperatures (i.e., 200 and 350 °C) was evaluated according to the change of ionic conductivity and was mechanistically investigated by complex impedance-based in situ modulus spectroscopy. Short-range (local) movement of Cu ions within the zeolite structure was found to determine largely the NH3-SCR sensing behavior of both catalysts. Formation of NH3-solvated, highly mobile CuI species showed a predominant influence on the ionic conductivity of both catalysts and, consequently, hindered NH3-SCR sensing at 200 °C. Density functional theory calculations over a model Cu-SAPO-34 system revealed that CuII reduction to CuI by coadsorbed NH3 and NO weakened significantly the coordination of the Cu site to the CHA framework, enabling high mobility of CuI species that influences substantially the NH3-SCR sensing. The in situ spectroscopic and theoretical investigations not only unveil the mechanisms of Cu-CHA catalyst as sensor elements for direct NH3-SCR monitoring but also allow us to get insights into the speciation of active Cu sites in NH3-SCR under different reaction conditions with varied temperatures and gas compositions.",Substrate-Controlled Direct α-Stereoselective Synthesis of Deoxyglycosides from Glycals Using B(C6F5)3 as Catalyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706711,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 18,"B(C6F5)3 enables the metal-free unprecedented substrate-controlled direct α-stereoselective synthesis of deoxyglycosides from glycals. 2,3-Unsaturated α- O-glycoside products are obtained with deactivated glycals at 75 °C in the presence of the catalyst, while 2-deoxyglycosides are formed using activated glycals that bear no leaving group at C-3 at lower temperatures.

Here, we demonstrate all-printed devices with high detectivity (∼1012 cm Hz1/2/W) and a cut-off frequency of >3 kHz. The low material consumption (<0.3 mg per detector) and short processing time (14 s per detector) enabled by the automated printing promises extremely low device costs. To enable all-printed devices, an ink formulation was developed based on nanocrystals stabilized by perovskite-like methylammonium iodobismuthate ligands, which are dispersed in a ternary solvent. Fully inkjet printed devices based on this solvent were achieved with printed silver electrodes and a ZnO interlayer. Considerable improvements were obtained by the addition of small amounts of the polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) to the ink. The polymer improved the colloidal stability of the ink and its film-formation properties and thus enabled the scalable printing of single detectors and detector arrays. While photoconductors were shown here, the developed ink will certainly find application in a series of further electronic devices based on nanocrystals from a broad range of materials.",Triacylglycerol Composition of Breast Milk during Different Lactation Stages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706708,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 08,"Triacylglycerol (TAG) composition of breast milk plays an important role in improving digestion, absorption, and metabolism when consumed by infants. This study characterized the TAG profile of human colostrum, transitional, and mature milk samples from 103 women.

The TAGs with high molecular weight and unsaturated fatty acid (such as 1,3-olein-2-palmitin (OPO) and 1(3)-olein-2-palmitin-3(1)-linolein (OPL)) were enriched in colostrum, while the TAGs containing medium-chain fatty acids were more abundant in transitional and mature milk than that in colostrum. Of note, OPL was the most common TAG in breast milk of Chinese women while the most common TAG in breast milk of Western women was OPO. This data will promote the development of infant formulas in terms of the TAG composition more suitable for infants.",Bifunctional Etalon-Electrode To Realize High-Performance Color Filter Free Image Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706707,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"Organic photodiodes (OPDs), based on organic semiconductors with high absorption coefficients for visible light, are emerging as potential candidates for replacing silicon photodiodes in image sensors, particularly due to the possibility of realizing a thin thickness and exclusion of color filters, both of which can contribute to a dramatically enhanced degree of integration for image sensors. Despite years of research, techniques have not yet been developed that allow the OPD itself to have color selectivity while maintaining a thin (<1 μm) OPD thickness, in combination with a sufficiently high detectivity (>1012 cm·Hz0.5/W). To solve this issue, we introduce a concept of ""etalon-electrode"", which can perform the function of electrode and simultaneously the function of selective wavelength transparency. A strategically designed OPD architecture consisting of an etalon-electrode, a panchromatic organic active layer, and a counter electrode displays well-defined narrowband R-/G-/B-selective detectivity spectra depending on precision-adjusted thickness composition of the etalon-electrode. While a thin thickness of OPD is preserved at less than 800 nm including electrodes, active layer, and other buffer layers for all R-/G-/B-selective OPDs, high average detectivity values over 1012 cm·Hz0.5/W are demonstrated. Furthermore, the characteristic of imparting color selectivity by the etalon-electrode enables a more facile full color patterning, such that a prototype of a 10 × 10 image sensor with a pixel pitch of 500 μm is realized, resulting in accurate picturing of a well-defined full color image.","Fully ""Erase-free"" Multi-Bit Operation in HfO2-Based Resistive Switching Device.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706706,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Fully ""Erase-free"" multi-bit operation was demonstrated in a W/HfO2/TiN-stacked resistive switching device. The term Erase-free means that a digital state in a multi-bit operation can be achieved without initializing the device resistance state when the device moves to another digital state. Because initializing the resistance state of a resistive switching device causes high energy consumption, omitting this sequence can achieve energy efficient multi-bit operation during rewriting of the resistance state of the device. Experimentally, an operational energy savings of up to 75% was confirmed. For stable and reliable Erase-free operation, several prerequisites are required, such as gradual resistance change with electric pulse stimuli during both writing and erasing, predictable operational voltages for certain resistance states, and high reliability of resistive switching. These prerequisites could be achieved by adopting a W top electrode in a W/HfO2/TiN-stacked resistive switching device. These results can pave the way to future nonvolatile memory applications.","Degradation of Cadmium Yellow Paint: New Evidence from Photoluminescence Studies of Trap States in Picasso's Femme ( Époque des ""Demoiselles d'Avignon"").",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706704,Analytical chemistry,2019 03 05,"Paints based on cadmium sulfide (CdS) were popular among artists beginning in the mid-19th century. Some paint formulations are prone to degrade, discoloring and disfiguring paintings where they have been used. Pablo Picasso's Femme (Époque des ""Demoiselles d'Avignon"") (1907) includes two commercial formulations of CdS: one is visibly degraded and now appears brownish yellow, while the other appears relatively intact and is vibrant yellow. This observation inspired the study reported here of the photoluminescence emission from trap states of the two CdS paints, complemented by data from multispectral imaging, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, micro-FTIR, and SEM-EDS. The two paints exhibit trap state emissions that differ in terms of spectrum, intensity, and decay kinetics. In the now-brownish yellow paint, trap state emission is highly favored with respect to near band edge optical recombination. This observation suggests a higher density of surface defects in the now-brownish yellow paint that promotes the surface reactivity of CdS particles and their subsequent paint degradation. CdS is a semiconductor, and surface defects in semiconductors can trap free charge carriers; this interaction becomes stronger at reduced particle size or, equivalently, with increased surface to volume ratio. Here, we speculate that the strong trap state emission in the now-brownish cadmium yellow paint is linked to the presence of CdS particles with a nanocrystalline phase, possibly resulting from a low degree of calcination during pigment synthesis. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate how photoluminescence studies can probe surface defects in CdS paints and lead to an improved understanding of their complex degradation mechanisms.",Room-Temperature Synthesis of Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanosheet-Stabilized CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706703,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 08,"Poor stability always restricts the application of all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (PQDs).

Accurate nodal staging for NSCLC correlates with improved survival, but it is unclear whether tumors with VPI require a more extensive lymph nodes (LNs) dissection to optimize survival. We aimed to evaluate the impact of VPI status on the optimal extent of LNs dissection in stage I NSCLC, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We identified 9297 surgically treated T1-2aN0M0 NSCLC patients with at least one examined LNs. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance the baseline clinicopathologic characteristics between the VPI group and non-VPI group. Log-rank tests along with Cox proportional hazards regression methods were performed to evaluate the impact of extent of LNs dissection on survival. VPI was correlated with a significant worse survival, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between PL1 and PL2. Patients who underwent sublobectomy had slightly decreased survival than those who underwent lobectomy. Pathologic LNs examination was significantly correlated with survival. Examination of 7-8 LNs and 14-16 LNs conferred the lowest hazard ratio for T1-sized/non-VPI tumors (stage IA) and T1-sized/VPI tumors (stage IB), respectively. The optimal extent of LNs dissection varied by VPI status, with T1-sized/VPI tumors (stage IB) requiring a more extensive LNs dissection than T1-sized/non-VPI tumors (stage IA).

Characterizations reveal improved film formation with the dynamic process due to the ""retainment"" of DMSO-complex necessary for the intermediate phase which i) promotes intercalation between precursors and ii) slows down perovskite crystallization for full conversion. The comparison on as-deposited perovskite before annealing indicates a more ordered film using this dynamic process. This results in a thicker, more uniform film with higher degree of preferred crystal orientation and higher carrier lifetime after annealing. Therefore, dynamic-processed devices present better performance repeatability, achieving a higher average efficiency of 17.0% compared to static ones (15.0%). The new insights provided by this work are important for perovskite solar cells processed sequentially as the process has greater flexibility in resolving solvent incompatibility, allowing separate optimizations and allowing different deposition methods.",Diabetes mellitus and survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients after surgery: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706684,Thoracic cancer,2019 03 05,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities in surgically treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and has a negative impact on short-term outcomes.

Current data show that childhood obesity is no longer just a concern for developed countries, but more significantly affecting developing countries. In adult population, cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality and morbidity among obese patients. It is therefore believed that risk factors found in adult patients could also be observed in obese youth. These risk factors will then persist and become progressively worse if obese youth remain obese as they reach adulthood. However, risk reduction is achievable through various prevention and management strategies of obesity and obese children who become nonobese in adulthood have a significant reduction in their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. New biomarkers to improve risk assessment in obese youth are an open research field, which will eventually lead to a more targeted approach in prevention and treatment. Nevertheless, there is still a need for continuous research in understanding the roles of these biomarkers and their potential in risk prediction. Cardiovascular risk modification of childhood obesity depends on a more concerted effort among the various parties involved and particularly a global collaboration to stop the rising prevalence of the epidemic in developing countries.",The protective role of rs56103835 against breast cancer onset in the Iranian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706682,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2019 05 08,"Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women and the highest cause of death due to cancer among women aged 40-45.

Part C, Seminars in medical genetics",2019 02 01,"In some parts of the world, prenatal screening using analysis of circulating cell-free (cf) DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has become part of routine prenatal care with limited professional guidelines and without significant input from the Turner syndrome community. In contrast to the very high positive predictive values (PPVs) achieved with cfDNA analysis for trisomy 21 (91% for high-risk and 82% for low-risk cases), the PPVs for monosomy X are much lower (~26%). This is because the maternal plasma sample contains both maternal cfDNA and placental DNA, which is a proxy for the fetal genome. Underlying biological mechanisms for false positive monosomy X screening results include confined placental mosaicism, co-twin demise, and maternal mosaicism. Somatic loss of a single X chromosome in the mother is a natural phenomenon that occurs with aging; this could explain many of the false positive cfDNA results. There is also increased awareness of women who have constitutional mosaicism for 45, X who are fertile. It is important to recognize that a positive cfDNA screen for 45, X does not mean that the fetus has Turner syndrome. A follow-up diagnostic test, either amniocentesis or neonatal karyotype/chromosome microarray, is recommended. Research studies on cell-free mRNA in second trimester amniotic fluid, which is almost exclusively fetal, demonstrate consistent dysregulation of genes involved in the hematologic, immune, and neurologic systems. This suggests that some of the pathophysiology of Turner syndrome occurs early in fetal life and presents novel opportunities for consideration of antenatal treatments.",Cytological features of uterine carcinosarcoma: A retrospective study of 20 cases with an emphasis on the usefulness of endometrial cytology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706679,Diagnostic cytopathology,2019 05 14,Carcinosarcoma of the endometrium is a relatively rare but aggressive neoplasm.

Herein, the preparation of 1D Sb2 Se3 nanowires (NWs) with high crystal quality via chemical vapor deposition growth is reported. The obtained Sb2 Se3 NWs have triangular prism morphology with aspect ratio range from 2 to 200, and three primary lattice orientations can be achieved on the sixfold symmetry mica substrate. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy measurement reveals strong anisotropic properties of the Sb2 Se3 NWs, which is also developed to identify its crystal orientation. Furthermore, photodetectors based on Sb2 Se3 NW exhibit a wide spectral photoresponse range from visible to NIR (400-900 nm). Owing to the high crystallinity of Sb2 Se3 NW, the photodetector acquires a photocurrent on/off ratio of about 405, a responsivity of 5100 mA W-1 , and fast rise and fall times of about 32 and 5 ms, respectively. Additionally, owing to the anisotropic structure of Sb2 Se3 NW, the device exhibits polarization-dependent photoresponse.

Mortality from sepsis is on the rise. Despite more than three decades of research and clinical trials, specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for sepsis are still absent. The use of LFQ- and TMT-based quantitative proteomics is reported here to study the plasma proteome in five mouse models of sepsis. A knowledge-based interpretation of the data reveals a protein network with extensive connectivity through documented functional or physical interactions. The individual proteins in the network all have a documented role in sepsis and are known to be extracellular. The changes in protein abundance observed in the mouse models of sepsis have for the most part the same directionality (increased or decreased abundance) as reported in the literature for human sepsis. This network has been named the Plasma Proteome Signature of Sepsis (PPSS). The PPSS is a quantifiable molecular readout that can supplant the current symptom-based approach used to diagnose sepsis. This type of molecular interpretation of sepsis, its progression, and its response to therapeutic intervention are an important step in advancing our understanding of sepsis, and for discovering and evaluating new therapeutic strategies.",Neoantigens in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Lung Cancer: A Point of View.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706659,Proteomics.

COPD and lung cancer caused by smoke inhalation are most likely linked by challenging the immune system via partly shared pathways. Genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms which predispose an increased susceptibility to COPD and lung cancer. In lung cancer, this leads to coding mutations in the affected tissues, development of neoantigens, and different functionality and abundance of proteins in specific pathways. If a similar reasoning can also be applied in COPD will be discussed. The technology of mass spectrometry has developed into an advanced technology for proteome research detecting mutated peptides or proteins and finding relevant molecular mechanisms that will enable predicting the response to immunotherapy in COPD and lung cancer patients.",Simple high-resolution NMR spectroscopy as a tool in molecular biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706658,The FEBS journal,2019 06 03,"NMR is one of the major techniques for investigating the structure, dynamics and interactions between biomolecules.

However, after eliminating the influence of the fat-free component of adipose tissue on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived lean mass, the original loss of lean mass is no longer observed or is markedly reduced. This suggests that the majority of the lean mass lost with dieting may be the fat-free component of adipose tissue.

Due to its increasing consumption, there is a need to develop a simple, fast, and reliable detection method to follow its concentration in pharmaceutical and biological samples. Herein, a novel fluorometric method is developed for the sensitive measurement of GB. The method is based on the enhancing effect of GB on the fluorescence emission of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTe QDs). QDs were synthesized in aqueous solution and were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Fluorescence intensity of QDs was enhanced by adding GB in a very low concentration. The effect of operative factors such as pH, buffer, contact time and concentration of CdTe QDs were investigated and in the optimized condition, a linear increase was achieved for the emission intensity of QDs by increasing GB concentration in the range 49-345 ng mL-1 , with a detection limit of 17.84 ng mL-1 .

New approaches based on targeted drug delivery may improve efficacy and decrease toxicity of cancer therapy. Furthermore, nanotechnology offers additional potential developments for cancer imaging, diagnosis, and treatment. Following these lines, in the past years, innovative therapies based on the use of liposomes loaded with anticancer agents and functionalized with peptides capable of recognizing neuroblastoma cells and/or tumor-associated endothelial cells have been developed. Studies performed in experimental orthotopic models of human neuroblastoma have shown that targeted nanocarriers can be exploited for not only decreasing the systemic toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer drugs, but also increasing their tumor homing properties, enhancing tumor vascular permeability and perfusion (and, consequently, drug penetration), inducing tumor apoptosis, inhibiting angiogenesis, and reducing tumor glucose consumption. Furthermore, peptide-tagged liposomal formulations are proved to be more efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic spreading of neuroblastoma than nontargeted liposomes.

In this context, the intrinsic behavior of the TMV disk that promotes its assembly into nanotubes is altered by a synergistic effect of dual functional modifications at the 53rd arginine mutation and the introduction of lysine groups in the periphery at 1st and 158th positions of the TMV disk, which results in the formation of 3D gear-like superstructures. Therein, the 53rd arginine moiety significantly strengthens the linkage between TMV disks in the alkaline environment through hydrogen bond interactions. The charge of lysine-modified lateral surfaces is partially neutralized in the alkaline solution, which induces the TMV disk to form a gear-like architecture to maintain its structural stability by exploiting the electrostatic repulsion between neighboring TMV disks. This study not only provides explicit evidence regarding the molecular-level understanding of how the modification of site-specific amino acid affects the assembly of resultant superstructures but also encourages the fabrication of functional protein-based nanoarchitectures.",Coordination Chemistry of Organoruthenium Compounds with Benzoylthiourea Ligands and their Biological Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706633,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 04 29,"Benzoylthiourea derivatives feature several donor atoms capable of coordinating to metal centers.

Although stem cells reside under low oxygen pressure and the availability of oxygen is known to be a crucial determinant in their fate, the key modulators in stem cell aging and the underlying mechanism have yet to be unraveled. Human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hpMSCs) were cultured under hypoxia (3% O2 ) or normoxia (21% O2 ) to investigate the key factors that regulate stem cell senescence under hypoxic conditions. RNA sequencing results suggested that the expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 3 (AIMP3, EEF1E1), an aging inducer, in the hpMSCs was dramatically repressed under hypoxia with concurrent suppression of the aging marker p16INK4a . The hpMSCs that overexpressed AIMP3 under hypoxic conditions displayed significantly decreased proliferation and fewer stem cell characteristics, whereas the downregulation of AIMP3 ameliorated the age-related senescence of MSCs. Consistent with the results of the hpMSCs, MSCs isolated from the adipose tissue of AIMP3-overexpressing mice exhibited decreased stem cell functions. Interestingly, AIMP3-induced senescence is negatively regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and positively regulated by Notch3. Furthermore, we showed that AIMP3 enhanced mitochondrial respiration and suppressed autophagic activity, indicating that the AIMP3-associated modulation of metabolism and autophagy is a key mechanism in the senescence of stem cells and further suggesting a novel target for interventions against aging.",Baghdadite nanoparticle-coated poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) ceramics scaffold improved osteogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706628,Journal of biomedical materials research.

Discovering a suitable combination of scaffolds to stimulate osteogenesis is one of the major concerns in this issue. Porous polymeric scaffolds such as poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) have been attracted a lot of attention because of their biodegradability. In the present study, we have been coated Baghdadite on the plasma-treated surface of PLLA and evaluated osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were cultured on PLLA and PLLA-Baghdadite scaffolds, and cell properties were characterized by MTT assay, scanning electron microscope, and FTIR analysis. Then, osteogenic differentiation potential of AD-MSCs has been investigated, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium mineral deposition, and the expression of bone-related genes (RUNX2, ALP, and OCN). The results have been indicated that calcium content and ALP activity of cells cultured on PLLA-Baghdadite nanofibers were higher than that of tissue culture polystyrenes (TCPs). Gene expression analysis showed that PLLA-Baghdadite had effectively induced osteogenesis-related genes. Taken together, these results suggest that porous nanofiber scaffolds which coated with Baghdadite can enhance osteogenic differentiation of AD-MSC, and PLLA-Baghdadite can be used as a new biodegradable scaffold for bone regeneration. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Despite the tractability in designing CRISPR/Cas9, efficacy in the application of this powerful genome editing tool also depends on DNA delivery methods. In wheat, the biolistics based transformation is the most used method for delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 complex. Due to the high frequency of gene silencing associated with co-transferred plasmid backbone and low edit rate in wheat, a large T0 transgenic plant population are required for recovery of desired mutations, which poses a bottleneck for many genome editing projects. Here, we report an Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system in wheat, which includes a wheat codon optimized Cas9 driven by a maize ubiquitin gene promoter and a guide RNA cassette driven by wheat U6 promoters in a single binary vector. Using this CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have developed 68 edit mutants for four grain-regulatory genes, TaCKX2-1, TaGLW7, TaGW2, and TaGW8, in T0 , T1 , and T2 generation plants at an average edit rate of 10% without detecting off-target mutations in the most Cas9-active plants. Homozygous mutations can be recovered from a large population in a single generation. Different from most plant species, deletions over 10 bp are the dominant mutation types in wheat. Plants homozygous of 1160-bp deletion in TaCKX2-D1 significantly increased grain number per spikelet. In conclusion, our Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 system provides an alternative option for wheat genome editing, which requires a small number of transformation events because CRISPR/Cas9 remains active for novel mutations through generations.",Radioactive seed vs wire localization for nonpalpable breast lesions: A single institution review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706613,The breast journal,2019 05 10,"The aim of this study was to compare wire localization (WL) and radioactive seed localization (RSL) for nonpalpable breast lesions with regard to margin status, re-excision rate, procedure length, and complications related to localization.

In the past, a lightweight (6 g) compliant environmental monitoring system: Marine Skin was demonstrated. In this paper, an enhanced version of that skin with improved functionalities (500-1500% enhanced sensitivity), packaging, and most importantly its endurance at a depth of 2 km in the highly saline Red Sea water for four consecutive weeks is reported. A unique noninvasive approach for attachment of the sensor by designing a wearable, stretchable jacket (bracelet) that can adhere to any species irrespective of their skin type is also illustrated. The wearable featherlight (<0.5 g in air, 3 g with jacket) gadget is deployed on Barramundi, Seabream, and common goldfish to demonstrate the noninvasive and effective attachment strategy on different species of variable sizes which does not hinder the animals' natural movement or behavior.",Heritable disorders of connective tissue: Description of a data repository and initial cohort characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706611,American journal of medical genetics. Part A,2019 04 17,"We describe a data repository on heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) assembled by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program between 2001 and 2013. Participants included affected persons with a wide range of heritable connective tissue phenotypes, and unaffected family members. Elements include comprehensive history and physical examination, standardized laboratory data, physiologic measures and imaging, standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and an extensive linked biorepository. The NIA made a commitment to make the repository available to extramural investigators and deposited samples at Coriell Tissue Repository (N = 126) and GenTAC registry (N = 132). The clinical dataset was transferred to Penn State University College of Medicine Clinical and Translational Science Institute in 2016, and data elements inventoried. The consented cohort of 1,009 participants averaged 39 ± 18 years (mean ± SD, range 2-95) at consent; gender distribution is 71% F and 83% self-report Caucasian ethnicity. Diagnostic categories include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (classical N = 50, hypermobile N = 99, vascular N = 101, rare types and unclassified N = 178), Marfan syndrome (N = 33), Stickler syndrome (N = 60), fibromuscular dysplasia (N = 135), Other HDCT (N = 72). Unaffected family members (N = 218) contributed DNA for the molecular archive only. We aim to develop further discrete data from unstructured elements, analyze multisymptom HDCT manifestations, encourage data use by other researchers and thereby better understand the complexity of these high-morbidity conditions and their multifaceted effects on affected persons.",Drinking and Intimate Partner Violence Severity Levels Among U.S. Ethnic Groups in an Urban Emergency Department.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706610,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,2019 06 10,"Emergency departments (EDs) provide care to ethnically diverse populations with multiple health-related risk factors, many of which are associated with intimate partner violence (IPV).

However, the simultaneous evolution of H2 and O2 requires a fluorine-containing proton exchange membrane to prevent the gases from mixing while using the same space to concentrate the gases, which significantly increases the cost and reduces the flexibility of this approach. Here, a battery electrode based on the highly reversible enolization reaction of pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone is first introduced as a solid-state proton buffer to separate the O2 and H2 evolution of acidic water electrolysis in space and time, through which the gas mixing issue can be avoided without using any membrane. This process allows us to separately consider H2 and O2 production according to the variation in input power (e.g., the renewable energy) and/or the location for H2 concentration, thus showing high flexibility for H2 production.",Surgical solutions for refractory J-pouch inlet obstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706608,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,2019 06 01,"Many surgeons consider total proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as the treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis or ulcerative colitis with dysplasia.

Wild-type and T1719G mutation-bearing HBV1.2× plasmids were transfected into Huh7 and HepG2 cells, respectively, and HBV total RNA, 3.5 kb RNA and supernatant HBV DNA were assessed using real-time PCR, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) levels were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. In order to assess Enh II activity and the binding capacity of HNF3β to Enh II sequence, dual-luciferase assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR were employed, respectively. Simultaneously, the HBx or HBx-mut (T1719G) plasmid was co-transfected to evaluate the effect of HBx on viral replication. Our results showed that the T1719G mutation impaired viral replication efficacy compared with the wild type both by reducing Enh II activity and binding capacity of HNF3β with Enh II. And such reduction caused by T1719G mutation could be rescued by HBx protein. Our results show that the T1719G mutation decreases HBV viral replication capacity possibly by mutant HBx protein and altered Enh II activity.","Geospatial attributes in psychogeriatric service delivery in the district of Colombo, Sri Lanka.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706586,Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,2019 02 01,"Mental health is a neglected area within the healthcare systems in developing nations, including Sri Lanka.

However, CMV becomes an important pathogen in individuals whose immune system is immature or compromised, such as the unborn child. Several vaccines against CMV are currently in clinical trials that aim to induce immunity in seronegative individuals and/or to boost the immunity of those with prior natural infection (seropositives). To facilitate estimation of the burden of disease and the need for vaccines that induce de novo immune responses or that boost pre-existing immunity to CMV, we conducted a systematic survey of the published literature to describe the global seroprevalence of CMV IgG antibodies. We estimated a global CMV seroprevalence of 83% (95%UI: 78-88) in the general population, 86% (95%UI: 83-89) in women of childbearing age, and 86% (95%UI: 82-89) in donors of blood or organs. For each of these three groups, the highest seroprevalence was seen in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean region 90% (95%UI: 85-94) and the lowest in WHO European region 66% (95%UI: 56-74).

Results showed that ultimate weight and average daily gain in high and medium energy groups were significantly higher than low-energy group, yet feed conversion ratio was significantly lower. IMF content was significantly increased by dietary energy increasing, whereas longissimus muscle shear force significantly decreased. Serum-free fatty acids, triglycerides and glucose significantly increased by dietary energy increasing, whereas growth hormone (GH) significantly decreased. Enzyme activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) significantly increased by dietary energy increasing, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) significantly diminished. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, adipocyte-fatty acid-binding proteins, ACC, LPL, and FAS gene or protein expression significantly increased by dietary energy increasing, whereas HSL, CPT-1, and GH gene or protein expression significantly decreased. These results indicated that high dietary energy promoting IMF deposition is mainly by downregulating pituitary GH gene expression, decreasing serum GH concentration, increasing lipogenic genes levels of mRNA, enzyme activities and protein expression, and decreasing lipolytic genes levels of mRNA, enzyme activities, and protein expression.","Scholarly Productivity and Impact: Developing a Quantifiable, Norm-based Benchmarking Methodology for Academic Emergency Medicine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706582,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,2019 06 11,"Quantifying and benchmarking scholarly productivity of emergency medicine faculty is challenging.

Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed. Thirteen studies with a total of 184 patients met our inclusion criteria. Positive resection margin was a poor prognostic factor for CFOS in the univariate and multivariate survival analyses.

A vast range of viruses, such as influenza A virus (IAV), dengue virus, Ebola virus, HIV, and RSV, have been reported to be susceptible to the antiviral activity of tetherin. Multiple reports have been published encompassing the role of tetherin in the IAV life cycle. To date, nine reports have been published regarding the role of tetherin in the IAV life cycle, with four reports supporting tetherin as an antiviral factor while five other reports suggesting no effect. To this end, this review summarizes the list of viruses currently known to be inhibited by tetherin and describes mechanisms used by viruses to overcome the antiviral potential of tetherin. Further, using IAV as disease model, we provide existing evidence in favor and against tetherin being considered as an antiviral candidate. Subsequent analysis of the experimental procedures across IAV-tetherin published reports revealed that the experimental setup (ie, cell lines, transfection reagents, and multiplicity of infection), strain-specific activity of NS1, and differing roles of NS1 in different cell lines may add up to the contributing factors leading to the discrepancies observed.",Morphology-Controlled Metal Sulfides and Phosphides for Electrochemical Water Splitting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706578,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 04 05,"Because H2 is considered a promising clean energy source, water electrolysis has attracted great interest in related research and technology. Noble-metal-based catalysts are used as electrode materials in water electrolyzers, but their high cost and low abundance have impeded them from being used in practical areas. Recently, metal sulfides and phosphides based on earth-abundant transition metals have emerged as promising candidates for efficient water-splitting catalysts. Most studies have focused on adjusting the composition of the metal sulfides and phosphides to enhance the catalytic performance. However, morphology control of catalysts, including faceted and hollow structures, is much less explored for these systems because of difficulties in the synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of the nanocrystal growth process. Herein, representative synthetic methods for morphology-controlled metal sulfides and phosphides are introduced to provide insights into these methodologies. The electrolytic performance of morphology-controlled metal sulfide- and phosphide-based nanocatalysts with enhanced surface area and intrinsically high catalytic activity is also summarized and the future research directions for this promising catalyst group is discussed."

Semaphorins (Sema) constitute a family of membrane-associated and secreted proteins that have garnered significant attention as a potential SGN ""navigator"" during cochlea development. Previous studies using mutant mice demonstrated that Sema3A plays a role in the SGN pathfinding. The mechanisms, however, by which Sema3A shapes SGNs firing behavior are not known. In these studies, we found that Sema3A plays a novel role in regulating SGN resting membrane potential and excitability. Using dissociated SGN from pre-hearing (P3-P5) and post-hearing mice (P12-P15), we recorded membrane potentials using whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques in apical and basal SGN populations. Recombinant Sema3A was applied to examine the effects on intrinsic membrane properties and action potentials evoked by current injections. Apical and basal SGNs from newborn mice treated with recombinant Sema3A (100 ng/ml) displayed a higher resting membrane potential, higher threshold, decreased amplitude, and prolonged latency and duration of spikes. Although a similar phenomenon was observed in SGNs from post-hearing mice, the resting membrane potential was essentially indistinguishable before and after Sema3A exposure. Sema3A-mediated changes in membrane excitability were associated with a significant decrease in K+ and Ca2+ currents. Sema3A acts through linopirdine-sensitive K+ channels in apical, but not in the basal SGNs. Therefore, Sema3A induces differential effects in SGN membrane excitability that are dependent on age and location, and constitutes an additional early and novel effect of Sema3A SGNs in vitro.","Food for thought: Exploring associations between knowledge of the Healthy Living Pyramid, the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and food group intake among Western Australian adolescents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706558,Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 02 21,Evidence indicates adolescents do not comply with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE)-recommended daily serves (RDS).

Herein, this study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-539 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and EMT by targeting secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) via the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)/Smads signaling pathway in PTC. First, PTC-related differentially expressed genes and regulatory miR were screened using bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase reporter gene assay, and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation, which identified the SLPI gene and the regulatory miR-539 for this study. We identified SLPI as a highly expressed gene in PTC tissues, and SLPI was targeted and negatively regulated by miR-539. Then, we introduced a series of miR-539 mimics, miR-539 inhibitors, and small interfering RNA against SLPI plasmids into CGTHW-3 cells to examine the effects of miR-539 and SLPI on the expression of TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway-, EMT-, and apoptosis-related factors, as well as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. The obtained results indicated that CGTHW-3 cells treated with silenced SLPI or overexpressed miR-539 suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, invasion abilities, and resistance to apoptosis of PTC cells, corresponding to increased expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein, TGF-β1, Sekelsky mothers against dpp 4, and epithelial cadherin, and decreased B cell lymphoma 2, Vimentin, and N-cadherin.

Particular interest lies in studies where the repeated measurements are used to predict a time-to-event outcome, such as mortality, in a dynamic manner. If event rates in a study are low, however, and most information is to be expected from the patients experiencing the study endpoint, it may be more cost efficient to only use a subset of the data. One way of achieving this is by applying a case-cohort design, which selects all cases and only a random samples of the noncases. In the standard way of analyzing data in a case-cohort design, the noncases who were not selected are completely excluded from analysis; however, the overrepresentation of the cases will lead to bias. We propose to include survival information of all patients from the cohort in the analysis. We approach the fact that we do not have longitudinal information for a subset of the patients as a missing data problem and argue that the missingness mechanism is missing at random. Hence, results obtained from an appropriate model, such as a joint model, should remain valid. Simulations indicate that our method performs similar to fitting the model on a full cohort, both in terms of parameters estimates and predictions of survival probabilities. Estimating the model on the classical version of the case-cohort design shows clear bias and worse performance of the predictions. The procedure is further illustrated in data from a biomarker study on acute coronary syndrome patients, BIOMArCS.","A pilot study of an integrated mental health, social and medical model for diabetes care in an inner-city setting: Three Dimensions for Diabetes (3DFD).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706535,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 05 08,"We examined the effectiveness of a service innovation, Three Dimensions for Diabetes (3DFD), that consisted of a referral to an integrated mental health, social care and diabetes treatment model, compared with usual care in improving biomedical and health economic outcomes.","Histological, immunohistochemical, and genomic evaluation of excisional and diabetic wounds treated with human Wharton's jelly stem cells with and without a nanocarrier.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706534,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 01,"We showed in previous studies that human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) improved the healing rates of excisional and diabetic wounds in the mouse model.

Bright-field microscopic observations and ImageJ software analysis on histological sections of the excisional and diabetic wound biopsies collected at different time points showed that the thickness of the epidermis and dermis, and positive picrosirius-red stained areas for collagen, were significantly greater in the presence of hWJSCs compared with controls (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry of the diabetic wound biopsies showed increased positive staining for the vascular endothelial marker CD31 and cell proliferation marker Ki67 in the presence of hWJSCs and its conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM).

Taken together, the results demonstrated that hWJSCs and hWJSC-CM that contains the paracrine secretions of hWJSCs, enhance the healing of excisional and diabetic wounds via re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. The inclusion of an Aloe vera-polycaprolactone (AV/PCL) nanocarrier did not significantly change the effect of the hWJSCs. However, the topical application of an AV/PCL nanocarrier impregnated with hWJSCs is convenient and less invasive than the administration of hWJSC injections into wounds.",Microvascular lining options for subtotal and total nasal reconstruction: A scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706532,Microsurgery,2019 02 01,"Restoration of nasal lining is essential in reconstruction of subtotal/total nasal defects.

The high efficacy and tolerability of DAA therapy has also created a rationale for utilizing HCV-viremic (HCV-RNA-positive) donors, including into HCV-negative recipients. We examined trends in frequency of organ utilization and graft survival in recipients of HCV-viremic donors (HCV-RNA positive as measured by nucleic acid testing [NAT]). Data were collected from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) on adult patients who underwent a primary, single-organ, deceased donor LT from January 1, 2008 to January 31, 2018. Outcomes of HCV-negative transplant recipients (R- ) who received an allograft from donors who were HCV-RNA positive (DNAT+ ) were compared to outcomes for R- patients who received organs from donors who were HCV-RNA negative (DNAT- ). There were 11,270 DNAT- /R- ; 4,748 DNAT- /R+ ; 87 DNAT+ /R- ; and 753 DNAT+ /R+ patients, with 2-year graft survival similar across all groups: DNAT- /R- 88%; DNAT- /R+ 88%; DNAT+ /R- 86%; and DNAT+ /R+ 90%. Additionally, there were 2,635 LTs using HCV antibody-positive donors (DAb+ ): 2,378 DAb+ /R+ and 257 DAb+ /R- . The annual number of DAb+ /R- transplants increased from seven in 2008 to 107 in 2017. In the post-DAA era, graft survival improved for all recipients, with 3-year survival of DAb+ /R- patients and DAb+ /R+ patients increasing to 88% from 79% and to 85% from 78%, respectively. Conclusion: The post-DAA era has seen increased utilization of HCV-viremic donor livers, including HCV-viremic livers into HCV-negative recipients. Early graft outcomes are similar to those of HCV-negative recipients. These results support utilization of HCV-viremic organs in selected recipients both with and without HCV infection.",Assessment of telomerase activity in nonsegmental vitiligo tissue: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706515,Clinical and experimental dermatology,2019 02 01,"Vitiligo is characterized by loss of melanocytes; therefore, an increased risk of photoageing and cancer are expected.

Mice spermatozoa were exposed to DON at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 µM for 1, 3 and 6 hr, motility parameters were evaluated by computer-assisted analysis and viability was examined by colorimetric metabolic activity assay and HOS test. DNA damage was examined by acridine orange staining, and sperm damages via lipid peroxidation pathway were determined by malondialdehyde (MDA) content measurement. DON affected sperm parameters in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In all test groups, the average path velocity and progressive motile spermatozoa were remarkably reduced. In comparison with the controls, after 1, 3 and 6 hr exposure to DON, viability of spermatozoa was reduced 25, 30 and 49% respectively. DON exposure at 10 µM for 6 hr resulted in 15% DNA damage and 2.5-fold more MDA generation, when compared with nonexposed spermatozoa.

The ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure and isometric tension of corpus cavernosum (CC) were measured. The penile expression of endothelial and neuronal NOS (eNOS and nNOS), inflammation markers [nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inhibitor kappa B alpha (IκBα)], H2 S-producing enzymes[cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)], the smooth muscle/collagen ratio and H2 S concentrations were determined. The blood pressure was significantly increased in the hypertensive group, but not reversed by NaHS. The erectile response in hypertensive rats was partially prevented by NaHS. The relaxation response to electrical field stimulation was increased in CC from NaHS-treated hypertensive rats. NaHS treatment restored decreased protein expression of eNOS, nNOS and CSE as well as smooth muscle/collagen ratio and H2 S levels and increased NF-κB and IκBα protein expression in the penile tissue of hypertensive rats.

In this paper, we propose a powerful and robust association test, which combines information from each individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on sequential independent burden tests. We compare the proposed approach with some popular tests through a comprehensive simulation study and real data application. Our results show that, in general, the new test is more powerful; the gain in detecting power can be substantial in many situations, compared to other methods.","Evaluating metronidazole as a novel, safe CYP2A6 phenotyping probe in healthy adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706508,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 04 26,"CYP2A6 is a genetically polymorphic enzyme resulting in differential substrate metabolism and health behaviours.

Systematic reviews on the treatment and prevention of AE are summarized in Part 1 of this update, and systematic reviews on the epidemiology of and risk factors for AE are summarized in Part 2. Six reviews summarized what outcome measurement instruments have been used in published AE trials, or summarized validation studies for the available instruments. These reviews were used to inform consensus decisions by the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema initiative. Although validated instruments exist for clinical signs and patient-reported symptoms, there are currently no validated instruments for capturing quality of life or long-term control. Four reviews examined the impact of AE on children and their families, but few studies were included. One birth cohort study found no association between AE and educational attainment at 11 years. AE has a moderate impact on health-related quality of life and a substantial impact on family life. AE is a major risk factor for occupational hand dermatitis, and it is advised that young atopic individuals are informed about high-risk occupations. Further efforts are required to standardize the nomenclature for AE, which is also commonly known as 'atopic dermatitis' or 'eczema', and preferred terms vary around the world."

However, the use of this technique is limited because efficiency of CO2 removal and potential beneficial effects on pulmonary hemodynamics are not precisely established. Moreover, this technique requires anticoagulation that may induce severe complications in critically ill patients. Therefore, our study aimed at determining precise efficiency of CO2 extraction and its effects on right ventricular (RV) afterload, and comparing regional anticoagulation with citrate to systemic heparin anticoagulation during ECCO2 R. This study was performed in an experimental model of severe hypercapnic acidosis performed in two groups of three pigs. In the first group (heparin group), pigs were anticoagulated with a standard protocol of unfractionated heparin while citrate was used for ECCO2 R device anticoagulation in the second group (citrate group). After sedation, analgesia and endotracheal intubation, pigs were connected to a volume-cycled ventilator. Severe hypercapnic acidosis was obtained by reducing tidal volume by 60%. ECCO2 R was started in both groups when arterial pH was lower than 7.2. Pump Assisted Lung Protection (PALP, Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) system was used to remove CO2 . CO2 extraction, arterial pH, PaCO2 as well as systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic were continuously followed. Mean arterial pH was normalized to 7.37 ± 1.4 at an extracorporeal blood flow of 400 mL/min, coming from 7.11 ± 1.3. RV end-systolic pressure increased by over 30% during acute hypercapnic acidosis and was normalized in parallel with CO2 removal. CO2 extraction was not significantly increased in citrate group as compared to heparin group. Mean ionized calcium and MAP were significantly lower in the citrate group than in the heparin group during ECCO2 R (1.03 ± 0.20 vs. 1.33 ± 0.19 and 57 ± 14 vs. 68 ± 15 mm Hg, respectively). ECCO2 R was highly efficient to normalize pH and PaCO2 and to reduce RV afterload resulting from hypercapnic acidosis. Regional anticoagulation with citrate solution was as effective as standard heparin anticoagulation but did not improve CO2 removal and lead to more hypocalcemia and hypotension.",Resurgence is greater following a return to the training context than remaining in the extinction context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706484,Journal of the experimental analysis of behavior,2019 05 09,"The present study examined whether resurgence of a previously reinforced target response upon removing alternative reinforcement would be greater when (1) returning to the original training context (ABA context changes) versus (2) remaining in the analogue treatment context in which the alternative response was differentially reinforced (ABB context changes).

Both apelin and APJ receptor are distributed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and play important roles in the cardiovascular system. Our previous reports have indicated that apelin-13 promoted the proliferation of VSMCs, but its exact mechanism remains to be further explored. The results of the present study demonstrated that the Warburg effect plays a pivotal role in apelin-13-induced human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) proliferation. Apelin-13 promoted the expression of glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, apelin-13 increased the extracellular, intracellular lactate level, and decreased adenosine triphosphate level in HA-VSMCs. Furthermore, siRNA-PKM2 reversed extracellular and intracellular lactate generation and inhibited the proliferation of HA-VSMCs induced by apelin-13. Downregulation of LDHA also significantly prevented extracellular and intracellular lactate generation and inhibited the proliferation of HA-VSMCs induced by apelin-13. Taken together, our results demonstrated a novel mechanism for HA-VSMCs proliferation induced by apelin-13 via Warburg effect.",Adhesion of Bread Dough to Solid Surfaces Under Controlled Heating: Balance Between the Rheological and Interfacial Properties of Dough.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706468,Journal of food science,2019 04 16,"The adhesion of wheat dough affects many aspects of industrial baking, from kneading raw dough to the final baking process. In this work, an original method was developed to study the effect of temperature on the adhesive properties of bread dough in contact with a solid surface during heating. Using this approach, it will be possible to understand the factors that affect adhesion between dough and a baking surface, which will aid in developing methods to prevent dough from sticking. Overall, the dough's adhesion to a hydrophobic surface globally decreased with an increase in temperature from 35 to 97 °C, with the exception of the temperature range between 55 and 70 °C, in which the energy of adhesion increased slightly. Under these circumstances, the evolution of adhesion was primarily shaped by the rheological properties of the dough. However, when we used a solid surface with different surface energy, the results changed significantly, which suggests that the mechanisms of adhesion during heating are governed by a balance between the interfacial and bulk properties of the heated dough. The overall decrease in the adhesion of the dough to the hydrophobic glass surface may be explained by a decrease in dough hydrophobicity due to structural and chemical changes in the dough.",Increased risk of maternal complications from repeat pregnancy among adolescent women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706467,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2019 05 01,To evaluate the risk of adverse maternal outcomes among adolescents experiencing a repeat pregnancy in the Philippines.,Identification of volatile compounds and odour activity values in quinoa porridge by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706466,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 15,"Quinoa porridge is becoming popular among Asian for its nutritional values; hence, it is important to understand its aroma characteristics.",A contemporary review of machine learning in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706465,The Laryngoscope,2019 02 01,"One of the key challenges with big data is leveraging the complex network of information to yield useful clinical insights. The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine-learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5 years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine-learning techniques, and review recent machine-learning applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine-learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care.

One developmental factor that has consistently been shown to influence sociosexual orientation is father absence in childhood. Consistent with the prediction of the theory, the analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data show that father absence significantly increases women's, but not men's, same-sex sexuality in adulthood, whether it is measured by self identity, sexual behaviour, or romantic attraction. Further consistent with the theory, the association between father absence and same-sex sexuality in women is entirely mediated by their sociosexual orientation."

Focal loss of neurons may also occur in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum. Pathophysiology of HE in cirrhosis is multifactorial, involving brain accumulation of ammonia and manganese, systemic and central inflammation, nutritional/metabolic factors and activation of the GABAergic neurotransmitter system. Neuroimaging and spectroscopic techniques reveal early deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex in parallel with neuropsychological impairment. T1-weighted MR signal hyperintensities in basal ganglia resulting from manganese lead to a novel entity, 'Parkinsonism in cirrhosis'.

Administration of LOLA removes ammonia via two distinct mechanisms: by synthesis of urea and by the synthesis of glutamine via the enzyme glutamine synthetase. While LOLA has been used in cirrhosis and acute liver injury settings, it is less clear if LOLA could be used in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD and the progressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are currently the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide, with roughly 25% of the world population affected by NAFLD. Consequences of NASH are end-stage liver disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As the basis for NAFLD is excess calorie uptake and excess adipose tissue mass, the conservative therapeutic approach is weight loss by intense lifestyle change. However, no pharmacological treatment options are currently approved. LOLA is being investigated as a pharmacological tool to ameliorate liver injury in NAFLD on the basis that it lowers liver ammonia concentrations and supplies anti-oxidative glutamine and glutathione. Indirect hepatoprotective effects currently under investigation could also be beneficial.","Hepatic Encephalopathy: Definition, Clinical Grading and Diagnostic Principles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706420,Drugs,2019 05 15,"In general, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portal-systemic blood shunting. This article relates to the so-called type C HE: that is, HE in patients with liver cirrhosis. It manifests as a wide spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations, detectable only by neuropsychological or neurophysiological assessment, to coma. Several scales have been developed for grading the extent of HE. The most often used is the West Haven criteria (WHC), which differentiate between four grades of clinically overt HE. Patients with liver cirrhosis without clinically overt symptoms of HE but neuropsychological or neurophysiological findings indicating brain dysfunction are considered to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). For simplification, some experts suggest differentiating between covert HE (MHE plus grade I HE according to WHC) and overt HE (WHC grades II-IV). Diagnosis of both MHE and overt HE is hampered by the fact that none of the symptoms of HE or the findings in the various diagnostic measures applied are specific. Thus, a diagnosis of HE or MHE can only be made after exclusion of other possible causes of brain dysfunction.",Impact of Hepatic Encephalopathy in Cirrhosis on Quality-of-Life Issues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706419,Drugs,2019 04 04,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has a major impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients, which has clinical and psychosocial consequences. HRQOL in cirrhosis has been measured by generic and liver-specific instruments, with most studies indicating a negative impact of HE. HRQOL abnormalities span daily functioning, sleep-wake cycle changes, and the ability to work. Of these, sleep-wake cycle changes have a major effect on HRQOL, which remains challenging to treat. The personal effect of HRQOL is modulated by the presence of HE, the etiology of cirrhosis, and cognitive reserve. Patients with higher cognitive reserve are able to tolerate HE and its impact on HRQOL better than those with a poor cognitive reserve. The impact of HRQOL impairment is felt by patients (higher mortality and poor daily functioning), as well as by caregivers and families. Caregivers of patients with HE bear a major financial and psychological burden, which may affect their personal health and longevity.",Effect of High Pressure on Paracoccus denitrificans Growth and Polyhydroxyalkanoates Production from Glycerol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706416,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 02 01,"The performance of fermentation under non-conventional conditions, such as high pressure (HP), is a strategy currently tested for different fermentation processes. In the present work, the purpose was to apply HP (10-50 MPa) to fermentation by Paracoccus denitrificans, a microorganism able to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from glycerol. In general, cell growth and glycerol consumption were both reduced by HP application, more extensively at higher pressure levels, such as 35 or 50 MPa. PHA production and composition was highly dependent on the pressure applied. HP was found to decrease polymer titers, but increase the PHA content in cell dry mass (%), indicating higher ability to accumulate these polymers in the cells. In addition, some levels of HP affected PHA monomeric composition, with the polymer produced at 10 and 35 MPa showing considerable differences relative to the ones obtained at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, it is possible to foresee that the changes in polymer composition may also affect its physical and mechanical properties. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that HP technology (at specific levels) can be applied to P. denitrificans fermentations without compromising the ability to produce PHA, with potentially interesting effects on polymer composition.","Synergism of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1, Cry2, and Vip3 Proteins in Spodoptera frugiperda Control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706415,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 02 01,"The polyphagous caterpillar, Spodoptera frugiperda, has been controlled with either chemical insecticides or transgenic plants such as Bt maize that expresses the cry and/or vip genes of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacterium. Despite the efficiency of Bt toxins in lepidopteran control, populations resistant to Bt plants have emerged in different locations around the world. Thus, understanding how combined proteins interact against pests can assist resistance control and management. This work demonstrated the toxicity of Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ca, Cry1Ea, Cry2Aa, Cry2Ab, Vip3Aa, and Vip3Ca in single and combined assays against S. frugiperda neonatal larvae. All protein mixtures had synergistic action in the control of the larvae.

Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Vip3Aa bound to more than one site on the brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of S. frugiperda. The Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac proteins share binding site, while Cry1Ab does not share binding site with the Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab proteins. The Vip3Aa protein does not share receptors with the tested Cry1 and Cry2.

The objectives were to determine (a) whether vibriophages against known strains or serotypes of clinical and environmental vibrios were detectable in oysters from the Delaware Bay and (b) whether vibriophage presence or absence corresponded with Vibrio abundances in oysters. Host cells for phage assays included pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus serotypes O3:K6, O1:KUT (untypable) and O1:K1, as well as clinical and environmental strains of V. vulnificus. Vibriophages against some, but not all, pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus serotypes were readily detected in Delaware Bay oysters. In July, abundances of total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus at one site spiked to levels exceeding regulatory guidelines. Phages against three V. parahaemolyticus host serotypes were detected in these same oysters, but also in oysters with low V. parahaemolyticus levels. Serotype-specific vibriophage presence or absence did not correspond with abundances of total or pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Vibriophages were not detected against three V. vulnificus host strains, even though V. vulnificus were readily detectable in oyster tissues. Selected phage isolates against V. parahaemolyticus showed high host specificity. Transmission electron micrographs revealed that most isolates were ~ 60-nm diameter, non-tailed phages. In conclusion, vibriophages were detected against pandemic V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 and O1:KUT, suggesting that phage monitoring in specific host cells may be a useful technique to assess public health risks from oyster consumption.",Lactate Dehydrogenase Predicts Early Hematoma Expansion and Poor Outcomes in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706410,Translational stroke research,2019 02 01,"This study aimed to investigate whether serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels predicted hematoma expansion and poor outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients.

A prospective study on the validation cohort of three clinical centers was performed to investigate the association between the target protein and hematoma expansion and poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale > 3) at 90 days by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Among the 41 differentially expressed proteins, LDH A chain was upregulated, which is one of the two main subunits of LDH protein. Considering that it was easy to determine serum LDH levels, LDH was selected as the target protein. In the derivation cohort, LDH ≥ 220 U/L was selected as the critical value to predict hematoma expansion by using receiver operating characteristic analysis. A total of 366 ICH patients were enrolled in the validation cohort and LDH ≥ 220 U/L was positive in 127 patients (34.7%). The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated LDH levels and LDH ≥ 220 U/L independently predicted hematoma expansion (p < 0.001) and poor outcomes (p < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of LDH ≥ 220 U/L for hematoma expansion and poor outcome prediction were 79.1%, 80.0%, 56.7%, 92.1%, and 79.8% and 53.3%, 78.2%, 63.0%, 70.7%, and 68.0%, respectively. In conclusion, LDH is a reliable predictor for early hematoma expansion and poor outcomes in patients with ICH."

Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are currently the most popular gene delivery system for targeting the liver, reflecting high transduction efficiency in vivo and the availability of a toolkit of multiple different capsids with high liver tropism. While AAV vectors confer stable gene transfer in the relatively quiescent adult liver, the predominantly episomal nature of AAV vector genomes results in less stable expression in the growing liver as a consequence of episome clearance during hepatocellular replication. This is an important consideration in experimental design involving young animals, particularly mice, where liver growth is rapid. Given the immense value of murine models for dissecting disease pathophysiology, experimental therapeutics and vector development, this technical manuscript focuses on AAV-mediated transduction of the mouse liver. Xenograft models, in which chimeric mouse-human livers can be established, are also amenable to AAV-mediated gene transfer and have proven to be powerful tools for in vivo selection and characterization of novel human-specific capsids. While yet to be confirmed, such models have the potential to more accurately predict transduction efficiency of clinical candidate vectors than nonhuman primate models.",Poxviruses as Gene Therapy Vectors: Generating Poxviral Vectors Expressing Therapeutic Transgenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706397,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"Treatments with poxvirus vectors can have long-lasting immunological impact in the host, and thus they have been extensively studied to treat diseases and for vaccine development. More importantly, the oncolytic properties of poxviruses have led to their development as cancer therapeutics. Two poxviruses, vaccinia virus (VACV) and myxoma virus (MYXV), have been extensively studied as virotherapeutics with promising results. Vaccinia virus vectors have advanced to the clinic and have been tested as oncolytic therapeutics for several cancer types with successes in phase I/II clinical trials. In addition to oncolytic applications, MYXV has been explored for additional applications including immunotherapeutics, purging of cancer progenitor cells, and treatments for graft-versus-host diseases. These novel therapeutic applications have encouraged its advancement into clinical trials. To meet the demands of different treatment needs, VACV and MYXV can be genetically engineered to express therapeutic transgenes. The engineering process used in poxvirus vectors can be very different from that of other DNA virus vectors (e.g., the herpesviruses).

This status can be attributed primarily to their ability to transduce dividing as well as quiescent cells. When coupled with internal promotor selection to drive expression in one cell type but not another, the ease with which the vectors can be pseudotyped to either restrict or expand tropism offers unique opportunities previously unavailable to the researcher to manipulate the genome. Although LV can be produced from stable packaging cell lines and/or in suspension culture, by and far, most LV vectors are produced using adherent 293 T cells grown in plasticware and production plasmids transiently transfected with either PEI or Calcium Phosphate. The media is usually changed and un-concentrated vector supernatant collected between 24 and 48 h post-transfection. The supernatant may then be purified by Mustang Q chromatography, concentrated by Tangential Flow Filtration, and finally diafiltered into the final formulation buffer of choice.

Typical titers for most vector constructs range between 1 × 108 and 1 × 109 infectious particles per mL. This method may be performed reiteratively to increase total volume or can be further scaled up to increase yield.",Generation of High-Titer Pseudotyped Lentiviral Vectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706393,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 18,"Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are widely used in gene transfer protocols due to many advantages that include stable gene expression, higher transgene payloads, and, importantly, the ability to pseudotype the vectors with a diverse number of heterologous viral envelopes with broad or restricted cell tropism depending on the need. The pseudotyping process also allows for incorporation of specific antibodies/ligands to engineer LVs. These features greatly facilitate customization of lentiviral vectors for cell/tissue specific gene delivery. The VSV-G protein containing envelope remains the most widely used among the viral glycoproteins used for LV pseudotyping due to its versatile host range and stability. However, many other viral envelopes are being identified for special applications of LVs. Here we describe the methodology to generate pseudotyped LVs using a four-plasmid transient transfection system focusing on aspects to generate high-titer vector stocks.",Multimodal Production of Adeno-Associated Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706392,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 18,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is an increasingly popular tool in the research laboratory, and use of this viral vector clinically is occurring at an accelerated pace. Nevertheless, despite its popularity, AAV is a relatively cumbersome virus to produce; however, significant efforts have been invested to develop, optimize, and simplify methodology that allows the generation of high-quality AAV with significantly increased production yields. Here we describe multiple modalities for production and purification of AAV particles produced in HEK293 cell cultures using an iodixanol density gradient. We include two methods adapted for harvesting virus from the culture media: tangential flow filtration (TFF) and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEGylation). Moreover, we also describe the protocol for anion exchange chromatography, which can be used after the iodixanol gradient as an additional purification step.

The most efficient gene transfer tools are currently derived from viruses. Among them, the recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are vectors of choice for many fundamental and therapeutic applications. The increasing number of clinical trials involving AAVs demonstrates the need to implement production and purification processes to meet the quantitative and qualitative demands of regulatory agencies for the use of these vectors in clinical trials. In this context, the rise of production levels on an industrial scale appeared essential. The introduction, in 2002, of an AAV process using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has circumvented this technological lock. The advantage of BEVS in expanding the AAV production in insect cells has been to switch the process to bioreactor systems, which are the ideal equipment for scaling up. We describe here a method for producing AAV vectors using the BEVS which can be easily used by research laboratories wishing to overcome the difficulties associated with the scaling up of production levels. The method provides sufficient quantities of AAV vectors to initiate preclinical projects in large animal models or for research projects where a single batch of vectors will consolidate the repeatability and reproducibility of in vitro and especially in vivo experimental approaches.",Practical Considerations for the Use of DREADD and Other Chemogenetic Receptors to Regulate Neuronal Activity in the Mammalian Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706390,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 18,"Chemogenetics is the process of genetically expressing a macromolecule receptor capable of modulating the activity of the cell in response to selective chemical ligand.

Angiogenesis plays an important role in retinal detachment and retinal microvascular inflammation throughout the whole development of DR. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect and the potential mechanism of miR-377 on high glucose and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and inflammation in human retinal endothelial cells, and found that the miR-377 level was significantly increased after high glucose and hypoxia-mimetic agent to simulate the DR milieu. Moreover, miR-377 was confirmed to directly decrease target SIRT1 gene, further aggravated proliferation, cell cycle transition, migration and angiogenesis, pro-inflammatory molecules release induced by high glucose and hypoxia in vitro. Conversely, down-regulation of miR-377 enhanced expression of SIRT1 and in turn alleviated high glucose and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and inflammation in vitro. Additionally, Western blot results showed that down-regulation of miR-377 restrained high glucose and hypoxia-induced protein expressions of p-IκBα, nuclear P65 and p-P65. Conversely, up-regulation of miR-377 presented opposite results. Conclusively, down-regulation of miR-377 could partially suppress high glucose and hypoxia-induced angiogenic functions, restrain pro-inflammatory cytokines release, and its mechanism may though inhibition of NF-κB pathway by direct up-regulation of target gene SIRT1 expression.

Neuroimaging based models generally agree that limbic regions work with medial prefrontal and temporal regions during moral processing to integrate emotional, social, and cognitive elements into decision-making. However, no quantitative work has been done examining neural response across types of moral cognition tasks. This paper uses Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) to conduct neuroimaging meta-analyses of the moral cognitive literature. MKDA replicated previous findings of the neural correlates of moral cognition: the left amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Random forest algorithms classified neural features as belonging to simple/utilitarian moral dilemmas, explicit/implicit moral tasks, and word/picture moral stimuli tasks; in combination with univariate contrast analyses, these results indicated a distinct pattern of processing for each of the members of these paradigm pairs. Overall, the results emphasize that the task selected for use in a moral cognition neuroimaging study is vital for the elicitation and interpretation of results. It also replicates and re-establishes the neural basis for moral processing, especially important in light of implementation errors in previous meta-analysis.",Sex-Dependent Sensory Phenotypes and Related Transcriptomic Expression Profiles Are Differentially Affected by Angelman Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706369,Molecular neurobiology,2019 02 01,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic disorder which entails autism, intellectual disability, lack of speech, motor deficits, and seizure susceptibility. It is caused by the lack of UBE3A protein expression, which is an E3-ubiquitin ligase. Despite AS equal prevalence in males and females, not much data on how sex affects the syndrome was reported. In the herein study, we thoroughly characterized many behavioral phenotypes of AS mice. The behavioral data acquired was analyzed with respect to sex. In addition, we generated a new mRNA sequencing dataset. We analyzed the coding transcriptome expression profiles with respect to the effects of genotype and sex observed in the behavioral phenotypes. We identified several neurobehavioral aspects, especially sensory perception, where AS mice either lack the male-to-female differences observed in wild-type littermates or even show opposed differences. However, motor phenotypes did not show male-to-female variation between wild-type (WT) and AS mice. In addition, by utilizing the mRNA sequencing, we identified genes and isoforms with expression profiles that mirror the sensory perception results. These genes are differentially regulated in the two sexes with inverse expression profiles in AS mice compared to WT littermates. Some of these are known pain-related and estrogen-dependent genes. The observed differences in sex-dependent neurobehavioral phenotypes and the differential transcriptome expression profiles in AS mice strengthen the evidence for molecular cross talk between Ube3a protein and sex hormone receptors or their elicited pathways. These interactions are essential for understanding Ube3a deletion effects, beyond its E3-ligase activity.",Aluminum in Neurological and Neurodegenerative Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706368,Molecular neurobiology,2019 03 08,"With continuing cooperation from 18 domestic and international brain banks over the last 36 years, we have analyzed the aluminum content of the temporal lobe neocortex of 511 high-quality human female brain samples from 16 diverse neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including 2 groups of age-matched controls. Temporal lobes (Brodmann areas A20-A22) were selected for analysis because of their availability and their central role in massive information-processing operations including efferent-signal integration, cognition, and memory formation. We used the analytical technique of (i) Zeeman-type electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (ETAAS) combined with (ii) preliminary analysis from the advanced photon source (APS) hard X-ray beam (7 GeV) fluorescence raster-scanning (XRFR) spectroscopy device (undulator beam line 2-ID-E) at the Argonne National Laboratory, US Department of Energy, University of Chicago IL, USA.

Using ETAAS, all measurements were performed in triplicate on each tissue sample. Among these 17 common neurological conditions, we found a statistically significant trend for aluminum to be increased only in AD, DS, and DDS compared to age- and gender-matched brains from the same anatomical region. This is the largest study of aluminum concentration in the brains of human neurological and neurodegenerative disease ever undertaken. The results continue to suggest that aluminum's association with AD, DDS, and DS brain tissues may contribute to the neuropathology of those neurological diseases but appear not to be a significant factor in other common disorders of the human brain and/or CNS.",Evidence-Based Consensus on Positioning of SGLT2i in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Indians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706366,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",2019 04 16,"The current diabetes management strategies not only aim at controlling glycaemic parameters but also necessitate continuous medical care along with multifactorial risk reduction through a comprehensive management concept. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a group of evolving antidiabetic agents that have the potential to play a pivotal role in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes due to their diverse beneficial effects. SGLT2i provide moderate glycaemic control, considerable body weight and blood pressure reduction, and thus have the ability to lower the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Some of the unique characteristics associated with SGLT2i, such as reduction in body weight (more visceral fat mass loss than subcutaneous fat loss), reduction in insulin resistance and improvement in β-cell function, as measured by homeostatic model assessment-β (HOMA-β) could be potentially beneficial and help in overcoming some of the challenges faced by Indian patients with diabetes. In addition, a patient-centric approach with individualised treatment during SGLT2i therapy is inevitable in order to reduce diabetic complications and improve quality of life. Despite their broad benefits profile, the risk of genital tract infections, volume depletion, amputations and diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2i should be carefully monitored. In this compendium, we systematically reviewed the literature from Medline, Cochrane Library, and other relevant databases and attempted to provide evidence-based recommendations for the positioning of SGLT2i in the management of diabetes in the Indian population.Funding: AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited."

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance myocardial feature tracking (CMR-FT) is a novel technique for the quantification of LA function. Our aim was first to evaluate LA function by CMR-FT and volumetric analysis in patients with HCM; and secondly we sought to determine the association of LA-longitudinal strain (LA-LS) with major cardiovascular outcomes, particularly all cause mortality and heart failure. 75 patients with HCM and 75 control subjects underwent a conventional CMR study including assessment of LA function by CMR-FT (LA-LS) and volumetric analysis. A primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and secondary combined endpoint of hospital admission related to heart failure, lethal ventricular arrhythmias or cardiovascular death were defined. Compared to controls, LA-LS and all volumetric indices of LA function were significantly impaired in HCM even in patients with normal LA volume and normal LV filling pressures. LA-LS showed moderate-high correlation with LA-emptying fraction (total, active and passive LA-EF, r = 0.68, r = 0.67, r = 0.31, p < 0.001 for all) and with parameters of diastolic function (E/é, r = 0.4, p < 0.001).

For SUV prediction at T2, linear and non-linear models of SUV difference for a given time change were developed in a derivation group. The results were tested in an independent validation group, whilst model reproducibility was tested in patients of the validation group who have undergone a second clinically indicated scan. Applying the linear model in the derivation group, there were no statistically significant differences in measurements obtained in the examined segments: mean differences ranged from 0 ± 0.10 in SVC to 0.01 ± 0.13 in ARC between measured and predicted SUV. In contrast, in the non-linear model, there were statistically significant differences in measurements, except in ARC, with mean differences ranging from 0.04 ± 0.14 in ARC to 0.28 ± 0.13 in ABD. In the validation group using the linear model, there were no statistically significant differences, with mean differences ranging from - 0.01 ± 0.08 in ASC to - 0.03 ± 0.11 in ABD.

Research has shown that the presence of ERS could lead to biased scores and thus influence the accuracy of differential item functioning (DIF) detection. In this study, a new method under the multiple-indicators multiple-causes (MIMIC) framework is proposed as a means to eliminate the impact of ERS in DIF detection. The findings from a series of simulations showed that a difference in ERS between groups caused inflated false-positive rates and deflated true-positive rates in DIF detection when ERS was not taken into account. The modified MIMIC model, as compared to conventional MIMIC, logistic discriminant function analysis, ordinal logistic regression, and their extensions, could control false-positive rates across situations and yielded trustworthy true-positive rates.

We have validated a novel, portable, high-speed video camera-based system (Exilim EX-FH20, Casio, Tokyo, Japan) for measuring saccade reaction time (RT) and error rate in a well-lit environment. This system would enable measurements of pro- and antisaccades in athletes, which is important because antisaccade metrics provide a valid tool for concussion diagnosis and determining an athlete's safe return to play. A total of 529 trials collected from 15 participants were used to compare saccade RT and error rate measurements of the high-speed camera system to a retroreflective video-based eye tracker (Eye-Trac 6: Applied Sciences Laboratories, Bedford, MA). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the RT measurements made by the high-speed video system were 11 ms slower than those made by the retroreflective system. Error rate measurements were identical between the two systems. An excellent degree of reliability was found between the system measurements and in the ratings of independent researchers examining the video data. A strong association (r = .97) between the RTs determined via the retroreflective and high-speed camera systems was observed across all trials. Our high-speed camera system is portable and easily set up, does not require extensive equipment calibration, and can be used in a well-lit environment. Accordingly, the camera-based capture of saccadometric data may provide a valuable tool for neurological assessment following a concussive event and for the continued monitoring of recovery.",Lytic KFS-SE2 phage as a novel bio-receptor for Salmonella Enteritidis detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706346,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2019 03 20,"Since Salmonella Enteritidis is one of the major foodborne pathogens, on-site applicable rapid detection methods have been required for its control.

KFS-SE2 phage was successfully isolated at a high concentration of (2.31 ± 0.43) × 1011 PFU/ml, and consisted of an icosahedral head of 65.44 ± 10.08 nm with a non-contractile tail of 135.21 ± 12.41 nm. The morphological and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that it belongs to the Pis4avirus genus in the family of Siphoviridae. KFS-SE2 genome consisted of 48,608 bp with 45.7% of GC content. Genome analysis represented KFS-SE2 to have distinctive characteristics as a novel phage. Comparative analysis of KFS-SE2 phage with closely related strains confirmed its novelty by the presence of unique proteins. KFS-SE2 phage exhibited excellent specificity to S.

The mice in the mock (PBS) and 1.875 μg HA immunized groups succumbed by 13 days following A/California/ 04/09 infection, while all mice in groups given more than 3.75 μg HA were protected from lethal challenge with the A/California/04/09 virus. In ferrets, although immunization with even a single dose of 15 or 30 μg of HA induced detectable HI antibodies, all ferrets given two doses of vaccine seroconverted and exhibited HI titers greater than 80 units. Following challenge with A/California/04/09, the mock (PBS) immunized ferrets showed influenza-like clinical symptoms, such as increased numbers of coughs, elevated body temperature, and body weight loss, for 7 days, while GC1115- immunized ferrets showed attenuated clinical symptoms only for short time period (3-4 days). Further, GC1115-immunized ferrets displayed significantly lower viral titers in the upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity) than the mock vaccinated group in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, this study demonstrates the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GC1115 as a non-adjuvanted vaccine.",Gentic overexpression increases production of hypocrellin A in Shiraia bambusicola S4201.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706344,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2019 03 20,"Hypocrellin A (HA) is a perylenequinone (PQ) isolated from Shiraia bambusicola that shows antiviral and antitumor activities, but its application is limited by the low production from wild fruiting body. A gene overexpressing method was expected to augment the production rate of HA in S. bambusicola. However, the application of this molecular biology technology in S. bambusicola was impeded by a low genetic transformation efficiency and little genomic information. To enhance the plasmid transformant ratio, the Polyethylene Glycol-mediated transformation system was established and optimized. The following green fluorescent protein (GFP) analysis showed that the gene fusion expression system we constructed with a GAPDH promoter Pgpd1 and a rapid 2A peptide was successfully expressed in the S. bambusicola S4201 strain. We successfully obtained the HA high-producing strains by overexpressing O-methyltransferase/FAD-dependent monooxygenase gene (mono) and the hydroxylase gene (hyd), which were the essential genes involved in our putative HA biosynthetic pathway. The overexpression of these two genes increased the production of HA by about 200% and 100%, respectively. In general, this study will provide a basis to identify the genes involved in the hypocrellin A biosynthesis. This improved transformation method can also be used in genetic transformation studies of other fungi."

Awassi ewes (n = 74) were randomly assigned into one of two groups. Group one (control, n = 36) did not receive vitamin E/Se injections, and group two (vitamin E/Se, n = 38) received 13.6-mg/kg BW of vitamin E plus 0.045-mg/kg BW of Se. Concurrent with estrus-synchronization program, vitamin E/Se injections were given at the time of insertion, withdrawal, and 19 days after withdrawal of intravaginal sponges. At all injection times, serum samples were collected (20 ewes per group) to measure Se contents. Pregnancy rates were evaluated by progesterone assay and by ultrasonography, respectively, at days 19 and 40 after sponge removal. Lambing rate, singles and twins%, sex ratio (M:F), and birth weight were recorded at lambing. Vitamin E/Se injections did not affect (P > 0.25) BW at lambing or BW change of ewes from breeding to lambing. Vitamin E/Se injections tended (P = 0.08) to decrease total pregnancy losses from 44.8 to 24.3%, subsequently, injections positively improved (P < 0.05) pregnancy rates determined by progesterone assay (from 80.6 to 97.4%) and ultrasonography (from 63.9 to 86.8%). Although overall fertility was not affected, vitamin E/Se injections markedly increased the percentage of ewes that lambed after only one service from 64.0 to 93.3%. Singles and twins%, lamb sex ratio, and birth weight of lambs were not affected (P > 0.20) by vitamin E/Se injections. Under conditions of our study, multiple injections of vitamin E/Se improved the reproductive performance of estrus-synchronized ewes.",Vertical transmission of Neospora caninum in bovine fetuses from a slaughterhouse in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706331,Tropical animal health and production,2019 02 01,"Neospora caninum is considered as one of the main causes of reproductive failure in cattle. Vertical transmission is the main route of infection in the bovine host and plays an important role in maintaining the parasite in the herd. Molecular detection of N. caninum is important to determine the occurrence of the disease and to evaluate the genetic diversity of the parasite. The present study aimed at assessing the vertical transmission of N. caninum using molecular techniques to detect the parasite in tissue samples from bovine fetuses collected in a slaughterhouse in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Seventy fetuses and 70 blood samples from pregnant cows were collected in a slaughtering line. Fresh samples of heart and brain tissue from fetuses were analyzed using molecular assays. Serum samples from fetuses and cows were subjected to an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) to detect antibodies against N. caninum. Nested PCR targeting the internal transcriber 1 (ITS1) region of the protozoan organism was used in the molecular testing. From the total of fetuses examined, 71.42% were positive for N. caninum by PCR. A higher number of heart samples (47.1%) were positive for the parasite using this technique. Antibodies against the protozoa were detected in 12.9% of serum samples of cows; 2.8% of fetuses were seropositive for this pathogen. Our results show that vertical transmission of N. caninum occurs in cattle from this region of Brazil, and that the use of different diagnostic techniques contributes to successful diagnosis of congenital transmission of the parasite in cattle.",Immunoprotective role of LaSota vaccine under immunosuppressive conditions in chicken challenged with velogenic avian avulavirus-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706330,Tropical animal health and production,2019 02 01,"The first objective of the present study was to evaluate if the antibodies induced by the live LaSota and killed Newcastle disease (sub-genotype VIIi) vaccines protect the chickens against exposure with pathogenic avian avulavirus-1 (AAvV-1) of chicken and/or pigeon origins. The second objective was to study the effect of vaccines on stressed birds (dexamethasone, aflatoxin, and heat stressed) with respect to antibody production and protection against pathogenic AAvV-1 challenge. Sixty-one-day-old Hubbard chickens were divided into six groups (gA-gF) with ten animals each. All the groups received LaSota (105 EID50, 0.1 ml per chick) on days 7 and 27 via eye drop and one intramuscular injection of a killed vaccine (sub-genotype VIIi) (107.5 EID50, 1 ml) on day 18, except the control birds received the PBS only. Moreover, group gC-DEX received dexamethasone intramuscularly at a dose rate of 1-mg/kg body weight daily; gD-AFLA had received aflatoxin as oral gavage at a dose rate of 30 ppb daily, and gE-HEAT was kept under heat stressed (38 °C) till challenged. All the groups were challenged with AAvV-1 strain of chicken origin of sub-genotype VIIi, except the group gA-pigeon was challenged with pigeon-origin strain (sub-genotype VIm). The result showed that the gA-pigeon and gB-chicken vaccinate showed 100% and 80% protection. The immunosuppressive birds produced low pre-challenge HI titer, and protection was observed at 40%, 50%, and 70% in gC-DEX, gD-AFLA, and gE-HEAT, respectively. Our findings suggest the stress factors such as aflatoxin in the feed and dexamethasone are immunosuppressive in nature and suppress the immune response and its associated protective role during infection.",Oocyte quality and viability in Nguni and Hereford cows exposed to different levels of dietary protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706329,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 20,"High blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration decreases fertility in ruminants. Nguni cattle are reported to maintain BUN concentration more efficiently than other beef breeds. Our objectives were to determine if BUN concentration differed between Nguni and Hereford cows exposed to a high protein ration, and if breed or BUN and serum protein concentrations at the time of oocyte pick-up affected oocyte quantity, quality, and viability. Twelve Nguni and 10 Hereford cows were randomized into high or normal BUN-inducing diets in a crossover design. Ultrasound-guided oocyte pick-up was performed twice weekly; oocytes were counted, visually graded and the viable oocytes were pooled by treatment and breed for in vitro maturation, fertilization, and culture. Nguni cows on the highest protein ration achieved lower mean BUN concentration than Herefords (P < 0.05), and Nguni cows reached BUN concentrations above 20 mg/dL less frequently than Herefords (P = 0.03). Donor BUN concentration above 20 mg/dL at the time of oocyte pick-up, but not breed, independently decreased the number of good quality oocytes harvested. Increasing weighted mean serum albumin of donor cows was independently associated with the number of oocytes that cleaved by day 2 and that reached morula stage by day 7 (P = 0.01). In conclusion, Nguni cows reached the critical threshold of 20 mg/dL BUN less frequently than Herefords; BUN of donor cows above 20 mg/dL negatively affected visual oocyte quality independent of breed, and increasing serum albumin of donor cows improved viability of bovine oocytes.",Identification of a novel CCDC22 mutation in a patient with severe Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and aggressive natural killer cell leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706328,International journal of hematology,2019 05 20,"Aggressive natural killer cell leukemia (ANKL) is a rare neoplasm characterized by the systemic infiltration of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated NK cells, and rapidly progressive clinical course. We report the case of a 45-year-old man with intellectual disability who developed ANKL, and describe the identification of a novel genetic mutation of coiled-coil domain-containing 22 (CCDC22). He presented with persistent fever, severe pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegary. Following bone marrow aspiration, numerous hemophagocytes were identified. High EBV viral load was detected in NK cells fractionation by qPCR. The initial diagnosis was EBV-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). A combination of immunosuppressive drugs and chemotherapy was administered, but was unsuccessful in controlling the disease. Therefore, he was treated with HLA-matched related allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, his condition deteriorated within 30 days, resulting in fatal outcome. Autopsy revealed many EBV-infected NK cells infiltrating major organs, consistent with ANKL. Furthermore, whole-exome sequencing identified a novel missense mutation of the CCDC22 gene (c.112G>A, p.V38M), responsible for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). CCDC22 has been shown to play a role in NF-κB activation. Our case suggests that CCDC22 mutation might be implicated in pathogenesis of EBV-HLH and NK-cell neoplasms as well as XLID via possibly affecting NF-κB signaling.",Deregulated Polycomb functions in myeloproliferative neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706327,International journal of hematology,2019 02 01,"Polycomb proteins function in the maintenance of gene silencing via post-translational modifications of histones and chromatin compaction. Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that the repressive function of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in transcription is counteracted by the activating function of Trithorax-group complexes; this balance fine-tunes the expression of genes critical for development and tissue homeostasis. The function of PRCs is frequently dysregulated in various cancer cells due to altered expression or recurrent somatic mutations in PRC genes. The tumor suppressive functions of EZH2-containing PRC2 and a PRC2-related protein ASXL1 have been investigated extensively in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). BCOR, a component of non-canonical PRC1, suppresses various hematological malignancies including MPN. In this review, we focus on recent findings on the role of PRCs in the pathogenesis of MPN and the therapeutic impact of targeting the pathological functions of PRCs in MPN.",A New Model System for Exploring Assembly Mechanisms of the HIV-1 Immature Capsid In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706326,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 04 04,"The assembly of the HIV-1 immature capsid (HIC) is an essential step in the virus life cycle. In vivo, the HIC is composed of [Formula: see text] hexameric building blocks, and it takes 5-6 min to complete the assembly process. The involvement of numerous building blocks and the rapid timecourse makes it difficult to understand the HIC assembly process. In this work, we study HIC assembly in vivo by using differential equations. We first obtain a full model with 420 differential equations. Then, we reduce six addition reactions for separate building blocks to a single complex reaction. This strategy reduces the full model to 70 equations. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis of the reduced model shows that it might not be an effective way to decrease the HIC concentration at the equilibrium state by decreasing the microscopic on-rate constants. Based on experimental data, we estimate that the nucleating structure is much smaller than the HIC. We also estimate that the microscopic on-rate constant for nucleation reactions is far less than that for elongation reactions. The parametric collinearity investigation testifies the reliability of these two characteristics, which might explain why free building blocks do not readily polymerize into higher-order polymers until their concentration reaches a threshold value. These results can provide further insight into the assembly mechanisms of the HIC in vivo.",A Junior Doctor's Perspective on Oncology and Palliative Medicine Education in Western Australia: Comparison Between Graduation and Completion of Internship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706325,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 02 01,"Cancer is a leading cause of death in Australia and is also the leading cause of disease burden as survivorship continues to improve.

Cognitive interviews were conducted with taxi drivers at garages and community centers across New York City. Interviews were conducted in five rounds with approximately 10 interviews conducted in each round. Modifications were made to the education materials between rounds based on driver feedback. Interviews were transcribed, coded to identify areas needing improvement, and then used to modify materials. Areas that needed adaptation included colloquialisms, literacy level, complex jargon/terminology, vague/confusing phrasing, driver-specific and ethnic-specific preferences, visual aids, and mathematical calculations. These were organized into four key themes: linguistic responsiveness, occupational and cultural adaptation, visuals, and calculations. Cognitive interviewing is a useful method for refining health education materials in the diverse driver population. Cognitive interviewing revealed a need to reduce literacy level, avoid complex terminology, make further occupational and cultural adaptations, use clear visual aids, and avoid the use of complex calculations. Cognitive interviewing is an effective method for refining health education materials for immigrant and low literacy populations.",Carcinosarcoma of Vater's papilla: case report of a rare neoplasm and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706323,Surgical case reports,2019 02 26,"Carcinosarcoma is a rare tumor that includes both carcinoma and sarcoma components.

Sixteen spouses/partners were included as well. Couple satisfaction from the patient perspective was never associated with depression or anxiety. However, poor marital adjustment (i.e., difference and absolute difference between patients and spouses/partners MSS-14 scores) predicted patients' pre-operative depressive mood. Longitudinal analyses showed that couple satisfaction (n = 9) worsened at 12 months and 18 months compared to pre-DBS scores, F(2.047, 16.378) = 8.723, p = .003, and despite concomitant motor improvement. Growth curve analyses showed that couple satisfaction worsening occurred between 6 and 12 months post-operatively (b = 2.938, p < .001).

The increasing incidence, low survival rate, and limited treatment opportunities necessitate the use of alternative approaches such as chemoprevention, to tackle PC. In this study, we report significant synergistic chemoprevention efficacy for the first time from a low-dose combination of a classical antihistaminic drug, Loratadine (LOR) and a neutraceutical compound, Sulforaphane (SFN) using a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulation. The formulation was developed using Quality by Design approach (globule size, 95.13 ± 7.9 nm; PDI, 0.17 ± 0.04) and revealed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement in the in vitro dissolution profile confirming the enhanced solubility of BCS class II drug LOR with SMEDDS formulation. The LOR-SFN combination revealed ~ 40-fold reduction in IC50 concentration compared to LOR alone in MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cell lines respectively, confirming the synergistic enhancement in chemoprevention. Further, the nanoformulation resulted in ~ 7-fold and ~ 11-fold reduction in IC50 values compared to LOR-SFN combination. Hence, our studies successfully demonstrate that a unique low-dose combination of LOR encapsulated within SMEDDs with SFN shows significantly enhanced chemopreventive efficacy of PC.",Mitochondrial transplantation as a potential and novel master key for treatment of various incurable diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706303,Cytotechnology,2019 05 05,"Mitochondria are attractive cellular organelles which are so interesting in both basic and clinical research, especially after it was found that they were arisen as a bacterial intruder in ancient cells. Interestingly, even now, they are the focus of many investigations and their function and relevance to health and disease have remained open questions. More recently, research on mitochondria have turned out their potential application in medicine as a novel therapeutic intervention. The importance of this issue is highlighted when we know that mitochondrial dysfunction can be observed in a variety of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia, diabetes, renal failure, skeletal muscles disorders, liver diseases, burns, aging, and cancer progression. In other words, transplantation of viable mitochondria into the injured tissues would replace or augment damaged mitochondria, allowing the rescue of cells and restoration of the normal function. Therefore, mitochondrial transplantation would be revolutionary for the treatment of a variety of diseases in which conventional therapies have proved unsuccessful. Here, we describe pieces of evidence of mitochondrial transplantation, discuss and highlight the current and future directions to show why mitochondrial transplantation could be a master key for treatment of a variety of diseases or injuries.",Practicing Medicine with Colleagues: Pitfalls from Social Psychology Science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706302,Journal of general internal medicine,2019 04 18,"This perspective reviews three pitfalls from psychology science that can distort clinical assessments and contribute to interpersonal conflicts. One pitfall is the illusion that one's own subjective perceptions or judgments are objective observations or interpretations that reasonable colleagues would share. A second pitfall involves self-serving situational attributions rather than disposition attributions for explaining missteps after things go wrong. A third pitfall is confirmation bias that leads to a perseverance of erroneous beliefs, a tendency to mostly seek supportive colleagues, and a failure to check for dissenting viewpoints. An awareness of these three pitfalls may help clinicians improve patient care when practicing with colleagues.","Fecal coagulase-negative staphylococci from horses, their species variability, and biofilm formation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706301,Folia microbiologica,2019 02 01,"The intestinal microbiota has enormous impact on the health and performance of horses. Staphylococci belong in the phylum Firmicutes, and their occurrence, especially of methicillin-resistant strains and species, has been reported in horses previously. Moreover, biofilm formation is one of the virulence factors; it has been not completely studied in fecal coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from horses. Therefore, this study was focused on biofilm formation by various species of fecal CoNS from horses because it has been never reported before. In addition, their antibiotic profile was tested. Horses (42) of various breeds from Slovakia/Poland were sampled. Variability in the species of CoNS was detected in feces of horses. Thirty-two strains were identified by using the MALDI-TOF system and classified into nine species and three subspecies of CoNS: Staphylococcus capitis, S. cohnii subsp. cohnii, S. cohnii subsp. urealyticus, S. cohnii subsp. casei, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. pasteuri, S. sciuri, S. vitulinus, S. warneri, and S. xylosus. The most frequent species was S. vitulinus. Twenty-two strains showed high biofilm production; 10 strains showed low-grade biofilm production. The highest biofilm formation was measured in the species S. xylosus. Eleven strains (of 32) were methicillin-resistant; the others were susceptible to methicillin.",Stb5p is involved in Kluyveromyces lactis response to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706300,Folia microbiologica,2019 02 01,"In yeast, the STB5 gene encodes a transcriptional factor belonging to binuclear cluster class (Zn2Cys6) of transcriptional regulators specific to ascomycetes.

We showed that KlSTB5 gene is able to complement the deficiencies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae stb5Δ mutant. The results of phenotypic analysis suggested that KlSTB5 gene deletion did not sensitize K. lactis cells to oxidative stress inducing compounds but led to Klstb5Δ resistance to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and hygromycin B. Expression analysis indicated that the loss of KlSTB5 gene function induced the transcription of drug efflux pump encoding genes that might contribute to increased 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and hygromycin B tolerance.

Wharton's jelly was used due to its similarity with articular cartilage in extracellular matrix composition. Also, silk fibroin has good mechanical properties which make this construct appropriate for cartilage repair. Decellularization of Wharton's jelly was verified by DAPI staining, DNA quantification, and PCR analysis. Then, the biochemical composition of DEWJ was determined by ELISA kits for total proteins, collagens, sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). After fabricating pure SF and SF/DEWJ hybrid hydrogels, their physical and mechanical properties were characterized by FESEM, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and rheological assays (amplitude and frequency sweeps). Furthermore, cell viability and proliferation were assessed by MTT assay. The results have shown that DEWJ in hybrid hydrogels enhances mechanical properties of the construct relative to pure SF hydrogels. Also, this extract at its 40% concentration in culture media and 20% or 40% concentrations in SF/DEWJ hybrid hydrogels significantly increases population of the cells compared to control and pure SF hydrogel after 7 days. In conclusion, this study proposes the potential of SF/DEWJ hybrid hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering applications.",The role of real-time PCR testing in the investigation of paediatric patients with community-onset osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706296,Irish journal of medical science,2019 02 01,"Culture yield in osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is low, emphasising the role for molecular techniques.",Clinical impact of rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for group B Streptococcus (GBS) in term women with ruptured membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706295,Irish journal of medical science,2019 02 01,Early-onset group B Streptococcus (EOGBS/GBS) infection remains a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.,The nature of ligand efficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706294,Journal of cheminformatics,2019 02 01,"Ligand efficiency is a widely used design parameter in drug discovery. It is calculated by scaling affinity by molecular size and has a nontrivial dependency on the concentration unit used to express affinity that stems from the inability of the logarithm function to take dimensioned arguments. Consequently, perception of efficiency varies with the choice of concentration unit and it is argued that the ligand efficiency metric is not physically meaningful nor should it be considered to be a metric. The dependence of ligand efficiency on the concentration unit can be eliminated by defining efficiency in terms of sensitivity of affinity to molecular size and this is illustrated with reference to fragment-to-lead optimizations. Group efficiency and fit quality are also examined in detail from a physicochemical perspective. The importance of examining relationships between affinity and molecular size directly is stressed throughout this study and an alternative to ligand efficiency for normalization of affinity with respect to molecular size is presented."

In this study, we report a simple protocol for the purification of recombinant untagged Campylobacter jejuni Fur (CjFur). CjFur was isolated using a combination of three ion exchange chromatography steps followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75. ESI-MS analysis shows that our method yields pure CjFur and that this tag-free version incorporates metal more efficiently than recombinant CjFur harboring a tag or tag remnants. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that this new purification method yields a CjFur preparation that binds DNA more efficiently. These results suggest that adding a N-terminus tag onto CjFur is detrimental to its activity. Overall, the approaches detailed in this study offer an alternative strategy for the purification of CjFur, and likely other metalloregulators, for future biochemical and biophysical studies.",Mechanisms of Resistance to Insect Herbivores in Isolated Breeding Lineages of Cucurbita pepo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706281,Journal of chemical ecology,2019 05 22,"Although crop wild ancestors are often reservoirs of resistance traits lost during domestication, examining diverse cultivated germplasm may also reveal novel resistance traits due to distinct breeding histories. Using ten cultivars from two independent domestication events of Cucurbita pepo (ssp. pepo and texana), we identified divergences in constitutive and induced resistance measured by growth of generalist caterpillars and leaf traits. C. p. texana cultivars were consistently more resistant to Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera exigua, and this was not due to expected mechanisms including cucurbitacins, nitrogen, sticky phloem sap, or toxicity. Although more susceptible on average, C. p. pepo cultivars showed stronger induced resistance, suggesting a trade-off between constitutive and induced resistance. To test the hypothesis that leaf volatiles accounted for differences in resistance to caterpillars, we devised a novel method to evaluate resistance on artificial diet while larvae are exposed to leaf volatiles. In both subspecies, cultivar-specific induced volatiles that reduced T. ni growth were present in highly inducible cultivars, but absent in those that showed no induction. These results have important agricultural implications as cultivar-specific resistance to caterpillars mirrored that of specialist beetles from field trials. Overall, the eponymous cucurbitacin defenses of the Cucurbitaceae are not the mechanistic basis of differences in constitutive or induced resistance between C. pepo subspecies or cultivars. Instead, deterrent cultivar-specific volatiles appear to provide general resistance to insect herbivores. Divergence during breeding history within and between subspecies revealed this pattern and novel resistance mechanism, defining new targets for plant breeding.",Effects of Pheromone Dose and Conspecific Density on the Use of Aggregation-Sex Pheromones by the Longhorn Beetle Phymatodes grandis and Sympatric Species (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706280,Journal of chemical ecology,2019 05 22,"Many species of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) utilize male-produced aggregation-sex pheromones that attract both sexes. However, the reasons why and the details of how this type of pheromone is used by cerambycids and other coleopteran species that utilize analogous male-produced pheromones remain unclear. Thus, our goals were to test the hypotheses that 1) cerambycids respond to pheromones in a dose-dependent (= release rate-dependent) manner and 2) pheromone emission is density-dependent. If true, these characteristics of pheromone use could suggest that cerambycids utilize an optimal density strategy to limit competition for scarce and ephemeral hosts, i.e., the stressed or dying trees that typically constitute their larval hosts. Attraction of beetles to a range of release rates of two common pheromone components - 2-methylbutanol and 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one - was tested in field trials. Responses, as measured by the number of beetles caught in pheromone-baited traps, increased with release rates for five endemic species, even at the highest rates tested (~1450 μg/h for 2-methylbutanol and ~720 μg/h for 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one). The effect of density of conspecific males on per capita pheromone production was tested by collecting the volatiles produced by individuals, pairs, or groups of three or four male Phymatodes grandis Casey. Frequency of pheromone production was significantly different among the treatment densities, and emission rates of the pheromone (R)-2-methylbutanol decreased with increasing density. These results are discussed in the context of a possible optimal density strategy used by cerambycids, and more broadly, in relation to the use of male-produced aggregation-sex pheromones by other coleopterans. In addition, we report the identification of the pheromones of four of our five test species, specifically, Phymatodes obliquus Casey, Brothylus conspersus LeConte, Brothylus gemmulatus LeConte, and Xylotrechus albonotatus Casey.","Hydrophobicity, rather than secondary structure, is essential for the SRP dependent targeting of GPR35 to the ER membrane.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706279,Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,2019 04 16,"The folding and targeting of hydrophobic transmembrane domains poses a major challenge to the cell. Several membrane proteins have been shown to gain some degree of secondary structure within the ribosome tunnel and to retain this conformation throughout maturation. However, there is little information on one of the largest classes of eukaryotic membrane proteins; the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study we show that the signal anchor domain of GPR35 remains in an extended conformation whilst exiting the ribosome tunnel, the polypeptide chain then forms interactions with components of the SRP targeting pathway, and the Sec61 translocon, resulting in a compacted conformation prior to integration into the ER membrane. We conclude that transmembrane structure is most likely adopted after the domain leaves the ribosome tunnel and that the interaction of the signal anchor with SRP is dependent on the native levels of hydrophobicity within the first transmembrane domain. Therefore, we propose a mechanism by which the first transmembrane domains of multi-spanning membrane proteins adopt compacted structures following SRP targeting but before insertion into the ER membrane.",Biodegradation of anthracene and different PAHs by a yellow laccase from Leucoagaricus gongylophorus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706277,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 29,"Laccases produced by Leucoagaricus gongylophorus act in lignocellulose degradation and detoxification processes. Therefore, the use of L. gongylophorus laccase (Lac1Lg) was proposed in this work for degradation of anthracene and others polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons without the use of mediators. Degradation reactions were performed in buffer aqueous solution with 10 ppm of anthracene and other PAHs, Tween-20 in 0.25% v/v and a laccase preparation of 50 U. The optimum condition (pH 6.0 and 30 °C) was determined by response surface methodology with an excellent coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.97 and an adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj) of 0.93. In addition, the employment of the mediator ABTS decreased the anthracene biodegradation from 44 ± 1% to 30 ± 1%. This optimum pH of 6.0 suggests that the reaction occurs by a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Additionally, in 24 h Lac1Lg biodegraded 72 ± 1% anthracene, 40 ± 3% fluorene and 25 ± 3% phenanthrene. The yellow laccase from L. gongylophorus biodegraded anthracene and produced anthrone and anthraquinone, which are interesting compounds for industrial applications. Moreover, this enzyme also biodegraded the PAHs phenanthrene and fluorene justifying the study of Lac1Lg for bioremediation of these compounds in the environment.",Techno-economic assessment of coconut biodiesel as a potential alternative fuel for compression ignition engines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706276,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 29,"Over the past years, there were dramatic improvements in identifying and assessing various feedstocks for the production of biodiesel fuels. To promote a particular feedstock as a renewable source of energy, it is important to analyze their energy, economic, and engine performance characteristics. The current work attempts to evaluate the net energy and economic indices for both fossil diesel and coconut-blended diesel (B20) considering the diesel consumption by the Indian railways. Further, we present the experimental results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated with neat coconut biodiesel (B100) and fossil diesel at various load and speed conditions. The engine experiments reveal that the coconut biodiesel exhibits leaner combustion and shorter ignition delay than fossil diesel. Lower amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emission is observed in the case of coconut biodiesel, with higher levels of nitric oxide (14%) and fuel consumption than diesel. The coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure is within the range of better driveability zone for both the fuels at all test conditions. Overall the engine performance, emission and combustion results with neat coconut biodiesel are favorable with a penalty in NO emission at high load conditions. The techno-economical study highlights higher production cost per liter of B20 than the cost of fossil diesel. However, the net energy ratio (NER) for B20 is 1.021, favoring higher output than diesel and thus lowers the dependency on crude oil.",Simultaneous adsorption and immobilization of As and Cd by birnessite-loaded biochar in water and soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706275,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 10,"A novel biochar was prepared by loading birnessite to improve its capability to simultaneously adsorb As(III), As(V), and Cd(II) in water and soil. Layer sheet-structured birnessite was successfully loaded onto the biochar surface with increased functional groups. SEM, XRD, and FTIR combining with XPS analysis were utilized to characterize birnessite-loaded biochar and its adsorption mechanisms for As and Cd(II). The saturated adsorption capabilities of the birnessite-loaded biochar (BRB) for As(III), As(V), and Cd(II) were as large as 3543, 2412, and 9068 mg/kg (calculated by Langmuir isotherm model), much higher than for the corresponding non-loaded biochar (no adsorption of As, 4335 mg/kg for Cd). Adsorption of Cd and As onto BRB was controlled by multi mechanisms; Cd(II) appeared to coordinate to vacant sites of birnessite, while As formed surface complex with functional groups. Furthermore, BRB showed higher abilities for co-adsorption of As(III) and Cd or As(V) and Cd, which may be due to the formation of Cd3(AsO4)2 surface precipitate as well as synergistic reaction between anions and cations. After conditioning to soil, BRB showed potential for Cd and As remediation under both flooded and unflooded conditions. These results suggested that BRB can be used as an effective sorbent for simultaneous immobilization of heavy metals, especially As and Cd, in environmental and agricultural systems.",Role of PTP/PTK trans activated insulin-like signalling pathway in regulation of grasshopper (Oedaleus asiaticus) development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706274,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 06,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTKs) genes are responsible for the regulation of insect insulin-like pathway (ILP), cells growth, metabolism initiation, gene transcription and observing immune response. Signal transduction in insect cell is also associated with PTPs and PTKs. The grasshopper (Oedaleus asiaticus) 'Bey-Bienko' were treated with dsRNA of protein tyrosine non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) and protein tyrosine kinase 5 (PTK5) along with control (water). Applying dsPTK5 treatments in 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus, significant reduction was recorded in body dry mass, growth rate and overall performance except survival rate. Whereas with PTPN4, no such significant impact on all of these growth parameters was recorded. Expression of genes in ILP 5th instar of Oedaleus asiaticus by the application of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 revealed that PTK, INSR (insulin receptor), IRS (insulin receptor substrate), PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), PDK (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B) and FOXO (forkhead transcription factor) significantly expressed with downregulation except PTPN4, which remained non-significant. On the other hand, the phosphorylation level of ILP four proteins in O. asiaticus with the treatment of dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5 significantly affected P-IRS and P-FOXO, while P-INSR and P-AKT remained stable at the probability level of 5%. This indicated that the stress response in the O. asiaticus insulin-like signalling pathway (ILP) reduced. Regarding association of protective enzymatic activities, ROS (relative oxygen species), CAT (catalase) and PO (phenol oxidase) increased significantly with exposure to dsPTK5 as compared to dsPTPN4 and control, while exposure of 5th instar of O. asiaticus to dsPTPN4 treatment slightly raised CAT and PO activities with but significant contribution. No such significant effect on MFO and POD was seen using dsPTPN4 and dsPTK5. This showed that in the ILP of O. asiaticus, PTK5 was detrimental to growth, body mass and overall performance, which ultimately benefited insect detoxification with high-energy cost.",Parametric and non-parametric convergence analysis of electricity intensity in developed and developing countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706273,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 10,"This paper examines the pattern of convergence in electricity intensity in a sample of 79 countries. We apply the residual augmented least squares regression to the convergence of energy intensity. This method has been used in the convergence of per capita energy consumption but not convergence of energy intensity. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous studies which mainly used the conventional beta convergence approach to examine conditional convergence, we use a beta convergence method that is capable of identifying the actual number of countries that contribute to conditional convergence. The sigma and gamma convergences of electricity intensity are also examined. In addition to the full sample of countries, we also examine convergence in African countries, Asian and Oceanic countries, American countries and European countries, separately. Convergences in OECD and non-OECD countries are also examined, separately. In the full sample, the results show convergence exists in 54% of the countries in the total sample. There is convergence in 65% of the African countries, 61% of the American countries, 43% of the Asian and Oceanic countries and 33% of the European countries. In terms of the regional classification, it is also observed that convergence exists for 58% of the non-OECD countries and 31% of the OECD countries. There is evidence for sigma convergence in all the blocs with the exception of European and non-OECD countries. With the exception of African countries, there is evidence for gamma convergence in all the countries and the various blocs. The policy implications of the results are discussed."

However, information regarding the effects of biochar on the carbon cycle in paddy fields under water-saving irrigation remains limited. Thus, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biochar addition on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and soil organic carbon (SOC) content of paddy fields under water-saving irrigation in the Taihu Lake region of China. Four treatments were applied: controlled irrigation (CI) without biochar addition as the control (CA), CI with biochar addition at a rate of 20 t·ha-1 (CB), CI with biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha-1 (CC), and flooding irrigation (FI) with biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha-1 (FC). Biochar addition increased rice yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) by 24.0-36.3 and 33.4-42.5%, respectively, compared with the control. In addition, biochar addition increased the NEE of CI paddy fields. The average NEE of paddy fields under CB and CC was 2.41 and 30.6% higher than that under CA, respectively. Thus, the increasing effect of biochar addition at a rate of 40 t·ha-1 was considerably better than those of the other treatments. Apart from biochar addition, irrigation mode was also identified as an influencing factor. CI management increased the NEE of paddy fields by 17.6% compared with FI management. Compared with CA, CB increased total net CO2 absorption by 10.0%, whereas CC decreased total net CO2 absorption by 13.8%. Biochar addition also increased SOC, dissolved organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon contents. Therefore, the joint regulation of biochar addition and water-saving irrigation is a good technique for maintaining rice yield, increasing IWUE, and promoting soil fertility. Furthermore, when amended at the rate of 20 t·ha-1, biochar addition will be a good strategy for sequestering carbon in paddy fields.",Presence of multiple abnormal immunologic markers is an independent prognostic factor of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706260,Frontiers of medicine,2019 03 29,"Autoimmune diseases (ADs) increase the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and contribute to poor prognosis of patients. However, the association between immunologic markers and clinical outcome has rarely been investigated. This study aims to analyze the prognostic value of pretreatment immunologic markers in newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We retrospectively reviewed the data on 502 patients with DLBCL treated in our institution from January 2013 to March 2018. Survival functions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. The 3-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 70.2% and 80.9%, respectively, and the complete remission (CR) rate was 78.1%. Among the patients, those with multiple ( ⩾ 3) abnormal immunologic markers had significantly shorter 3-year PFS (52.7% vs. 77.3%, P < 0.001) and OS (68.5% vs. 85.8%, P = 0.001) than those without multiple abnormal immunologic markers. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of multiple abnormal immunologic markers and the elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase were the independent adverse prognostic factors for PFS (P = 0.008, P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.003, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, advanced Ann Arbor stage was an independent adverse prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.001) and age > 60 years for OS (P = 0.014). In conclusion, the immunologic status was closely related to lymphoma progression, and this study provides new insights into the risk stratification of patients with DLBCL.",Impact of medicaid policy changes on immigrant parents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706259,International journal of health economics and management,2019 02 01,"During the 1990s and early 2000s many states expanded Medicaid eligibility for parents particularly after the 1996 welfare reform. At the same time, welfare reform also put in place policies that limited the eligibility of recent immigrants for public programs including Medicaid. This paper evaluates the effects of these changes in Medicaid eligibility policy on the private and public health insurance coverage of immigrants as well as the overall insurance rate. It also looks at the effect on health care use and measures of health status. The findings indicate a significant increase in Medicaid coverage and an increase in the proportion insured overall with negligible crowd-out of private insurance. There is also an increase in the use of health care services. In the case of permanent residents, there is a diminished response to Medicaid eligibility changes possibly due to a ""chilling effect"".",Phase analysis single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) detects dyssynchrony in myocardial scar and increases specificity of MPI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706258,EJNMMI research,2019 02 26,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is commonly used to assess patients with cardiovascular disease. However, in certain scenarios, it may have limited specificity in the identification of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (e.g., false positive), potentially resulting in additional unnecessary testing and treatment. Phase analysis (PA) is an emerging, highly reproducible quantitative technology that can differentiate normal myocardial activation (synchrony) from myocardial scar (dyssynchrony). The objective of this study is to determine if PA can improve the specificity SPECT MPI.",An acute stroke CT imaging algorithm incorporating automated perfusion analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706257,Emergency radiology,2019 05 10,"In this paper, we propose a CT imaging algorithm for patients presenting with suspected acute stroke that incorporates automated CT perfusion (CTP) imaging. The algorithm details evaluation of the non-contrast CT (NCCT) for hemorrhage and acute ischemia, calculation of ASPECTS, with performance and interpretation of CTP if appropriate. In particular, we consider the key steps in expeditious interpretation of non-contrast CT and CT angiography in the context of suspected acute ischemic stroke. Given the recent expansion of the ""imaging based"" treatment window for thrombectomy from 6 to 24 h in the 2018 American Heart Association stroke guidelines, we consider the key criteria in the decision to perform CT perfusion and the patient cohorts in which this might be most helpful. We also describe how imaging findings might be incorporated into the treatment paradigm for suspected with acute ischemic stroke and we allude to some of the most frequently encountered pitfalls associated with CTP which we think will be particularly helpful for radiologists and stroke physicians who are considering adding CT perfusion to their work-up for acute stroke.",Closure of foramen ovale triggered by injury to tunnel surfaces of septum primum and secundum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706256,Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,2019 06 15,We investigated the feasibility to proactively stimulate subsequent closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) by injuring (mechanical trauma or radiofrequency [RF] energy) the opposing surfaces of the septum primum (SP) and septum secundum (SS).,Catheter ablation for failed surgical maze: comparison of cut and sew vs. non-cut and sew maze.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706254,Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,2019 02 01,To compare findings in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation(AF) and/or atrial flutter(AFl) ablation after failed cut and sew (CS) vs. non-cut and sew (NCS) surgical maze.,Associated vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for the complication of HCV-related liver cirrhosis including hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706253,Internal and emergency medicine,2019 02 01,"The influence of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), deficiency on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis had been poorly elucidated especially in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of SBP or HE, including the mortality rate. Serum 25(OH)D levels were prospectively determined in 135 patients. Of them, 45 patients had complications with HE and 45 patients had complications with SBP; 45 cirrhotic patients without complication served as the control group. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/ml. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test were used in our statistical analysis. Predictors of survival were determined using Cox regression analysis. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the HE and SBP groups than in the control group (6.81 ± 2.75, 7.15 ± 2.10, 16.28 ± 6.60, respectively). Moreover, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the high HE grade than in the low grade (P < 0.001). Regarding the SBP group, classic SBP was associated with lower 25(OH)D levels compared to other types (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed that lower 25(OH)D levels less than 7.1 ng/ml and 6.6 ng/ml could predict the mortality in SBP and HE patients, respectively, with high sensitivity and specificity. Serum 25(OH)D levels < 5 ng/ml were associated with significant higher mortality rate (HR = 2.76, P = 0.001). Lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with HE and SBP in cirrhotic patients. In addition, it may be considered a prognostic parameter for the severity of liver cirrhosis.",Step-down units are cost-effective alternatives to coronary care units with non-inferior outcomes in the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706252,Internal and emergency medicine,2019 02 01,"Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) within a door-to-balloon timing of 90 min have greatly decreased mortality and morbidity of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Post-PCI, they are routinely transferred into the coronary care unit (CCU) regardless of the severity of their condition, resulting in frequent CCU overcrowding. This study assesses the feasibility of step-down units (SDUs) as an alternative to CCUs in the management of STEMI patients after successful PCI, to alleviate CCU overcrowding. Criteria of assessment include in-hospital complications, length of stay, cost-effectiveness, and patient outcomes up to a year after discharge from hospital. A retrospective case-control study was done using data of 294 adult STEMI patients admitted to the emergency departments of two training and research hospitals and successfully underwent primary PCI from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015. Patients were followed up for a year post-discharge. Student t test and χ2 test were done as univariate analysis to check for statistical significance of p < 0.05. Further regression analysis was done with respect to primary outcomes to adjust for major confounders. Patients managed in the SDU incurred significantly lower inpatient costs (p = 0.0003). No significant differences were found between the CCU and SDU patients in terms of patient characteristics, PCI characteristics, in-hospital complications, length of stay, and patient outcomes up to a year after discharge. The SDU is a viable cost-effective option for managing STEMI patients after successful primary PCI to avoid CCU overcrowding, with non-inferior patient outcomes as compared to the CCU.",Exploring the Variability in Reaction Times of Preschoolers at Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: an ex-Gaussian Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706251,Journal of abnormal child psychology,2019 02 01,"Reaction times (RTs) are typically slower and more variable in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Analysis of the ex-Gaussian RT distribution, which is described by mu, sigma (mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the normal distribution) and tau (that of exponential distribution), reveals that individuals with ADHD do not display overall slower RTs but have a high proportion of extremely slow RTs, represented by a high tau value. Although this is a vital component for describing ADHD-related RT variability in school-aged children, adolescents, and adults, it has not been thoroughly studied at the preschool age. We assessed 65 preschoolers at risk of ADHD and 98 typically developing preschoolers with the Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) and parental and teacher reports of ADHD symptoms. We found that preschoolers at risk of ADHD had greater values for RT standard deviation, sigma, and tau than typically developing preschoolers at long inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) (3 s), but not at short ISIs (1.5 s). This suggests that attention problems in preschool children may only be apparent in the tasks with a relatively slow event rate. Our study demonstrates that the ex-Gaussian tau value is essential for describing the inattentive component of task performance in preschoolers with heightened ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, the fact that the tau effect was modulated by ISI suggests that the longer duration (3 s vs. 1.5 s) is a non-optimal energetic state in preschoolers at risk of ADHD, and that this might account for the subtle attentional flaw in task performance."

The environmental protection area of Lageado is located in an urban area and provides approximately 12% of the water supplied to the municipality. Knowing the relationship between soil occupancy and population density, which may cause harmful effects to the quality of surface water and water resources, is fundamental. The present study aims to analyse the physical-chemical parameters of water samples collected at three different times and in six distinct points in Lageado. To verify whether the transformation of this watershed into a conservation unit resulted in the maintenance of water quality, the statistical analyses considered the significance and correlation among the following parameters: water quality index (WQI); dissolved aluminium, iron and copper; Escherichia coli; nitrate; ammoniacal nitrogen; Kjeldahl nitrogen; chemical oxygen demand; and chlorophyll α. The results show that the formal creation of the environmental protection area of Lageado did not provide the effective improvement or maintenance of its environmental conditions. Statistically, there were decreases in the WQI over the studied period, which demonstrates that the creation of a conservation unit is, in itself, not sufficient and it lacks the implementation of effective programmes and actions related to the soil use, occupancy and water quality.","Monitoring and exposure assessment of organophosphorus flame retardants in source and drinking water, Nanjing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706205,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 03 12,"This study developed a new method to determine the residues of 13 organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) in drinking water by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) technique and investigated the chemical distribution in water samples from municipal plants along the Yangtze River in Nanjing. The linear calibration correlation coefficients R2 for all 13 OPFRs were at least 0.998 0. Three levels of spiked test were performed. Most of the recoveries were in the range of 80~120%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the 13 OPFRs were 2.1~17% (n = 6). Five OPFRs were 100% positively detected in the samples, and 3 OPFRs were positively detected in some samples. The concentrations of detected OPFR in the water ranged from 0.7 to 5780.0 ng L-1. The average concentrations of OPFRs in wet season were higher than those in dry season, and the contaminants mainly originated from the source water in the Yangtze River.

In order to find a disposal site, analysis of spatial data, laws, and large socioeconomic and environmental criteria is required. Multi-criteria analysis techniques coupled with GIS capabilities can be a good solution for this. Due to numerous industrial units, especially refineries in Bushehr province, it is essential to find a management solution for hazardous wastes of this province. The main objective of this study is to find an optimal location which has the lowest environmental risk and economically favorable. For this purpose, ecological and socioeconomic criteria were identified and normalized by fuzzy method. The weight of the parameters was determined by analytical network process method combined with the weighted linear combination method. In the capability of the area to locate the hazardous waste disposal, the results showed that the highest weight belonged to ecological criteria (61.34%) and land use (0.27), respectively. Also, 6.13% of the province areas are identified with high potentials for disposal of hazardous wastes. The results of this study showed the importance and significant weight of environmental criteria in prioritizing the proposed areas for disposal of this type of waste.

Odds ratios were computed to determine if the association between religiosity and MDE differed based on age of adolescent among 12-13-year-olds, 14-15-year-olds, and 16-17-year-olds. Results indicated that 9.7% of adolescents reported having an MDE within the past year. Past-year MDE did not differ based on religious attendance for any of the three age groups. However, 12-13- and 14-15-year-olds who did not feel their religious beliefs influence how they make decisions in their life were at increased risk for a past-year MDE. For 15-16-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds, those who did not feel it was important that their friends share their religious beliefs were at increased risk for a past-year MDE. Such findings appear to indicate that certain aspects of religiosity may provide a significant protective effect against adolescent MDE. Prevention professionals and health educators should consider these findings to help bolster ongoing and future MDE prevention efforts. Recommendations for future research are provided.","Archetype Development Process: A Case Study of Support Interoperability among Electronic Health Record in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706199,Journal of medical systems,2019 05 28,"The interoperability among electronic medical records requires a standard that guarantees the semantic persistency of information.

Here, we report the first case of canine A. caninus infection in Japan. A castrated Japanese Shiba Inu (6 years old; weight, 12.5 kg) was referred to the Yamaguchi University Animal Medical Center, Yamaguchi, Japan, in June 2017 showing vitality loss and depression. Computed tomography revealed iliac and splenic hilum lymphopathies, and histologic examination of an iliac lymph node by biopsy revealed granulomatous lesions with numerous oval to round yeast-like fungal cells. Aspergillus caninus was isolated from the biopsy samples, and in vitro susceptibility tests of the isolate to the antifungal drugs amphotericin B (AMB), fluconazole (FLZ), itraconazole (ITZ), voriconazole (VRZ), and micafungin (MCF) were performed by the E-test method. The isolate from this dog exhibited a minimal inhibitory concentration of < 0.002 µg/ml to AMB, > 256 µg/ml to FLZ, < 0.002 µg/ml to ITZ, < 0.002 µg/ml to VRZ, and < 0.002 µg/ml to MCF, indicating that the isolate was not susceptible to FLZ and susceptible to AMB, ITZ, VRZ, and MCF. Since the response of the patient dog to ITZ and VRZ treatments was poor, more aggressive management using combination therapies of ITZ with other antifungals may be necessary for treating canine A. caninus infection in dogs.",Dopaminergic denervation using [123I]-FPCIT and pain in Parkinson's disease: a correlation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706197,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 03 10,"In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormal activations of nociceptive brain areas and lowered pain thresholds were reported, probably reflecting a central modification of pain processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible correlation between the striatal and extrastriatal dopaminergic system and pain threshold in PD patients. We included 25 PD patients with various intensities of central pain (visual analog scale). Subjective pain threshold (thermotest) and a motor examination (UPDRS III) were performed. Patients underwent SPECT imaging with [123I]-FP-CIT. We analyzed the correlation between [123I]-FP-CIT binding and subjective pain threshold, using a simple linear regression model for striatal uptake and a voxel-based approach for extrastriatal uptake. The covariables were age, sex, duration of PD, and UPDRS motor score. A pain matrix mask was also used to identify clusters in relation with pain matrix. Striatal analysis revealed that [123I]-FP-CIT binding was negatively correlated with age (p = 0.02), duration of PD (p = 0.0002) and UPDRS motor score (p = 0.006), but no correlation with pain threshold was observed. The extrastriatal analysis showed a positive correlation between [123I]-FP-CIT binding and subjective heat pain threshold for the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p < 0.001) and negative correlations for the right secondary visual cortex (p < 0.001) and left insula (p < 0.001). When applying the pain matrix mask, correlations remained significant only in the left PCC and the left insula. We suggest that pain perception abnormalities in PD are not directly related to striatal dopaminergic dysfunction. Painful sensations may be related to extrastriatal monoaminergic systems."

Such genetically driven forms of hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathies are chronic, debilitating diseases that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction and frequently progress to heart failure (HF). Locus and allelic heterogeneity, as well as clinical variability combined with genetic and phenotypic overlap between different cardiomyopathies, have challenged proper clinical prognosis and provided an incentive for identification of pathogenic variants. This review attempts to provide an overview of inherited cardiomyopathies with a focus on their genetic etiology in myosin regulatory (RLC) and essential (ELC) light chains, which are EF-hand protein family members with important structural and regulatory roles. From the clinical discovery of cardiomyopathy-linked light chain mutations in patients to an array of exploratory studies in animals, and reconstituted and recombinant systems, we have summarized the current state of knowledge on light chain mutations and how they induce physiological disease states via biochemical and biomechanical alterations at the molecular, tissue, and organ levels. Cardiac myosin RLC phosphorylation and the N-terminus ELC have been discussed as two important emerging modalities with important implications in the regulation of myosin motor function, and thus cardiac performance. A comprehensive understanding of such triggers is absolutely necessary for the development of target-specific rescue strategies to ameliorate or reverse the effects of myosin light chain-related inherited cardiomyopathies.",SGK1-dependent stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cell osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation by interleukin-18.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706178,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2019 06 10,"The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is a key regulator of osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation and subsequent calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The phenotypical transdifferentiation of VSMCs is associated with increased interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels and generalized inflammation. Therefore, the present study investigated the possible involvement of SGK1 in IL-18-induced vascular calcification. Experiments were performed in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) treated with recombinant human IL-18 protein in control or high phosphate conditions and following SGK1 knockdown by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of SGK1, PI3K, and PDK1. As a result, IL-18 treatment increased SGK1 mRNA and protein expression in HAoSMCs. IL-18 upregulated SGK1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was paralleled by upregulation of the mRNA expression of MSX2 and CBFA1, osteogenic transcription factors, and of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), an osteogenic enzyme, as markers of increased osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation. Phosphate treatment increased SGK1 and osteogenic markers mRNA expression as well as ALPL activity and induced calcification of HAoSMCs, all effects significantly augmented by additional treatment with IL-18. Conversely, silencing of SGK1 or cotreatment with the SGK1 inhibitor EMD638683 blunted the effects of IL-18 on osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of HAoSMCs. The procalcific effects of IL-18 were similarly suppressed in the presence of PI3K or PDK1 inhibitors. In conclusion, SGK1 expression is upregulated by IL-18 in VSMCs and SGK1 participates in the intracellular signaling of IL-18-induced osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs. Thus, SGK1 may serve as therapeutic target to limit the progression of medial vascular calcification during vascular inflammation.",Race influences survival in glioblastoma patients with KPS ≥ 80 and associates with genetic markers of retinoic acid metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706176,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 04 10,To study whether the clinical outcome and molecular biology of gliomas in African-American patients fundamentally differ from those occurring in Whites.,Post-traumatic stress disorders in patients with low-grade glioma and its association with survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706175,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 04 08,"The primary objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of PTSD at 3 months postoperatively in patients who were newly diagnosed with LGGs, and its association with 5-year survival.

It is well established, however, that SAE is more prevalent in aged individuals and related to a worse outcome. In this context, we decided to investigate the acute effects of sepsis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), on the cerebral transcriptional profile of young and old rats. The idea was to highlight important signaling pathways possibly implicated in the early stages of SAE. Global gene expression analysis of three different brain regions (hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex) indicated a relatively small interference of sepsis at the transcriptional level. Cerebellum tissue was the least affected by sepsis in aged rats. The increased expression of S100a8, Upp1, and Mt2a in all three brain regions of young septic rats indicate that these genes may be involved in the first line of response to sepsis in the younger brain. On the other hand, altered expression of a network of genes involved in sensory perception of smell in the cortex of aged rats, but not in young ones, indicates an earlier disruption of cortex function, possibly more sensitive to the systemic inflammation. The expression of S100a8 at the protein level was confirmed in all brain regions, with clear-up regulation in septic aged cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that the transcriptional response of the central nervous system to early sepsis varies between distinct brain regions and that the cortex is affected earlier in aged animals, in line with early neurological manifestations observed in older patients.",Factors associated with renal Doppler resistive index in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706172,Annals of intensive care,2019 02 26,"The renal Doppler resistive index (renal RI) is a noninvasive tool that has been used to assess renal perfusion in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

The approach consisted of building a translational model combining pre-clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models and parameters, with dosing paradigms used in the clinics along with clinical PK models to derive tumour profiles in humans driving overall survival. Tumour growth inhibition simulations were performed using drug effect parameters obtained from mice, system parameters obtained from mice after appropriate scaling, patient PK models for gemcitabine and carboplatin, and the standard dosing schedules given in the clinical scenario for both types of cancers. Tumour profiles in mice were scaled by body weight to their equivalent values in humans. As models for survival in humans showed that tumour size was the main driver of the hazard rate, it was possible to describe overall survival in pancreatic and ovarian cancer patients. Simulated tumour dynamics in pancreatic and ovarian cancer patients were evaluated using available data from clinical trials. Furthermore, calculated metrics showed values (maximal tumour regression [0-17%] and tumour size ratio at week 12 with respect to baseline [- 9, - 4.5]) in the range of those predicted with the clinical PKPD models. The model-informed Drug Discovery and Development paradigm has been successfully applied retrospectively to gemcitabine data, through a semi-mechanistic translational approach, describing the time course of the tumour response in patients from pre-clinical studies.",Renal tubular markers as screening tools for severe vesicoureteral reflux.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706159,European journal of pediatrics,2019 04 01,"Severe (grades IV and V) vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis, renal scars, and renal failure. This study evaluates albumin and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) urinary excretion, and renal concentrating ability as screening tools to select patients for voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Children (111 M, 52 F) aged 10.97 ± 21.17 months (mean + SD), diagnosed with UTI, and who had undergone renal ultrasound and a VCUG, underwent a desmopressin test and had albumin/creatinine and NAG/creatinine urinary excretion measured. Urine osmolality was significantly lower in 27 children with severe VUR (375.3 ± 171.8 mOsm/kg; mean + SD) compared to 100 patients with normal VCUG (611.5 ± 175.8 mOsm/kg), p < 0.001, and to 36 patients with VUR grades I to III (636.2 ± 180.2 mOsm/kg), p < 0.001. NAG/creatinine ratio was significantly elevated in 20 children with severe VUR (26.4 (28.3) U/g); median and interquartile range compared to 67 children with normal VCUG (10.8 (17.9) U/g), p = 0.003, and to 20 patients with VUR grades I to III (7.6 (21.1) U/g), p = 0.009.Conclusions: Urinary osmolality is significantly decreased and urinary excretion of NAG is significantly increased in patients with severe VUR. These tests could select patients for VCUG to assess for severe VUR. What is Known: • Severe vesicoureteral reflux (SVUR) may contribute to renal damage. Severe vesicoureteral reflux is diagnosed by voiding cystourethrogram and represents about 10% of all patients with VUR. Currently, there are no reliable tests used prior to VCUG to help on the decision of obtaining a VCUG to diagnose SVUR. What is New: • This study shows that renal tubular markers (concentrating ability and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) excretion) are useful tests prior to voiding cystourethrogram to screen for severe vesicoureteral reflux. • This study suggests the use of renal concentrating ability and urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) excretion to screen for severe vesicoureteral reflux before requesting a voiding cystourethrogram.",Knowledge and practices regarding infant vaccination: results of a survey of French physicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706158,European journal of pediatrics,2019 04 26,"A prospective, observational, survey of pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) was conducted to assess pediatric vaccination knowledge and practices. The survey was distributed by email to 1069 pediatricians and 1700 GPs and completed by 151 pediatricians (14.1%) and 201 GPs (11.8%). Knowledge of the vaccination calendar was very good (99% overall). Of the respondents, 98% were confident in vaccine efficacy. Eight-one percent of pediatricians and 62% of GPs agreed that recommended vaccinations should become obligatory; all prescribed hexavalent vaccines often or always. More pediatricians (88%) than GPs (75%) used anti-pyretics; the use of anesthetic cream/patches was similar in each group (79% and 75%, respectively). The ambience at vaccination was considered to be important by both groups, and was disturbed in 37% of cases. Seventy percent of pediatricians and 57% of GPs agreed that vaccine reconstitution (e.g., Hib pellet) is a complicating factor: overall, 28% reported occasionally omitting to reconstitute a pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine in error, and 60% reported having not fully reconstituted the vaccine. Almost all (93%) considered non-reconstitution as an important error.Conclusion: Overall, adherence to good vaccination practices was good, although errors in reconstitution were reported by physicians. These problems would be minimized by wider use of fully liquid vaccines. What is Known: • Pediatric vaccination schedules are crowded. • Good vaccination practices and the use of multivalent vaccines are essential to maintain good compliance to pediatric vaccination recommendations. What is New: • Overall good compliance to good vaccination practices by both pediatricians and GPs in France. • Omission of pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine reconstitution of Hib pellet and incomplete reconstitution reported by pediatricians/GPs.

We investigated 112 consecutive patients (72 ruptured and 40 unruptured) with ACoA aneurysms from a single-center database. The effects of demographic and morphologic characteristics on the risk of rupture in ACoA aneurysms were tested using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, respectively. We found that larger size, greater size ratio, larger flow angle, irregular shape, and smoking of the patient were associated with the rupture of ACoA aneurysms based on univariate analysis. Size ratio (OR = 3.890, P = 0.003), irregular shape (OR = 1.068, P = 0.001), flow angle (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001), and current smoking (OR = 4.435, P = 0.009) were the strongest factors related to ruptured ACoA aneurysms based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. The areas under the curves for the flow angle and size ratio were 0.742 (95% CI 0.646-0.838; P = 0.001) and 0.736 (95% CI 0.621-0.796; P = 0.001), respectively.

Twenty-eight 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: normal control (Ctr), methylprednisolone (MP, 13 mg/kg/day, sc, 5 days per week), MP plus Aln orally (1 mg/kg/day), and MP plus Met orally (200 mg/kg/day). After 9 weeks, serum bone metabolic biochemistry, bone densitometry and histomorphometry were performed. The GC-induced osteoporosis model was characterized by decreased osteocalcin, increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP-5b), and decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in the femur and fifth lumbar vertebra (L5). Histomorphometrically, MP significantly decreased trabecular bone volume, decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption in proximal metaphysis, compared with the controls. Aln and Met increased the BMDs of femur (0.305 ± 0.011 vs. 0.280 ± 0.012, P < 0.05; 0.304 ± 0.019 vs. 0.280 ± 0.012, P < 0.05) and L5 (0.399 ± 0.029 vs. 0.358 ± 0.022, P < 0.05; 0.397 ± 0.022 vs. 0.358 ± 0.022, P < 0.05), compared with the model group. Met increased osteocalcin and decreased TRAP-5b, but Aln only decreased TRAP-5b, compared with model group. In histomorphometry of tibial proximal metaphysis, Aln and Met increased trabecular bone volume (39.21 ± 2.46 vs. 30.98 ± 5.83, P < 0.05; 38.97 ± 5.56 vs. 30.98 ± 5.83, P < 0.05), while Met increased the bone formation dynamic parameters and decreased bone resorption dynamic parameters, but Aln just decreased bone resorption dynamic parameters, compared with model group significantly. These findings suggest that metformin prevents GC-induced bone loss by suppressing bone resorption and stimulating bone formation in trabecular bone. The action mode of metformin was different from alendronate, which only suppressed bone resorption."

A total of 286 patients underwent isolated CABG with a cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) evaluation between 2006 and 2015. Seventy-five had significant stenosis and/or occlusion of craniocervical vessels; the other 211 had no significant stenosis. Cerebral SPECT was performed for 49 (SPECT group) of the 75 patients. The SPECT group was further divided into a normal perfusion (NP) (n = 37); and a hypoperfusion (HP) (n = 12). In the present study we compared the NP group and the 211 patients with no significant stenosis (as a control group) to the HP group. No strokes occurred in the HP group, and 1 stroke occurred at the time of operation in the control group. Postoperative stroke within 30 days occurred in 3 patients in the control group; the difference was not statistically significant. The long-term stroke-free rates of the HP and Control group did not differ to a statistically significant extent. The functional evaluation of cerebral perfusion by SPECT is important when patients have significant stenotic lesions on cerebral MRA.

The predominant phyla of candidate OD1, candidate OP3, and Proteobacteria represented more than half of the total bacteria, which clearly manifested as a ""low nucleic acid content (LNA) bacteria majority"" type via flow cytometric fingerprint. The results showed that LNA bacteria were more tolerant to rapid changes in temperature and pH, compared to high nucleic acid content (HNA) bacteria. A continuous temperature increase test demonstrated that the LNA bacterial group was less competitive than the HNA bacterial group in terms of maintaining their cell intactness and growth potential. In contrast, the percentage of intact LNA bacteria was maintained at nearly 70% with pH decrease, despite a 50% decrease in total intact cells. Next-generation sequencing results revealed strong resistance and growth potential of phylum Proteobacteria when the temperature increased or the pH decreased in groundwater, especially for subclasses α-, β-, and γ-Proteobacteria. In addition, relative abundance of nitrogen-related functional genes by qPCR showed no difference in nitrifiers or denitrifiers within 0.45 μm-captured and 0.45 μm-filterable bacteria due to phylogenetic diversity. One exception was the monophyletic anammox bacteria that belong to the phylum Planctomycetes, which were mostly captured on a 0.45-μm filter.

It can be used alone or in combination with other antibiotics or anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy drug for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Due to the therapeutic importance of bestatin, mining of its biosynthetic mechanism is imperative. Genome mining, one of the bioinformatics-based approaches for the discovery of novel natural product, has been developed and applied widely. Herein, we reported the complete genome of Streptomyces olivoreticuli ATCC 31159 obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Aegilops peregrina, a wild tetraploid relative of wheat with genome constitution UUSS, displays genetic variation for resistance to leaf and stripe (yellow) rust. The wheat Ae. peregrina introgression line, IL pau16058, harbouring leaf and stripe rust resistance, was crossed with wheat cv. WL711 to generate an F2:3 mapping population. Inheritance studies on this population indicated the transfer of dominant co-segregating resistance to leaf and stripe rust. Ethyl methane sulphonate mutagenesis of IL pau16058 identified independent loss-of-function mutants for leaf and stripe rust resistance, indicating that the leaf and stripe rust resistance is controlled by independent genes, herein designated LrP and YrP, respectively. A high-resolution genetic map of LrP and YrP was constructed using the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat array and resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) markers. The map spans 4.19 cM on the distal-most region of the short arm of chromosome 5D, consisting of eight SNP markers and one microsatellite marker.

Yet, it is unknown if H. azteca is protective for European crustacean shredders. We thus compared the sensitivity of H. azteca with that of the European species Asellus aquaticus and Gammarus fossarum towards copper- and cadmium-contaminated sediments (prepared according to OECD 218) under laboratory conditions employing mortality and leaf consumption as endpoints. H. azteca either reacted approximately fourfold more sensitive than the most tolerant tested species (as for cadmium) or its sensitivity was only 1.6 times lower than the highest sensitivity determined (as for copper), which should be covered by safety factors applied during risk assessments. Therefore, the results for the sediment type and the two heavy metals tested during the present study in combination with the existence of standardized testing protocols, their ease of culture, and short generation time, suggest H. azteca as suitable crustacean model shredder for assessing the toxicity of sediment-associated metals in Europe.",Signs of damage in pelvic floor muscles at the end of pregnancy in rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706078,International urogynecology journal,2019 05 16,"Temporary effects to pelvic floor muscles are linked to impairments in micturition, particularly stress urinary incontinence (SUI), during pregnancy.

They are cheap to scale up, easy to functionalise and are potentially safer than viral vectors, however many are cytotoxic. The large number of polycations, designed to address the toxicity problem, raises a practical need to develop a fast and reliable method for assessing the safety of these materials. In this regard, metabolomics provides a detailed and comprehensive method that can assess the potential toxicity at the cellular and molecular level. Here, we applied metabolomics to investigate the impact of hyperbranched polylysine, hyperbranched polylysine-co-histidine and branched polyethyleneimine polyplexes at sub-toxic concentrations on the metabolic pathways of A459 and H1299 lung carcinoma cell lines. The study revealed that the polyplexes downregulated metabolites associated with glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and induced oxidative stress in both cell lines. The relative changes of the metabolites indicated that the polyplexes of polyethyleneimine and hyperbranched polylysine affected the metabolism much more than the polyplexes of hyperbranched polylysine-co-histidine. This was in line with transfection results, suggesting a correlation between the toxicity and transfection efficiency of these polyplexes. Our work highlights the importance of the metabolomics approach not just to assess the potential toxicity of polyplexes but also to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying any adverse effects, which could help in designing more efficient vectors.",Making Prussian blue analogues nanoparticles luminescent: effect of the luminophore confinement over the properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706065,Nanoscale,2019 04 11,"In this communication, we report the post-synthetic functionalization of K+/Ni2+/[Cr(CN)6]3- Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticles by the 2-aminoanthracene luminophore to yield a bifunctional magneto-luminescent nanosystem.

The G/hBN differs from previously demonstrated vdW heterostructures, where it has a chemical bridging between graphene and hBN allowing a direct charge transfer - resulting in high ORR activity. The ORR efficacy of G/hBN is compared with that of graphene-hBN vdW structure and individual layers of graphene and hBN along with that of benchmark platinum/carbon (Pt/C). The ORR activity of G/hBN is found to be on par with Pt/C in terms of current density but with much higher electrochemical stability and methanol tolerance. The onset potential of the G/hBN is found to be improved from 780 mV at a glassy carbon electrode to 930 mV and 940 mV in gold and platinum electrodes, respectively, indicating its substrate-dependent catalytic activity. This opens possibilities of new benchmark catalysts of metals capped with G/hBN atomic layers, where the underneath metal is protected while keeping the activity similar to that of pristine metal. Density functional theory-based calculations are found to be supporting the observed augmented ORR performance of G/hBN.",Simultaneous electrokinetic stacking and separation of anionic and cationic species on a paper fluidic channel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706062,Lab on a chip,2019 05 02,"On-line enrichment is effective for improving the sensitivity of paper-based analytical devices (PADs). Electrokinetic stacking of ionic species - anionic or cationic species, respectively, on a paper-based fluidic channel has been well demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we further demonstrated that both anionic and cationic species can be electrokinetically stacked and separated simultaneously on the same paper fluidic channel. The feasibility of the proposed method was visually demonstrated by using a colored cationic probe of Rhodamine 6G and an anionic probe of Brilliant Blue. With the introduction of a background electrolyte (BGE) consisting of weak acid and weak base salt, two electric field gradients can be developed on the same paper fluidic channel when a DC voltage was applied. Both of the anionic and cationic species from the reservoirs can be simultaneously stacked as separate bands on the two field gradients, respectively. Under optimized conditions, two orders of magnitude enrichment factors can be achieved for the anionic and cationic probes as characterized by colorimetric analysis by smartphone imaging. The applicability of this method was further demonstrated by stacking and separation of copper ions/nitrite and even amphoteric ions-proteins of phycocyanin (blue, pI 4.4)/cytochrome C (brown, pI 10.2). Potential applications can be found not only for a PAD based point of care test (POCT), but also for sample pretreatment in protein analysis considering the friendliness of the BGE to the mass spectrometer.",Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706061,Proceedings : ...

In order to validate THS, we have created a collection of roughly twelve thousands labelled tweets. These tweets contain one or more target medical terms, and the labels indicate if the tweet is related or not to a medical condition. We used this collection to test various models based on LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks. Our experiments show that we can classify tweets with 96% precision, 92% recall, and 91% F1 score.

The architectural disorganization of splenic white pulp is a hallmark of the aging spleen, yet the factors underlying these structural changes are unclear. Fibroblastic reticular cells comprise one stromal cell subset in the spleen that is important for maintenance of architectural organization, yet it remains to be determined how aging impacts these cells. In this study, we sought to determine how aging impacts splenic T cell zone reticular cell (TRC) numbers, morphology, and function. Using a mouse model of aging, we found that aged naive spleens have fewer TRCs than young spleens. This reduction in TRC number correlated with reduced CCL19 and CCL21 concentrations in aged spleens, which may contribute to impaired homing of T cells. CCL21 in both young and aged spleens localized with TRCs. Aged TRCs extended marginally into B cell follicles and may contribute to the blending of the T cell zone and B cell follicles in aged spleens. The described age-related changes in TRCs number and function may be an underlying factor contributing to impaired immune system function with age.",The Research Fairness Initiative: Filling a critical gap in global research ethics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706057,Gates open research,2019 06 10,"2017 marked the 70 anniversary of the Nuremberg Code. The ethics of research with human beings has been shaped by the simplicity of its core logic, i.e., that the voluntary consent of research participants is sacrosanct and, when given, creates profound obligations of care and respect on the part of researchers. But there are other aspects of the global research enterprise that warrant more deliberate ethical scrutiny. One of these is the fairness of research collaborations and partnerships and the many practical challenges that make fair partnerships difficult to achieve. Corruption in governments and institutions, unequal access to research funding among researchers and research institutions, and enormous disparities in institutional capacity to support research partnerships are just some of the factors that present obstacles to fair partnerships between high income country (HIC) and low and middle income country (LMIC) partners, and within LMICs and HICs alike. Serious attention to these structural disparities, and the ways they shape the ethical character of the research enterprise, is long overdue. Achieving fairness in research partnerships is, in essence, a complex policy and management challenge. Against this backdrop, COHRED has developed and pilot-tested the Research Fairness Initiative (RFI) with several leading research institutions around the world. The RFI was designed as a tool for promoting self-reflection on, and public reporting of, institutional practices and policies related to research partnerships to create a continuous improvement process for research collaborations. Here, we report promising preliminary results of the RFI's impact, including TDR-WHO's recent publication of its first RFI report 
.
 The RFI provides a pragmatic strategy to explicitly address fairness in research partnerships as a fundamental requirement of the ethics of research.",Improving energy efficiency of electrochemical blackwater disinfection through sequential reduction of suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706055,Gates open research,2019 06 10,"Onsite reuse of blackwater requires removal of considerable amounts of suspended solids and organic material in addition to inactivation of pathogens. Previously, we showed that electrochemical treatment could be used for effective pathogen inactivation in blackwater, but was inadequate to remove solids and organics to emerging industry standards. Further, we found that as solids and organics accumulate with repeated recycling, electrochemical treatment becomes less energetically sustainable. Here, we describe a pilot study in which concentrated blackwater is pretreated with ultrafiltration and granular activated carbon prior to electrochemical disinfection, and show that this combination of treatments removes 75-99% of chemical oxygen demand, 92-100% of total suspended solids, and improves the energy efficiency of electrochemical blackwater treatment by an order of magnitude.",Heterogeneous exposure and hotspots for malaria vectors at three study sites in Uganda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30706054,Gates open research,2019 06 10,"Background: Heterogeneity in malaria transmission has household, temporal, and spatial components. These factors are relevant for improving the efficiency of malaria control by targeting heterogeneity. To quantify variation, we analyzed mosquito counts from entomological surveillance conducted at three study sites in Uganda that varied in malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting or exposure is a risk factor for malaria transmission. Methods: Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria vector density and examined its spatial distribution. We introduced a novel approach for identifying changes in vector abundance hotspots over time by computing the Getis-Ord statistic on ratios of household biting propensities for different scenarios. We also explored the association of household biting propensities with housing and environmental covariates. Results: In each site, there was evidence for hot and cold spots of vector abundance, and spatial patterns associated with urbanicity, elevation, or other environmental covariates. We found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after the application of control interventions. Housing quality explained a portion of the variation among households in mosquito counts. Conclusion: This work provided an improved understanding of heterogeneity in malaria vector density at the three study sites in Uganda and offered a valuable opportunity for assessing whether interventions could be spatially targeted to be aimed at abundance hotspots which may increase malaria risk. Indoor residual spraying was shown to be a successful measure of vector control interventions in Tororo, Uganda.  Cement walls, brick floors, closed eaves, screened airbricks, and tiled roofs were features of a house that had shown reduction of household biting propensity. Improvements in house quality should be recommended as a supplementary measure for malaria control reducing risk of infection."

We studied this phenomenon in Caenorhabditis elegans by applying weak or severe abiotic (cadmium, CdCl2) and/or biotic stress (different bacterial diets) during cultivation/breeding of the worms and determining their developmental speed or survival and performing transcriptome profiling and RT-qPCR analyses to explore the genetic basis of the detected phenotypic differences. To specify weak or severe stress, developmental speed was measured at different cadmium concentrations, and survival assays were carried out on different bacterial species as feed for the worms. These studies showed that 0.1 μmol/L or 10 mmol/L of CdCl2 were weak or severe abiotic stressors, and that E. coli HT115 or Chitinophaga arvensicola feeding can be considered as weak or severe biotic stress. Extensive phenotypic studies on wild type (WT) and different signaling mutants (e.g., kgb-1Δ and pmk-1Δ) and genetic studies on WT revealed, inter alia, the following results. WT worms bred on E. coli OP50, which is a known cause of high lipid levels in the worms, showed high resistance to severe abiotic stress and elevated gene expression for protein biosynthesis. WT worms bred under weak biotic stress (E. coli HT115 feeding which causes lower lipid levels) showed an elevated resistance to severe biotic stress, elevated gene expression for the innate immune response and signaling but reduced gene expression for protein biosynthesis. WT worms bred under weak biotic and abiotic stress (E. coli HT115 feeding plus 0.1 μmol/L of CdCl2) showed high resistance to severe biotic stress, elevated expression of DAF-16 target genes (e.g., genes for small heat shock proteins) but further reduced gene expression for protein biosynthesis. WT worms bred under weak biotic but higher abiotic stress (E. coli HT115 feeding plus 10 μmol/L of CdCl2) showed re-intensified gene expression for the innate immune response, signaling, and protein biosynthesis, which, however, did not caused a higher resistance to severe biotic stress. E. coli OP50 feeding as well as weak abiotic and biotic stress during incubations also improved the age-specific survival probability of adult WT worms. Thus, this study showed that a bacterial diet resulting in higher levels of energy resources in the worms (E. coli OP50 feeding) or weak abiotic and biotic stress promote the resistance to severe abiotic or biotic stress and the age-specific survival probability of WT.",Nonlinear convective stratified flow of Maxwell nanofluid with activation energy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705980,Heliyon,2019 02 03,"The aim of present article is to explore the novel aspects of activation energy in nonlinearly convective flow of Maxwell nanofluid driven by nonlinearly stretched inclined cylinder. Generalized forms of Fourier's and Fick's law are utilized through Cattaneo-Christov double diffusion scheme. Maxwell nanomaterial model is used to describe the significant slip mechanism namely known as Brownian and thermophoresis diffusions. Features of double stratification, non-uniform heat generation/absorption, binary chemical reaction and activation energy are considered for present flow problem. Modified Arrhenius formula for activation energy is implemented. The resulting nonlinear system is cracked for series solutions via homotopy technique. Effects of different flow parameters on temperature, nanoparticle volume concentration and velocity fields are examined through graphs and tables. Numerical computations are performed for local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. Our analysis reveals that nanoparticle concentration is directly proportional to the chemical reaction with activation energy. Moreover stratification variables diminish the temperature and concentration. It is also noticed that higher estimation of Deborah number declines the velocity profile of Maxwell fluid. Numerical outcomes are compared with previous published results and found to be in good agreement for limiting cases of the evolving parameters.",Dynamic behavior of double and triple adjacent 2D hills using boundary element method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705979,Heliyon,2019 02 01,"A 2D boundary element method with material damping is developed in order to seismic investigation of constructions with different configurations.

S42 also increased muscle weight of the levator ani in orchiectomized Sprague-Dawley rats. These findings prompted us to investigate whether S42 has a direct effect on cultured C2C12 myotubes. S42 significantly lowered expression levels of the skeletal muscle ubiquitin ligase (muscle atrophy-related gene), atrogin1 and Muscle RING-Finger Protein 1(MuRF1) in C2C12 myotubes, as determined by real time PCR. Phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), an essential factor for promoting protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, was significantly increased by S42 to almost the same extent as by insulin, but this was significantly prevented by treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, phosphorylation of Akt, upstream regulator of mTORC1, was not changed by S42. S42 did not increase insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) mRNA levels in C2C12 myotubes. These results suggest that S42 may have an anabolic effect through activation of mTORC1-p70S6K signaling, independent of IGF-1-Akt signaling and may exert an anti-catabolic effect through inhibition of the degradation pathway in cultured C2C12 myotubes.",Ideation and implementation of an open science drug discovery business model - M4K Pharma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705971,Wellcome open research,2019 02 03,"M4K Pharma was incorporated to launch an open science drug discovery program that relies on regulatory exclusivity as its primary intellectual property and commercial asset, in lieu of patents.In many cases and in key markets, using regulatory exclusivity can provide equivalent commercial protection to patents, while also being compatible with open science.

The current study aimed to compare risk of delayed bleeding before and after implementation of CSP in a screening colonoscopy setting. Patients and methods  This study retrospectively analyzed a prospectively maintained screening colonoscopy database in a university hospital in Taiwan. We compared the rate of delayed bleeding before and after implementation within similar periods (18 months and 15 months) and the respective number of polypectomies (1,304 and 1,255) performed to remove small and diminutive polyps. The main outcome measurement was delayed bleeding within the two periods. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for major confounders. Results  A total of 1,304 and 1,225 subjects received hot snare polypectomy (HSP) and CSP in two separate periods, respectively. Compared with the HSP, the CSP had a lower rate of delayed bleeding (0.1 % vs . 1.1 %, P  < 0.001), severe bleeding (0 % vs. 0.7 %, P  < 0.01), need for second-look colonoscopy (0 % vs. 0.8 %, P  < 0.01), and emergency service visits (0.1 % vs . 1.0 %, P  < 0.01).

The integrated Scope Guide assist is built in to show that with its use outcomes are improved during colonoscopy. We aimed to test the usefulness of the Magnetic Scope Guide Assist (ScopeGuide ) with respect to cecal intubation time, and other procedural quality outcomes. Patients and methods  We conducted a prospective study of outpatients undergoing elective colonoscopy at the endoscopic units of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from March 2016 to July 2016. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 block design to groups that either had standard colonoscopy or Scope-guided colonoscopy. The primary outcome measure was cecal intubation time (CIT). Secondary outcome measures included use of manual pressure, position changes for cecal intubation and sedation requirements. Results  Three hundred patients were randomized to either group; standard (n = 150) vs. Scope-guided (n = 150). The mean CIT was not statistically different for the standard and the Scope-guided groups (4.6 vs. 4.3 minutes; P  = 0.46). There were also no statistical differences in frequency of manual pressure applied (16.7 % for Scope-guided vs. 19.1 % for standard; P  = 0.65) or position changes (11.4 % for scope guided vs. 8.8 % standard; P  = 0.56).

Patients and methods  Forty-two patients were included in the study, each one bearing one polyp. A dataset was generated with a total of 1680 polyp instances and 1360 frames of normal mucosa. We used three methods, that are all binary classifiers, labelling a frame as either containing a polyp or not. Two of the methods (Methods 1 and 2) are threshold-based and address the problem of polyp detection (i. e. separation between normal mucosa frames and polyp frames) and the problem of polyp localization (i. e. the ability to locate the polyp in a frame). The third method (Method 3) belongs to the class of machine learning methods and only addresses the polyp detection problem. The mathematical techniques underlying these three methods rely on appropriate fusion of information about the shape, color and texture content of the objects presented in the medical images. Results  Regarding polyp localization, the best method is Method 1 with a sensitivity of 71.8 %.

Controlled studies comparing temporary placement of FCSES to repeated BD are not available. Patients and methods  Patients with refractory anastomotic esophageal strictures, dysphagia scores ≥ 2, and two to five prior BD were randomized to 8 weeks of FCSEMS or to repeated BD. The primary endpoint was the number of BD during the 12 months after baseline treatment. Results  Eighteen patients were included (male 67 %, median age 66.5; 9 received metal stents, 9 received BD). Technical success rate of stent placement and stent removal was 100 %. Recurrent dysphagia occurred in 13 patients (72 %) during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the stent and BD groups for mean number of BD during follow-up (5.4 vs. 2.4, P  = 0.159), time to recurrent dysphagia (median 36 days vs. 33 days, Kaplan-Meier: P  = 0.576) and frequency of reinterventions per month (median 0.3 vs. 0.2, P  = 0.283). Improvement in quality of life score was greater in the stent group compared to the BD group at month 12 (median 26 % vs. 4 %, P  = 0.011). Conclusions  The current data did not provide evidence for a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the number of BD during the 12 months after initial treatment.

The cohort consisted of 12 males (44.4 %) and 15 females (55.5 %). RUS-FNA was diagnostic in 24 patients (88.8 %) and obviated the need for surgery in 14 patients (51.9 %). There were four complications (14.8 %): two perirectal and two presacral abscesses. Conclusion  While the diagnostic yield of RUS-FNA is high and the potential to affect clinical decision-making is substantial, risk of complication is not negligible. RUS-FNA should only be performed if the result will substantially alter clinical management, and the decision to perform RUS-FNA should be made with close consultation between the endosonographer, surgeon, and/or medical or radiation oncologist.",Linked color imaging improves the endoscopic visibility of gastric mucosal cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705948,Endoscopy international open,2019 02 03,"Background and study aims  As a newly developed endoscopy technique, linked color imaging (LCI) provides very bright images with enhanced color tones. With the objective of improving the detection rate of gastric mucosal cancers, which are often difficult to detect, we examined the utility of LCI from the viewpoint of visibility. Patients and methods  The current study used 100 consecutive gastric mucosal cancers ≤ 20 mm in diameter. For each lesion, we selected one endoscopic image acquired by white-light imaging (WLI), blue-laser imaging (BLI) -bright, and LCI modes. Four endoscopists interpreted the images; using a previously reported scale, we scored the visibility level on a scale of 1 - 4. Results  The mean (± SD) visibility scores were 2.54 ± 1.10 for WLI, 3.02 ± 1.07 for BLI-bright, and 3.28 ± 0.97 for LCI. The score was significantly higher for BLI-bright compared with WLI ( P  < .001) and again higher for LCI compared with BLI-bright ( P  < .001). For the experts, the scores for BLI-bright and LCI were similar, but both were significantly higher than the score for WLI. For the trainees, there was no significant difference between the WLI and BLI-bright scores, but LCI score was significantly higher than those for WLI and BLI-bright scores. With regard to clinical characteristics, LCI particularly enhanced visibility of normochromic, flat and depressed lesions, which had the lowest visibility scores of all three modalities compared with those of the other lesions. Conclusion  LCI increased visibility and may contribute to early detection of gastric mucosal cancers."

The spectrum includes extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), aggressive NK-cell leukemia, and a group of EBV-TNKLPDs affecting children which are poorly characterized in terms of their molecular biology. Gene and miRNA expression profiling has elucidated RNA abnormalities which impact on disease biology, classification, and treatment of EBV-TNKLPD. Pathways promoting proliferation, such as Janus associated kinase/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) and nuclear factor kB, are upregulated in ENKTL while upregulation of survivin and deregulation of p53 inhibit apoptosis in both ENKTL and chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV). Importantly, immune evasion via the programmed cell death-1 and its ligand, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway, has been demonstrated to play an important role in ENKTL. Other pathogenic mechanisms involve EBV genes, microRNA deregulation, and a variety of other oncogenic signaling pathways. The identification of EBV-positive Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) as a tumor with a distinct molecular signature and clinical characteristics highlights the important contribution of the knowledge derived from gene and miRNA expression profiling in disease classification.

The use of DNA-damaging agents has a long history in cancer chemotherapy but is limited by their toxicities. The combination with a safer drug can be a strategy in reducing dosage and toxicity while increasing anticancer activity in CRPC treatment. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are used to treat erectile dysfunction through the selective inhibition of PDE5 that is responsible for cGMP degradation in the corpus cavernosum. Several studies have reported that PDE5 inhibitors display protective effect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The combinatory treatment of CRPC with doxorubicin and PDE5 inhibitors has been studied accordingly. The data demonstrated that sildenafil or vardenafil (two structure-related PDE5 inhibitors) but not tadalafil (structure-unrelated to sildenafil) sensitized doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in CRPC cells with deteriorating the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and amplifying caspase activation. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair systems were inhibited in the apoptotic sensitization through detection of nuclear foci formation of Rad51 and DNA end-binding of Ku80. PDE5 knockdown to mimic the exposure to PDE5 inhibitors did not reproduce apoptotic sensitization, suggesting a PDE5-independent mechanism. Not only doxorubicin, sildenafil combined with other inhibitors of topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I also triggered apoptotic sensitization. In conclusion, the data suggest that sildenafil and vardenafil induce PDE5-independent apoptotic sensitization to doxorubicin (or other topoisomerase II inhibitors) through impairment of both HR and NHEJ repair systems that are evident by a decrease of nuclear Rad51 levels and their foci formation in the nucleus, and an inhibition of Ku80 DNA end-binding capability. The combinatory treatment may enable an important strategy for anti-CRPC development.","Clinical Utilization Pattern of Liquid Biopsies (LB) to Detect Actionable Driver Mutations, Guide Treatment Decisions and Monitor Disease Burden During Treatment of 33 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) Patients (pts) at a Fox Chase Cancer Center GI Oncology Subspecialty Clinic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705875,Frontiers in oncology,2019 02 04,"Background: Liquid biopsy (LB) captures dynamic genomic alterations (alts) across metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) therapy and may complement tissue biopsy (TB). We sought to describe the utility of LB and better understand mCRC biology during therapy. Methods: Thirty-three patients (pts) with mCRC underwent LB. We used permutation-based t-tests to assess associations between alts, and clinical variables and used Kendall's tau to measure correlations. Results: Of 33 pts, 15 were women; 22 had colon, and the rest rectal cancer. Pts received a median of two lines of therapy before LB. Nineteen pts had limited testing on TB (RAS/RAF/TP53/APC), 11 extended NGS, and 3 no TB. Maxpct and alts correlated with CEA (p < 0.001, respectively). In 3/5 pts with serial LB, CEA correlated with maxpct trend, and CT tumor burden. In 6 pts, mutant RAS was seen in LB and not TB; 5/6 had received anti-EGFR therapy prior to LB, suggesting RAS alts developed post-therapy. In two pts RAS-mutated by TB, no RAS alts were detected on LB; these pts had low disease burden on CT at time of LB that also did not reveal APC or TP53 alts. In six patients who were KRAS wt based on TB, post anti-EGFR LB revealed subclonal KRAS mutations, likely a treatment effect. The median number of alts was higher post anti-EGFR LB (n = 12) vs. anti-EGFR naïve LB (n = 22) (9.5 vs. 5.5, p = 0.059) but not statistically significant. More alts were also noted in post anti-EGFR therapy LB vs. KRAS wt anti-EGFR-naïve LB (n = 6) (9.5 vs. 5) among patients with KRAS wild-type tumors, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.182). Conclusions: LB across mCRC therapy detects driver mutations, monitors disease burden, and identifies sub-clonal alts that reflect drug resistance, tumor evolution, and heterogeneity.

A total of 385 patients who underwent initial intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURB) were included. We analyzed the relationship between oncological outcomes and ratios of SIR markers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Each SIR marker was used for analysis. Their cut-off values were determined through receiver operation characteristics curves analysis. Patients were divided into two groups according to pretreatment NLR (<1.5 vs. ≥1.5), dNLR (<1.2 vs. ≥1.2), and PLR values (171< vs. ≥171). Patients with NLR ≥ 1.5 and dNLR ≥ 1.2 were associated with poor prognosis in terms of overall survival and cause-specific survival. However, no serum SIR marker was associated with prognosis in recurrence-free survival or progression-free survival. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that age, NLR, dNLR, hemoglobin, and pathologic T stage were significant factors predicting overall survival. Age, NLR, and pathologic T stage were significant factors predicting cancer-specific survival, NLR and tumor number were the most important predictors of bladder preserving survival. NLR before treatment was correlated with both oncological outcomes and survival outcome in NMIBC patients undergoing initial intravesical BCG treatment after TURB. Increased NLR reflects a poor prognosis of these outcomes.",Importance of the telemedicine network for neurosurgery in Slovenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705871,World journal of methodology,2019 02 03,"The number of invasive procedures in medicine is increasing, as is the employment of new technological achievements.

Regulation of the insulin receptor (IR) expression and its function is very well studied in major metabolic tissues like liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue. The physiological relevance of IRs in the kidney has recently begun to be clarified. The credit goes to studies that showed a wide distribution of IR throughout the nephron segments and their reduced expression in the insulin resistance state. Moreover, altered renal and systemic metabolism observed in mice with targeted deletion of the IR from various epithelial cells of the kidney has strengthened this proposition.

As a part of the decision making process, patients are often educated how the choice regarding modality of dialysis would fit into their life but it is not clear and not usually discussed, how it can affect eventual kidney transplantation in the future. In this article we would like to discuss ESRD demographics and outcomes, modality of dialysis and kidney transplant related events. We have summarized the data comparing PD and HD as the modality of dialysis and its impact on allograft and recipient outcomes after kidney transplantation.",Sirtuins in B lymphocytes metabolism and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705866,World journal of experimental medicine,2019 02 03,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases and play a role in virtually all cell biological processes. As SIRTs functions vary according to their subtypes, they can either activate or inhibit signaling pathways upon different conditions or tissues. Recent studies have focused on metabolic effects performed by SIRTs in several cell types since specific metabolic pathways (e.g., aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, β-oxidation, glutaminolysis) are used to determine the cell fate. However, few efforts have been made to understand the role of SIRTs on B lymphocytes metabolism and function. These cells are associated with humoral immune responses by secreting larger amounts of antibodies after differentiating into antibody-secreting cells. Besides, both the SIRTs and B lymphocytes are potential targets to treat several immune-mediated disorders, including cancer. Here, we provide an outlook of recent studies regarding the role of SIRTs in general cellular metabolism and B lymphocytes functions, pointing out the future perspectives of this field."

We conducted a qualitative examination of the structure, successes, and challenges of enacted state laws and policies aimed at the opioid epidemic, with an in-depth focus on prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and naloxone access efforts. A set of 10 states (Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia) was chosen a priori to achieve a varied sample of state policies and timing, as well as population opioid complications. Archival research was conducted to identify state-level policies aimed at the opioid epidemic and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 key stakeholders between March and September 2016. The most frequently mentioned key to success was an identifiable champion instrumental in leading the passage of these policies. The lack of a unified legislature and physician pushback were challenges many states faced in implementing policies. Champion-led task forces, stakeholders' personal stories garnering buy-in, ongoing education and feedback to PDMP users, and inclusive stakeholder engagement are critical aspects of passing and implementing state policies aimed at combating the opioid epidemic. Engaging all interested stakeholders and providing continuing feedback are ongoing challenges in all states.

Evidence indicates that placing stair prompt signs at points-of-decision (e.g. near elevators and stairways) is an inexpensive, effective strategy for increasing physical activity through stair use. This article aims to share the experience of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in the outreach and implementation of a population-scale stair prompt initiative, including lessons learned from process evaluations, with other public health authorities conducting a similar program. Between May 2008 and August 2012, NYC DOHMH implemented a stair prompt initiative as one strategy in a comprehensive program to increase physical activity and healthy eating through physical improvements to NYC's buildings, streets and neighborhoods, particularly targeting facilities in underserved and low-income neighborhoods. Program evaluation was conducted using program planning documents to examine the process, and data from NYC information line call center, outreach tracking database, and site and phone audits to examine process outcomes. The initiative successfully distributed more than 30,000 stair prompts to building owners/managers of over 1000 buildings. Keys to success included multi-sector partnerships between NYC's Health Department and non-health government agencies and organizations (such as architecture and real estate organizations), a designated outreach coordinator, and outreach strategies targeting building owners/managers owning/managing multiple buildings and buildings serving underserved and at risk populations. A NYC citywide initiative successfully distributed stair prompts to the wider community to promote population-level health impacts; lessons learned may assist other jurisdictions considering similar initiatives to increase physical activity.","The theoretical foundation, fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability of a teacher training to promote physical activity among preschoolers in child care: A pilot study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705808,Preventive medicine reports,2019 02 03,"This article describes the Wellness Enhancing Physical Activity in Young Children (WE PLAY) teacher training, which was designed to assist early childhood educators to promote physical activity among preschoolers in child care.

Fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability data from the WE PLAY pilot study, a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with six Head Start programs in Massachusetts. Data, collected between October 2017-May 2018, are from teachers and supervisors at 3 preschool programs who participated in the WE PLAY (intervention) group. To understand program feasibility and acceptability, we used the Usage Rating Profile-Intervention (URP-I; n = 13) and key informant interviews (n = 5). The URP-I is a validated teacher survey with 6 subscales (Acceptability, Understanding, Feasibility, Family-School Collaboration, Systems Climate, and Systems Support). It was administered twice; immediately after users completed the first component, an online training (week 2), and after implementation of all program components (week 4). WE PLAY was implemented as it was intended, and it was considered acceptable and feasible to users. There was an increase in users' understanding of how to implement the program between weeks 2 and 4, and a concomitant decrease in the amount of additional systems-level supports users thought they would need to implement WE PLAY between weeks 2 and 4. WE PLAY was easily understandable and feasible to implement in real world settings, it was highly acceptable to users, and it deserves further testing.","Dietary patterns among French-speaking men residing in Montreal, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705807,Preventive medicine reports,2019 02 03,"The purpose of this study was to describe dietary patterns among 1636 French-speaking men residing in Montreal, Canada and to assess sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics of men adhering to the dietary patterns identified. Participants were population controls from the Prostate Cancer and Environment Study, a case-control study conducted between 2006 and 2011 in Montreal. Information on diet was collected using a food frequency questionnaire, and principal component analysis, a data-driven method and a posteriori method, was used to identify dietary patterns. Three dietary patterns were identified; Healthy, Modified Western - Salty and Modified Western - Sweet patterns accounted for 7.0%, 5.4%, and 3.2% of the variance, respectively. The Healthy pattern was characterized by consumption of fruits, vegetables, vegetable soup, chicken, fish and seafood, cheese, rice, yogurt, and wine. The Modified Western - Salty pattern included high loadings for beef, pork, chicken, hot-dogs or sausages, cold cuts, bacon, barbecue cooking, meat slightly blackened, potatoes, pasta with tomato sauce, pizza, pastries, dark carbonated soft drinks, ice cream, and white bread. The third pattern, labelled as Modified Western - Sweet, had high loadings of cookies, muffins, cakes, pastries, pies, ice cream, fruits and vegetables. In multivariate analyses, the Healthy pattern was positively associated with higher income and education, moderate recreational physical activity and less heavy smoking, and inversely associated with French ancestry. The Modified Western - Salty pattern was positively associated with French, other European, and Latino ancestries, and with married and common-law relationships. Finally, the Modified Western - Sweet pattern was more common among men of French ancestry and users of vitamin/mineral supplements.

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between depression status and weekly exercise in children ages 6 to 17 years stratifying by age and sex using a large nationally representative sample. The study data (n = 65,059) came from the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health. Depression categories were current, former, and no history of diagnosed depression. Exercise categories were exercising ≤6 days a week and 7 days a week. Multivariable regression stratified by age and by sex was conducted on the weighted survey data. Among children age 6 to 17, 95.2% were never depressed, 2.1% were formerly depressed, and 2.8% were currently depressed and 28.0% exercised daily. Currently depressed children had 0.75 (95% CI 0.56, 1.00) times and formerly depressed children had 1.09 (95% CI 0.76, 1.57) times the adjusted odds of exercising daily compared to never depressed children. Stratified separately by sex and by age, females and children age 12 to 17 with current depression had 0.63 (95% CI 0.42, 0.94) and 0.48 (95% CI 0.35, 0.66) times the adjusted odds of exercising daily compared to their counterparts with no depression. This study indicates a significant difference in daily exercise habits between currently depressed children age 12 to 17 and females compared to their never depressed counterparts.

Yet, little is known about psychosocial determinants of obesity that relate specifically to older persons. In this study, we investigated for the first time whether self-perceptions of aging (SPA), defined as beliefs about oneself as an older person that are assimilated from society, relate to new cases of obesity. This seemed plausible because older persons who report more-positive SPA tend to engage in more health-promoting behaviors. Our sample consisted of 5702 Americans in the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study who were aged 60 years or older and not obese at baseline. The participants were followed from 2008 to 2014. As predicted, older persons with more-positive SPA, compared to those with more-negative SPA, were significantly less likely to become obese over the next 6 years, after adjusting for relevant covariates. For example, according to our model, a participant with the most-positive SPA score was 27% less likely to become obese than a same-aged peer with an average score on the SPA measure. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of obesity in later life could benefit from targeting SPA.",Tuning of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Compartment in its Inflammatory Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705804,Current stem cell reports,2019 02 04,The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is the cornerstone of a lifelong blood cell production but also contributes to the ability of the hematopoietic system to dynamically respond to environmental challenges.

Many plants from the Convolvulaceae family contain compounds that have demonstrated wound healing and antidiabetic activity. Such compounds can be effectively used as a part of treatments to promote wound healing in diabetics and used in combination with antimicrobial therapy to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance and allergic reactions. Novel strategies for developing herbal formulations such as nanoparticles and adhesive patches can improve the delivery of plant-based therapeutic agents. Recent Advances: Studies have confirmed the antidiabetic and wound healing activities of Merremia tridentata, Argyreia speciosa, and Ipomoea batatas, whereas Evolvulus alsinoides, Evolvulus nummularius, Argyreia cuneata, and Ipomoea carnea have wound healing activity. Critical Issues: Drug resistance is a major problem associated with antimicrobial therapy and can affect wound healing processes. Phytoconstituents can facilitate healing processes and reduce reliance on antibiotics. Future Directions: Plants from the Convolvulaceae family have had frequent traditional uses, and all plants selected for this study have antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and wound healing properties. Detailed phytochemical studies of these plants can help develop novel wound healing therapies.",A Porcine Wound Model of Acinetobacter baumannii Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705786,Advances in wound care,2019 02 03,"Objective: To better understand Acinetobacter baumannii pathogenesis and to advance drug discovery against this pathogen, we developed a porcine, full-thickness, excisional, monospecies infection wound model. Approach: The research was facilitated with AB5075, a previously characterized, extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate. The model requires cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) that persists beyond 7 days. Multiple, 12-mm-diameter full-thickness wounds were created in the skin overlying the cervical and thoracic dorsum. Wound beds were inoculated with 5.0 × 104 colony-forming units (CFU) and covered with dressing. Results:A. baumannii was observed in the wound bed and on the dressing in what appeared to be biofilm. When bacterial burdens were measured, proliferation to at least 106 CFU/g (log106) wound tissue was observed. Infection was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) staining. To validate as a treatment model, polymyxin B was applied topically to a subset of infected wounds every 2 days. Then, the treated and untreated wounds were compared using multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques to include gross pathology, CFU burden, histopathology, PNA-FISH, and SEM. Innovation: This is the first study to use A. baumannii in a porcine model as the sole infectious agent. Conclusion: The porcine model allows for an additional preclinical assessment of antibacterial candidates that show promise against A. baumannii in rodent models, further evaluating safety and efficacy, and serve as a large animal in preclinical assessment for the treatment of SSTI.","Comparison of Fractional CO2 Laser, Verapamil, and Triamcinolone for the Treatment of Keloid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705785,Advances in wound care,2019 02 03,"Objective: Scar biology is a territory less understood. The search for ideal treatment of keloid continues. The aim of this study was to compare the role of CO2 laser, triamcinolone (TAC), and verapamil in the treatment of keloid. Approach: A randomized parallel-group study was conducted in which 60 patients were randomly allocated to three groups from May 2017 to April 2018. First group received fractional CO2 laser therapy, second group received triamcinolone, and third group received intralesional verapamil. Outcomes were evaluated using Vancouver scar scale score at 3 weekly intervals for 6 months. Results: There was a reduction in scar height, vascularity, and pliability in all the three groups. However, pigmentation was not completely resolved by any of the three modalities. The response was fastest in case of triamcinolone followed by verapamil and laser, which was statistically significant. There was reduction in pain and pruritus in all the three groups and lesser injection site pain with verapamil. There was some amount of charring with CO2 laser. Innovation: Our study provides evidence that TAC has the fastest response in treating keloids when compared to other modalities. Scar pigmentation is the parameter that is not completely resolved by TAC, verapamil, or CO2 laser. Conclusion: The study revealed that fractional CO2 laser and verapamil are as efficient as triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) for treating keloids, except it takes longer for laser and verapamil to act compared to TAC. Verapamil can be used as an alternative treatment modality that is cost-effective with minimal adverse effects.",Prediction of In-Hospital Pressure Ulcer Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705784,Advances in wound care,2019 02 03,"Objective: The development of in-hospital acquired pressure ulcers (PUs) is of great concern for both patients and professionals in health care.

Approach: A total of 383 patients were recruited from three departments. The investigations were performed in two steps: 252 patients were used to train the algorithm, and 131 patients were used in the validation. The new scale combines observational and on-site available information regarding patient mobility. Results: The validation data yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. The Qscale had a significantly higher AUC compared with that of the Braden Scale with an AUC of 0.76 (p < 0.05). When comparing the performance at specific thresholds, a sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 94% were observed. This was significantly (p < 0.05) better than the Braden score with a sensitivity of 20% and a specificity of 94%.

Herein, we examine the complexities of polyester degradation behavior, its assessment and strategies for refinement. The factors governing polyester degradation are strikingly complex. In addition to the half-life of the hydrolytically-labile bond, a series of interdependent material properties must be considered. Thus, methods used to characterize such material properties, both before and during degradation, must be carefully selected. Assessment of degradation behavior is further complicated by the variability of reported test protocols and the need for accelerated rather than real-time in vitro testing conditions. Ultimately, through better control of degradation behavior and correlation of in vitro, simulated degradation to that observed in vivo, the development of superior devices prepared with polyester biomaterials may be achieved.","N,N-Diaryl Dihydrophenazines as Photoredox Catalysts for PET-RAFT and Sequential PET-RAFT/O-ATRP.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705782,ACS macro letters,2019 06 10,"N,N-Diaryl dihydrophenazines are employed as organic photoredox catalysts (PCs) for photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization.

Data come from a unique random digit dial (RDD) sample of Arab Americans (N=96), Blacks (N=102) and Whites (N=100) from metro-Detroit collected in 2011, ranging in age from 19-89. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare health, network structure, composition and support quality. Findings established preliminary benchmarks showing that Arab Americans reported more depressive symptoms (7.6) than Whites (5.2), but no difference in physical health. Arab Americans also reported more contact frequency (4.4) than Blacks (4.1) and Whites (4.0), yet lower proportions of networks comprised of the same ethnicity (77%) compared to Blacks (96%) and Whites (97%). Unpacking the White category to identify Arab Americans in a comparative analysis identified benchmarks to show how Arab American health and social relations are distinct from Blacks and Whites, yielding unique avenues for thinking about new ways to conceptualize how race and social relations impact health disparities.",Reduction in IGF1 mRNA in the Human Subependymal Zone During Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705779,Aging and disease,2019 02 04,"The cell proliferation marker, Ki67 and the immature neuron marker, doublecortin are both expressed in the major human neurogenic niche, the subependymal zone (SEZ), but expression progressively decreases across the adult lifespan (PMID: 27932973). In contrast, transcript levels of several mitogens (transforming growth factor α, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2) do not decline with age in the human SEZ, suggesting that other growth factors may contribute to the reduced neurogenic potential. While insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) regulates neurogenesis throughout aging in the mouse brain, the extent to which IGF1 and IGF family members change with age and relate to adult neurogenesis markers in the human SEZ has not yet been determined. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine gene expression of seven IGF family members [IGF1, IGF1 receptor, insulin receptor and high-affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) 2, 3, 4 and 5] in the human SEZ across the adult lifespan (n=50, 21-103 years). We found that only IGF1 expression significantly decreased with increasing age. IGFBP2 and IGFBP4 expression positively correlated with Ki67 mRNA. IGF1 expression positively correlated with doublecortin mRNA, whereas IGFBP2 expression negatively correlated with doublecortin mRNA. Our results suggest IGF family members are local regulators of neurogenesis and indicate that the age-related reduction in IGF1 mRNA may limit new neuron production by restricting neuronal differentiation in the human SEZ.",Relationship between Hypothyroidism and Endometrial Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705778,Aging and disease,2019 02 03,"Thyroid dysfunction is involved in several types of carcinoma.

Additionally, 18 patients were assessed iTUG before and after shunt surgery. During iTUG, time and 3-dimensional (3D) acceleration were automatically recorded every 0.01 s. A volume of the 95% confidence ellipsoid (95%CE) of all plots for 3D acceleration was calculated. Additionally, an iTUG score was defined as (95%CE volume) 0.8 / 1.9 - 1.9 × (time) + 60. The measurement reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlations and Bland-Altman plots. The participants with mild gait disturbance who accomplished within 13.5 s on the iTUG time had the 95%CE volumes for 3D acceleration of ≥70 m3/s6 and iTUG scores of ≥50. The mean iTUG time was shortened and the mean 95%CE volumes and iTUG scores were increased after the tap test among 28 patients with tap-positive iNPH and after shunt surgery among 18 patients with definite iNPH. Conversely, the mean iTUG score among 8 patients with tap-negative was decreased after the tap test. The intraclass correlations for the time, 95%CE volume and iTUG score were 0.97, 0.80 and 0.90, respectively. Not only the iTUG time but also the 95%CE volume was important for evaluating mobility. Therefore, the novel iTUG score consisting both is useful for the quantitative assessment of mobility.",Increased Inflammatory Response in Old Mice is Associated with More Severe Neuronal Injury at the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705764,Aging and disease,2019 02 04,"Stroke occurs mostly in patients with advanced age. Elderly patients have a less favorable prognosis compared with young adult patients. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we tested our hypothesis that an increased inflammatory response to acute ischemic injury in old stroke mice leads to more severe brain damage and behavioral dysfunction. An ischemic stroke model was created in 2- and 12-month-old C57BL/6 mice through permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery (dMCAO). Infarct/atrophy volumes were quantified by staining the brain sections with Cresyl Violet. Sensorimotor function was assessed using the corner test and adhesive removal test. Quantification of CD68+ cells in the peri-infarct region was performed at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the ischemic brain tissue were measured using ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. Blood-brain barrier permeability was measured by Evans blue (EB) extravasation. Gelatinase B (MMP-9, type IV collagenase) was measured by gel zymography. Compared to 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had more severe behavioral deficits at both the acute and chronic stages of stroke. Compared with the 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had larger infarct/atrophy volumes at 1 and 14 days after dMCAO, higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β, higher MMP9 activity, and lower levels of claudin-5 and ZO-1 at 1 and 3 days after dMCAO. 12-month-old mice also had more CD68+ cells in the peri-infarct region at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO and more EB leakage at 3 days after dMCAO. A higher inflammatory response at the acute stage of ischemic stroke in old mice is associated with more severe neuronal injury and long-term behavioral dysfunction.",Is Dementia More Fatal Than Previously Estimated? A Population-based Prospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705763,Aging and disease,2019 02 03,"Dementia increases the risk of mortality (ROM) in the elderly and estimates of hazard ratio (HR) of dementia for mortality have ranged from 1.7 to 6.3. However, previous studies may have underestimated ROM of dementia due to length bias, which occurs when failing to include the persons with rapidly progressive diseases, who died before they could be included in the study. This population-based prospective cohort study conducted on 6,752 randomly sampled Koreans, aged 60 years or older (the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia). Cognitive disorders were evaluated at baseline and 2-year follow-up using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet (CERAD-K), and prevalent and incident cases of dementia were identified. The participants' deaths were confirmed through the National Mortality Database of Statistics Korea. We compared the ROM between prevalent and incident dementia, and estimated HR of dementia for mortality using Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 5,097 responders to the 2-year follow-up assessment, 150 participants had dementia from the baseline (prevalent dementia), and 95 participants developed dementia during the 2-year follow-up period (incident dementia). The ROM of participants with incident dementia was about 3 times higher than the ROM of those with prevalent dementia (HR = 3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-6.91). Compared to cognitively normal participants at both the baseline and 2-year follow-up assessments, the ROM of those with incident dementia approximately 8 times higher (HR = 8.37, 95 % CI = 4.23-16.54). In conclusion, the ROM of dementia using prevalent cases was underestimated due to length bias, and dementia may be much more fatal than previously estimated. In clinical settings, the ROM of dementia warrants the attention of physicians, particularly in recently incident dementia cases.",Longitudinal changes in subchondral bone structure as assessed with MRI are associated with functional outcome after high tibial osteotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705762,Journal of ISAKOS : joint disorders & orthopaedic sports medicine,2019 02 12,The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of high tibial osteotomy (HTO) on subchondral bone structure assessed with magnetic resonance (MR)-based trabecular bone imaging and the correlations of these effects with functional outcome and clinical symptoms.,Replicability and replication in the humanities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705761,Research integrity and peer review,2019 02 03,"A large number of scientists and several news platforms have, over the last few years, been speaking of a replication crisis in various academic disciplines, especially the biomedical and social sciences. This paper answers the novel question of whether we should also pursue replication in the humanities. First, I create more conceptual clarity by defining, in addition to the term ""humanities,"" various key terms in the debate on replication, such as ""reproduction"" and ""replicability."" In doing so, I pay attention to what is supposed to be the object of replication: certain studies, particular inferences, of specific results. After that, I spell out three reasons for thinking that replication in the humanities is not possible and argue that they are unconvincing. Subsequently, I give a more detailed case for thinking that replication in the humanities is possible. Finally, I explain why such replication in the humanities is not only possible, but also desirable.",EMPOWER-PD - A physical therapy intervention to empower the individuals with Parkinson's disease: a study protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705760,Pilot and feasibility studies,2019 02 03,"One of the greatest barriers found by physical therapy treating individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) is the adherence to treatment, associated with the lack of motivation to remain active.

All participants received a single 30 mg radiprodil dose (12 mL oral suspension). Blood was collected at various time points using conventional venous sampling (intravenous catheter or venepuncture), and Mitra™ and Aqua-Cap™ Drummond microsampling (finger-prick and blood taken from venous blood sample tubes). Geometric mean radiprodil plasma concentrations from conventional venous samples were above the lower limit of quantification up to 48 hours after administration of a single oral dose of radiprodil. Geometric mean AUC inf and Cmax were 2042 h ng mL -1 and 89.4 ng mL -1, respectively. Geometric mean t&frac12; was 15.8 hour; median tmax was 4 hour (range: 3-6 hour). Radiprodil exposure variables for Aqua-Cap™ Drummond sampling were similar to the conventional venous-derived data. Conversely, radiprodil exposure variables were lower with Mitra™ sampling compared with conventional venous sampling. The geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) for Cmax of conventional venous versus Mitra™ and Aqua-Cap™ Drummond sampling (finger-prick blood) was 0.89 (0.85, 0.94) and 1.03 (0.97,1.08), respectively, and therefore within the conventional bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). Radiprodil oral suspension had an acceptable safety, tolerability, and palatability profile. The PK profile of radiprodil oral suspension was established in healthy adults, and was comparable when analyzed using conventional versus microsampling techniques. These results will support future radiprodil paediatric studies.",pH as a potential therapeutic target to improve temozolomide antitumor efficacy : A mechanistic modeling study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705757,Pharmacology research & perspectives,2019 03 19,"Despite intensive treatments including temozolomide (TMZ) administration, glioblastoma patient prognosis remains dismal and innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. A systems pharmacology approach was undertaken to investigate TMZ pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) incorporating the effect of local pH, tumor spatial configuration and micro-environment. A hybrid mathematical framework was designed coupling ordinary differential equations describing the intracellular reactions, with a spatial cellular automaton to individualize the cells. A differential drug impact on tumor and healthy cells at constant extracellular pH was computationally demonstrated as TMZ-induced DNA damage was larger in tumor cells as compared to normal cells due to less acidic intracellular pH in cancer cells. Optimality of TMZ efficacy defined as maximum difference between damage in tumor and healthy cells was reached for extracellular pH between 6.8 and 7.5. Next, TMZ PK-PD in a solid tumor was demonstrated to highly depend on its spatial configuration as spread cancer cells or fragmented tumors presented higher TMZ-induced damage as compared to compact tumor spheroid. Simulations highlighted that smaller tumors were less acidic than bigger ones allowing for faster TMZ activation and their closer distance to blood capillaries allowed for better drug penetration. For model parameters corresponding to U87 glioma cells, inter-cell variability in TMZ uptake play no role regarding the mean drug-induced damage in the whole cell population whereas this quantity was increased by inter-cell variability in TMZ efflux which was thus a disadvantage in terms of drug resistance. Overall, this study revealed pH as a new potential target to significantly improve TMZ antitumor efficacy."

The invention of these devices has made it possible to address the reparative cascade of arterial wall injury following balloon angioplasty that results in restenosis. DESs were first used for the treatment of infrapopliteal lesions almost 20 years ago. More recently, however, DCB technology is being investigated to improve outcomes of endovascular below-the-knee arterial procedures, avoiding the need for a metallic scaffold. Today, level IA evidence supports the use of infrapopliteal DES for short to medium length lesions, although robust evidence that justifies the use of DCBs in this anatomical area is missing. This review summarizes and discusses all available data on infrapopliteal drug-elution devices and highlights the most promising future perspectives.",Heart disease in Friedreich's ataxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705738,World journal of cardiology,2019 02 03,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), which occurs in 1/50000 live births, is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disorder. Nearly all FRDA patients develop cardiomyopathy at some point in their lives. The clinical manifestations of FRDA include ataxia of the limbs and trunk, dysarthria, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac diseases. However, the broad clinical spectrum makes FRDA difficult to identify. The diagnosis of FRDA is based on the presence of suspicious clinical factors, the use of the Harding criteria and, more recently, the use of genetic testing for identifying the expansion of a triplet nucleotide sequence. FRDA is linked to a defect in the mitochondrial protein frataxin; an epigenetic alteration interferes with the folding of this protein, causing a relative deficiency of frataxin in affected patients. Frataxins are small essential proteins whose deficiency causes a range of metabolic disturbances, including oxidative stress, iron-sulfur cluster deficits, and defects in heme synthesis, sulfur amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, stress responses, and mitochondrial function. The cardiac involvement seen in FRDA is a consequence of mitochondrial proliferation as well as the loss of contractile proteins and the subsequent development of myocardial fibrosis. The walls of the left ventricle become thickened, and different phenotypic manifestations are seen, including concentric or asymmetric hypertrophy and (less commonly) dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia are associated with mortality in patients with FRDA, whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not. Systolic function tends to be low-normal in FRDA patients, with an acute decline at the end of life. However, the literature includes only a few long-term prospective studies of cardiac progression in FRDA, and the cause of death is often attributed to heart failure and arrhythmia postmortem. Cardiomyopathy tends to be correlated with the clinical neurologic age of onset and the nucleotide triplet repeat length (i.e., markers of phenotypic disease severity) rather than the duration of disease or the severity of neurologic symptoms. As most patients are wheelchair-bound within 15 years of diagnosis, the clinical determination of cardiac involvement is often complicated by comorbidities. Researchers are currently testing targeted therapies for FRDA, and a centralized database, patient registry, and natural history study have been launched to support these clinical trials. The present review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and spectrum of cardiac disease in FRDA patients and then introduces gene-targeted and pathology-specific therapies as well as screening guidelines that should be used to monitor cardiac disease in this mitochondrial disorder.",Comparison of clinical and histopathological features of patients who underwent incidental or emergency appendectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705736,World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2019 02 03,Incidental appendectomy can be defined as the removal of a clinically normal appendix during another surgical procedure unrelated to appendicitis or other appendicular diseases.,Intraoperative cell salvage with autologous transfusion in liver transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705735,World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2019 02 03,"Liver transplant (LT) is the primary treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. About 25000 LTs are performed annually in the world. The potential for intraoperative bleeding is quite variable. However, massive bleeding is common and requires blood transfusion. Allogeneic blood transfusion has an immunosuppressive effect and an impact on recipient survival, in addition to the risk of transmission of viral infections and transfusion errors, among others. Techniques to prevent excessive bleeding or to use autologous blood have been proposed to minimize the negative effects of allogeneic blood transfusion. Intraoperative reinfusion of autologous blood is possible through previous self-donation or blood collected during the operation. However, LT does not normally allow autologous transfusion by prior self-donation. Hence, using autologous blood collected intraoperatively is the most feasible option. The use of intraoperative blood salvage autotransfusion (IBSA) minimizes the perioperative use of allogeneic blood, preventing negative transfusion effects without negatively impacting other clinical outcomes. The use of IBSA in patients with cancer is still a matter of debate due to the theoretical risk of reinfusion of tumor cells. However, studies have demonstrated the safety of IBSA in several surgical procedures, including LT for hepatocellular carcinoma. Considering the literature available to date, we can state that IBSA should be routinely used in LT, both in patients with cancer and in patients with benign diseases.",Up-to-date intraoperative computer assisted solutions for liver surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705734,World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,2019 02 03,"Computer assisted surgical planning allowed for a better selection of patients, evaluation of operative strategy, appropriate volumetric measurements, identification of anatomical risks, definition of tumour resection margins and choice of surgical approach in liver oncologic resections and living donor liver transplantations. Although preoperative computer surgical analysis has been widely used in daily clinical practice, intraoperative computer assisted solutions for risk analysis and navigation in liver surgery are not widely available or still under clinical evaluation. Computer science technology can efficiently assist modern surgeons during complex liver operations, mainly by providing image guidance with individualized 2D images and 3D models of the various anatomical and pathological structures of interest. Intraoperative computer assisted liver surgery is particularly useful in complex parenchyma-sparing hepatectomies, for intraoperative risk analysis and for the effective treatment of colorectal metastases after neoadjuvant therapy or when they are multiple. In laparoscopic liver surgery, intraoperative computer aid is definitively more important as, apart from a restricted field of view, there is also loss of the fine haptic feedback. Intraoperative computer assisted developments face challenges that prevent their application in daily clinical practice. There is a vast variety of studies regarding intraoperative computer assisted liver surgery but there are no clear objective measurements in order to compare them and select the most effective solutions.

Per-oral cholangioscopy has become an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool leading to avoidance of aggressive and unnecessary surgery in many clinical scenarios. This paper focuses on the newly developed SpyGlass DS technology, its advantages, and the technique of single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC), biliary indications and possible adverse events. We also review the available literature; discuss the limitations and future expectations. Digital SOC (D-SOC) is a useful technique, which provides endoscopic imaging of the biliary tree, optical diagnosis, biopsy under direct vision and therapeutic interventions. The implementations are diagnostic and therapeutic. Diagnostic indications are indeterminate biliary strictures, unclear filling defects, staging of cholangiocarcinoma, staging of ampullary tumors (extension into the common bile duct), unclear bile duct dilation, exploring cystic lesions of the biliary tree, unexplained hemobilia, posttransplant biliary complications. Therapeutic indications are lithotripsy of difficult stones, retrieval of migrated stents, foreign body removal, guide wire placement, transpapillary gallbladder drainage and endoscopic tumor ablative therapy. Most studied and established indications are the diagnosis of indeterminate biliary stricture and intraductal lithotripsy of difficult stones. The adverse events are not different and more common compared to those of Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) alone. D-SOC is a safe and effective procedure, adjunct to the standard ERCP and the newly available digital technology overcomes many of the limitations of the previous generations of cholangioscopes.",Pancreatoscopy: An update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705729,World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 02 03,"Per-oral pancreatoscopy (POPS) is an endoscopic procedure to visualize the main pancreatic duct. POPS specifically has the advantage of direct visualization of the pancreatic duct, allowing tissue acquisition and directed therapies such as stones lithotripsy. The aim of this review is to analyze and summarize the literature around pancreatoscopy. Pancreatoscopy consists of the classic technique of the mother-baby method in which a mini-endoscope is passed through the accessory channel of the therapeutic duodenoscope. Pancreatoscopy has two primary indications for diagnostic purpose. First, it is used for visualization and histological diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. In these cases, POPS is very useful to assess the extent of malignancy and for the study of the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in order to guide the surgery resection margins. Second, it is used to determine pancreatic duct strictures, particularly important in cases of chronic pancreatitis, which is associated with both benign and malignant strictures. Therefore POPS allows differentiation between benign and malignant disease and allows mapping the extent of the tumor prior to surgical resection. Also tissue sampling is possible, but it can be technically difficult because of the limited maneuverability of the biopsy forceps in the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatoscopy can also be used for therapeutic purposes, such as pancreatoscopy-guided lithotripsy in chronic painful pancreatitis with pancreatic duct stones. The available data for the moment suggests that, in selected patients, pancreatoscopy has an important and promising role to play in the diagnosis of indeterminate pancreatic duct strictures and the mapping of main pancreatic duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate and validate the pancreatoscopy role in the therapeutic algorithm of chronic pancreatitis.","Difficult biliary cannulation: Historical perspective, practical updates, and guide for the endoscopist.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705728,World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 02 03,"Despite improvements in endoscopic technologies and accessories, development of advanced endoscopy fellowship programs, and advances in ancillary imaging techniques, biliary cannulation in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can still be unsuccessful in up to 20% of patients, even in referral centers. Once cannulation has been deemed to be difficult, the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis and technical failure inherently increases. A number of factors, including endoscopist experience and patient anatomy, have been associated with difficult biliary cannulation, but predicting a case of difficult cannulation a priori is often not possible. Numerous techniques such as pancreatic guidewire and stenting, early pre-cut, and rendezvous may be employed when standard approaches fail. Data regarding the rate of success and adverse events of these techniques have been variable, though most studies suggest that pancreatic duct stenting generally reduces the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis in instances of difficult biliary cannulation. Here we provide a review on difficult biliary cannulation and discuss how the choice of which techniques to employ and how to best employ them should be individualized and take into account the skill of the endoscopist, the disorder being treated, the anatomy of the patient, and the available biomedical literature.",High prevalence of occult hepatitis C infection in predialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30705723,World journal of hepatology,2019 02 03,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (OCI) may be associated with extrahepatic diseases and it is known that the patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on hemodialysis (HD) present a higher prevalence of this type of infection than the general population, with a worse clinical outcome. However, there are no data in the literature to assess the presence of OCI in patients prior to the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and epidemiological aspects of OCI in patients with Predialysis CKD. We hypothesize that this infection could occur before RRT initiation."
