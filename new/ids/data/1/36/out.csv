To produce HA with desired molecular weight, it is important to identify parameters that offer tunability and control of MWHA at a desired value during fermentation. In this work, two tunable parameters, viz. glucose concentration and combination of HA biosynthetic genes expressed, were used to produce HA of different molecular weights. Three recombinant strains of Lactococcus lactis were constructed, using a combination of the has-operon genes from Streptococcus zooepidemicus (hasA, hasB, hasE) and the α-phosphoglucomutase gene (pgmA) from L. lactis. Batch fermentations of these recombinant strains at different initial glucose concentrations enabled production of HA with different molecular weights. Co-expression of hasABE was observed to be particularly effective in improving the MWHA. It was observed during batch fermentations of all these recombinant L. lactis cultures that the MWHA decreases steadily during the later part of the fermentation and the final value is 19-43% lower than the peak MWHA produced. Analysis of the fermentation data showed that the decrease in MWHA correlated strongly with the decrease in specific productivity of the culture. To overcome this decrease in MWHA, a glucostat strategy was successfully devised which could maintain a high value of specific productivity throughout the glucostat phase and result in constant-MW HA production. Glucostat processes were designed with the three recombinant L. lactis strains at two different glucose concentrations to produce constant molecular weight HA ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 MDa. This is the first report of its kind in literature that demonstrates production of controlled MW HA over a wide range by using a combination of tunable parameters and suitable process control strategies.",Improvement of stress tolerance and riboflavin production of Bacillus subtilis by introduction of heat shock proteins from thermophilic bacillus strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968162,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 05 08,"In this study, stress tolerance devices consisting of heat shock protein (HSP) genes from thermophiles Geobacillus and Parageobacillus were introduced into riboflavin-producing strain Bacillus subtilis 446 to improve its stress tolerance and riboflavin production. The 12 HSP homologs were selected from 28 Geobacillus and Parageobacillus genomes according to their sequence clustering and phylogenetically analysis which represents the diversity of HSPs from thermophilic bacillus. The 12 HSP genes and 2 combinations of them (PtdnaK-PtdnaJ-PtgrpE and PtgroeL-PtgroeS) were heterologously expressed in B. subtilis 446 under the control of a strong constitutive promoter P43. Most of the 14 engineered strains showed increased cell density at 44 to 48 °C and less cell death at 50 °C compared with the control strains. Among them, strains B.s446-HSP20-3, B.s446-HSP20-2, and B.s446-PtDnaK-PtDnaJ-PtGrpE increased their cell densities over 25% at 44 to 48 °C. They also showed 5-, 4-, and 4-fold improved cell survivals after the 10-h heat shock treatment at 50 °C, respectively. These three strains also showed reduced cell death rates under osmotic stress of 10% NaCl, indicating that the introduction of HSPs improved not only the heat tolerance of B. subtilis 446 but also its osmotic tolerance. Fermentation of these three strains at higher temperatures of 39 and 43 °C showed 23-66% improved riboflavin titers, as well as 24-h shortened fermentation period. These results indicated that implanting HSPs from thermophiles to B. subtilis 446 would be an efficient approach to improve its stress tolerance and riboflavin production.",[Endoscopic negative pressure therapy of a post-laryngectomy pharyngocutaneous fistula-first report of a new therapeutic method. German version].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968161,HNO,2019 04 10,"In the current first report, it is shown how a post-laryngectomy pharyngocutaneous fistula was successfully closed by endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT; also termed endoscopic vacuum therapy, EVT). The duration of negative pressure treatment was 14 days. Up until now, ENPT has been used for treatment of transmural defects in the rectum and esophagus. The new endoscopic method can also be used in the ENT field for closure of pharyngocutaneous fistulas.",Combining pedigree and genomic information to improve prediction quality: an example in sorghum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968160,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 10,"The use of a kinship matrix integrating pedigree- and marker-based relationships optimized the performance of genomic prediction in sorghum, especially for traits of lower heritability. Selection based on genome-wide markers has become an active breeding strategy in crops. Genomic prediction models can make use of pedigree information to account for the residual polygenic effects not captured by markers. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of using pedigree and genomic information on prediction quality of breeding values for different traits in sorghum. We explored BLUP models that use weighted combinations of pedigree and genomic relationship matrices. The optimal weighting factor was empirically determined in order to maximize predictive ability after evaluating a range of candidate weights. The phenotypic data consisted of testcross evaluations of sorghum parental lines across multiple environments. All lines were genotyped, and full pedigree information was available. The performance of the best predictive combined matrix was compared to that of models fitting the component matrices independently. Model performance was assessed using cross-validation technique. Fitting a combined pedigree-genomic matrix with the optimal weight always yielded the largest increases in predictive ability and the largest reductions in prediction bias relative to the simple G-BLUP. However, the weight that optimized prediction varied across traits. The benefits of including pedigree information in the genomic model were more relevant for traits with lower heritability, such as grain yield and stay-green. Our results suggest that the combination of pedigree and genomic relatedness can be used to optimize predictions of complex traits in crops when the additive variation is not fully explained by markers.",Rab5C enhances resistance to ionizing radiation in rectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968159,"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",2019 06 10,"Rectal cancer represents one third of the colorectal cancers that are diagnosed. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a well-established protocol for rectal cancer treatment reducing the risk of local recurrence. However, a pathologic complete response is only achieved in 10-40% of cases and the mechanisms associated with resistance are poorly understood. To identify potential targets for preventing therapy resistance, a proteomic analysis of biopsy specimens collected from stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma patients before neoadjuvant treatment was performed and compared with residual tumor tissues removed by surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. Three proteins, Ku70, Ku80, and Rab5C, exhibited a significant increase in expression after chemoradiation. To better understand the role of these proteins in therapy resistance, a rectal adenocarcinoma cell line was irradiated to generate a radiotherapy-resistant lineage. These cells overexpressed the same three proteins identified in the tissue samples. Furthermore, radiotherapy resistance in this in vitro model was found to involve modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization by Rab5C in response to irradiation, affecting expression of the DNA repair proteins, Ku70 and Ku80, and cell resistance. Taken together, these findings indicate that EGFR and Rab5C are potential targets for the sensitization of rectal cancer cells and they should be further investigated. KEY MESSAGES: • Rab5C orchestrates a mechanism of radioresistance in rectal adenocarcinoma cell. • Rab5C modulates EGFR internalization and its relocalization to the nucleus. • In the nucleus, EGFR can modulate the expression of the DNA repair proteins, Ku70 and Ku80. • Rab5C, Ku70, and Ku80 are overexpressed in tumor tissues that contain tumor cells that are resistant to chemoradiation treatment.",FABP5 regulates the proliferation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968158,International journal of oncology,2019 04 24,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been associated with one of the highest mortality rates among all cancers. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are 14‑15 kDa proteins that are highly abundant in the cytosol of most tissues. FABP5, a member of the FABP family, has been observed to promote tumor cell growth in numerous cancer types. In order to investigate the function of FABP5 in ccRCC cells in the present study, RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to determine the expression levels of FABP5 in ccRCC patient samples. Survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to measure the association between FABP5 expression and clinicopathological features of patients with ccRCC. Subsequent in vitro experiments downregulated or overexpressed FABP5 in Caki‑1 and 786O ccRCC cells using lentiviral vectors to evaluate cell proliferation ability, and a xenograft transplantation model was established to examine the effect of FABP5 on tumorigenesis in vivo. The results demonstrated that FABP5 expression was significantly upregulated in samples from patients with ccRCC when compared with normal tissue samples. High FABP5 expression was also significantly correlated with tumor and metastasis classifications and predicted poor survival in patients with ccRCC. In ccRCC cells, silencing of FABP5 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while overexpression of FABP5 promoted cell proliferation when compared to the respective controls. In addition, treatment with the phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase (PI3K)/AKT inhibitor, LY294002, attenuated the pro‑proliferative effects of exogenous FABP5 expression in Caki‑1 and 786O cells. This indicated that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may be partially involved in the FABP5‑mediated increase in ccRCC cell proliferation. Furthermore, FABP5 was observed to regulate tumor growth in nude mice in vivo. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that FABP5 may exert a pro‑proliferative role in ccRCC and may be associated with malignant progression and tumorigenesis.","CGK062, a small chemical molecule, inhibits cancer upregulated gene 2‑induced oncogenesis through NEK2 and β‑catenin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968157,International journal of oncology,2019 04 24,"The mechanisms through which cancer‑upregulated gene 2 (CUG2), a novel oncogene, affects Wnt/β‑catenin signaling, essential for tumorigenesis, are unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate some of these mechanisms in A549 lung cancer cells. Under the overexpression of CUG2, the protein levels and activity of β‑catenin were evaluated by western blot analysis and luciferase assay. To examine a biological consequence of β‑catenin under CUG2 overexpression, cell migration, invasion and sphere formation assay were performed. The upregulation of β‑catenin induced by CUG2 overexpression was also accessed by xenotransplantation in mice. We first found that CUG2 overexpression increased β‑catenin expression and activity. The suppression of β‑catenin decreased cancer stem cell (CSC)‑like phenotypes, indicating that β‑catenin is involved in CUG2‑mediated CSC‑like phenotypes. Notably, CUG2 overexpression increased the phosphorylation of β‑catenin at Ser33/Ser37, which is known to recruit E3 ligase for β‑catenin degradation. Moreover, CUG2 interacted with and enhanced the expression and kinase activity of never in mitosis gene A‑related kinase 2 (NEK2). Recombinant NEK2 phosphorylated β‑catenin at Ser33/Ser37, while NEK2 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of β‑catenin, suggesting that NEK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of β‑catenin at Ser33/Ser37. Treatment with CGK062, a small chemical molecule, which promotes the phosphorylation of β‑catenin at Ser33/Ser37 through protein kinase C (PKC)α to induce its degradation, reduced β‑catenin levels and inhibited the CUG2‑induced features of malignant tumors, including increased cell migration, invasion and sphere formation. Furthermore, CGK062 treatment suppressed CUG2‑mediated tumor formation in nude mice. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that CUG2 enhances the phosphorylation of β‑catenin at Ser33/Ser37 by activating NEK2, thus stabilizing β‑catenin. CGK062 may thus have potential for use as a therapeutic drug against CUG2‑overexpressing lung cancer cells.",Vitamin D and its low calcemic analogs modulate the anticancer properties of cisplatin and dacarbazine in the human melanoma A375 cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968156,International journal of oncology,2019 06 10,"Melanoma represents a significant challenge in cancer treatment due to the high drug resistance of melanomas and the patient mortality rate. This study presents data indicating that nanomolar concentrations of the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1α,25‑dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], its non‑calcemic analogues 20S‑hydroxyvitamin D3 and 21‑hydroxypregnacalciferol, as well as the low‑calcemic synthetic analog calcipotriol, modulate the efficacy of the anticancer drugs cisplatin and dacarbazine. It was observed that vitamin D analogs sensitized melanoma A375 cells to hydrogen peroxide used as an inducer of oxidative stress. On the other hand, only 1α,25(OH)2D3 resulted in a minor, but significant effect on the proliferation of melanoma cells treated simultaneously with dacarbazine, but not cisplatin. Notably, cisplatin (300 µM) exhibited a higher overall antiproliferative activity than dacarbazine. Cisplatin treatment of melanoma cells resulted in an induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by flow cytometry (accumulation of cells at the subG1 phase of the cell cycle), whereas dacarbazine caused G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, with the effects being improved by pre‑treatment with vitamin D analogs. Treatment with cisplatin resulted in an initial increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dacarbazine caused transient stimulation of ROS levels and the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (after 1 or 3 h of treatment, respectively), but the effect was not detectable following prolonged (24 h) incubation with the drug. Vitamin D exhibited modulatory effects on the cells treated with dacarbazine, decreasing the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the drug, stimulating G1/G0 arrest and causing a marked decrease in Δψm. Finally, cisplatin, dacarbazine and 1α,25(OH)2D3 displayed modulatory effects on the expression of ROS and vitamin D‑associated genes in the melanoma A375 cells. In conclusion, nanomolar concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 only had minor effects on the proliferation of melanoma cells treated with dacarbazine, decreasing the relative IC50 value. However, co‑treatment with vitamin D analogs resulted in the modulation of cell cycle and ROS responses, and affected gene expression, suggesting possible crosstalk between the signaling pathways of vitamin D and the anticancer drugs used in this study.",Netrin‑1 interference potentiates epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition through the PI3K/AKT pathway under the hypoxic microenvironment conditions of non‑small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968155,International journal of oncology,2019 04 24,"Netrin‑1 is overexpressed in several types of cancer. However, whether netrin‑1 can potentiate hypoxia‑induced tumor progression in lung cancer has not been reported to date. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether netrin‑1 regulates cancer cell migration and invasion under hypoxic conditions in lung cancer and explore the underlying mechanism. A three‑dimensional microfluidic chip was used to observe real‑time changes in cancer cells, and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) was used to simulate a hypoxic microenvironment. Netrin‑1 siRNA was employed in the A549 and PC9 cell lines to downregulate the expression of netrin‑1. Microfluidic chip, wound healing and Transwell assays were used to examine cell migration and invasion. The expression levels of E‑cadherin and vimentin were detected by western blotting. The data demonstrated that netrin‑1 mediated epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of A549 and PC9 cells in vitro, which may be associated with the phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT pathway. This effect of netrin‑1 on the EMT was not observed in the normoxic microenvironment. In this retrospective study, netrin‑1 concentrations were evaluated in serum obtained from patients with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and compared with healthy control samples by quantitative enzyme‑linked immunosorbent analysis. The serum concentration of netrin‑1 was found to be significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with that in healthy donors. Taken together, the findings of the present study highlight a novel role for netrin‑1 in tumor development under hypoxia in NSCLC and provide further evidence for the use of netrin‑1 as a therapeutic target.",Diverse and cancer type‑specific roles of the p53 R248Q gain‑of‑function mutation in cancer migration and invasiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968154,International journal of oncology,2019 04 24,"Gain‑of‑function (GOF) mutations in the TP53 gene lead to acquisition of new functions by the mutated tumor suppressor p53 protein. A number of the over‑represented 'hot spot' mutations, including the ones in codons 175, 248 or 273, convey GOF phenotypes. Such phenotypes may include resistance to chemotherapeutics or changes in motility and invasiveness. Whereas the prevalent notion is that the acquisition of the p53 GOF phenotype translates into poorer prognosis for the patient, the analysis of a human somatic p53 mutations dataset demonstrated earlier tumor onset, but decreased frequency and altered location of metastases in patients with the p53‑R248Q allele. Therefore, the GOF activities of p53‑R248Q and p53‑D281G were analyzed in triple negative breast cancer MDA‑MB‑231 and lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cell lines with regard to invasive and metastatic traits. The expression of p53‑D281G increased the motility and invasiveness of the lung cancer cells, but not those of the breast cancer cells. In contrast, the expression of p53‑R248Q decreased the motility and invasiveness of the breast and lung cancer cells in a p53 transactivation‑dependent manner. The intravenous xenotransplantation of MDA‑MB‑231 cells expressing p53‑R248Q into zebrafish embryos resulted in an alteration of the distribution of cancer cells in the body of the fish. In p53‑R248Q‑expressing H1299 cells a decrease in the expression of TCF8/ZEB1 and N‑cadherin was observed, suggesting partial mesenchymal‑to‑epithelial transition. In the two cell lines expressing p53‑R248Q a decrease was noted in the expression of myosin light chain 2, a protein involved in actomyosin‑based motility. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is one of only few reports demonstrating the mutated p53 GOF activity resulting in a decrease of a malignant trait in human cancer."

Dietary nutrients were formulated to keep similar ME/nutrient ratios, except for dietary protein, fat, and fiber using corn, soybean meal, animal protein blend, barley, poultry oil and an enzyme mixture of xylanase, glucanase, and phytase. Digestibility coefficients of nutrients and ME were measured in battery cages under free-access of feed, while NE was measured in floor pens feeding 75% of recommended ME intake each day. NE for maintenance was calculated on basis of mean metabolic weight using a coefficient from a previous study and NE for gain was calculated by body protein and fat gains using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Digestibility coefficients of protein and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were curvilinearly related to dietary protein and NDF, respectively, while digestibility coefficients of fat and starch were linearly correlated to dietary fat and starch, respectively. The inclusion of enzymes increased the digestion coefficient of NDF to predict the digestibility of protein, NDF, fat, and starch. MEn/gross energy ratio averaged 72.5% and was correlated to protein, fat, NDF, and starch. ME values were accurately predicted from chemical characteristics, where best equations were obtained from digestible nutrients. Energetic efficiencies of ME were 72% (NE/MEn) and 68% (NE/ME) and varied by about 20 and 18%, respectively. Ratios of energetic efficiency were 68% for digestible carbohydrates; 86% for digestible fat; and 76% (NE/MEn) and 59% (NE/ME) for digestible protein. According to the lowest residual standard deviation the best nutrient components to predict energy were digestible nutrients for predicting ME values (41 kcal/kg); digestible protein intake, fecal organic matter, and body fat and protein for predicting heat increment values (111 kcal/kg); and combination of ME and crude nutrient for predicting NE values (140 kcal/kg).",Society of Toxicology Develops Learning Framework for Undergraduate Toxicology Courses Following the Vision and Change Core Concepts Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968141,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2019 04 10,"The Society of Toxicology announces the development of a Learning Framework (https://www.toxicology.org/education/docs/SOT-Toxicology-Learning-Objectives.pdf) for undergraduate toxicology that will facilitate the development and sharing of evidence-based teaching materials for undergraduate toxicology educators throughout the world. This Learning Framework was modeled on the ""Vision and Change Report"" (www.visionandchange.org), an effort of the National Science Foundation and American Association for the Advancement of Science defining Core Concepts and Core Competencies to inform undergraduate biology course design. Vision and Change (V&C) has gained national acceptance, becoming a foundation for 14 upper-level courses designed by professional life science scientific societies. The undergraduate toxicology Learning Framework includes five Core Concepts aligned with V&C that encompass the discipline of toxicology: Evolution; Biological Information, Risk and Risk; Management; Systems Toxicology; and Pathways and Transformations for Energy and Matter. Underpinning the Core Concepts are Level Two Toxicology Concepts, which are broad disciplinary categories, Level Three Learning Objectives, which address specific learning goals, and Level Four Example Learning Objectives and Case Studies, which provide examples of how content might be taught. Syllabi from more than 20 undergraduate toxicology courses and several undergraduate toxicology textbooks were surveyed to determine toxicology-related Learning Objectives. From these, undergraduate educators can design courses tailored to their institutional needs by selecting a subset of Learning Objectives. Publication of a Learning Framework for toxicology will enable integration into other disciplines and facilitate the development and sharing of evidenced-based teaching materials for toxicology to educators in allied disciplines. Ultimately this will expand toxicology's impact to a broader audience.",Restricting carbohydrates at breakfast is sufficient to reduce 24-hour exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and improve glycemic variability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968140,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 05 08,The breakfast meal often results in the largest postprandial hyperglycemic excursion in people with type 2 diabetes.,Structural evidence for an essential Fe-S cluster in the catalytic core domain of DNA polymerase ϵ.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968138,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 10,"DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ), the major leading-strand DNA polymerase in eukaryotes, has a catalytic subunit (Pol2) and three non-catalytic subunits. The N-terminal half of Pol2 (Pol2CORE) exhibits both polymerase and exonuclease activity. It has been suggested that both the non-catalytic C-terminal domain of Pol2 (with the two cysteine motifs CysA and CysB) and Pol2CORE (with the CysX cysteine motif) are likely to coordinate an Fe-S cluster. Here, we present two new crystal structures of Pol2CORE with an Fe-S cluster bound to the CysX motif, supported by an anomalous signal at that position. Furthermore we show that purified four-subunit Pol ϵ, Pol ϵ CysAMUT (C2111S/C2133S), and Pol ϵ CysBMUT (C2167S/C2181S) all have an Fe-S cluster that is not present in Pol ϵ CysXMUT (C665S/C668S). Pol ϵ CysAMUT and Pol ϵ CysBMUT behave similarly to wild-type Pol ϵ in in vitro assays, but Pol ϵ CysXMUT has severely compromised DNA polymerase activity that is not the result of an excessive exonuclease activity. Tetrad analyses show that haploid yeast strains carrying CysXMUT are inviable. In conclusion, Pol ϵ has a single Fe-S cluster bound at the base of the P-domain, and this Fe-S cluster is essential for cell viability and polymerase activity.",Dietary proteins and protein sources and risk of death: the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968137,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 05 03,Previous studies investigating protein intake in relation to mortality have provided conflicting results.,Final internal cooking temperature of pork chops influenced consumer eating experience more than visual color and marbling or ultimate pH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968136,Journal of animal science,2019 06 14,"The objective was to determine the effect of ""quality grade"" (combination of visual color and marbling) or ultimate pH on consumer eating experience of pork chops cooked to different final internal temperatures. The hypothesis was that consumers would rate a greater percentage of pork chops as acceptable when graded ""choice,"" had a greater ultimate pH, or when cooked to 63 °C compared with chops graded ""standard,"" had a lesser ultimate pH, or when cooked to 71 or 82 °C. Consumers (264 total) were served chops in 1 of 2 experiments. Chops in Exp. 1 were classified as ""choice"" when NPPC visual color score ≥3 and visual marbling score was ≥2 or ""standard"" when NPPC scores did not meet the qualifications for ""choice"" and were cooked to either 63 or 71 °C. Chops in Exp. 2 were categorized as high pH (5.88 to 6.23) or low pH (5.36 to 5.56) and cooked to 63, 71, or 82 °C. Chops were cooked with a sous-vide device (ANOVA Precision Cooker, Anova Applied Electronics, San Francisco, CA) in a water bath. Consumers used a 9-point Likert-type score system where scores 1 through 3 were considered not tender, not juicy, not flavorful, or unacceptable. Scores 4 through 6 were consider neutral for tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability. Scores 7 through 9 were considered tender, juicy, flavorful, and acceptable. Data were organized as a percentage of responses and analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS for both experiments with models including treatment (quality grade, ultimate pH, and final internal temperature) and all interactions. Quality grade did not affect (P ≥ 0.30) consumer ratings for any sensory trait. More (P < 0.01) consumers rated chops with a high pH (36.07%) as juicy compared with chops with a low pH (24.29%), but pH category did not alter (P ≥ 0.13) perceptions for tenderness, flavor, or overall acceptability. In both studies, a greater (P < 0.001) percentage of consumers rated chops cooked to 63 °C as acceptable compared with chops cooked to 71 °C. Therefore, internal cooking temperature has a greater impact on consumer eating experience than ""quality grade"" or ultimate pH.",Dynamics of transposable element invasions with piRNA clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968135,Molecular biology and evolution,2019 04 10,"In mammals and invertebrates the proliferation of an invading transposable element (TE) is thought to be stopped by an insertion into a piRNA cluster. Here we explore the dynamics of TE invasions under this trap model using computer simulations. We found that piRNA clusters confer a substantial benefit, effectively preventing extinction of host populations from a proliferation of deleterious TEs. TE invasions consists of three distinct phases: first the TE amplifies within the population, next TE proliferation is stopped by segregating cluster insertions and finally the TE is inactivated by fixation of a cluster insertion. Suppression by segregating cluster insertions is unstable and bursts of TE activity may yet occur. The transposition rate and the population size mostly influence the length of the phases but not the amount of TEs accumulating during an invasion. Solely the size of piRNA clusters was identified as a major factor influencing TE abundance. We found that a single non-recombining cluster is more efficient in stopping invasions than clusters distributed over several chromosomes. Recombination among cluster sites makes it necessary that each diploid carries, on the average, four cluster insertions to stop an invasion. Surprisingly, negative selection in a model with piRNA clusters can lead to a novel equilibrium state, where TE copy numbers remain stable despite only some individuals in a population carrying a cluster insertion. In Drosophila melanogaster the trap model accounts for the abundance of TEs produced in the germline but fails to predict the abundance of TEs produced in the soma.",Alternative oxidase is an important player in the regulation of nitric oxide levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968134,Journal of experimental botany,2019 04 10,"Plant mitochondria possess two different pathways for electron transport from ubiquinol: the cytochrome pathway and the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway. The AOX pathway plays an important role in stress tolerance and is induced by various metabolites and signals. Previously, several lines of evidence suggested that the AOX pathway prevents overproduction of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species. More recent evidence suggests that AOX also plays a role in regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and signalling. The AOX pathway is induced under low phosphate, hypoxia, pathogen infections and elicitor treatments. The induction of AOX under aerobic conditions in response to various stresses can reduce electron transfer through complexes III and IV and thus prevents the leakage of electrons to nitrite and the subsequent accumulation of NO. Excess of NO under various stresses can inhibit complex IV, thus the AOX pathway minimizes nitrite-dependent NO synthesis that would arise from enhanced electron leakage in the cytochrome pathway. By preventing NO generation, AOX can reduce peroxynitrite formation and tyrosine nitration. In contrast to its function under normoxia, AOX has a specific role under hypoxia, where AOX can facilitate nitrite-dependent NO production. This reaction drives the phytoglobin-NO cycle to increase energy efficiency under hypoxia.",Replicative DNA polymerases promote active displacement of SSB proteins during lagging strand synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968132,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 10,"Genome replication induces the generation of large stretches of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates that are rapidly protected by single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins. To date, the mechanism by which tightly bound SSBs are removed from ssDNA by the lagging strand DNA polymerase without compromising the advance of the replication fork remains unresolved. Here, we aimed to address this question by measuring, with optical tweezers, the real-time replication kinetics of the human mitochondrial and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerases on free-ssDNA, in comparison with ssDNA covered with homologous and non-homologous SSBs under mechanical tension. We find important differences between the force dependencies of the instantaneous replication rates of each polymerase on different substrates. Modeling of the data supports a mechanism in which strong, specific polymerase-SSB interactions, up to ∼12 kBT, are required for the polymerase to dislodge SSB from the template without compromising its instantaneous replication rate, even under stress conditions that may affect SSB-DNA organization and/or polymerase-SSB communication. Upon interaction, the elimination of template secondary structure by SSB binding facilitates the maximum replication rate of the lagging strand polymerase. In contrast, in the absence of polymerase-SSB interactions, SSB poses an effective barrier for the advance of the polymerase, slowing down DNA synthesis.",Sensitive effect of linker histone binding mode and subtype on chromatin condensation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968131,Nucleic acids research,2019 06 14,"The complex role of linker histone (LH) on chromatin compaction regulation has been highlighted by recent discoveries of the effect of LH binding variability and isoforms on genome structure and function. Here we examine the effect of two LH variants and variable binding modes on the structure of chromatin fibers. Our mesoscale modeling considers oligonucleosomes with H1C and H1E, bound in three different on and off-dyad modes, and spanning different LH densities (0.5-1.6 per nucleosome), over a wide range of physiologically relevant nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs). Our studies reveal an LH-variant and binding-mode dependent heterogeneous ensemble of fiber structures with variable packing ratios, sedimentation coefficients, and persistence lengths. For maximal compaction, besides dominantly interacting with parental DNA, LHs must have strong interactions with nonparental DNA and promote tail/nonparental core interactions. An off-dyad binding of H1E enables both; others compromise compaction for bendability. We also find that an increase of LH density beyond 1 is best accommodated in chromatosomes with one on-dyad and one off-dyad LH. We suggest that variable LH binding modes and concentrations are advantageous, allowing tunable levels of chromatin condensation and DNA accessibility/interactions. Thus, LHs add another level of epigenetic regulation of chromatin."

One possible solution to warrant biostability is to directly evolve chemically modified aptamers from xenobiotic nucleic acids (XNAs). We have isolated fully modified 2'-O-methyl-ribose-1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleic acid (MeORNA-HNA) aptamers targeting the rat vascular endothelial growth factor 164 (rVEGF164). Three sequences have been identified that interact with the target protein with affinities in the low-nanomolar range and HNA modifications appeared to be mandatory for their tight binding. The evolution of these XNA aptamers was accomplished using an in vitro selection procedure starting from a fully sugar-modified library containing a 20mer 2'-OMe-ribonucleotide region followed by a 47mer HNA sequence. The high binding affinity and selectivity of the selected aptamers were confirmed by several methods including gel-shift, fluorescence polarisation, and enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assays. The isolated HNA ligands exhibited higher specificity to the rVEGF164 and human VEGF165 isoforms compared to rat VEGF120, while very low binding efficiencies were observed to streptavidin and thrombin. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that the resulting aptamers possessed a superior stability to degradation in human serum and DNase I solutions.",The evaluation of potential immunotoxicity induced by environmental pollutant ammonia in broilers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968116,Poultry science,2019 04 10,"Ammonia (NH3) is a harmful gas with irritating odor, and higher NH3 concentration was found in intensive poultry houses. Although the toxicity of NH3 is well known, little attention has been given to the mechanism of NH3 poisoning in chicken immune organs. To investigate NH3-caused inflammatory damage of broiler spleens, in this study, a broiler model for NH3 poisoning was established, and 3 levels (including microRNA [miRNA], mRNA, and protein) were performed using qRT-PCR and western blot. The results indicated that NH3 exposure caused inflammatory damage using microstructure observation; decreased 2 inflammation-related miRNAs (miR-133a and miR-6615), 2 cytokines secreted by T helper cells 1 (Th1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1); and increased 2 target genes (LOC101747543 and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 [SMAD7]) of the 2 miRNAs, 7 inflammation-related factors, 3 cytokines secreted by Th2, and 5 heat shock proteins (HSPs) in broiler spleens. Our study suggested that Th1/Th2 imbalance, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, and compensatory response of HSPs were involved in NH3-caused inflammatory damage in broiler spleens; there was immunotoxic effect in excess NH3 on broilers. For the first time, we discovered miR-6615 and LOC101747543 may be involved in the mechanism of broiler spleen inflammatory damage caused by NH3 via the NF-κB pathway, and further mechanism needs to be investigated. This study provides new insights for NH3 toxicity identification and risk assessment in animal husbandry production practice.",Staged total cavopulmonary connection: serial comparison of intra-atrial lateral tunnel and extracardiac conduit taking account of current surgical adaptations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968115,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,2019 04 10,"Our goals were to compare the outcome of the intra-atrial lateral tunnel (ILT) and the extracardiac conduit (ECC) techniques for staged total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) and to compare the current modifications of the TCPC technique, i.e. the prosthetic ILT technique with the current ECC technique with a ≥18-mm conduit.",Dietary index scores and invasive breast cancer risk among women with a family history of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968114,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2019 05 08,Many epidemiologic studies have analyzed the relations of individual foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk with inconsistent results.

This review will examine the pregnancy retention rates of IVP embryos and explore causes for pregnancy failures. Based on work completed over the past 25 yr, only 27% of cattle receiving IVP embryos will produce a live calf. Approximately 60% of these pregnancies fail during the first 6 wk of gestation. When compared with embryos generated by superovulation, pregnancy rates are 10% to 40% lower for cattle carrying IVP embryos, exemplifying that IVP embryos are consistently less competent than in vivo-generated embryos. Several abnormalities have been observed in the morphology of IVP conceptuses. After transfer, IVP embryos are less likely to undergo conceptus elongation, have reduced embryonic disk diameter, and have compromised yolk sac development. Marginal binucleate cell development, cotyledon development, and placental vascularization have also been documented, and these abnormalities are associated with altered fetal growth trajectories. Additionally, in vitro culture conditions increase the risk of large offspring syndrome. Further work is needed to decipher how the embryo culture environment alters post-transfer embryo development and survival. The risk of these neonatal disorders has been reduced by the use of serum-free synthetic oviductal fluid media formations and culture in low oxygen tension. However, alterations are still evident in IVP oocyte and embryo transcript abundances, timing of embryonic cleavage events and blastulation, incidence of aneuploidy, and embryonic methylation status. The inclusion of oviductal and uterine-derived embryokines in culture media is being examined as one way to improve the competency of IVP embryos. To conclude, the evidence presented herein clearly shows that bovine IVP systems still must be refined to make it an economical technology in cattle production systems. However, the current shortcomings do not negate its current value for certain embryo production needs and for investigating early embryonic development in cattle.",Investigating causal biological relationships between reproductive performance traits in high-performing gilts and sows1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968112,Journal of animal science,2019 06 14,"Efficient management of swine production systems requires understanding of complex reproductive physiological mechanisms. Our objective in this study was to investigate potential causal biological relationships between reproductive performance traits in high-producing gilts and sows. Data originated from a nutrition experiment and consisted of 200 sows and 440 gilts arranged in body weight blocks and randomly assigned to dietary treatments during late gestation at a commercial swine farm. Reproductive performance traits consisted of weight gain during late gestation, total number born and number born alive in a litter, born alive average birth weight, wean-to-estrous interval, and total litter size born in the subsequent farrowing. Structural equation models combined with the inductive causation algorithm, both adapted to a hierarchical Bayesian framework, were employed to search for, estimate, and infer upon causal links between the traits within each parity group. Results indicated potentially distinct reproductive networks for gilts and for sows. Sows showed sparse connectivity between reproductive traits, whereas the network learned for gilts was densely interconnected, suggesting closely linked physiological mechanisms in younger females, with a potential for ripple effects throughout their productive lifecycle in response to early implementation of tailored managerial interventions. Cross-validation analyses indicated substantial network stability both for the general structure and for individual links, though results about directionality of such links were unstable in this study and will need further investigation. An assessment of relative statistical power in sows and gilts indicated that the observed network discrepancies may be partially explained on a biological basis. In summary, our results suggest distinctly heterogeneous mechanistic networks of reproductive physiology for gilts and sows, consistent with physiological differences between the groups. These findings have potential practical implications for integrated understanding and differential management of gilts and sows to enhance efficiency of swine production systems.","A mutation in the major autophagy gene, WIPI2, associated with global developmental abnormalities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968111,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 03,"We describe a large consanguineous pedigree from a remote area of Northern Pakistan, with a complex developmental disorder associated with wide-ranging symptoms, including mental retardation, speech and language impairment and other neurological, psychiatric, skeletal and cardiac abnormalities. We initially carried out a genetic study using the HumanCytoSNP-12 v2.1 Illumina gene chip on nine family members and identified a single region of homozygosity shared amongst four affected individuals on chromosome 7p22 (positions 3059377-5478971). We performed whole-exome sequencing on two affected individuals from two separate branches of the extended pedigree and identified a novel nonsynonymous homozygous mutation in exon 9 of the WIPI2 (WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositide 2) gene at position 5265458 (c.G745A;pV249M). WIPI2 plays a critical role in autophagy, an evolutionary conserved cellular pathway implicated in a growing number of medical conditions. The mutation is situated in a highly conserved and critically important region of WIPI2, responsible for binding PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, an essential requirement for autophagy to proceed. The mutation is absent in all public databases, is predicted to be damaging and segregates with the disease phenotype. We performed functional studies in vitro to determine the potential effects of the mutation on downstream pathways leading to autophagosome assembly. Binding of the V231M mutant of WIPI2b to ATG16L1 (as well as ATG5-12) is significantly reduced in GFP pull-down experiments, and fibroblasts derived from the patients show reduced WIPI2 puncta, reduced LC3 lipidation and reduced autophagic flux.",Unmasking herd protection by an oral cholera vaccine in a cluster-randomized trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968110,International journal of epidemiology,2019 04 10,"Several studies have shown that inactivated, whole-cell oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) confer both direct protection on vaccinees and herd protection on populations.

The synthetic flexibility of TPCOs enables facile tuning of their properties. In this study, we address the effect of various electron-donating and electron-withdrawing symmetric terminal substituents (fluorine, methyl, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, tert-butyl, and trimethylsilyl) on frontier orbitals, charge distribution, static polarizabilities, molecular vibrations, bandgaps and photoluminescence quantum yields of 5,5'-diphenyl-2,2'-bithiophene (PTTP). By combining DFT calculations with cyclic voltammetry and absorption, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies, we show that symmetric terminal substitution tunes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of TPCOs within a range of ∼0.7 eV, shifts the frequencies of the vibrational modes associated with the phenyl rings, changes the photoluminescence quantum yield by about two-fold and slightly changes the bandgap by ∼0.1 eV. We demonstrate that these effects are governed by two factors: the Hammet constant of the substituents and their involvement in the π-conjugation/hyperconjugation described by the effective conjugation length of the substituted oligomer. A detailed picture underlying the effect of the terminal substituents on the electronic, vibrational and optical properties of TPCOs is presented. Overall, the unraveled relationships between the structure and the properties of the substituted PTTPs should facilitate a rational design of π-conjugated (co-)oligomers for efficient organic optoelectronic devices."

Although MPS provide unique microenvironments that transcend common 2D cell culture, without proper regulation of oxygen content, MPS often fail to provide the biomimetic environment necessary to activate and investigate fundamental pathways of cellular metabolism and sub-cellular level. Oxygen exists in the human body in various concentrations and partial pressures; moreover, it fluctuates dramatically depending on fasting, exercise, and sleep patterns. Regulating oxygen content inside MPS necessitates a sensitive biological sensor to quantify oxygen content in real-time. Measuring oxygen in a microdevice is a non-trivial requirement for studies focused on understanding how oxygen impacts cellular processes, including angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Quantifying oxygen inside a microdevice can be achieved via an array of technologies, with each method having benefits and limitations in terms of sensitivity, limits of detection, and invasiveness that must be considered and optimized. This article will review oxygen physiology in organ systems and offer comparisons of organ-specific MPS that do and do not consider oxygen microenvironments. Materials used in microphysiological models will also be analyzed in terms of their ability to control oxygen. Finally, oxygen sensor technologies are critically compared and evaluated for use in MPS.",Tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate-modified hollow silver nanoparticles for combating bacteria-resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968093,Biomaterials science,2019 05 28,"Multiple drug resistance and the increase in the appearance of superbugs together with the exceedingly scant development of new potent antibiotic drugs pose an urgent global medical threat and imminent public security crisis. In the present study, we fabricated well-dispersed tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS)-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of about 10 nm in size. The hollow structure of the TPGS-capped AgNPs (TPGS/AgNPs) was confirmed and applied to load antibiotics. The TPGS/AgNPs proved to be able to cross the bacterial cell wall and penetrate into bacteria, thereby delivering more of the antibiotic to the interior of bacteria and thus enhancing the in vitro antibacterial effect of the antibiotic, even overcoming the drug-resistance in drug-resistant E. coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. It was found that the TPGS modification in the TPGS/AgNPs could decrease the activity of the efflux pumps AdeABC and AdeIJK in drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii via inhibiting the efflux pump genes adeB and adeJ, thus increasing the accumulation of the delivered antibiotic and overcoming the drug-resistance. Tigecycline delivered by TPGS/AgNPs could effectively antagonize drug-resistance in an acute peritonitis model mice, thereby increasing the survival rate and alleviating the inflammatory response.

We employ bimodal atomic force microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy for high spatial resolution and large area scanning of force of adhesion on the regions of the graphene/SiO2 surface with different graphene layers. Our measurements show that the interface conditions between graphene and SiO2 dominate the experimentally observed graphene surface energy. This finding sheds new light on the controversy surrounding graphene transparency studies. By separating the surface energy into polar and non-polar interactions, our findings suggest that monolayer graphene is nearly van der Waals opaque but partially transparent (near 60%) to polar interactions, which is further supported by characterizing graphene on the copper surface and two levels of density functional theory simulation.

Aneuploidy has been shown to produce more global modulations than polyploidy with the responsible genes being transcription factors and signaling components involved in molecular complexes, illustrating a stoichiometric component to gene expression. Genomic imbalance is usually detrimental to the organism and in many cases results in lethality. Here, it is proposed that once gene flow is prevented between or within populations by various speciation initiating processes, the stoichiometric relationship of members of macromolecular complexes can change via compensatory drift with the eventual result of newly established functional balances. However, when these new relationships are brought together in interspecific hybrids, detrimental consequences will occur. We suggest that these detrimental interactions contribute to hybrid incompatibilities.",Epigenetic Classifiers for Precision Diagnosis of Brain Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968063,Epigenetics insights,2019 04 12,"DNA methylation profiling has proven to be a powerful analytical tool, which can accurately identify the tissue of origin of a wide range of benign and malignant neoplasms.

We have explored the methylomes of metastatic brain tumors from patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and cutaneous melanoma and primary brain neoplasms to build epigenetic classifiers. Our brain metastasis methylation (BrainMETH) classifier has the ability to determine the type of brain tumor, the origin of the metastases, and the clinical-therapeutic subtype for patients with breast cancer brain metastases. To facilitate the translation of these epigenetic classifiers into clinical practice, we selected and validated the most informative genomic regions utilizing quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP).

It is characterized by the presence of a maculopapular erythematous skin eruption, fever, lymphadenopathy, influenza-like symptoms, eosinophilia, and visceral involvement such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, and colitis. The prognosis of patients with DReSS is related to the severity of visceral involvement. The mortality ranges from approximately 5% to 10%, and death is mainly due to liver failure, which is also the organ most commonly involved in this syndrome. Although it was previously hypothesized in 1994, DReSS syndrome can lead to reactivation of one or more human herpesvirus family members. Now being included as diagnostic criteria in a proposed diagnostic score system, this reactivation can be detected up to 2-3 wk after DReSS syndrome onset. Other causes of mortality in DReSS syndrome include myocardial or pulmonary lesions and hemophagocytosis. We reviewed the literature of previously reported case-series of DReSS and liver involvement, highlighting the pattern of liver damage, the treatment used, and the outcome.",Effects of apoptosis on liver aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968034,World journal of clinical cases,2019 04 12,"As an irreversible and perennial process, aging is accompanied by functional and morphological declines in organs.

We aimed to identify these drivers using a novel approach that combined participatory epidemiology (PE) and Q-sorting (a methodology that allows the analysis of the subjectivity of individuals facing a common phenomenon). A total of 26 semi-structured collective interviews were conducted with 125 farmers representative of the most common farming systems in the area (chickens, meat ducks, and mobile grazing ducks), as well as with 73 farmers' advisors [veterinarians, veterinary drug shop owners, and government veterinarians/commune animal health workers (CAHWs)] in five districts of Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta). Through these interviews, 46 statements related to the antimicrobials' perceived reliability, costs, and impact on flock health were created. These statements were then investigated on 54 individuals (28 farmers and 26 farmers' advisors) using Q-sorting interviews. Farmers generally indicated a higher propensity for antimicrobial usage (AMU) should their flocks encounter bacterial infections (75.0-78.6%) compared with viral infections (8.3-66.7%). The most trusted sources of advice to farmers were, in decreasing order: government veterinarian/CAHWs, their own knowledge/experience, veterinary drug shop owners, and sales persons from pharmaceutical and feed companies. The highest peak of AMU took place in the early phase of the production cycle. Farmers and their advisors showed considerable heterogeneity of attitudes with regards to AMU, with, respectively, four and three discourses representing their views on AMU. Overall, farmers regarded the cost of AMU cheaper than other disease management practices implemented on their farms. However, they also believed that even though these measures were more expensive, they would also lead to more effective disease prevention. A key recommendation from this finding would be for the veterinary authorities to implement long-term sustainable training programs aiming at reducing farmers' reliance on antimicrobials.",The Impact of Natural Antioxidants on the Regenerative Potential of Vascular Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968031,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 04 12,"With advances in technology, the impact of natural antioxidants on vascular cell regeneration is attracting enormous attention as many current studies are now exploring the clinical potential of antioxidants in regenerative medicine. Natural antioxidants are an important step for improving future treatment and prevention of various diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer, neurodegenerative, and diabetes. The use of natural antioxidants which have effects on several types of stem cells with the potential to differentiate into functional endothelium and smooth muscle cells (known as vascular progenitors) for vascular regeneration might override pharmaceutical and surgical treatments. The natural antioxidant systems comprise of several components present in fruits, vegetables, legumes, medicinal plants, and other animal-derived products that interact with reactive free radicals such as oxygen and nitrogen species to neutralize their oxidative damaging effects on vascular cells. Neutralization by antioxidants involves the breaking down of the oxidative cascade chain reactions in the cell membranes in order to fine-tune the free radical levels. The effect of natural antioxidants on vascular regeneration includes restoration or establishment of new vascular structures and functions. In this review, we highlight the significant effects of natural antioxidants on modulating vascular cells to regenerate vessels, as well as possible mechanisms of action and the potential therapeutic benefits on health. The role of antioxidants in regenerating vessels may be critical for the future of regenerative medicine in terms of the maintenance of the normal functioning of vessels and the prevention of multiple vascular diseases.",Novel Mannitol-Based Small Molecules for Inhibiting Aggregation of α-Synuclein Amyloids in Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968030,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2019 04 12,"The aggregation of the amyloidogenic protein α-synuclein (α-Syn) into toxic oligomers and mature fibrils is the major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Herein, we tested whether the conjugation of Mannitol and NQTrp may result in enhance efficacy toward α-Syn. The molecules were conjugated either by a click linker or via a PEG linker. The effect of the conjugate molecules on α-Syn aggregation in vitro was monitored using Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy, and Congo red birefringence assay. One of the conjugate molecules was found to be more effective than the two parent molecules and as effective as a mixture of the two.

These maladies are associated with the formation of aggregative amyloid protein structures showing common characteristics, such as the assembly of soluble oligomeric species, binding of indicative dyes, and apoptotic cytotoxicity. The canonical yeast models have recently been expanded by the establishment of a model for type II diabetes, a non-neurological amyloid-associated disease. While these model systems require the exogenous expression of mammalian proteins in yeast, an additional amyloid-associated disease model, comprising solely mutations of endogenous yeast genes, has been recently described. Mutated in the adenine salvage pathway, this yeast model exhibits adenine accumulation, thereby recapitulating adenine inborn error of metabolism disorders. Moreover, in line with the recent extension of the amyloid hypothesis to include metabolite amyloids, in addition to protein-associated ones, the intracellular assembly of adenine amyloid-like structures has been demonstrated using this yeast model. In this review, we describe currently available yeast models of diverse amyloid-associated disorders, as well as their impact on our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribution to future potential drug development.",Highlighting the Proteasome: Using Fluorescence to Visualize Proteasome Activity and Distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968028,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2019 04 12,"Proteasomes are critical proteases in the cell responsible for the turnover of many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins.

In this work, the properties of two α-glucosyl derivatives of EGCG (3'- and 7-O-α-D-glucopyranoside), obtained by enzymatic synthesis, were assessed. The α-glucosylation enhanced the pH and thermal stability of EGCG. The analysis of scavenging activity toward ABTS·+ radicals showed that the α-glucosylation at C-7 of A-ring caused a higher loss of antioxidant activity compared with the sugar conjugation at C-3' of B-ring. The 3'-glucoside also showed higher potential to alleviate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and to boost REDOX activity. The toxicity of EGCG and its monoglucosides was tested in human SH-S5Y5 neurons, RAW 264.7 macrophages, MRC5 fibroblasts, and HT-29 colon cancer cells. Interestingly, the 3'-O-α-D-glucoside increased the viability of neural cells in vitro (2.75-fold at 100 μM) in the presence of H2O2, whilst EGCG gave rise only to a 1.7-fold enhancement. In conclusion, the α-glucoside of EGCG at C-3' has a great potential for nutraceutical, cosmetic and biomedical applications.",Biopreservative Efficacy of Bacteriocin GP1 of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GP1 on Stored Fish Filets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968026,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 04 12,"The bacteriocin based strategy of biopreservation has got wide spread research interests in the recent past for their prospects in reducing usage of chemical preservatives.

The sensory attributes of the fish filets treated with the bacteriocin and control from 7 to 28 days of storage in both the storage temperatures varied significantly. The pH of the raw fish increased from the initial 6.8 to 7.91 and 7.43 for the control and bacteriocin GP1, respectively, at the end of storage period (28 days) when stored at 4°C. However, the pH showed a decreasing trend with the increase in period of storage for the samples stored at 0°C. The TVB-N content of the bacteriocin treated samples stored at 4°C remained within the limit of acceptability (35 mg/100 g) at the 21st day. The TMA level also remained within the acceptable limit of 10-15 mg/100 g at the 21st day in the case of bacteriocin-treated samples. The application of bacteriocin GP1 in the stored fish was effective in controlling the growth of coliforms, Aeromonas sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Vibrio sp. in the treated fish samples.

Different types of conformations emerge, depending on whether the trimer adopts an open arrangement, with significant freedom for internal rotation of the cyclen moieties, or it locks in a folded conformation with intermolecular H-bonds between the two cyclen backbones. The ion mobility collision cross section supports that folded configurations of the complex are dominant under isolated conditions in the gas phase. The IRMPD spectroscopy experiments suggest that two qualitatively different families of folded conformations coexist at room temperature, featuring either peripheral or inner positions of the anion with respect to the macrocycle cavities, These findings should have implications in the growth of extended networks in the nanoscale and in sensing applications.","Modulation of Excited State Property Based on Benzo[a, c]phenazine Acceptor: Three Typical Excited States and Electroluminescence Performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968012,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 04 12,"Throwing light upon the structure-property relationship of the excited state properties for next-generation fluorescent materials is crucial for the organic light emitting diode (OLED) field.

In particular, the hydrothermal decomposition of benchmark C6- and C5-monosaccharides, i.e., D-glucose and D-xylose, into furanics and/or organic acids is fully considered. Herein, we propose to establish the fundamentals of the decomposition of D-glucose and D-xylose under subcritical water conditions in the presence of specific salts (i.e., NaCl and KI) and in seawater. Our results demonstrated that the introduction of inorganic salts was found to modify sugars dehydration yields. Different NaCl concentrations from 0.21 to 1.63 mol L-1 promoted the conversion of D-xylose to 2-furfural (2-F) from 28 to 44% (molar yield). NaCl also improved 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) generation from D-glucose as well as rehydration of 5-HMF to levulinic and formic acid. KI favored other pathways toward formic acid production from D-glucose, reaching 20% in the upper concentration. Compared to a solution of equivalent NaCl concentration, seawater enhanced selectivity toward lactic acid which was raised by 10% for both monosaccharides, and sugars conversion, especially for D-glucose whose conversion was increased by 20%. 5-HMF molar yield around 30% were achieved from D-glucose in seawater at 211°C and 20 bars after 15 min.",Accuracy of Micro-Computed Tomography in Post-mortem Evaluation of Fetal Congenital Heart Disease. Comparison Between Post-mortem Micro-CT and Conventional Autopsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968009,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 12,"Aims: Early prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease is feasible. Conventional autopsy is the current gold standard method for post-mortem confirmation. Radiologic techniques alternative to conventional autopsy, such as post-mortem micro-computed tomography, have been proposed in case of limited diagnostic accuracy (i.e., early termination of pregnancy, samples of small dimension or of low weight). The aim of the present study was to define accuracy of micro-computed tomography for post-mortem diagnosis of congenital heart disease in gross anatomy samples. Methods and Results: Fetal heart underwent in-utero prenatal echocardiography and ex-vivo post-mortem evaluation by 9 μm resolution micro-computed tomography and conventional autopsy. For each case, 25 indices of cardiac anatomy were studied by post-mortem micro-computed tomography and conventional autopsy; these were used to compare the two post mortem techniques. Ten samples were examined (gestational age between 12 + 4 and 21 + 6 weeks of gestation). Considering comparable indices, agreement between post-mortem micro-computed tomography and conventional autopsy was of 100% and sensitivity and specificity were of 100%. In ""challenging specimens,"" post-mortem micro-computed tomography diagnoses more indices as compared to conventional autopsy and 84% of ""not-diagnostic"" indices at conventional autopsy would be diagnostic at post-mortem micro-computed tomography. Conclusion: Micro-computed tomography can be a valid diagnostic alternative to conventional autopsy for post-mortem evaluation of human fetal heart. In addition, it may prove superior to conventional autopsy particularly in cases coming from early termination of pregnancy or in samples of small dimension or of low weight.",Early Urinary Biomarkers in Pediatric Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD): No Evidence in the Interest of Urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (uNGAL).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968008,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 12,"Background: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is increasingly diagnosed during childhood by the presence of renal cysts in patients with a positive familial history. No curative treatment is available and early detection and diagnosis confronts pediatricians with the lack of early markers to decide whether to introduce renal-protective agents and prevent the progression of renal failure. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a tubular protein that has been recently proposed as an early biomarker of renal impairment in the ADPKD adult population. Methods: Urinary NGAL (uNGAL) levels were measured in 15 ADPKD children and compared with 15 age and gender matched controls using parametric, non-parametric, and Bayesian statistics. We also tested the association of uNGAL levels with markers of disease progression, such as proteinuria, albuminuria, blood pressure, and Total Kidney Volume (TKV) using correlation analysis. TKV was calculated by ultrasound, using the ellipsoid method. Results: No difference in mean uNGAL levels was observed between groups (ADPKD: 26.36 ng/ml; Controls: 27.24 ng/ml; P = 0.96). Moreover, no correlation was found between uNGAL and proteinuria (P = 0.51), albuminuria (P = 0.69), TKV (P = 0.68), or mean arterial pressure (P = 0.90). By contrast, TKV was positively correlated with proteinuria (P = 0.04), albuminuria (P = 0.001), and mean arterial pressure (P = 0.03). Conclusion: uNGAL did not confirm its superiority as a marker of disease progression in a pediatric ADPKD population. In the contrary, TKV appears to be an easy measurable variable and may be promising as a surrogate marker to follow ADPKD progression in children.",Robotic Ureteral Reconstruction in the Pediatric Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968006,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 12,"Robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) surgery is a safe, minimally invasive technique that has become more widely used in pediatric urology over recent decades.

PEM involves a constellation of substantially disabling signs and symptoms that occur in response to physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual over-exertion. Because PEM occurs in response to over-exertion, physiological measurements obtained during standardized exertional paradigms hold promise to contribute greatly to our understanding of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic states underlying PEM. In turn, information from standardized exertional paradigms can inform patho-etiologic studies and analeptic management strategies in people with ME/CFS. Several studies have been published that describe physiologic responses to exercise in people with ME/CFS, using maximal cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) as a standardized physiologic stressor. In both non-disabled people and people with a wide range of health conditions, the relationship between exercise heart rate (HR) and exercise workload during maximal CPET are repeatable and demonstrate a positive linear relationship. However, smaller or reduced increases in heart rate during CPET are consistently observed in ME/CFS. This blunted rise in heart rate is called chronotropic intolerance (CI). CI reflects an inability to appropriately increase cardiac output because of smaller than expected increases in heart rate. The purposes of this review are to (1) define CI and discuss its applications to clinical populations; (2) summarize existing data regarding heart rate responses to exercise obtained during maximal CPET in people with ME/CFS that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature through systematic review and meta-analysis; and (3) discuss how trends related to CI in ME/CFS observed in the literature should influence future patho-etiological research designs and clinical practice.",Perceived Racial Discrimination and Marijuana Use a Decade Later; Gender Differences Among Black Youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968004,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 13,"Background: Researchers have reported gender differences in the association between perceived racial discrimination (PRD) and substance use including marijuana use (MU). A limited number of longitudinal studies, however, have documented the long-term effect of PRD during adolescence on subsequent MU in young adulthood. Objective: In the current longitudinal study, we tested gender differences in the association between baseline PRD during adolescence and subsequent MU during young adulthood within Black population. Methods: A cohort of 595 Black (278 male and 317 female) ninth grade students were followed for 13 years from 1999 (mean age 20) to 2012 (mean age 33). Participants were selected from an economically disadvantaged urban area in the Midwest, United States. The independent variable was PRD measured in 1999. The outcome was average MU between 2000 and 2012 (based on eight measurements). Covariates included age, socio-demographics (family structure, and parental employment), and substance use by friends and parents. Gender was the focal moderator. Linear regression was used for statistical analysis. Results: In the pooled sample, PRD in 1999 was not associated with average MU between 2000 and 2012. We did, however, find an interaction effect between baseline PRD and gender on average MU, suggesting stronger association for males than females. In gender-specific models, baseline PRD predicted average MU between 2000 and 2012 for males, but not for females. Conclusion: Exposure to PRD during late adolescence may have a larger role on MU of male than female Black young adults. Although we found that males are more vulnerable to the effects of PRD on MU, PRD should be prevented regardless of race, gender, and other social identities. While PRD is pervasive among Black Americans, exposure to PRD increase the risk of MU for Black males. Hence, substance use prevention efforts for Black males, in particular, should emphasize coping with PRD.",Fortification of Human Milk for Preterm Infants: Update and Recommendations of the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA) Working Group on Human Milk Fortification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968003,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 12,"Evidence indicates that human milk (HM) is the best form of nutrition uniquely suited not only to term but also to preterm infants conferring health benefits in both the short and long-term. However, HM does not provide sufficient nutrition for the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant when fed at the usual feeding volumes leading to slow growth with the risk of neurocognitive impairment and other poor health outcomes such as retinopathy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. HM should be supplemented (fortified) with the nutrients in short supply, particularly with protein, calcium, and phosphate to meet the high requirements of this group of babies. In this paper the European Milk Bank Association (EMBA) Working Group on HM Fortification discusses the existing evidence in this field, gives an overview of different fortification approaches and definitions, outlines the gaps in knowledge and gives recommendations for practice and suggestions for future research. EMBA recognizes that ""Standard Fortification,"" which is currently the most utilized regimen in neonatal intensive care units, still falls short in supplying sufficient protein for some VLBW infants. EMBA encourages the use of ""Individualized Fortification"" to optimize nutrient intake. ""Adjustable Fortification"" and ""Targeted Fortification"" are 2 methods of individualized fortification. The quality and source of human milk fortifiers constitute another important topic. There is work looking at human milk derived fortifiers, but it is still too early to draw precise conclusions about their use. The pros and cons are discussed in this Commentary in addition to the evidence around use of fortifiers post discharge.",Attenuation of Acute Renal Injury After the Post-resuscitation Administration of Doxycycline in Surviving Newborn Piglets With Severe Hypoxia-Reoxygenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968002,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 12,"Background: Asphyxiated neonates often have myocardial dysfunction and renal insufficiency. Previously we demonstrated that doxycycline improved cardio-renal function through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 inhibition in an acute swine model of neonatal hypoxia-reoxygenation. The prolonged cardio-renal protective effects of doxycycline in neonates still remained unknown. We therefore hypothesized that the protective effects of doxycycline persisted in surviving subjects. Methods: Newborn piglets were instrumented and subjected to 1 h of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation with 21-25% oxygen and observed for 4 days. Intravenous doxycycline (30 mg/kg) or normal saline (1 mL, saline-control group) was given at 5 min of reoxygenation (n = 8/group) in a randomized, blinded fashion. Sham-operated piglets (n = 5) received no hypoxia-reoxygenation. At 96 h after reoxygenation, the left ventricular function was assessed by Millar® catheter. Renal injury was investigated by measuring plasma creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activity, renal tissue lactate and MMP-2 activity. Results: Both hypoxia-reoxygenation groups had similar hypoxic stress with severe lactate acidosis, and hemodynamic recovery. Doxycycline-treated piglets had higher urine output with lower urine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase, plasma creatinine, and renal MMP-2 activity (vs. saline-controls; all p < 0.05). These markers were all negatively correlated with urine output. Conclusions: In newborn piglets surviving hypoxia-reoxygenation, we observed a weak but significant and persistent attenuation of renal injury and improved recovery with the post-resuscitation administration of doxycycline."

Patients and methods Records of 22 patients who underwent nephrectomy due to renal masses at our clinic between January 2008 and May 2018 and whose pathology results indicated XGP were retrospectively evaluated. The computed tomography (CT) measurement of the kidney volumes of the patients was calculated as the product of the longest length, width, and height of the kidney. The mean kidney volume of the patients was calculated and the patients were distributed into two groups: those that presented volumes below average (Group 1) and above average (Group 2). The patients' mean ages, operative duration, hospitalization days, differences in pre- and postoperative hemoglobin and creatinine levels, and postoperative complications were compared across groups. Results Group 1 consisted of 12 patients and Group 2 of 10 patients. The mean kidney volume of the patients was calculated as 33.4 cm3 ± 26.0 cm3. The mean kidney volume of the patients was 15.8 cm3± 9.9 cm3 in Group 1 and 56.8 cm3 ± 21.8 cm3 in Group 2. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of operative times, preop-postop hemoglobin (Hgb) levels and complications.

We here addressed whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could effectively combat MDR-Psae carriage. Therefore, secondary abiotic mice were challenged with MDR-Psae by gavage. One week later, mice were subjected to peroral FMT from either murine or human donors on 3 consecutive days. Irrespective of murine or human origin of fecal transplant, intestinal MDR-Psae loads decreased as early as 24 h after the initial FMT. Remarkably, the murine FMT could lower intestinal MDR-Psae burdens by approximately 4 log orders of magnitude within 1 week. In another intervention study, mice harboring a human gut microbiota were perorally challenged with MDR-Psae and subjected to murine FMT on 3 consecutive days, 1 week later. Strikingly, within 5 days, murine FMT resulted in lower loads and carrier rates of MDR-Psae in mice with a human gut microbiota. In conclusion, FMT might be a promising antibiotics-independent option to combat intestinal MDR-Psae carriage and thus prevent from future endogenous infections of patients at risk.",Screening for Carbapenemases in Ertapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Collected at a Tunisian Hospital Between 2014 and 2018.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967970,European journal of microbiology & immunology,2019 04 12,Carbapenem-resistance is frequently detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Tunisia.

The present study retrospectively reviewed 44 patients who received SRS or WBRT as an initial treatment for 10-20 BMs from non-small cell lung cancer between 2009 and 2016. Of the patients, 24 (54.5%) were treated with SRS and 20 (45.5%) were treated with WBRT. Overall survival (OS), time to intracranial progression (TTIP), neurological survival (NS), and prognostic factors were examined. OS did not significantly differ between the two groups: 7.3 months in the SRS group vs. 7.2 months in the WBRT group (P=0.502). Median TTIP was significantly shorter in the SRS group than in the WBRT group (7.1 vs. 19.1 months, P=0.009). In contrast, there were no significant differences in NS between the two groups (14.5 months in the SRS group vs. 12.9 months in the WBRT group, P=0.346). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that the type of initial treatment for BMs (WBRT or SRS) was not a significant prognostic factor (hazard ratio=0.80, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-1.52, P=0.502). However, histology, performance status, subsequent molecular targeted drugs, subsequent chemotherapy and salvage treatment were independent prognostic factors. There were no significant differences in OS and NS between treatment with SRS and treatment with WBRT in patients with 10-20 BMs, although TTIP was improved with WBRT. As an upfront treatment for 10-20 BMs, SRS may delay WBRT and the adverse events associated with WBRT.",Locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma: Are preoperative short and long course radiotherapy truly equivalent?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967950,Molecular and clinical oncology,2019 04 12,"In the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, long- and short-course radiotherapy are considered to be of equivalent efficacy based upon several randomized trials. The present study assessed the effect of radiotherapy dose on overall survival. Using the National Cancer Database (2006-2013) 458 individuals with clinical stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma treated were identified, with either short- (25 Gy) or long- (45 or 50.4 Gy) course neoadjuvant radiotherapy followed by surgery, without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariate COX regression was employed to evaluate differences in overall survival according to radiotherapy regimen. An association with improved overall survival in individuals treated with long- compared with short-course radiotherapy was demonstrated (HR=0.50, 0.34-0.73). The 30- and 90-day post-surgery mortality rates were higher in the short-course group when compared with the long-course group (12.2 vs. 2.4%; and 18.5 vs. 5.4%, respectively). Following the exclusion of patients that succumbed within 90-days post-surgery, overall survival advantage in the long-course group compared with the short-course group was maintained [hazard ratio (HR)=0.62, 0.39-0.99], with a median overall survival of 25.3 months (IQR 16.9-41.6) for the short-course group compared with 43.5 months (IQR 25.6-67.9) for the long-course group. To the best of our knowledge, the present results suggest for the first time that long-course radiotherapy is associated with an improved overall survival compared with short-course radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma in the absence of chemotherapy usage. This possible advantage is clinically relevant mainly in patients who cannot tolerate systemic chemotherapy.",Chronic kidney disease and positive surgical margins as prognosticators for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967949,Molecular and clinical oncology,2019 04 12,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition among elderly patients and has been reported to be a biomarker for the presence of malignant disease. In addition, unfavorable outcomes for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) undergoing radical nephroureterectomy can be due to independent clinical factors. Therefore, the present study analyzed the clinicopathological data of patients with UTUC, who underwent radical nephroureterectomy at our institution, to clarify whether preoperative CKD and other factors are independent predictors of the shorter disease-specific and/or recurrence-free survival time of these patients. A retrospective review of 187 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy was conducted, and patients were followed for at least 3 months postoperatively. The clinicopathological factors that are thought to have potentially significant roles in the progression and metastasis of malignant tumors and for disease-specific and recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Positive surgical margins and an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 were independent factors for the shorter disease-specific survival time in multivariate analysis with Cox's proportional hazards model [hazard ratio (HR), 2.401: 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.044-5.255; and HR, 2.371: 95% CI, 1.024-5.898, respectively]. Another multivariate analysis also revealed that positive surgical margins (HR, 4.477; 95% CI, 2.042-9.469), and preoperative eGFR <60 (HR, 2.362; 95% CI, 1.067-5.592) were independent factors for the worse recurrence-free survival rate in all patients. Patients with UTUC who had eGFR <60 as well as positive surgical margins had significantly shorter time to disease-specific mortality and extraurothelial recurrence. The present study demonstrated that patients with UTUC undergoing radical nephroureterectomy who have CKD as well as positive surgical margins should be carefully followed up postoperatively.",Paclitaxel for relapsed small-cell lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967948,Molecular and clinical oncology,2019 04 12,"Although first-line chemotherapy is highly sensitive against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), most patients subsequently experience disease progression. Topotecan is the standard therapy for sensitive-relapsed SCLC patients, and subgroup analysis of a randomized phase III trial suggests that amrubicin is effective for refractory-relapsed SCLC. However, because of the lack of the evidence based on clinical trials, the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy for relapsed SCLC patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) is unclear. In the presentstudy, 17 relapsed SCLC patients with IIPs who received a paclitaxel (PTX)-containing regimen as a second-line chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. The overall response rate and the disease control rate of the PTX-containing regimens were 29.4 and 47.1%, respectively. The median progression-free survival and the overall survival of the regimens were 2.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-3.6 months] and 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.3-14.0 months), respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 12 (70.6%) and 2 (11.8%) patients, respectively. During the treatment period, acute exacerbation (AE) of IIPs was observed in five patients (29.4%). Treatment-associated fatality was observed in 1 patient with febrile neutropenia and in 1 patient with AE of IIPs. PTX had promising anti-tumor activity against refractory-relapsed SCLC with IIPs. However, the survival benefit of the treatment was limited because of the high incidence of AE of IIPs and treatment-related death.",Photocoagulation for juxtapapillary retinal hemangioma in a young girl: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967947,Molecular and clinical oncology,2019 04 12,"von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in formation of multiple systemic tumors.

The present study reports the case of a 6-year-old girl with suspected VHL disease presenting with JRCH. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated marked dye leakage from the tumor. Retinal hemorrhage occurred around the tumor 7 months later. Laser photocoagulation of the tumor tissue was safely and successfully conducted without general anesthesia. The hemorrhage diminished after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated mild resolution of an elevated lesion in JRCH with contraction of the vitreoretinal interface over the tumor.

After an abrupt worsening of his blood glucose control, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor with a multilocular cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed obstruction of the main pancreatic duct and dilation of the dorsal pancreatic duct; in addition, adenocarcinoma was detected in the pancreatic juice cytology. Based on the abovementioned findings, the patient was diagnosed with carcinoma of the pancreatic head and underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, the patient was diagnosed with mixed ductal-acinar cell carcinoma.

We report the case of a 79-year-old male with multiple primary malignancies of three histological types in six different organs: Stomach, prostate, colon, urinary bladder, facial skin and pancreas, in chronological order. The first malignancy was upper gastric cancer diagnosed in 1998. The second and third malignancies were prostate cancer and ascending colon cancer, which were diagnosed in 2010. The fourth malignancy was bladder cancer diagnosed in 2011. The fifth and sixth malignancies were squamous cell skin cancer of the right cheek and intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMC), respectively, diagnosed in 2014. The gastric cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancer and IPMC were surgically resected. The prostate cancer was treated by anti-androgen therapy. The patient died of local recurrence of IPMC in August 2016.

The aim of the present study was to examine the expression and prognostic importance of ECT2 in various breast cancer subtypes using the online tools, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Kaplan-Meier-plotter and bc-GenExMiner. ECT2 mRNA expression was significantly different in oestrogen receptor ER(+) breast cancer; overexpression of ECT2 was associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer. The mRNA expression levels of ECT2 were increased in basal-like breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer, but were not significant for prognostic prediction. We identified ECT2-correlated genes and their corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment terms. The results revealed that GO: 0005524 (protein binding) had the greatest number of correlated genes and also contained ECT2. This suggested that overexpression of ECT2 may be a significant prognostic factor for poor outcome in ER+ breast cancer; however, the precise role of ECT2 in breast cancer requires further investigation."

Mixed models can be employed to effectively identify eQTLs by explaining polygenic effects. In these mixed models, the polygenic effects are considered as random variables, and their variability is explained by the polygenic variance component. The polygenic and residual variance components are first estimated, and then eQTL effects are estimated depending on the variance component estimates within the frequentist mixed model framework. The Bayesian approach to the mixed model-based genome-wide eQTL analysis can also be applied to estimate the parameters that exhibit various benefits. Bayesian inferences on unknown parameters are based on their marginal posterior distributions, and the marginalization of the joint posterior distribution is a challenging task. This problem can be solved by employing a numerical algorithm of integrals called Gibbs sampling as a Markov chain Monte Carlo. This article reviews the mixed model-based Bayesian eQTL analysis by Gibbs sampling. Theoretical and practical issues of Bayesian inference are discussed using a concise description of Bayesian modeling and the corresponding Gibbs sampling. The strengths of Bayesian inference are also discussed. Posterior probability distribution in the Bayesian inference reflects uncertainty in unknown parameters. This factor is useful in the context of eQTL analysis where a sample size is too small to apply the frequentist approach. Bayesian inference based on the posterior that reflects prior knowledge, will be increasingly preferred with the accumulation of eQTL data. Extensive use of the mixed model-based Bayesian eQTL analysis will accelerate understanding of eQTLs exhibiting various regulatory functions.",Phenotyping a Dynamic Trait: Leaf Growth of Perennial Ryegrass Under Water Limiting Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967891,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Water limitation is one of the major factors reducing crop productivity worldwide. In order to develop efficient breeding strategies to improve drought tolerance, accurate methods to identify when a plant reduces growth as a consequence of water deficit have yet to be established. In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), an important forage grass of the Poaceae family, leaf elongation is a key factor determining plant growth and hence forage yield. Although leaf elongation has been shown to be temperature-dependent under non-stress conditions, the impact of water limitation on leaf elongation in perennial ryegrass is poorly understood. We describe a method for quantifying tolerance to water deficit based on leaf elongation in relation to temperature and soil moisture in perennial ryegrass. With decreasing soil moisture, three growth response phases were identified: first, a ""normal"" phase where growth is mainly determined by temperature, second a ""slow"" phase where leaf elongation decreases proportionally to soil water potential and third an ""arrest"" phase where leaf growth terminates. A custom R function was able to quantify the points which demarcate these phases and can be used to describe the response of plants to water deficit. Applied to different perennial ryegrass genotypes, this function revealed significant genotypic variation in the response of leaf growth to temperature and soil moisture. Dynamic phenotyping of leaf elongation can be used as a tool to accurately quantify tolerance to water deficit in perennial ryegrass and to improve this trait by breeding. Moreover, the tools presented here are applicable to study the plant response to other stresses in species with linear, graminoid leaf morphology.",Tree Circumference Changes and Species-Specific Growth Recovery After Extreme Dry Events in a Montane Rainforest in Southern Ecuador.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967890,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Under drought conditions, even tropical rainforests might turn from carbon sinks to sources, and tree species composition might be altered by increased mortality. We monitored stem diameter variations of 40 tree individuals with stem diameters above 10 cm belonging to eleven different tree genera and three tree life forms with high-resolution dendrometers from July 2007 to November 2010 and additionally March 2015 to December 2017 in a tropical mountain rainforest in South Ecuador, a biodiversity hotspot with more than 300 different tree species belonging to different functional types. Although our study area receives around 2200 mm of annual rainfall, dry spells occur regularly during so-called ""Veranillo del Niño"" (VdN) periods in October-November. In climate change scenarios, droughts are expected with higher frequency and intensity as today. We selected dry intervals with a minimum of four consecutive days to examine how different tree species respond to drought stress, raising the question if some species are better adapted to a possible higher frequency and increasing duration of dry periods. We analyzed the averaged species-specific stem shrinkage rates and recovery times during and after dry periods. The two deciduous broadleaved species Cedrela montana and Handroanthus chrysanthus showed the biggest stem shrinkage of up to 2 mm after 10 consecutive dry days. A comparison of daily circumference changes over 600 consecutive days revealed different drought responses between the families concerning the percentage of days with stem shrinkage/increment, ranging from 27.5 to 72.5% for Graffenrieda emarginata to 45-55% for Podocarpus oleifolius under same climate conditions. Moreover, we found great difference of recovery times after longer-lasting (i.e., eight to ten days) VdN drought events between the two evergreen broadleaved species Vismia cavanillesiana and Tapirira guianensis. While Vismia replenished to pre-VdN stem circumference after only 5 days, Tapirira needed 52 days on average to restore its circumference. Hence, a higher frequency of droughts might increase inter-species competition and species-specific mortality and might finally alter the species composition of the ecosystem.",Agronomic and Environmental Assessment of a Polyculture Rooftop Soilless Urban Home Garden in a Mediterranean City.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967889,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Urban planning has been focusing its attention on urban rooftop agriculture as an innovative way to produce local and reliable food in unused spaces in cities. However, there is a lack of quantitative data on soilless urban home gardens and their contribution to self-sufficiency. The aim of the present study is to provide quantitative agronomic and environmental data on an actual soilless urban garden to estimate its degree of self-sufficiency and sustainability. For this purpose, an 18 m2 soilless polyculture rooftop urban home garden in the city center of Barcelona was analyzed. From 2015 to 2017, 22 different crops were grown to feed 2 people in an open-air soilless system, and a life cycle assessment was performed. A total productivity of 10.6 kg/m2/year was achieved, meaning that 5.3 m2 would be needed to fulfill the yearly vegetable requirements of an average citizen (in terms of weight). Considering the vegetable market basket of Catalonia, an 8.2 m2 soilless garden would be needed to cover 62% of the market basket for one person. The top 5 most productive crops were tomato, chard, lettuce, pepper and eggplant, accounting for 85.5% of the total production. The water consumption was 3.7 L/m2/day, and 3.3 kg/year/m2 of waste was generated. A high degree of self-sufficiency was achieved, although adjustments could be made to adapt the production to the market basket. The environmental assessment showed that the fertilizers and their associated leachates accounted for the highest environmental impacts in all the studied impact categories. Overall, 0.6 kg CO2 eq. was generated per kg of vegetables produced. The quantitative data provided by the present study offer a reference from which urban planners and researchers can project future implementations of rooftop urban agriculture (UA) on a large scale.",Submergence and Waterlogging Stress in Plants: A Review Highlighting Research Opportunities and Understudied Aspects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967888,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Soil flooding creates composite and complex stress in plants known as either submergence or waterlogging stress depending on the depth of the water table. In nature, these stresses are important factors dictating the species composition of the ecosystem. On agricultural land, they cause economic damage associated with long-term social consequences. The understanding of the plant molecular responses to these two stresses has benefited from research studying individual components of the stress, in particular low-oxygen stress. To a lesser extent, other associated stresses and plant responses have been incorporated into the molecular framework, such as ion and ROS signaling, pathogen susceptibility, and organ-specific expression and development. In this review, we aim to highlight known or suspected components of submergence/waterlogging stress that have not yet been thoroughly studied at the molecular level in this context, such as miRNA and retrotransposon expression, the influence of light/dark cycles, protein isoforms, root architecture, sugar sensing and signaling, post-stress molecular events, heavy-metal and salinity stress, and mRNA dynamics (splicing, sequestering, and ribosome loading). Finally, we explore biotechnological strategies that have applied this molecular knowledge to develop cultivars resistant to flooding or to offer alternative uses of flooding-prone soils, like bioethanol and biomass production.",Karyotype Analysis of Diploid and Spontaneously Occurring Tetraploid Blood Orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] Using Multicolor FISH With Repetitive DNA Sequences as Probes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967887,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Blood orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] has been increasingly appreciated by consumers worldwide owing to its brilliant red color, abundant anthocyanin and other health-promoting compounds. However, there is still relatively little known about its cytogenetic characteristics, probably because of the small size and similar morphology of metaphase chromosomes and the paucity of chromosomal landmarks. In our previous study, a naturally occurring tetraploid blood orange plant was obtained via seedling screening. Before this tetraploid germplasm can be manipulated into a citrus triploid seedless breeding program, it is of great importance to determine its chromosome characterization and composition. In the present study, an integrated karyotype of blood orange was constructed using sequential multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with four satellite repeats, two ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs), a centromere-like repeat and an oligonucleotide of telomere repeat (TTTAGGG)3 as probes. Satellite repeats were preferentially located at the terminal regions of the chromosomes of blood orange. Individual somatic chromosome pairs of blood orange were unambiguously identified by repetitive DNA-based multicolor FISH. These probes proved to be effective chromosomal landmarks. The karyotype was formulated as 2n = 2x = 18 = 16m+2sm (1sat) with the karyotype asymmetry degree belonging to 2B. The chromosomal distribution pattern of these repetitive DNAs in this spontaneously occurring tetraploid was identical to that of the diploid, but the tetraploid carried twice the number of hybridization sites as the diploid, indicating a possible pathway involving the spontaneous duplication of chromosome sets in nucellar cells. Our work may facilitate the molecular cytogenetic study of blood orange and provide chromosomal characterization for the future utilization of this tetraploid germplasm in the service of seedless breeding programs.",Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation Is Indispensable for Haustorium Formation of the Root Parasitic Plant Striga hermonthica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967886,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"The parasitic witchweed Striga hermonthica causes devastating damage to crops in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the mechanism of its parasitism is not well understood. Parasitic plants form a special organ called a haustorium to obtain water and nutrients from host plants. The haustorium is induced by host-derived small molecules, collectively named haustorium-inducing factors (HIFs). The most active HIF known to date is 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone (DMBQ), originally isolated from sorghum root extracts. It has been suggested that DMBQ is produced by oxidation of its precursor, syringic acid, and that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidases are involved in the process. However, the roles of ROS in haustorium formation after HIF recognition remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of various inhibitors of ROS and ROS-regulating enzymes on haustorium formation in S. hermonthica. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidases and peroxidases inhibited haustorium formation during treatment with DMBQ, syringic acid, and host root extracts, suggesting that ROS production and/or regulation via NADPH oxidases and peroxidases are essential for haustorium formation. We observed hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the haustorium upon treatment with various HIFs. Our results suggest that ROS and ROS-regulating enzymes are indispensable in downstream signaling of HIFs for haustorium formation.",Genetic Characterization of Resistance to Pyrenophora teres f. teres in the International Barley Differential Canadian Lake Shore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967885,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Genetic resistance to net form of net blotch in the international barley differential Canadian Lake Shore (CLS) was characterized and mapped. A doubled haploid (DH) population generated from a cross between CLS and susceptible cultivar Harrington was evaluated at the seedling stage using eight diverse Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt) isolates and at the adult stage in the field using natural inoculum. To effectively map the CLS resistance, comparative marker frequency analysis (MFA) was performed using 8,762 polymorphic DArT-seq markers, where 'resistant' and 'susceptible' groups each comprised 40 DH lines displaying the most extreme phenotypes. Five DArTseq markers were consistently detected in eight disease assays, which was designated qPttCLS and deemed to harbor the locus underpinning CLS resistance. Four of these markers were present onto the barley DArTseq physical map and spans a region between 398203862 and 435526243 bp which were found to consist several genes involved in important plant functions such as disease response and signaling pathways. While MFA only detected the 3H region, genetic analyses based on segregation patterns were inconsistent, suggesting complex inheritance or variation in phenotypic expression of qPttCLS, particularly in the field. This study represents progress toward connecting Ptt pathotype surveys with the corresponding resistance genes in barley differentials. The markers associated with qPttCLS are useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs.",One Century of Forest Monitoring Data in Switzerland Reveals Species- and Site-Specific Trends of Climate-Induced Tree Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967884,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 12,"Climate-induced tree mortality became a global phenomenon during the last century and it is expected to increase in many regions in the future along with a further increase in the frequency of drought and heat events. However, tree mortality at the ecosystem level remains challenging to quantify since long-term, tree-individual, reliable observations are scarce. Here, we present a unique data set of monitoring records from 276 permanent plots located in 95 forest stands across Switzerland, which include five major European tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, silver fir, European beech, and sessile and common oak) and cover a time span of over one century (1898-2013), with inventory periods of 5-10 years. The long-term average annual mortality rate of the investigated forest stands was 1.5%. In general, species-specific annual mortality rates did not consistently increase over the last decades, except for Scots pine forests at lower altitudes, which exhibited a clear increase of mortality since the 1960s. Temporal trends of tree mortality varied also depending on diameter at breast height (DBH), with large trees generally experiencing an increase in mortality, while mortality of small trees tended to decrease. Normalized mortality rates were remarkably similar between species and a modest, but a consistent and steady increasing trend was apparent throughout the study period. Mixed effects models revealed that gradually changing stand parameters (stand basal area and stand age) had the strongest impact on mortality rates, modulated by climate, which had increasing importance during the last decades. Hereby, recent climatic changes had highly variable effects on tree mortality rates, depending on the species in combination with abiotic and biotic stand and site conditions. This suggests that forest species composition and species ranges may change under future climate conditions. Our data set highlights the complexity of forest dynamical processes such as long-term, gradual changes of forest structure, demography and species composition, which together with climate determine mortality rates."

For protection against infection, young children mainly depend on their innate immune system and maternal antibodies. Traditionally, antibody-mediated protection against viral infections is thought to be mediated by direct binding of antibodies to viral particles, resulting in virus neutralization. However, in the case of RSV, virus neutralization titers do not provide an adequate correlate of protection. The current lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which antibodies can protect against RSV infection and disease or, alternatively, contribute to disease severity, hampers the design of safe and effective vaccines against this virus. Importantly, neutralization is only one of many mechanisms by which antibodies can interfere with viral infection. Antibodies consist of two structural regions: a variable fragment (Fab) that mediates antigen binding and a constant fragment (Fc) that mediates downstream effector functions via its interaction with Fc-receptors on (innate) immune cells or with C1q, the recognition molecule of the complement system. The interaction with Fc-receptors can lead to killing of virus-infected cells through a variety of immune effector mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Antibody-mediated complement activation may lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, both Fc-receptor interactions and complement activation can exert a broad range of immunomodulatory functions. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of Fc-mediated antibody effector functions in both protection and pathogenesis for various infectious agents. In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on Fc-mediated antibody effector functions in the context of RSV infection, discuss their potential role in establishing the balance between protection and pathogenesis, and point out important gaps in our understanding of these processes. Furthermore, we elaborate on the regulation of these effector functions on both the cellular and humoral side. Finally, we discuss the implications of Fc-mediated antibody effector functions for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies against RSV.",Skin and Systemic Inflammation in Schnitzler's Syndrome Are Associated With Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967871,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Schnitzler's syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory disorder characterized by interleukin-1ß-mediated and neutrophil-dominated inflammation. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures of decondensed chromatin, histones, and antimicrobial peptides released by neutrophils. NETs were initially described in the context of pathogen defense but are also involved in autoimmune-mediated skin diseases. Here, we assessed the role of neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in Schnitzler's syndrome. Immunofluorescence co-staining of myeloperoxidase and subnucleosomal complex was performed on lesional skin samples from patients with Schnitzler's syndrome, other neutrophilic dermatoses (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum), urticarial vasculitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria as well as healthy control skin. Blood neutrophils from patients with Schnitzler's syndrome and controls were isolated, and NETosis was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Also, NETosis of control neutrophils induced by symptomatic Schnitzler's syndrome sera, cytokines and sub-threshold PMA doses was studied. Immunofluorescence co-staining revealed widespread and substantial NET formation in lesional skin of Schnitzler's syndrome patients but absence of NETs in chronic spontaneous urticaria and control skin. Neutrophils undergoing NETosis were observed in the skin of other neutrophilic diseases too. Correspondingly, blood neutrophils from Schnitzler's syndrome patients showed significantly elevated NETosis rates compared to control neutrophils following stimulation with PMA. Increased NETosis correlated well with high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). SchS patients with the lowest NETosis rates had persistent joint and bone pain despite IL-1 blockade. Stimulation of control neutrophils and sub-threshold PMA with sera of symptomatic Schnitzler's syndrome patients disclosed enhanced NETosis as compared to control sera. Our results suggest that the induction of NET formation by neutrophils contributes to skin and systemic inflammation and may support the resolution of local inflammation in Schnitzler's syndrome.",MMP-9/Gelatinase B Degrades Immune Complexes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967870,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a common and devastating autoimmune disease, characterized by a dysregulated adaptive immune response against intracellular antigens, which involves both autoreactive T and B cells. In SLE, mainly intracellular autoantigens generate autoantibodies and these assemble into immune complexes and activate the classical pathway of the complement system enhancing inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels have been investigated in the serum of SLE patients and in control subjects. On the basis of specific studies, it has been suggested to treat SLE patients with MMP inhibitors. However, some of these inhibitors induce SLE. Analysis of LPR-/-MMP-9-/- double knockout mice suggested that MMP-9 plays a protective role in autoantigen clearance in SLE, but the effects of MMP-9 on immune complexes remained elusive. Therefore, we studied the role of MMP-9 in the clearance of autoantigens, autoantibodies and immune complexes and demonstrated that the lack of MMP-9 increased the levels of immune complexes in plasma and local complement activation in spleen and kidney in the LPR-/- mouse model of SLE. In addition, we showed that MMP-9 dissolved immune complexes from plasma of lupus-prone LPR-/-/MMP-9-/- mice and from blood samples of SLE patients. Surprisingly, autoantigens incorporated into immune complexes, but not immunoglobulin heavy or light chains, were cleaved by MMP-9. We discovered Apolipoprotein-B 100 as a new substrate of MMP-9 by analyzing the degradation of immune complexes from human plasma samples. These data are relevant to understand lupus immunopathology and side-effects observed with the use of known drugs. Moreover, we caution against the use of MMP inhibitors for the treatment of SLE.",Role of the IgM Fc Receptor in Immunity and Tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967868,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) M is the first antibody isotype to appear during evolution, ontogeny and immune responses.

With the discovery of the IgM Fc receptor (FcμR), it is now clear that IgM can also elicit its function through FcμR. In this review, we will describe the molecular characteristics of FcμR, its role in B cell development, maturation and activation, humoral immune responses, host defense, and immunological tolerance. We will also discuss the functional relationship between IgM-complement and IgM-FcμR pathways in regulating immunity and tolerance. Finally, we will discuss the potential involvement of FcμR in human diseases.",Mycobacterial Evolution Intersects With Host Tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967867,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 13,"Over the past 200 years, tuberculosis (TB) has caused more deaths than any other infectious disease, likely infecting more people than it has at any other time in human history. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of TB, is an obligate human pathogen that has evolved through the millennia to become an archetypal human-adapted pathogen. This review focuses on the evolutionary framework by which Mtb emerged as a specialized human pathogen and applies this perspective to the emergence of specific lineages that drive global TB burden. We consider how evolutionary pressures, including transmission dynamics, host tolerance, and human population patterns, may have shaped the evolution of diverse mycobacterial genomes.",An Anti-hTNF-α Variable New Antigen Receptor Format Demonstrates Superior in vivo Preclinical Efficacy to Humira® in a Transgenic Mouse Autoimmune Polyarthritis Disease Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967865,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), an established pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a central role in the induction and progression of several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Targeting TNF-α as a treatment modality has shown tremendous success, however there are several limitations associated with the current anti-TNF-α biologic drugs including: immunogenicity, life-threatening infections, resistance to treatment, complexity of manufacture and cost of treatment. Here, we report the in vivo efficacy of novel anti-TNF-α formats generated from molecular engineering of variable new antigen receptors (VNARs), originally derived from the immune system of an immunized nurse shark. Two anti-TNF-α VNAR formats, a tandem multivalent trimer, D1-BA11-C4 and an Fc-fused quadrivalent D1-Fc-C4 (Quad-X™) construct were tested in a clinically relevant, preclinical mouse efficacy model of polyarthritis (Tg197) and compared to the commercial anti-TNF-α ""best in class"" therapy, Adalimumab (Humira®). Both VNAR formats bind and neutralize TNF-α through an epitope that appears to be different from those recognized by other anti-TNF biologics used clinically. All doses of Quad-X™, from 0.5 to 30 mg/kg, significantly blocked the development of polyarthritis. At 0.5 mg/kg Quad-X™, the arthritis score was improved by 76% and the histopathology score by 63%. At 3 mg/kg Quad-X™, control of disease was almost complete at 90% (arthritis) and 88% (histopathology). In marked contrast, 1 mg/kg Humira® saw profound disease breakthrough with scores of 39 and 16% respectively, increasing to a respectable 82 and 86% inhibition at 10 mg/kg Humira®. We have previously reported the superior potency of anti-TNF-α VNARs in vitro and in these studies translate this superiority into an in vivo setting and demonstrate the potential of VNAR formats to meet the requirements of next-generation anti-TNF-α therapies.",Dendritic Cells and T Cells Interact Within Murine Afferent Lymphatic Capillaries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967863,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Afferent lymphatic vessels contribute to immunity by transporting antigen and leukocytes to draining lymph nodes (LNs) and are emerging as new players in the regulation of peripheral tolerance. Performing intravital microscopy in inflamed murine ear skin we found that migrating dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen-experienced effector T cells spend considerable time arresting or clustering within afferent lymphatic capillaries. We also observed that intralymphatic T cells frequently interacted with DCs. When imaging polyclonal T cells during an ongoing contact-hypersensitivity response, most intralymphatic DC-T cell interactions were short-lived. Conversely, during a delayed-type-hypersensitivity response, cognate antigen-bearing DCs engaged in long-lived MHCII-(I-A/I-E)-dependent interactions with antigen-specific T cells. Long-lived intralymphatic DC-T cell interactions reduced the speed of DC crawling but did not delay overall DC migration to draining LNs. While further consequences of these intralymphatic interactions still need to be explored, our findings suggest that lymphatic capillaries represent a unique compartment in which adaptive immune interaction and modulation occur.","Ablation of the Chaperone Protein ERdj5 Results in a Sjögren's Syndrome-Like Phenotype in Mice, Consistent With an Upregulated Unfolded Protein Response in Human Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967862,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Objective: Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects mainly the exocrine glands. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins have been suggested to participate in autoimmune and inflammatory responses, either acting as autoantigens, or by modulating factors of inflammation. The chaperone protein ERdj5 is an ER-resident disulfide reductase, required for the translocation of misfolded proteins during ER-associated protein degradation. In this study we investigated the role of ERdj5 in the salivary glands (SGs), in association with inflammation and autoimmunity. Methods:In situ expression of ERdj5 and XBP1 activation were studied immunohistochemically in minor SG tissues from primary SS patients and non-SS sicca-complaining controls. We used the mouse model of ERdj5 ablation and characterized its features: Histopathological, serological (antinuclear antibodies and cytokine levels), and functional (saliva flow rate). Results: ERdj5 was highly expressed in the minor SGs of SS patients, with stain intensity correlated to inflammatory lesion severity and anti-SSA/Ro positivity. Moreover, SS patients demonstrated higher XBP1 activation within the SGs. Remarkably, ablation of ERdj5 in mice conveyed many of the cardinal features of SS, like spontaneous inflammation in SGs with infiltrating T and B lymphocytes, distinct cytokine signature, excessive cell death, reduced saliva flow, and production of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La autoantibodies. Notably, these features were more pronounced in female mice. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a critical connection between the function of the ER chaperone protein ERdj5 and autoimmune inflammatory responses in the SGs and provide evidence for a new, potent animal model of SS.",Leishmania-Host Interactions-An Epigenetic Paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967861,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Leishmaniasis is one of the major neglected tropical diseases, for which no vaccines exist. Chemotherapy is hampered by limited efficacy coupled with development of resistance and other side effects. Leishmania parasites elude the host defensive mechanisms by modulating their surface proteins as well as dampening the host's immune responses. The parasites use the conventional RNA polymerases peculiarly under different environmental cues or pressures such as the host's milieu or the drugs. The mechanisms that restructure post-translational modifications are poorly understood but altered epigenetic histone modifications are believed to be instrumental in influencing the chromatin remodeling in the parasite. Interestingly, the parasite also modulates gene expression of the hosts, thereby hijacking or dampening the host immune response. Epigenetic factor such as DNA methylation of cytosine residues has been incriminated in silencing of macrophage-specific genes responsible for defense against these parasites. Although there is dearth of information regarding the epigenetic alterations-mediated pathogenesis in these parasites and the host, the unique epigenetic marks may represent targets for potential anti-leishmanial drug candidates. This review circumscribes the epigenetic changes during Leishmania infection, and the epigenetic modifications they enforce upon the host cells to ensure a safe haven. The non-coding micro RNAs as post-transcriptional regulators and correlates of wound healing and toll-like receptor signaling, as well as prognostic biomarkers of therapeutic failure and healing time are also explored. Finally, we highlight the recent advances on how the epigenetic perturbations may impact leishmaniasis vaccine development as biomarkers of safety and immunogenicity.",Circulating LPS and (1→3)-β-D-Glucan: A Folie à Deux Contributing to HIV-Associated Immune Activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967860,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 12,"Immune activation is the driving force behind the occurrence of AIDS and non-AIDS events, and is only partially reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Soon after HIV infection, intestinal CD4+ T cells are depleted leading to epithelial gut damage and subsequent translocation of microbes and/or their products into systemic circulation. Bacteria and fungi are the two most abundant populations of the gut microbiome. Circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-Glucan (βDG), major components of bacterial and fungal cell walls respectively, are measured as markers of microbial translocation in the context of compromised gut barriers. While LPS is a well-known inducer of innate immune activation, βDG is emerging as a significant source of monocyte and NK cell activation that contributes to immune dysfunction. Herein, we critically evaluated recent literature to untangle the respective roles of LPS and βDG in HIV-associated immune dysfunction. Furthermore, we appraised the relevance of LPS and βDG as biomarkers of disease progression and immune activation on ART. Understanding the consequences of elevated LPS and βDG on immune activation will provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies against the occurrence of AIDS and non-AIDS events."

To overcome this, we developed a microbial inoculant from forest and agricultural materials that resembles microbiota in organic soils. Three different sand materials (sieved, safety, and sandbox) commonly used in playgrounds and other public spaces were enriched with 5% of the inoculant. Skin microbiota on fingers (identified from bacterial 16S rDNA determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing) was compared after touching non-enriched and microbial inoculant-enriched sands. Exposure to the non-enriched materials changed the skin bacterial community composition in distinct ways. When the inoculant was added to the materials, the overall shift in community composition was larger and the differences between different sand materials almost disappeared. Inoculant-enriched sand materials increased bacterial diversity and richness but did not affect evenness at the OTU level on skin. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher after touching inoculant-enriched compared to non-enriched sand materials. The relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens on skin was 40-50% before touching sand materials, but dropped to 14 and 4% after touching standard and inoculant-enriched sand materials, respectively. When individual genera were analyzed, Pseudomonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. were more abundant after touching standard, non-enriched sand materials, while only the relative abundance of Chryseobacterium sp. increased after touching the inoculant-enriched materials. As Chryseobacterium is harmless for healthy persons, and as standard landscaping materials and normal skin contain genera that include severe pathogens, the inoculant-enriched materials can be considered safe. Microbial inoculants could be specifically created to increase the proportion of non-pathogenic bacterial taxa and minimize the transfer of pathogenic taxa. We recommend further study into the usability of inoculant-enriched materials and their effects on the bacterial community composition of human skin and on the immune response.",Bacterial Diversity and Population Dynamics During the Fermentation of Palm Wine From Guerrero Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967846,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 12,"Palm wine is obtained by fermentation of palm tree sap. In the Pacific coast of Mexico, palm wine is called Tuba and it is consumed as a traditional fermented beverage. Tuba has empirical applications such as an auxiliary in gastrointestinal diseases and a good source of nutrients. In the present study, a next-generation sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was employed to analyze bacterial diversity and population dynamics during the fermentation process of Tuba, both in laboratory controlled conditions and in commercial samples from local vendors. Taxonomic identification showed that Fructobacillus was the main genus in all the samples, following by Leuconostoc, Gluconacetobacter, Sphingomonas, and Vibrio. Alpha diversity analysis demonstrated variability between all the samples. Beta diversity clustered the bacterial population according to the collection origin of the sample. Metabolic functional profile inference showed that the members of the bacterial communities may present the vitamin, antibiotic and antioxidant biosynthesis genes. Additionally, we further investigated the correlation between the predominant genera and some composition parameters of this beverage. This study provides the basis of the bacterial community composition and functionality of the fermented beverage.",Bacterial and Archaeal Communities Change With Intensity of Vegetation Coverage in Arenized Soils From the Pampa Biome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967845,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 12,"Arenization occurs in regions that present sandy soils with normal rainfall levels. Predatory use of environmental sources, the dissolution of arenitic rocks and reworking of non-consolidated surface sands intensify this degradation scenario. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the impact of the arenization process in the Brazilian Pampa Biome and how this phenomenon affects the soil microbial and plant communities. For this purpose, three arenized areas in Southern Brazil (Pampa Biome) were selected and, in each one, three sampling points were studied: arenized (ARA), arenized to grassland transition (AGT), and grassland (GRA) areas. In the three sampling points, soils presented low levels of nutrients, organic matter, mud and pH acidic in all regions but, the presence of vegetation coverage in AGT and GRA areas preserved the topsoil structure. Our study related ARA with bacterial families Alcaligenaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae. AGT with bacterial families Bacillaceae and Burkholderiaceae, and plant species Melinis repens (Willd.) Zizka and Paspalum stellatum Humb. and Bonpl. ex Flüggé, and GRA with bacterial families Koribacteraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Chthoniobacteraceae, and plant species Croton subpannosus Müll.Arg. ex Griseb., Piptochaetium montevidense (Spreng.) Parodi and Elyonurus sp. The three studied areas (as well as sampling points) present soils extremely poor in nutrients with sandy texture, and the bacterial and plant composition well known to be resistant to environmental stresses were dominant. The vulnerability of these areas causes a degradation scenario, which is worsened by agricultural activities. However, in general, this phenomenon is a natural process that occurs mainly due to soil characteristics (poor soils) and climatic variations.",Cave Actinobacteria as Producers of Bioactive Metabolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967844,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 12,"Recently, there is an urgent need for new drugs due to the emergence of drug resistant pathogenic microorganisms and new infectious diseases.

Cave ecosystems have attracted interest of the research community because of their unique characteristics and the microbiome residing inside including actinobacteria. At the time of writing, 47 species in 30 genera of actinobacteria were reported from cave and cave related habitats. Novel and promising bioactive compounds have been isolated and characterized.

The lack of coordinated efforts to gather data at representative temporal and spatial scales limits aerobiology to help understand large scale patterns of global microbial biodiversity and its causal relationships with the environmental context. This paper presents the sampling strategy and analytical protocols developed in order to integrate different fields of research such as microbiology, -omics biology, atmospheric chemistry, physics and meteorology to characterize atmospheric microbial life. These include control of chemical and microbial contaminations from sampling to analysis and identification of experimental procedures for characterizing airborne microbial biodiversity and its functioning from the atmospheric samples collected at remote sites from low cell density environments. We used high-volume sampling strategy to address both chemical and microbial composition of the atmosphere, because it can help overcome low aerosol and microbial cell concentrations. To account for contaminations, exposed and unexposed control filters were processed along with the samples. We present a method that allows for the extraction of chemical and biological data from the same quartz filters. We tested different sampling times, extraction kits and methods to optimize DNA yield from filters. Based on our results, we recommend supplementary sterilization steps to reduce filter contamination induced by handling and transport. These include manipulation under laminar flow hoods and UV sterilization. In terms of DNA extraction, we recommend a vortex step and a heating step to reduce binding to the quartz fibers of the filters. These steps have led to a 10-fold increase in DNA yield, allowing for downstream omics analysis of air samples. Based on our results, our method can be integrated into pre-existing long-term monitoring field protocols for the atmosphere both in terms of atmospheric chemistry and biology. We recommend using standardized air volumes and to develop standard operating protocols for field users to better control the operational quality.",Starfish Gonadotropic Hormone: From Gamete-Shedding Substance to Relaxin-Like Gonad-Stimulating Peptide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967842,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 12,"The first report of a gonadotropic substance in an invertebrate hot-water extract of radial nerve cords from starfish Asterias forbesi that induced the shedding of gametes when injected into the coelomic cavity in a ripe individual occurred in 1959. The active substance was named gamete-shedding substance (GSS) or radial nerve factor. GSS is the primary mediator of oocyte maturation and ovulation in starfish. However, the effect of GSS is indirect. Resumption of meiosis in immature oocytes and release from the ovary are induced by a second mediator, maturation-inducing hormone, identified as 1-methyladenine (1-MeAde) in starfish. The role of GSS is to induce 1-MeAde production by ovarian follicle cells. Thus, GSS was redesignated as gonad-stimulating substance (also GSS). Although GSS has been characterized biochemically as a peptide hormone, identification of the chemical structure had to wait until 2009. Fifty years after the initial finding, GSS was purified from the radial nerve cords of starfish Patiria pectinifera (P. pectinifera). The purified hormone was a heterodimer composed of A- and B-chains, with disulfide cross-linkages. Based on its cysteine motif, GSS is classified as a member of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/relaxin superfamily. More specifically, phylogenetic sequence analysis revealed that P. pectinifera GSS is a member of the relaxin-type peptide family. Therefore, GSS in starfish has been redesignated as relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP). Subsequently, orthologs of P. pectinifera RGP have been identified in other starfish species, including Asterias amurensis (A. amurensis), and Aphelasterias japonica (A. japonica).",Overt and Subclinical Hypothyroidism in the Elderly: When to Treat?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967841,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 12,"Hypothyroidism is characterized by increased thyrotropin (TSH) levels and reduced free thyroid hormone fractions while, subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) by elevated serum TSH in the face of normal thyroid hormones. The high frequency of hypothyroidism among the general population in Western Countries made levothyroxine (LT4) one of the 10 most prescribed drugs. However, circulating TSH has been demonstrated to increase with aging, regardless the existence of an actual thyroid disease. Thus, when confronting an increase in circulating TSH levels in the elderly, especially in the oldest old, it is important to carry an appropriate diagnostic path, comprehensive of clinical picture as well as laboratory and imaging techniques. In the current review, we summarize the recommendations for a correct diagnostic workup and therapeutic approach to older people with elevated TSH value, with special attention to the presence of frailty, comorbidities, and poly-therapy. The treatment of choice for hypothyroid patients is hormone replacement with LT4 but, it is important to consider multiple factors before commencing the therapy, from the age dependent TSH increase to the presence of an actual thyroid disease and comorbidities. When treatment is necessary, a tailored therapy should be chosen, considering poly-pharmacy and frailty. A careful follow-up and treatment re-assessment should be always considered to avoid the risk of over-treatment. It is important to stress the need of educating the patient for a correct administration of LT4, particularly when poly-therapy is in place, and the importance of a tailored therapeutic approach and follow-up, to avoid overtreatment.",Cumulative Live Birth Rates Following Stimulation With Corifollitropin Alfa Compared With hp-hMG in a GnRH Antagonist Protocol in Poor Ovarian Responders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967840,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 12,"Background: Bologna criteria poor ovarian responders have a very low prognosis. Although, it has been proposed that LH supplementation could be beneficial in women with previous hypo-response to FSH. There are no studies comparing the cumulative live birth rates (LBRs) between corifollitropin alfa (CFA) and highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (hp-hMG). Objective: To compare cumulative LBRs in Bologna poor ovarian responders undergoing ovarian stimulation with CFA followed by hp-hMG vs. hp-hMG alone in a GnRH antagonist protocol. Design: This is a retrospective cohort study. We included in total 917 poor responders fulfilling the Bologna criteria for poor ovarian response (POR) at a university-affiliated tertiary center from January 2011 until March 2017. Patients were administered either fixed daily doses of 300-450 IU of hp-hMG (group A) or a single dose of 150 μg of CFA followed by daily injections of ≥300 IU of hp-hMG from Day 8 of stimulation until the day of ovulation trigger (group B), in a fixed GnRH antagonist protocol. Results: LBRs after fresh embryo transfer (ET) were similar in group A 71/510 (14%) and B 42/407 (10%). Cumulative LBR per cycle was significantly higher in group A (16.9%) compared to group B (11.8%); (P = 0.03). However, logistic regression analysis showed no association between the type of gonadotropin administered and cumulative LBR. Only age was significantly associated with cumulative LBR (OR = 0.93, P = 0.007). Conclusion: Cumulative LBRs are similar in Bologna poor responders stimulated with CFA followed by hp-hMG compared to hp-hMG monotreatment in an antagonist protocol.",Temperature Affects Musculoskeletal Development and Muscle Lipid Metabolism of Gilthead Sea Bream (Sparus aurata).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967839,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 12,"World population is expected to increase to approximately 9 thousand million people by 2050 with a consequent food security decline. Besides, climate change is a major challenge that humanity is facing, with a predicted rise in mean sea surface temperature of more than 2°C during this century. This study aims to determine whether a rearing temperature of 19, 24, or 28°C may influence musculoskeletal development and muscle lipid metabolism in gilthead sea bream juveniles. The expression of growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) system-, osteogenic-, myogenic-, and lipid metabolism-related genes in bone and/or white muscle of treated fish, and the in vitro viability, mineralization, and osteogenic genes expression in primary cultured cells derived from bone of the same fish were analyzed. The highest temperature significantly down-regulated igf-1, igf-2, the receptor igf-1ra, and the binding proteins igfbp-4 and igfbp-5b in bone, and in muscle, igf-1 and igf-1ra, suggesting impaired musculoskeletal development. Concerning myogenic factors expression, contrary responses were observed, since the increase to 24°C significantly down-regulated myod1 and mrf4, while at 28°C myod2 and myogenin were significantly up-regulated. Moreover, in the muscle tissue, the expression of the fatty acid transporters cd36 and fabp11, and the lipases lipa and lpl-lk resulted significantly increased at elevated temperatures, whereas β-oxidation markers cpt1a and cpt1b were significantly reduced. Regarding the primary cultured bone-derived cells, a significant up-regulation of the extracellular matrix proteins on, op, and ocn expression was found with increased temperatures, together with a gradual decrease in mineralization along with fish rearing temperature. Overall, these results suggest that increasing water temperature in this species appears to induce unfavorable growth and development of bone and muscle, through modulating the expression of different members of the GH/IGFs axis, myogenic and osteogenic genes, while accelerating the utilization of lipids as an energy source, although less efficiently than at optimal temperatures.",Current Research Approaches and Challenges in the Obesogen Field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967838,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 13,"Obesity is a worldwide pandemic that also contributes to the increased incidence of other diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

Several experimental approaches, from in vitro cell cultures to transgenerational in vivo studies, are used to better understand the mechanisms of action of obesogens, each of which contributes to answer different questions. In this review, we discuss current knowledge in the obesogen field and the existing tools developed in research laboratories using tributyltin as a model obesogen. By understanding the advantages and limitations of each of these tools, we will better focus and design experimental approaches that will help expanding the obesogen field with the objective of finding potential therapeutic targets in human populations."

SoA may be estimated by integrating different agency cues. In the present study, we examined whether the use of different agency cues - action-effect congruency, temporal relation between action and effect, and affective valence of effects - differs between Eastern (Mongolian) and Western (Austrian) cultures. In a learning phase, participants learned to associate different actions (keypresses) with positive and negative action effects (smileys). In a test phase, participants performed the same keypresses. After different intervals positive and negative action effects, which were either congruent or incongruent with the previously acquired action-effect associations, were presented. In each trial participants were asked to rate how likely the action effect was caused by themselves or by the computer (authorship ratings). In both groups authorship ratings were higher for congruent compared to incongruent action effects and for positive compared to negative action effects. This indicates that action-effect congruency and affective valence of action effects modulate SoA. Further, in both groups the difference between positive and negative effects was higher with congruent effects than incongruent effects. This overadditive effect of action-effect congruency and affective valence might indicate that an integration of different agency cues takes place. Decreasing authorship ratings with increasing interval were observed in Austrians but not in Mongolians. For Mongolians, the temporal chronology of events might be less important when inferring causality. Therefore, information regarding the temporal occurrence of the effect might not be used as an agency cue in Mongolians. In conclusion, some agency cues might be similarly used in different cultures, but the use of others might be culture-dependent.",Coping With Negative Stereotypes Toward Older Workers: Organizational and Work-Related Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967825,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"The current study aims to test a moderated-mediation model in which occupational self-efficacy determines the indirect effect of negative stereotypes about older workers in the organization both on psychological engagement in the work domain and on attitudes toward development opportunities through identification with the company. The survey involved 1,501 Italian subjects aged over 50 who were employed by a major large-scale retailer. Consistently with the Social Identity Theory and the Social Exchange Theory, results showed that the perception of negative stereotypes about older workers in the organization is associated with low identification with the company and, subsequently, with poor psychological engagement in the work domain and with attitudes indicating very little interest in development opportunities. In addition, this association was found to be stronger in older workers with higher and medium levels of occupational self-efficacy. These findings suggest that organizations should discourage the dissemination of negative stereotypes about older workers in the workplace because they may lead to older workers' disengagement from the work domain and their loss of interest in development opportunities.",Strengthening the Healthy Adult Self in Art Therapy: Using Schema Therapy as a Positive Psychological Intervention for People Diagnosed With Personality Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967824,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"This article reviews recent theoretical contributions and studies about art therapy that attempt to capture aspects of healthy ego functioning and presents an inventory of art therapy interventions to strengthen the Healthy Adult. It discusses how art therapy can offer interventions that focus specifically and directly on the integration and growth of the whole person, and which interventions are suitable for this purpose in the treatment of people diagnosed with severe personality disorders. A link is made between the Healthy Adult as a familiar concept from Schema Therapy, and Positive Psychology, with its focus on well-being, strength and positive affect. On the basis of our present knowledge, available studies and experiences, art therapy seems promising in contributing to the development of Healthy Adult functioning. Art therapy addresses the different areas of healthy adult functioning. Specific art therapy interventions are discussed on a concrete level. Art therapy appears to offer ways to strengthen the Healthy Adult and helps people to free themselves from destructive patterns and to work on satisfying their basic needs as independent and responsibly functioning individuals in a positive connectedness with themselves and their surroundings. The strength of art therapy may be the experiential level and the appeal to the capacity to play, to flexibility, and to be creative. This makes experiences easier to reach, and developing from there into a Healthy Adult mode is possible in a manner that is more felt than thought. Creativity can be regarded as the ability of the Healthy Adult to be flexible and to find different solutions to a problem. This appeal of art therapy fits well the therapeutic goal of empowerment and well-being, which is at the heart of positive psychology. More research is needed to verify the effects and working mechanisms of art therapy interventions.",Children's Social Integration and Low Perception of Negative Relationships as Protectors Against Bullying and Cyberbullying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967823,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"The aim was to investigate the factors associated with the diverse bullying forms suffered by a victim (relational, aggressive and cyberbullying) by considering the mediating role of the quality of coexistence in school: social integration and perception about relationships among peers. We evaluated data about 42 schools (79.5% public) in a sample of 3,407 students (47.6% boys and 52.4% girls) from the Primary Education. The mediational analyses indicated that, to predict all the bullying forms, a greater sense of social integration and a perception of low negative relationships were mediators, and social integration was the factor that most strongly correlated with bullying, especially relational bullying. We found that the number of good friends and negative relationships together predicted social integration, and the school type predicted negative relationships and number of good friends. The implications for education programs and policy are discussed.",Work-Family Conflict and Mindful Parenting: The Mediating Role of Parental Psychopathology Symptoms and Parenting Stress in a Sample of Portuguese Employed Parents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967822,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"Aims: The aims of the current study are to examine whether parents' work-family conflict, emotional distress (anxiety/depressive symptoms and parenting stress) and mindful parenting vary according to the type of employment (full-time, part-time, and occasional), the type of work schedule (fixed, flexible, and shift), and the number of working hours per week and to explore whether parental emotional distress mediates the association between work-family conflict and mindful parenting dimensions. Methods: A sample of 335 employed parents (86.3% mothers) of children and adolescents between the ages of 1 and 19 years old completed a sociodemographic form and measures of work-family conflict, anxiety/depression symptoms, parenting stress, and mindful parenting. The differences in study variables among types of employment, work schedules and number of weekly working hours were analyzed. A path model was tested through structural equation modeling in AMOS to explore the indirect effect of work-family conflict on mindful parenting dimensions through anxiety, depression and parenting stress. The invariance of the path model across children's age groups (toddlers, preschool and grade school children, and adolescents) and parents' gender was also examined. Results: Parents with a shift work schedule, working full-time and 40 h or more per week, presented significantly higher levels of work-family conflict than those with a fixed or flexible schedule, working part-time and less than 40 h per week, respectively. Parents with a flexible work schedule presented significantly higher levels of self-regulation in parenting and of non-judgmental acceptance of parental functioning than parents with a shift work schedule. Higher levels of work-family conflict were associated with lower levels of mindful parenting dimensions through higher levels of anxiety/depression symptoms and parenting stress. The model was invariant across children's age groups and parents' gender. Discussion: Work-family conflict is associated with poorer parental mental health and with less mindful parenting. Workplaces should implement family-friendly policies (e.g., flexible work arrangements) that help parents successfully balance the competing responsibilities and demands of their work and family roles. These policies could have a critical impact on the mental health of parents and, consequently, on their parental practices.",The Role of BMI Group on the Impact of Weight Bias Versus Body Positivity Terminology on Behavioral Intentions and Beliefs: An Experimental Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967821,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"This experimental study investigated the role of BMI on the impact of weight bias vs body positivity terminology on behavioral intentions and beliefs about obesity. Participants (n = 332) were randomly allocated to two conditions to receive a vignette depicting an image of a person with obesity using either weight bias (n = 164) or body positivity (n = 168) terminology. Participants were divided into three groups based upon their BMI category (normal weight n = 173; overweight n = 92; obese n = 64). They then completed measures of behavioral intentions, obesity illness beliefs, and fat phobia. Although there were several differences in beliefs by BMI group, the results showed no differences between weight bias or body positivity terminology on any measures. There were, however, significant BMI group by condition interactions for beliefs about obesity relating to personal control and treatment control. Post hoc tests showed that weight bias resulted in reduced personal control in the obese BMI group compared to other participants. Weight bias also resulted in higher personal control over obesity in normal weight individuals compared to body positivity. People with obesity reported higher treatment control when exposed to weight bias compared to overweight participants, whereas normal weight participants reported greater treatment control when exposed to body positivity compared to both other groups. To conclude, the impact of weight bias and body positivity information is not universal and varies according to the BMI of the audience and the outcome being measured; whereas people of normal weight may benefit from weight bias there is no evidence that obese people benefit from body positivity. Implications for the prevention and treatment of obesity are discussed.","Secondary Traumatic Stress: Relationship With Symptoms, Exhaustion, and Emotions Among Cemetery Workers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967820,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"Background: Cemeteries workers are deserving of attention because they are exposed to various psychosocial risks: these workers are subject to painful contacts and daily exposed to a work content linked to death experiences and the emotions associated with them. Secondary trauma develops from this continuous contact with others' suffering; operators working with this type of traumatic content and dynamic could suffer from emotional disorders (Figley, 1995). Therefore, the secondary traumatic stress (STS) is seen as an occupational risk factor (Bride et al., 2004) and cemetery workers are subject to this risk. Studies on this topic have focused on the operators of emergencies, social, and health sectors; little attention has been given to cemetery workers. Aim: The present study considers the relations between the dimensions composing the STS and the psychological and physical symptoms, the perception of exhaustion, and the positive and negative emotions at work in a group of cemetery workers. Moreover, differences among occupational tasks are explored considering the different possibilities of contact with clients and trauma contagion. Methods: The study included a qualitative phase (interviews and focus groups) and subsequently a quantitative phase (self-report questionnaire) and involved 114 participants in a cemetery organization in northern Italy, divided into technicians employees (TE), technicians and specialists of decoration and garden (TS), gravediggers (GR) administrative and front office employees (AFO). Levels of secondary trauma and psychophysical symptoms were assessed, and correlations were calculated in the total sample and for the different job categories of employees. Results: AFO and TS showed the highest levels of STS and psychophysical symptoms, in particular for symptoms related to anxiety, sadness, insomnia, and gastric and musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of considering the STS among also this category of workers, since they are exposed daily not only with death, but also with suffering people; grief and emotional skills are important to cope with these job characteristics cemetery workers are not trained on this. It is important to monitor symptomatic levels not only to avoid chronicity, but also to provide employees with psychological support and training about secondary trauma and its consequences.",Selective Emotional Dysregulation in Splenium Agenesis. A Case Report of a Patient With Normal Cognitive Profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967819,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"Objective: Patients with lesions of the corpus callosum are rare and may present different symptoms of the disconnection syndrome. However, to-date studies on callosotomized patients have not been conclusive, likely because of the non-uniform nature of clinical features, the extent of resection, and methods used to investigate specific and related deficits. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally or associated with very slight deficits diagnosed during neurological examinations. In this study, we reported a case of an apparently completely asymptomatic 23-year-old woman with appreciable agenesis of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Methods: She underwent a neurological evaluation, a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to identify any subclinical dysfunction that may affect the functionality of the subject in the daily life. Specifically, the possible presence of emotion dysregulation was examined by using a self-report questionnaire. Results: She showed normal neuropsychological and emotional functioning, performing efficiently on tests measuring acquired brain impairment. Discussion: The present case is discussed in terms of neuroplasticity - with a focus on putative compensatory mechanisms - emphasizing the variegated clinical feature patterns of brain defects present from birth.",Training or Battling a Monster of a Location-Based Augmented-Reality Game While Descending Stairs: An Observational Study of Inattentional Blindness and Deafness and Risk-Taking Inclinations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967818,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"Several emerging smartphone location-based augmented-reality (AR) games require three primary tasks: training or battling a monster, capturing a monster, and searching for a monster, which involve different levels of perceptual load. Using the AR game originated from Japan as a single case study, this study examined inattentional blindness and deafness and risk-taking inclinations among participants concurrently descending stairs and engaging in these three tasks. Participants descending stairs in Taipei Medical University were observed through recordings obtained from Wi-Fi cameras to determine whether they engaged in risk-taking behaviors such as hopping, not using the handrail, and stopping suddenly. After the participants descended the stairs, they were interviewed to obtain additional information regarding demographics, game tasks (training or battling a monster, capturing a monster, or searching for a monster), data plan, and screen size. Inattentional blindness and deafness were investigated by determining whether participants saw something unusual, a police ascending the stairs, and heard the national anthem played by the police, respectively. In total, 1036 participants descended the stairs and underwent the interview between August 2016 and July 2018. Logistic regression models revealed that training or battling a monster was most associated with inattentional blindness, deafness, not using the handrail, and stopping suddenly, whereas hopping behavior was the commonest among those capturing a monster. Other contributory factors include a large smartphone screen (≥5 in), unlimited mobile data, being an undergraduate student, and an increase in the daily gaming hours. Development of smartphone apps toward detection of stair locomotion may be beneficial for curbing phone use in general and AR game playing in particular.",Coach-Created Motivational Climate and Athletes' Adaptation to Psychological Stress: Temporal Motivation-Emotion Interplay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967817,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 12,"This two-wave study investigated the temporal interplay between motivation and the intensity and reported impact of athletes' emotions in training settings. In total, 217 athletes completed self-report measures of motivational climate, motivation regulations, emotional states (i.e., pleasant states, anger, and anxiety) experienced before practice at two time points during a 3-month period. Latent change score modeling revealed significantly negative paths from task-involving climate at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of dysfunctional anxiety and anger, and significantly positive paths from ego-involving climate at time 1 to the latent change in dysfunctional anger (i.e., intensity and reported impact). The paths from controlled motivation at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of dysfunctional anxiety and vice versa were significantly positive. The path from controlled motivation at time 1 to the latent change in the intensity of functional anger was significantly positive, but not vice versa. In addition, the paths from dysfunctional anger (i.e., intensity and reported impact) at time 1 to the latent change in motivation regulations were significant, but not vice versa. Overall, evidence provided suggested that the temporal interplay of motivation and emotions is contingent on the specific emotions. The findings highlight the role of coach-created motivational climate and the importance of identifying high levels of controlled motivation to help athletes better adapt to psychological stress."

Objective: We aim to describe diagnostic pathways by homotypic (within the disorder continuity) and heterotypic development (between the disorder continuity), with maternal psychopathology as moderator for both trajectories. Methods: Clinically referred children (0-7 years; N = 83) were assessed at preschool age and at primary-school age through a clinical interview. We built a disorder cluster of emotional disorders (ED; F32, F40, F42, F43, F93.0, F93.1, F93.2, F93.8, F95), behavioral disorders (BD; F68.8, F90, F91, F91.3, F93.3, F93.9, F94), and specific early onset disorders (SEO; F50, F51, F70, F98.0, F98.1, F98.2, F98.8, F98.9). We describe the prevalence, comorbidity, and clinical trajectories of various types of homotypic and heterotypic development. Results: We observed a high rate of comorbidity throughout the study (62.6% at admission and 67.5% at follow-up) and in general, a high continuity of mental health problems from preschool to primary-school age children (69.9% of the sample showed continuity), with 50.6% of the sample showing homotypic and 44.6% showing heterotypic development. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggest that heterotypic development may be influenced by maternal psychopathology. Conclusion: Currently, evidence-based mental health guidelines for preschool populations are designed and evaluated assuming a homotypic development. However, our findings indicate that treatment interventions and outcome measures should also be designed and evaluated for heterotypic development especially in case of increased maternal psychopathology.",Understanding the Relation Between Early-Life Adversity and Depression Symptoms: The Moderating Role of Sex and an Interleukin-1β Gene Variant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967802,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 04 12,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), are thought to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of depression within a subset of individuals. However, the involvement of IL-1β has not been as consistently linked to depression, possibly owing to difficulties in detecting this cytokine in blood samples or that changes in circulating levels might only be apparent in a subgroup of patients who have experienced early-life adversity. From this perspective, the association between early-life adversity and depressive illness might depend on genetic variants regulating IL-1β activity. Considering the inflammatory-depression link, and that women are twice as likely to experience depression compared to men, the current study (N = 475 university students) examined the moderating role of three independent cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; IL-1β rs16944, IL-6 rs1800795 SNP, TNF-α rs1800629) in the relationship between early-life adversity and depressive symptoms, and whether these relations differed between males and females. The relation between childhood adversity and depressive symptoms was moderated by the IL-1β SNP, and further varied according to sex. Specifically, among females, higher childhood maltreatment was accompanied by elevated depressive symptoms irrespective of the IL-1β SNP, but among males, this relationship was particularly pronounced for those carrying the GG genotype of the IL-1β SNP. These findings suggest that, in the context of early life adversity, genetic variations of IL-1β functioning are related to depressive symptomatology and this may vary among males and females. The present study also, more broadly, highlights the importance of considering the confluence of experiential factors (e.g., early life adversity) and personal characteristics (e.g., sex and genetics) in understanding depressive disorders, an approach increasingly recognized in developing personalized treatment approaches to this illness.",Psychopathological Correlates and Emotion Regulation as Mediators of Approach and Avoidance Motivation in a Chinese Military Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967800,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 04 12,"Background: Approach and avoidance motivation have been thoroughly studied in common mental disorders, which are prevalent in the military context. Approach/avoidance motivational dispositions underlie emotion responses and are thought to influence emotion dysregulation. However, studies on the mediating role of emotion regulation (ER) between motivational dispositions and mental disorders have been insufficient. We examined the psychopathological correlates of motivational dispositions and explored the mediating role of ER. Methods: The Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales and measures of mood disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD) were administered to a nonclinical sample of 3,146 Chinese military service members. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Armymen (ERQ-A) (Chinese version) was used to measure ER styles. We examined the reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Approach/avoidance motivations were correlated with symptoms of mood disorders. Mediation analysis was conducted to confirm the mediating role of ER between motivation and mood disorders. Results: The results showed acceptable internal reliability and construct validity of the BIS/BAS scales. Gender (female), family status (single-parent family), and social relationships (having fewer good friends) were significant predictors of high BIS sensitivity. More years of education, an older age, being an only child and being in a single-parent family all significantly predicted high BAS sensitivity. The BIS/BAS scales were predictive of various DSM-V-based mental disorders (depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD). Immersion exacerbated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on depressive/PTSD symptoms, while reinterpretation and talking out alleviated the impact of BAS/BIS sensitivities on these symptoms. Conclusions: Motivational dispositions have an impact on mood symptoms under specific conditions. ER strategies (immersion, reinterpretation, and talking out) were shown to be partial mediators between approach/avoidance motivation and mood disorders. These findings highlight the importance of ER in altering the impact of motivational dispositions on mood disorders and as a promising target of psychotherapies.",The Psychometric Properties of a Short UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale Among Psychiatric Patients Evaluated in an Emergency Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967798,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 04 12,"Objective: Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct that has an important role for the understanding of diverse psychopathologies and problematic behaviors. The UPPS-P impulsive behavior scale, measuring five distinct facets of impulsivity, has been subject to several studies. No study has investigated the clinical utility of this questionnaire amongst an unstable psychiatric population. The aim of the current study is to examine the psychometric properties of the short version of this scale in a psychiatric emergency unit. Method: The S-UPPS-P was administered to 1,097 psychiatric patients in an emergency setting, where a subgroup of 148 participants completed a follow-up. The internal consistency, the construct validity, the test-retest reliability, and correlations with a substance misuse measure were examined. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a five-factor solution. Results indicated good psychometric properties across psychiatric diagnoses and gender. The S-UPPS-P was partially invariant across sexes. The authors have found differences on the loading of one item and on the thresholds of two items from lack of premeditation and positive urgency subscales. Conclusion: This validation study showed that the UPPS-P conserved good psychometric properties in an unstable psychiatric sample, indicating that the instrument can be utilized in such settings.",The Importance of Impact Loading and the Stretch Shortening Cycle for Spaceflight Countermeasures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967797,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 12,"Pronounced muscle and bone losses indicate that the musculoskeletal system suffers substantially from prolonged microgravity. A likely reason for these detrimental adaptations in the lower extremity is the lack of impact loading and the difficulty to apply large loading forces on the human body in microgravity. The human body is well adapted to ambulating in Earth's gravitational field. A key principle herein is the periodic conversion of kinetic to elastic energy and vice versa. Predominantly tendons and to a lesser extent muscles, bones and other tissues contribute to this storage and release of energy, which is most efficient when organized in the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). During SSC, muscles, especially those encompassing the ankle, knee, and hip joints, are activated in a specific manner, thereby enabling the production of high muscle forces and elastic energy storage. In consequence, the high forces acting throughout the body deform the viscoelastic biological structures sensed by mechanoreceptors and feedback in order to regulate the resilience of these structures and keep strains and strain rates in an uncritical range. Recent results from our lab indicate, notably, that SSC can engender a magnitude of tissue strains that cannot be achieved by other types of exercise. The present review provides an overview of the physiology and mechanics of the natural SSC as well as the possibility to mimic it by the application of whole-body vibration. We then report the evidence from bed rest studies on effectiveness and efficiency of plyometric and resistive vibration exercise as a countermeasure. Finally, implications and applications of both training modalities for human spaceflight operations and terrestrial spin-offs are discussed.",Genome-Wide Analysis of MicroRNAs in Relation to Pupariation in Oriental Fruit Fly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967796,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 12,"Insect metamorphosis is a complex process involving drastic morphological and physiological changes. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play key roles in regulating various biological processes, including metamorphosis, by post-transcriptional repression of mRNAs. The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is one of the most destructive insect pests in many Asian countries and the Pacific Islands. The regulatory role of miRNAs in B. dorsalis metamorphosis is unclear. To better understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in pupariation, Illumina sequencing of the wandering stage (WS), the late WS and the white puparium stage of B. dorsalis were performed. Two hundred forty-nine miRNAs, including 184 known miRNAs and 65 novel miRNAs, were obtained. Among these miRNAs, 19 miRNAs were differentially expressed in pupariation, and eight miRNAs showed relative high expression levels (>50 TPM), of which five differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) had target differentially expressed genes (DEGs) predicted by the expected miRNA-mRNA negative regulation pattern using the Illumina HiSeq data. Four sets of DEMs and their predicted target DEGs were confirmed by qPCR. Of the four miRNAs, two miRNAs were down-regulated: miR-981, which may target pdpc, and Bdo-novel-mir-55, which potentially regulates spsX1, psB/C, and chit3. The other two miRNAs were up-regulated: let-7a-3p, which possibly controls lap, and Bdo-novel-mir-24, which may regulate ipc and sp1/2. This study provides a useful resource to elucidate the regulatory role of miRNAs and understand the molecular mechanisms of metamorphosis.",Evaluation of the Heart Function of Swimmers Subjected to Exhaustive Repetitive Endurance Efforts During a 500-km Relay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967795,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 12,"Aim: Knowledge of the human body's ability to adapt to repeated endurance efforts during swimming is limited. We echocardiographically assessed the impact of an exhausting and repetitive swimming effort on cardiac activity. Materials: Fourteen well-trained amateur swimmers (8 female swimmers aged 16-43 years and 6 male swimmers aged 13-67 years old) participated in an ultramarathon relay. Over 5 days, swimmers swam 500 km in the Warta River (in 5-km intervals). Each swimmer swam seven intervals, each within 44:46 to 60:02 min. Objective difficulties included low water temperatures, strong winds, rain, and night conditions. Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed three times: at baseline (the day before exertion), at peak effort, and during recovery (48 h after the event). The heart rate (HR) of each swimmer was monitored. Results: Swimmers completed the ultramarathon relay within approximately 91 h. The average HR value at the end of each interval was 91% HRmax. TTE test results showed no significant changes indicative of deterioration of myocardial function at peak effort or after 48 h. Significant increases in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV fractional shortening (LVFS), LV myocardial systolic velocity, and right ventricular (RV) fractional area changes observed on day 2 after swimming were compared to baseline values and peak effort values. No significant changes in diastolic heart function were observed. Conclusion: Echocardiography assessment indicated that prolonged intense swimming does not affect LV or RV function. Supercompensation of the post-event RV function and increased global LV systolic function demonstrated ventricular interaction after prolonged intense swimming.",Sex Differences in Performance and Pacing Strategies During Sprint Skiing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967794,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 12,"Purpose: This study aimed to compare performance and pacing strategies between elite male and female cross-country skiers during a sprint competition on snow using the skating technique. Methods: Twenty male and 14 female skiers completed an individual time-trial prolog (TT) and three head-to-head races (quarter, semi, and final) on the same 1,572-m course, which was divided into flat, uphill and downhill sections. Section-specific speeds, choice of sub-technique (i.e., gear), cycle characteristics, heart rate and post-race blood lactate concentration were monitored. Power output was estimated for the different sections during the TT, while metabolic demand was estimated for two uphill camera sections and the final 50-m flat camera section. Results: Average speed during the four races was ∼12.5% faster for males than females (P < 0.001), while speeds on the flat, uphill and downhill sections were ∼11, 18, and 9% faster for the males than females (all P < 0.001 for terrain, sex, and interaction). Differences in uphill TT speed between the sexes were associated with different sub-technique preferences, with males using a higher gear more frequently than females (P < 0.05). The estimated metabolic demand relative to maximal oxygen uptake ( 

V
˙

 O2max) was similar for both sexes during the two uphill camera sections (∼129% of 

V
˙

 O2max) and for the final 50-m flat section (∼153% of 

V
˙

 O2max). Relative power output during the TT was 18% higher for males compared to females (P < 0.001) and was highly variable along the course for both sexes (coefficient of variation [CV] between sections 4-9 was 53%), while the same variation in heart rate was low (CV was ∼3%). The head-to-head races were ∼2.4% faster than the TT for both sexes and most race winners (61%) were positioned first already after 30 m of the race. No sex differences were observed during any of the races for heart rate or blood lactate concentration. Conclusion: The average sex difference in sprint skiing performance was ∼12.5%, with varying differences for terrain-specific speeds. Moreover, females skied relatively slower uphill (at a lower gear) and thereby elicited more variation in their speed profiles compared to the males.",Subjective and Objective Outcomes in Patients With COPD After Pulmonary Rehabilitation - The Impact of Comorbidities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967792,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 12,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple systemic manifestations and comorbidities, which contribute independently to its total morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation is an evidence-based intervention that is indicated for COPD patients who remain symptomatic, despite optimal pharmacological therapy. Although it is well documented in pure COPD, the role of pulmonary rehabilitation is uncertain in coexisting comorbidities. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program in COPD patients with concomitant comorbidities. Methods: Thirty two patients with COPD were evaluated before and after a comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program, in terms of dyspnea, quality of life (QOL), pulmonary function tests and exercise capacity. The patients were also divided into two groups, according to the presence or the absence of comorbidities. Patients with none or only one comorbidity (Group 1, n = 11) were compared to those who had two or more comorbidities (Group 2, n = 21). Results: All patients significantly improved in dyspnea, as expressed by modified Medical Research Council scale and the COPD assessment Test (p < 0.001), QOL as assessed by the St. George respiratory questionnaire (p < 0.001) and exercise tolerance in six minute walking test (p < 0.001). Peak oxygen uptake relatively increased and body mass decreased in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD seems to be beneficial for all patients, independently of the presence, the number or the nature of their comorbidities. Thus, the presence of comorbidities must not represent an exclusion criterion for patients that are referred to pulmonary rehabilitation programs.

The current standard treatment for term infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is hypothermia. Because hypothermia is only partially effective, novel therapies are required to improve outcomes further. Human umbilical cord blood cells (UCB) are a rich source of stem and progenitor cells making them a potential treatment for neonatal HI brain injury. Recent clinical trials have shown that UCB therapy is a safe and efficacious treatment for confirmed cerebral palsy. In this study, we assessed whether early administration of UCB to the neonate could improve long-term behavioral outcomes and promote brain repair following neonatal HI brain injury. Methods: HI brain injury was induced in postnatal day (PND) 7 rat pups via permanent ligation of the left carotid artery, followed by a 90 min hypoxic challenge. UCB was administered intraperitoneally on PND 8. Behavioral tests, including negative geotaxis, forelimb preference and open field test, were performed on PND 14, 30, and 50, following brains were collected for assessment of neuropathology. Results: Neonatal HI resulted in decreased brain weight, cerebral tissue loss and apoptosis in the somatosensory cortex, as well as compromised behavioral outcomes. UCB administration following HI improved short and long-term behavioral outcomes but did not reduce long-term histological evidence of brain injury compared to HI alone. In addition, UCB following HI increased microglia activation in the somatosensory cortex compared to HI alone. Conclusion: Administration of a single dose of UCB cells 24 h after HI injury improves behavior, however, a single dose of cells does not modulate pathological evidence of long-term brain injury."

Second, we aimed to investigate whether the frequency of CDI codispensings appeared higher or lower than the expected for the drugs involved. Methods: We carried out a study using a random sample of all drugs dispensings registered in a database of the French Health Insurance System between 2010 and 2015. The distribution of the drugs involved was described considering active principles, detailing the 20 most frequent ones for both contraindicated or discommended codispensings (DCs). To investigate whether the frequency of CDI codispensings appeared higher or lower than the expected for the drugs involved, we developed a specific indicator, the Drug-drug interaction prevalence study-score (DIPS-score), that compares for each drug pair the observed frequency of codispensing to its expected probability. The latter is determined considering the frequencies of dispensings of the individual drugs constituting a pair of interest. Results: We analyzed 6,908,910 dispensings: 13,196 (0.2%) involved contraindicated codispensings (CCs), and 95,410 (1.4%) DCs. For CCS, the most frequently involved drug pair was ""bisoprolol+flecainide"" (n = 5,036); four out of five of the most represented pairs involved cardiovascular drugs. For DCS, the most frequently involved drug pair was ""ramipril+spironolactone"" (n = 4,741); all of the five most represented pairs involved cardiovascular drugs. The drug pair involved in the CC with the highest score value was ""citalopram+hydroxyzine"" (DIPS-score: 3.7; 2.9-4.6); that with the lowest score was ""clarithromycin+simvastatin"" (DIPS-score: 0.2; 0.2-0.3). DIPS-score median value was 0.4 for CCs and 0.6 for DCs. Conclusion: This high prevalence of CDI codispensings enforces the need for further risk-prevention actions regarding drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially for arrhythmogenic or anti-arrhythmic drugs. In this perspective, the DIPS-score we develop could ease identifying the interactions that are poorly considered by clinicians/pharmacists and targeting interventions.",Molecular Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia Infection Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967778,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is becoming more prevalent, thus seriously affecting patient outcomes. In this paper, we studied the drug resistance mechanism and epidemiological characteristics of CRE, and analyzed the infection and prognosis factors of VAP caused by CRE, to provide evidence for effective control of nosocomial infection in patients with VAP. A total of 58 non-repetitive CRE strains of VAP were collected from January 2016 to June 2018. To explore the risk factors of CRE infection, 1:2 group case control method was used to select non CRE infection patients at the same period as the control group. Among the 58 CRE strains, the most common isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. All strains were sensitive to polymyxin B, which features better sensitivity to other antibiotics such as minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and amikacin. Multiple drug resistance genes were detected at the same time in most strains. KPC-2 was the most common carbapenemase-resistant gene in Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas NDM-1 was more common in Escherichia coli. The risk factors correlated with CRE infection included intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy time >7 days (OR = 2.793; 95% CI 1.439~5.421), antibiotic exposure during hospital stay including those to enzyme inhibitors (OR = 1.977; 95% CI 1.025~3.812), carbapenems (OR = 3.268; 95% CI 1.671~6.392), antibiotic combination therapy(OR = 1.951; 95% CI 1.020~3.732), and nerve damage (OR = 3.013; 95% CI 1.278~7.101). Multivariable analysis showed that ICU stay >7 days (OR = 1.867; 95% CI 1.609~20.026), beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotics (OR = 7.750; 95% CI 2.219~27.071), and carbapenem (OR = 9.143; 95% CI 2.259~37.01) are independent risk factors for VAP carbapenem caused by Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A high resistance rate of CRE isolated from VAP indicated that the infected patients featured higher mortality and longer hospital stay time than the control group. Multiple risk factors for CRE infection and their control can effectively prevent the spread of VAP.","Apigenin Combined With Gefitinib Blocks Autophagy Flux and Induces Apoptotic Cell Death Through Inhibition of HIF-1α, c-Myc, p-EGFR, and Glucose Metabolism in EGFR L858R+T790M-Mutated H1975 Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967777,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"Cancer cells are characterized by abnormally increased glucose uptake and active bio-energy and biosynthesis to support the proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistant survival. We examined the therapeutic value of the combination of apigenin (a natural small-molecule inhibitor of Glut1 belonging to the flavonoid family) and gefitinib on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-resistant mutant non-small cell lung cancer, to notably damage glucose utilization and thus suppress cell growth and malignant behavior. Here, we demonstrate that apigenin combined with gefitinib inhibits multiple oncogenic drivers such as c-Myc, HIF-1α, and EGFR, reduces Gluts and MCT1 protein expression, and inactivates the 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which regulates glucose uptake and maintains energy metabolism, leading to impaired energy utilization in EGFR L858R-T790M-mutated H1975 lung cancer cells. H1975 cells exhibit dysregulated metabolism and apoptotic cell death following treatment with apigenin + gefitinib. Therefore, the combined apigenin + gefitinib treatment presents an attractive strategy as alternative treatment for the acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.",CXCL6 Promotes Renal Interstitial Fibrosis in Diabetic Nephropathy by Activating JAK/STAT3 Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967776,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"In this study the role of CXCL6 in diabetic nephropathy (DN) was investigated. It was found to be overexpression in DN patients and DN rat model. And the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines was consistent with the expression of CXCL6. High glucose significantly increased the proliferation of rat renal fibroblasts NRK-49F cell and the expression of CXCL6. Knockdown of CXCL6 ameliorated the pro-proliferation effect of high glucose and decreased the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines, while CXCL6 overexpression exhibited the opposite phenomenon. Gene set enrichment analysis, Western blot and ELISA showed that Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and CYTOKINE_CYTOKINE_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION signaling pathways were correlative with CXCL6. This data indicates that CXCL6 may promote fibrosis-related factors to accelerate the development of DN renal interstitial fibrosis by activating JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. CXCL6 is promising to be a potential novel therapeutic target and candidate biomarker for JAK/STAT3 signaling for the treatment of DN.",Repeated Sigma-1 Receptor Antagonist MR309 Administration Modulates Central Neuropathic Pain Development After Spinal Cord Injury in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967775,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"Up to two-thirds of patients affected by spinal cord injury (SCI) develop central neuropathic pain (CNP), which has a high impact on their quality of life. Most of the patients are largely refractory to current treatments, and new pharmacological strategies are needed. Recently, it has been shown that the acute administration of the σ1R antagonist MR309 (previously developed as E-52862) at 28 days after spinal cord contusion results in a dose-dependent suppression of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in wild-type CD-1 Swiss female mice. The present work was addressed to determine whether MR309 might exert preventive effects on CNP development by repeated administration during the first week after SCI in mice. To this end, the MR309 (16 or 32 mg/kg i.p.) modulation on both thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia development were evaluated weekly up to 28 days post-injury. In addition, changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β) expression and both the expression and activation (phosphorylation) of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B-NMDA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) were analyzed. The repeated treatment of SCI-mice with MR309 resulted in significant pain behavior attenuation beyond the end of the administration period, accompanied by reduced expression of central sensitization-related mechanistic correlates, including extracellular mediators (TNF-α and IL-1β), membrane receptors/channels (NR2B-NMDA) and intracellular signaling cascades (ERK/pERK). These findings suggest that repeated MR309 treatment after SCI may be a suitable pharmacologic strategy to modulate SCI-induced CNP development.","Rolipram, a PDE4 Inhibitor, Enhances the Inotropic Effect of Rat Heart by Activating SERCA2a.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967774,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"This study was designed to investigate the hemodynamic effect of rolipram, a phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, in normal rat hearts both in vivo and in vitro and its underlying mechanism. The pressure-volume loop, isolated heart, and Ca2+ transients triggered by field stimulation or caffeine were used to analyze the hemodynamic mechanism of rolipram. The results demonstrated that rolipram (3 mg/kg, ip) significantly increased the in vivo rat heart contractility by enhancing stroke work, cardiac output, stroke volume, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic pressure, heart rate, ejection fraction, peak rate of rise of left pressure (+dp/dtmax), the slopes of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (slope of ESPVR) named as left ventricular end-systolic elastance, and reduced the slopes of end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (slope of EDPVR). Meanwhile, the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were significantly enhanced by rolipram. Also, rolipram deviated normal ventricular-arterial coupling without changing the arterial elastance. Furthermore, rolipram (0.1, 1, 10 μM) also exerted positive inotropic effect in isolated rat hearts by increasing the left ventricular development pressure, and +dp/dtmax in non-paced and paced modes. Rolipram (10 μM) increased the SERCA2a activity, Ca2+ content, and Ca2+ leak rate without changing diastolic Ca2+ level. Rolipram had significant positive inotropic effect with less effect on peripheral vascular elastance and its underlying mechanism was mediated by increasing SERCA2a activity. PDE4 inhibition by rolipram resulted in a positive inotropic effect and might serve as a target for developing agents for the treatment of heart failure in clinical settings.",Metabolism-Based Therapeutic Strategies Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967773,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 12,"Cancer heterogeneity constitutes the major source of disease progression and therapy failure. Tumors comprise functionally diverse subpopulations, with cancer stem cells (CSCs) as the source of this heterogeneity. Since these cells bear in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential, survive chemotherapy and drive relapse, its elimination may be the only way to achieve long-term survival in patients. Thanks to the great advances in the field over the last few years, we know now that cellular metabolism and stemness are highly intertwined in normal development and cancer. Indeed, CSCs show distinct metabolic features as compared with their more differentiated progenies, though their dominant metabolic phenotype varies across tumor entities, patients and even subclones within a tumor. Following initial works focused on glucose metabolism, current studies have unveiled particularities of CSC metabolism in terms of redox state, lipid metabolism and use of alternative fuels, such as amino acids or ketone bodies. In this review, we describe the different metabolic phenotypes attributed to CSCs with special focus on metabolism-based therapeutic strategies tested in preclinical and clinical settings.",Cognitive Performance Concomitant With Vision Acuity Predicts 13-Year Risk for Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967772,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019 04 12,"Objective: To assess the joint impact of cognitive performance and visual acuity on mortality over 13-year follow-up in a representative US sample. Methods: Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (≥18 years old) were linked with the death record data of the National Death Index (NDI) with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2011. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and cognitive performance impairment was defined as the DSST score equal to or less than the median value in the study population. Visual impairment (VI) was defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. Risks of all-cause and specific-cause mortality were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for confounders. Results: A total of 2,550 participants 60 years and older from two waves of (NHANES, 1999-2000, 2001-2002) were included in the current analysis. Over a median follow-up period of 9.92 years, 952 (35.2%) died of all causes, of whom 239 (23.1%), 224 (24.0%), and 489 (52.9%) died from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality, respectively. Cognitive performance impairment and VI increased the odds for mortality. Co-presence of VI among cognitive impaired elderly persons predicted nearly a threefold increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratios (HRs), 2.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.02-3.70; P < 0.001) and almost a fourfold higher risk of non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.30-6.00; P < 0.001) compared to having neither impairment. Conclusion: People aged 60 years and over with poorer cognitive performance were at higher risk of long-term mortality, and were especially vulnerable to further mortality when concomitant with VI. It is informative for clinical implication in terms of early preventive interventions.",Affibody-Mediated Sequestration of Amyloid β Demonstrates Preventive Efficacy in a Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967771,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019 04 13,"Different strategies for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are currently under investigation, including passive immunization with anti-amyloid β (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of a novel type of Aβ-targeting agent based on an affibody molecule with fundamentally different properties to mAbs. We generated a therapeutic candidate, denoted ZSYM73-albumin-binding domain (ABD; 16.8 kDa), by genetic linkage of the dimeric ZSYM73 affibody for sequestering of monomeric Aβ-peptides and an ABD for extension of its in vivo half-life. Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 transgenic AD mice were administered with ZSYM73-ABD, followed by behavioral examination and immunohistochemistry. Results demonstrated rescued cognitive functions and significantly lower amyloid burden in the treated animals compared to controls. No toxicological symptoms or immunology-related side-effects were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first reported in vivo investigation of a systemically delivered scaffold protein against monomeric Aβ, demonstrating a therapeutic potential for prevention of AD.",Early Stage Alterations in White Matter and Decreased Functional Interhemispheric Hippocampal Connectivity in the 3xTg Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967770,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019 04 12,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized in the late stages by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Nevertheless, recent evidence has indicated that early changes in cerebral connectivity could compromise cognitive functions even before the appearance of the classical neuropathological features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and volumetry were performed in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) at 2 months of age, prior to the development of intraneuronal plaque accumulation. We found the 3xTg-AD had significant fractional anisotropy (FA) increase and radial diffusivity (RD) decrease in the cortex compared with wild-type controls, while axial diffusivity (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were similar. Interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity was decreased in the 3xTg-AD while connectivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) was similar to controls. Most surprising, ventricular volume in the 3xTg-AD was four times larger than controls. The results obtained in this study characterize the early stage changes in interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity in the 3xTg-AD mouse that could represent a translational biomarker to human models in preclinical stages of the AD."

As an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, LPHN1 is cleaved into two fragments, which can behave independently on the cell surface, but re-associate upon binding the toxin. This triggers intracellular signaling that involves the Gαq/phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate cascade and an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, leading to vesicular exocytosis. Using affinity chromatography on LPHN1, we isolated its endogenous ligand, teneurin-2/Lasso. Both LPHN1 and Ten2/Lasso are expressed early in development and are enriched in neurons. LPHN1 primarily resides in axons, growth cones and presynaptic terminals, while Lasso largely localizes on dendrites. LPHN1 and Ten2/Lasso form a trans-synaptic receptor pair that has both structural and signaling functions. However, Lasso is proteolytically cleaved at multiple sites and its extracellular domain is partially released into the intercellular space, especially during neuronal development, suggesting that soluble Lasso has additional functions. We discovered that the soluble fragment of Lasso can diffuse away and bind to LPHN1 on axonal growth cones, triggering its redistribution on the cell surface and intracellular signaling which leads to local exocytosis. This causes axons to turn in the direction of spatio-temporal Lasso gradients, while LPHN1 knockout blocks this effect. These results suggest that the LPHN1-Ten2/Lasso pair can participate in long- and short-distance axonal guidance and synapse formation.",Kinect-Assisted Performance-Sensitive Upper Limb Exercise Platform for Post-stroke Survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967755,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 04 12,"One's ability to use upper limbs is critical for performing activities of daily living necessary for enjoying quality community life. However, after stroke, such abilities becomes adversely affected and it often deprives one of their capability to perform tasks that need coordinated movement in the upper limbs. To address issues with upper limb dysfunction, patients typically undergo rehabilitative exercises. Given the high patient to doctor ratio particularly in developing countries like India, conventional rehabilitation with patients undergoing exercises under one-on-one therapist's supervision often becomes a challenge. Thus, investigators are exploring technology such as computer-based platforms coupled with cameras that can alleviate the need for the continuous presence of a therapist and can offer a powerful complementary tool in the hands of the clinicians. Such marker-based imaging systems used for rehabilitation can offer real-time processing and high accuracy of data. However, these systems often require dedicated lab space and high set-up time. Often this is very expensive and suffers from portability issues. Investigators have been exploring marker-less imaging techniques e.g., Kinect integrated computer-based graphical user interfaces in stroke-rehabilitation such as tracking one's limb movement during rehabilitation. In our present study, we have developed a Kinect-assisted computer-based system that offered Human Computer Interaction (HCI) tasks of varying challenge levels. Execution of the tasks required one to use reaching and coordination skills of the upper limbs. Also, the system was Performance-sensitive i.e., adaptive to the individualized residual movement ability of one's upper limb quantified in terms of task performance score. We tested for the usability of our system by exposing 15 healthy participants to our system. Subsequently, seven post-stroke patients interacted with our system over a few sessions spread over 2 weeks. Also, we studied patient's mean tonic activity corresponding to the HCI tasks as a possible indicator of one's post-stroke functional recovery suggesting its potential of our system to serve as a rehabilitation platform. Our results indicate the potential of such systems toward the improvement of task performance capability of post-stroke patients with possibilities of upper limb movement rehabilitation.",Microelectrode Array With Transparent ALD TiN Electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967754,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 04 12,"Low noise platinum black or sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) microelectrodes are typically used for recording electrical activity of neuronal or cardiac cell cultures. Opaque electrodes and tracks, however, hinder the visibility of the cells when imaged with inverted microscope, which is the standard method of imaging cells plated on microelectrode array (MEA). Even though transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes exist, they cannot compete in impedance and noise performance with above-mentioned opaque counterparts. In this work, we propose atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the method to deposit TiN electrodes and tracks which are thin enough (25-65 nm) to be transparent (transmission ∼18-45%), but still benefit from the columnar structure of TiN, which is the key element to decrease noise and impedance of the electrodes. For ALD TiN electrodes (diameter 30 μm) impedances from 510 to 590 kΩ were measured at 1 kHz, which is less than the impedance of bare ITO electrodes. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neurons were cultured on the ALD TiN MEAs for 14 days without observing any biocompatibility issues, and spontaneous electrical activity of the neurons was recorded successfully. The results show that transparent ALD TiN film is a suitable electrode material for producing functional MEAs.",A Compound Computational Model for Filling-In Processes Triggered by Edges: Watercolor Illusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967753,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 04 12,"The goal of our research was to develop a compound computational model with the ability to predict different variations of the ""watercolor effects"" and additional filling-in effects that are triggered by edges. The model is based on a filling-in mechanism solved by a Poisson equation, which considers the different gradients as ""heat sources"" after the gradients modification. The biased (modified) contours (edges) are ranked and determined according to their dominancy across the different chromatic and achromatic channels. The color and intensity of the perceived surface are calculated through a diffusive filling-in process of color triggered by the enhanced and biased edges of stimulus formed as a result of oriented double-opponent receptive fields. The model can successfully predict both the assimilative and non-assimilative watercolor effects, as well as a number of ""conflicting"" visual effects. Furthermore, the model can also predict the classic Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet (COC) effect. In summary, our proposed computational model is able to predict most of the ""conflicting"" filling-in effects that derive from edges that have been recently described in the literature, and thus supports the theory that a shared visual mechanism is responsible for the vast variety of the ""conflicting"" filling-in effects that derive from edges.",Electrical Neuroimaging of Music Processing in Pianists With and Without True Absolute Pitch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967751,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 04 12,"True absolute pitch (AP), labeling of pitches with semitone precision without a reference, is classically studied using isolated tones. However, AP is acquired and has its function within complex dynamic musical contexts. Here we examined event-related brain responses and underlying cerebral sources to endings of short expressive string quartets, investigating a homogeneous population of young highly trained pianists with half of them possessing true-AP. The pieces ended regularly or contained harmonic transgressions at closure that participants appraised. Given the millisecond precision of ERP analyses, this experimental plan allowed examining whether AP alters music processing at an early perceptual, or later cognitive level, or both, and which cerebral sources underlie differences with non-AP musicians. We also investigated the impact of AP on general auditory cognition. Remarkably, harmonic transgression sensitivity did not differ between AP and non-AP participants, and differences for auditory cognition were only marginal. The key finding of this study is the involvement of a microstate peaking around 60 ms after musical closure, characterizing AP participants. Concurring sources were estimated in secondary auditory areas, comprising the planum temporale, all transgression conditions collapsed. These results suggest that AP is not a panacea to become a proficient musician, but a rare perceptual feature.",Physical Exercise for Individuals with Hypertension: It Is Time to Emphasize its Benefits on the Brain and Cognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967748,Clinical Medicine Insights. Cardiology,2019 04 12,"Hypertension affects more than 40% of adults worldwide and is associated with stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. It has also been shown to cause severe functional and structural damage to the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that these cognitive impairments affect the mental ability to maintain productivity at work, ultimately causing social and economic problems. Because hypertension is a chronic condition that requires clinical treatment, strategies with fewer side effects and less-invasive procedures are needed. Physical exercise (PE) has proven to be an efficient and complementary tool for hypertension management, and its peripheral benefits have been widely supported by related studies. However, few studies have specifically examined the potential positive effects of PE on the brain in hypertensive individuals. This narrative review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms that hypertension promotes in the brain, and suggests PE as an important tool to prevent and reduce cognitive damage caused by hypertension.

Each expert analyzed 18 frames twice with a 3-month interval. A total of 72 measurements by 2 experts were used for intra- and interobserver variability analysis in calibration factor (CF), minimal lumen diameter (MLD), percent diameter stenosis (%DS), interpolated reference diameter (Int R), and lesion length (LL). Accuracy, precision, and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated based on 2 measurements. For interobserver variability, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was evaluated.

Intraclass correlation coefficient of Int R was almost perfect in blind and pre-selected frame QCA. Intraclass correlation coefficient of MLD, %DS, and LL were substantial/lower by blind frame QCA and improved to almost perfect by pre-selected frame QCA. Blind cine film selection might affect intra- and interobserver variability, especially in MLD and LL. In the multiple linear regression analysis, blind frame QCA was selected as an explanatory factor of QCA variability in MLD, %DS, and LL.

Patient-specific geometries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967745,"Physics of fluids (Woodbury, N.Y. : 1994)",2019 04 13,"A simple parameter, called the Aneurysm number (An) which is defined as the ratio of transport to vortex time scales, has been shown to classify the flow mode in simplified aneurysm geometries. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that An can classify the flow in patient-specific intracranial aneurysms (IA). Therefore, the definition of this parameter is extended to anatomic geometries by using hydraulic diameter and the length of expansion area in the approximate direction of the flow. The hypothesis is tested using image-based flow simulations in five sidewall and four bifurcation geometries, i.e., if An ≲ 1 (shorter transport time scale), then the fluid is transported across the neck before the vortex could be formed, creating a quasi-stationary shear layer (cavity mode). By contrast, if An ≳ 1 (shorter vortex time scale), a vortex is formed. The results show that if An switches from An ≲ 1 to An ≳ 1, then the flow mode switches from the cavity mode to the vortex mode. However, if An does not switch, then the IAs stay in the same mode. It is also shown that IAs in the cavity mode have significantly lower An, temporal fluctuations of wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index (OSI) compared to the vortex mode (p < 0.01). In addition, OSI correlates with An in each flow mode and with pulsatility index in each IA.

The flow inside aneurysm-like geometries can be widely classified into (i) the vortex mode in which a vortex ring is formed and (ii) the cavity mode in which a stationary shear layer acts similar to a moving lid of a lid-driven cavity. In these modes, two competing time scales exist: (a) a transport time scale, T
t
 , which is the time scale to develop a shear layer by transporting a fluid particle across the expansion region, and (b) the vortex formation time scale, 


T


v


 . Consequently, a relevant non-dimensional parameter is the ratio of these two time scales, which is called Aneurysm number: An = T
t
 / 


T


v


 . It is hypothesized, based on this definition, that the flow is in the vortex mode if the time required for vortex ring formation 


T


v


 is less than the transport time T
t
 (An ≳ 1). Otherwise, the flow is in the cavity mode (An ≲ 1). This hypothesis is systematically tested through numerical simulations on simplified geometries and shown to be true through flow visualizations and identification of the main vortex and shear layer. The main vortex is shown to evolve when An ≳ 1 but stationary when An ≲ 1. In fact, it is shown that the flows with An ≲ 1 (cavity mode) are characterized by much smaller fluctuations of wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index relative to flows with An ≳ 1 (vortex mode) because of their quasi-stationary flow pattern (cavity mode) compared to the evolution and breakdown of the formed vortex ring (vortex mode)."

However, new knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin C and recent high-profile preclinical studies have revived interest in the utilization of high-dose vitamin C for cancer treatment. Studies have shown that pharmacological vitamin C targets many of the mechanisms that cancer cells utilize for their survival and growth. In this Opinion article, we discuss how vitamin C can target three vulnerabilities many cancer cells share: redox imbalance, epigenetic reprogramming and oxygen-sensing regulation. Although the mechanisms and predictive biomarkers that we discuss need to be validated in well-controlled clinical trials, these new discoveries regarding the anticancer properties of vitamin C are promising to help identify patient populations that may benefit the most from high-dose vitamin C therapy, developing effective combination strategies and improving the overall design of future vitamin C clinical trials for various types of cancer.","Quality of life under extended continuous versus intermittent adjuvant letrozole in lymph node-positive, early breast cancer patients: the SOLE randomised phase 3 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967649,British journal of cancer,2019 05 15,"In the phase III SOLE trial, the extended use of intermittent versus continuous letrozole for 5 years did not improve disease-free survival in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Thirty-three whole surgical specimens from 28 patients with HNSCC were included. PD-L1 expression in six random core biopsies from each surgical specimen was used to assess the concordance between multiple biopsies and the negative predictive value of a single negative core biopsy.

Clinical oncology,2019 04 10,"Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma, but resistance to these therapeutic modalities limits the percentage of patients with long-lasting responses. Accumulating evidence indicates that a persisting subpopulation of melanoma cells contributes to resistance to targeted therapy or immunotherapy, even in patients who initially have a therapeutic response; however, the root mechanism of resistance remains elusive. To address this problem, we propose a new model, in which dynamic fluctuations of protein expression at the single-cell level and longitudinal reshaping of the cellular state at the cell-population level explain the whole process of therapeutic resistance development. Conceptually, we focused on two different pivotal signalling pathways (mediated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and IFNγ) to construct the evolving trajectories of melanoma and described each of the cell states. Accordingly, the development of therapeutic resistance could be divided into three main phases: early survival of cell populations, reversal of senescence, and the establishment of new homeostatic states and development of irreversible resistance. On the basis of existing data, we propose future directions in both translational research and the design of therapeutic strategies that incorporate this emerging understanding of resistance.",Evaluating the genetic architecture of quantitative traits via selection followed by inbreeding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967644,Heredity,2019 04 10,"The deleterious mutation model proposes that quantitative trait variation should be dominated by rare, partially recessive, deleterious mutations. Following artificial selection on a focal trait, the ratio of the difference in inbreeding effects between control and selected populations (ΔB), to the difference in trait means caused by directional selection (ΔM), can inform the extent to which deleterious mutations cause quantitative trait variation. Here, we apply the ΔB/ΔM ratio test to two quantitative traits (male mating success and body size) in Drosophila melanogaster. For both traits, ΔB/ΔM ratios suggested that intermediate-frequency alleles, rather than rare, partially recessive alleles (i.e. deleterious mutations), caused quantitative trait variation. We discuss these results in relation to viability data, exploring how differences between regimens in segregating (measured through inbreeding) and fixed (measured through population crosses) mutational load could affect the ratio test. Finally, we present simulations that test the statistical power of the ratio test, providing guidelines for future research.",Weight loss at your fingertips: personalized nutrition with fasting glucose and insulin using a novel statistical approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967642,European journal of clinical nutrition,2019 04 10,"Precision medicine is changing the way people are diagnosed and treated into a more personalized approach.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well known. We identified that the oncogenic miR-146b-5p attenuates miRNA biosynthesis by targeting DICER1 and reducing its expression. DICER1 overexpression inhibited all the miR-146b-induced aggressive phenotypes in thyroid cells. Systemic injection of an anti-miR-146b in mice with orthotopic thyroid tumors suppressed tumor growth and recovered DICER1 levels. Notably, DICER1 downregulation promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through miRNA downregulation. Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed a general decrease in DICER1 expression in thyroid cancer that was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Administration of the small-molecule enoxacin to promote DICER1 complex activity reduced tumor aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data confirm DICER1 as a tumor suppressor and show that oncogenic miR-146b contributes to its downregulation. Moreover, our results highlight a potential therapeutic application of RNA-based therapies including miRNA inhibitors and restoration of the biogenesis machinery, which may provide treatments for thyroid and other cancers.",Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967625,Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,2019 04 10,"Advances in radiation technology have transformed treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer.

At a concentration of 100 nM, a nucleosome solution induced a strong stiffening effect on DNA (1.1 N m-1). This can be compared to the effects of the histone proteins, H1, H2A, H3 where no changes in the mechanical properties of DNA were observed and the complex of the H3/H4 proteins where a smaller increase in the stiffness is observed (0.2 N m-1). Para-sulphonato-calix[4]arene, SC4, known for epigenetic activity by interacting specifically with the lysine groups of histone proteins, was studied for its effect on an artificial chromatin. Using a microfluidic SNT device, SC4 was titrated against the artificial chromatin, at a concentration of 1 mM in SC4 a considerable increase in stiffness, 15 N m-1, was observed. Simultaneously optical microscopy showed a physical change in the DNA structure between the tips of the SNT device. Electronic and Atomic Force microscopy confirmed this structural re-arrangement.

Moreover, it was confirmed that variation in pH resulted in the changes in the surface area (defect structure), which were considered to be responsible for the changes in the catalytic properties of these NPs. For the oxygen evolution reaction, these NPs exhibited relatively smaller overpotential (η) values than other tested Cr@IrO2- and Ni@IrO2-containing NPs.

Rheumatology,2019 04 26,"B cells have important functions in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In addition to producing autoantibodies, B cells contribute to autoimmunity by serving as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), producing cytokines, and through additional mechanisms. B cell activation and effector functions are regulated by immune checkpoints, including both activating and inhibitory checkpoint receptors that contribute to the regulation of B cell tolerance, activation, antigen presentation, T cell help, class switching, antibody production and cytokine production. The various activating checkpoint receptors include B cell activating receptors that engage with cognate receptors on T cells or other cells, as well as Toll-like receptors that can provide dual stimulation to B cells via co-engagement with the B cell receptor. Furthermore, various inhibitory checkpoint receptors, including B cell inhibitory receptors, have important functions in regulating B cell development, activation and effector functions. Therapeutically targeting B cell checkpoints represents a promising strategy for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune rheumatic diseases.","Enasidenib, an inhibitor of mutant IDH2 proteins, induces durable remissions in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967620,Leukemia,2019 04 10,"Older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not fit for standard chemotherapy historically have poor outcomes. Approximately 12-15% of older patients with AML harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) gene mutations. Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant IDH2 proteins. Among 39 patients with newly diagnosed mutant-IDH2 AML who received enasidenib monotherapy in this phase I/II trial, median age was 77 years (range 58-87) and 23 patients (59%) had had an antecedent hematologic disorder. The median number of enasidenib treatment cycles was 6.0 (range 1-35). The most common treatment-related adverse events were indirect hyperbilirubinemia (31%), nausea (23%), and fatigue, decreased appetite, and rash (18% each).

To clarify the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in MLLr leukemia, two loss-of-function (LOF) Setd2-mutant alleles (Setd2F2478L/WT or Setd2Ex6-KO/WT) were generated and introduced, respectively, to the Mll-Af9 knock-in leukemia mouse model. Both alleles cooperated with Mll-Af9 to accelerate leukemia development that resulted in resistance to standard Cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells showed downregulated signaling related to cell cycle progression, S, and G2/M checkpoint regulation. Thus, after Cytarabine treatment, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells exit from the S phase and progress to the G2/M phase. Importantly, S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint inhibition could resensitize the Mll-Af9/Setd2 double-mutant cells to standard chemotherapy by causing DNA replication collapse, mitotic catastrophe, and increased cell death. These findings demonstrate that LOF SETD2 mutations confer chemoresistance on AL to DNA-damaging treatment by S and G2/M checkpoint defects. The combination of S and G2/M checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy can be explored as a promising therapeutic strategy by exploiting their unique vulnerability and resensitizing chemoresistant AL with SETD2 or SETD2-like epigenetic mutations.",Formation of tubules and helical ribbons by ceramide phosphoethanolamine-containing membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967612,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE), a major sphingolipid in invertebrates, is crucial for axonal ensheathment in Drosophila. Darkfield microscopy revealed that an equimolar mixture of bovine buttermilk CPE (milk CPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (diC18:1 PC) tends to form tubules and helical ribbons, while pure milk CPE mainly exhibits amorphous aggregates and, at low frequency, straight needles. Negative staining electron microscopy indicated that helices and tubules were composed of multilayered 5-10 nm thick slab-like structures. Using different molecular species of PC and CPE, we demonstrated that the acyl chain length of CPE but not of PC is crucial for the formation of tubules and helices in equimolar mixtures. Incubation of the lipid suspensions at the respective phase transition temperature of CPE facilitated the formation of both tubules and helices, suggesting a dynamic lipid rearrangement during formation. Substituting diC18:1 PC with diC18:1 PE or diC18:1 PS failed to form tubules and helices. As hydrated galactosylceramide (GalCer), a major lipid in mammalian myelin, has been reported to spontaneously form tubules and helices, it is believed that the ensheathment of axons in mammals and Drosophila is based on similar physical processes with different lipids.",Bio-compatible organic humidity sensor based on natural inner egg shell membrane with multilayer crosslinked fiber structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967610,Scientific reports,2019 04 16,"In this paper, we propose a novel bio-compatible organic humidity sensor based on natural inner egg shell membrane (IESM) with multilayer cross linked fiber structure that can be used as a substrate as well as a sensing active layer.

We investigated the prognostic impact of a deletion spanning the entire UGT2B17 gene (UGT2B17*2) and genetic variants of the aromatase CYP19A1 and estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in 125 postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer enrolled in a randomized pre-surgical trial. The UGT2B17*2 was estimated by copy number variation assays and the CYP19A1 rs10046/rs4646 and ESR1 rs2077647/rs2234693/rs9340799 by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Serum exemestane/17-hydroxy exemestane were determined by MS and estrone (E1)/estradiol (E2)/ by GC-MS/MS. The association of genetic polymorphisms with ""any event"" was assessed by the Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for confounders. The UGT2B17*2 was associated with higher levels of 17-hydroxy exemestane (P = 0.04) and better prognosis (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.20-1.01; P = 0.05) compared with homozygote UGT2B17 wt. The CYP19A1 rs10046 A and rs4646 C alleles were associated with higher estrogen levels: rs10046 AA vs. AG/GG genotypes had median E1 of 35.9 vs. 27.4 pg/mL (P = 0.05) and E2 of 7.57 vs. 3.9 pg/mL (P < 0.004). After a median follow-up of 7 years, women carrying the ""low estrogen"" alleles rs10046 G and rs4646 A had a better prognosis compared with homozygote wt for both polymorphisms (HR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.93; P = 0.03). Our analysis points to an impact of UGT2B17 and CYP19A1 in postmenopausal endocrine responsive breast cancer. Carriers of UGT2B17*2 and CYP19A1 low estrogen variants may have better prognosis, supporting studies addressing the role of these polymorphisms in optimizing endocrine therapy.

We examine the effects of disorder on the TE properties of semiconducting polymers based on the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) for site energies while employing Pauli's master equation approach to model hopping between localized sites. Our model is in good agreement with experimental results and a useful tool to study hopping transport. We show that stronger overlap between sites can improve the electrical conductivity without adversely affecting the Seebeck coefficient. We find that positional disorder aids the formation of new conduction paths with an increased probability of carriers in high energy sites, leading to an increase in electrical conductivity while leaving the Seebeck unchanged. On the other hand, energetic disorder leads to increased energy gaps between sites, hindering transport. This adversely affects conductivity while only slightly increasing Seebeck and results in lower TE power factors. Furthermore, positional correlation primarily affects conductivity, while correlation in site energies has no effect on TE properties of polymers. Our results also show that the Lorenz number increases with Seebeck coefficient, largely deviating from the Sommerfeld value, in agreement with experiments and in contrast to band conductors. We conclude that reducing energetic disorder and positional correlation, while increasing positional disorder can lead to higher TE power factors.",Rapid detection of Bacillus ionophore cereulide in food products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967595,Scientific reports,2019 04 16,"Cereulide is a toxic cyclic depsipeptide produced by certain strains of Bacillus cereus found in soil and food products. While some harmless strains of Bacillus are used as probiotic, others can cause nausea and vomiting, and represent an important food safety concern. Current detection methods are time consuming and do not necessarily detect toxic cereulide. Here, we developed a rapid protocol using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry that detects the toxin originating from a colony smear of B. cereus. The distinct molecular feature of the toxin peak at m/z 1,191 was clearly identified from bacterial extracts with a limit of detection (LOD) of 30 ng/mL. Final optimisation of the sample preparation was based on cereulide chelating cations to produce the alkali adduct [M + K]+ without the use of a MALDI matrix, and provided a 1,000-fold improvement of LOD with 30 pg/mL of cereulide. We evaluated the application of this method for the detection of cereulide in rice, milk, and different ready-to-eat meals. The proposed protocol is quick, easy and provides an improvement over conventional methods for the detection of B. cereus toxin.",β-carboline biomediators induce reveromycin production in Streptomyces sp.

In usual solution-based methods such as 2-step solution and antisolvent, we observed the relatively weak two main absorption peaks at 0.95 and 1.87 THz. The measured absorption spectrum is analyzed by density-functional theory calculations. The modes at 0.95 and 1.87 THz are assigned to the Pb-I vibrations of the inorganic components in the tetragonal phase. By contrast, the origin of the 1.58 THz absorption is due to the structural deformation of Pb-I bonding at the grain boundary incorporated with a CH3NH2 molecular defect.","Sevoflurane promotes migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of human glioblastoma cells possibly via increasing the expression of cell surface protein 44.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967592,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2019 04 10,"Surgical resection of primary solid tumor under anesthesia remains a common practice. It has been concerned whether general anesthetics, especially volatile anesthetics, may promote the growth, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effects of sevoflurane on human glioblastoma cells and determined the role of cluster of differentiation (CD) 44, a cell surface protein involved in cell growth, migration, and invasion, in sevoflurane's effects. We showed that exposure to 1%-4% sevoflurane did not change the cell proliferation, but concentration-dependently increased the invasion of human glioblastoma U251 cells. Furthermore, 4% sevoflurane significantly increased the migration and colony-forming ability of U251 cells. Similar results were observed in human glioblastoma A172 cells. Exposure to sevoflurane concentration-dependently increased the activity of calpains, a group of cysteine proteinases, and CD44 protein in U251 and A172 cells. Knockdown of CD44 with siRNA abolished sevoflurane-induced increases in calpain activity, migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of U251 cells. Inhalation of 4% sevoflurane significantly increased the tumor volume and invasion/migration distance of U87 cells from the tumor mass in the nude mice bearing human glioblastoma U87 xenograft in the brain. The aggravation by sevoflurane was attenuated by CD44 silencing. In conclusion, sevoflurane increases the migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability of human glioblastoma cells in vitro, and their tumor volume and invasion/migration in vivo. Sevoflurane enhances these cancer cell biology features via increasing the expression of CD44.",microRNA-155 inhibition restores Fibroblast Growth Factor 7 expression in diabetic skin and decreases wound inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967591,Scientific reports,2019 04 17,"Treatment for chronic diabetic foot ulcers is limited by the inability to simultaneously address the excessive inflammation and impaired re-epithelization and remodeling. Impaired re-epithelization leads to significantly delayed wound closure and excessive inflammation causes tissue destruction, both enhancing wound pathogen colonization. Among many differentially expressed microRNAs, miR-155 is significantly upregulated and fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) mRNA (target of miR-155) and protein are suppressed in diabetic skin, when compared to controls, leading us to hypothesize that topical miR-155 inhibition would improve diabetic wound healing by restoring FGF7 expression. In vitro inhibition of miR-155 increased human keratinocyte scratch closure and topical inhibition of miR-155 in vivo in wounds increased murine FGF7 protein expression and significantly enhanced diabetic wound healing. Moreover, we show that miR-155 inhibition leads to a reduction in wound inflammation, in accordance with known pro-inflammatory actions of miR-155. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that topical miR-155 inhibition increases diabetic wound fibroblast growth factor 7 expression in diabetic wounds, which, in turn, increases re-epithelization and, consequently, accelerates wound closure. Topical miR-155 inhibition targets both excessive inflammation and impaired re-epithelization and remodeling, being a potentially new and effective treatment for chronic diabetic foot ulcers.",Royal jelly attenuates cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967588,Scientific reports,2019 04 16,"Cadmium exposure induces nephrotoxicity by mediating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of royal jelly on Cd-induced nephrotoxicity. Adult male mice were distributed randomly into 4 clusters: untreated, royal jelly-treated (85 mg/kg, oral), CdCl2-treated (6.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and pretreated with royal jelly (85 mg/kg) 2 h before CdCl2 injection (6.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for seven consecutive days. Cd concentration in the renal tissue and absolute kidney weight of the Cd-treated mice were significantly higher than those of control group. The levels of kidney function markers, kidney injury molecules-1 (KIM-1), metallothionein, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and the apoptosis regulators Bax and caspases-3 also increased significantly in the renal tissue of Cd-treated mice, whereas the levels of glutathione, antioxidant enzyme activities, and the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 were significantly reduced in the renal tissue of Cd-treated group. Histopathological studies showed vacuolation and congested glomeruli in the kidney tissue of Cd-treated mice. However, all aforementioned Cd-induced changes were attenuated by pretreatment with royal jelly. We therefore concluded that royal jelly attenuated Cd-induced nephrotoxicity and it is suggested that this nephroprotective effect could be linked to its ability to promote the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant responsive element (ARE) pathway.",Successively accelerated ionic wind with integrated dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator for low-voltage operation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967587,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) force is used for active control of fluid motion and for the generation of propulsive thrust by inducing ionic wind with no moving parts. We propose a method of successively generating and accelerating ionic wind induced by surface dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD), referred to as a DBD plasma actuator with multiple electrodes. A conventional method fails to generate unidirectional ionic wind, due to the generation of a counter ionic-wind with the multiple electrodes DBD plasma actuator. However, unidirectional ionic wind can be obtained by designing an applied voltage waveform and electrode arrangement suitable for the unidirectional EHD force generation. Our results demonstrate that mutually enhanced EHD force is generated by using the multiple electrodes without generating counter ionic-wind and highlights the importance of controlling the dielectric surface charge to generate the strong ionic wind. The proposed method can induce strong ionic wind without a high-voltage power supply, which is typically expensive and heavy, and is suitable for equipping small unmanned aerial vehicles with a DBD plasma actuator for a drastic improvement in the aerodynamic performance.",Entrainment of Lymphatic Contraction to Oscillatory Flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967585,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Lymphedema, a disfiguring condition characterized by an asymmetrical swelling of the limbs, is suspected to be caused by dysfunctions in the lymphatic system. A possible source of lymphatic dysfunction is the reduced mechanosensitivity of lymphangions, the spontaneously contracting units of the lymphatic system. In this study, the entrainment of lymphangions to an oscillatory wall shear stress (OWSS) is characterized in rat thoracic ducts in relation to their shear sensitivity. The critical shear stress above which the thoracic ducts show a substantial inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly negatively correlated to the diameter of the lymphangion. The entrainment of the lymphangion to an applied OWSS was found to be significantly dependent on the difference between the applied frequency and the intrinsic frequency of contraction of the lymphangion. The strength of the entrainment was also positively correlated to the applied shear stress when the applied shear was less than the critical shear stress of the vessel. The ejection fraction and fractional pump flow were also affected by the difference between the frequency of the applied OWSS and the vessel's intrinsic contraction frequency. The results suggest an adaptation of the lymphangion contractility to the existing oscillatory shear stress as a function of its intrinsic contractility and shear sensitivity. These adaptations might be crucial to ensure synchronized contraction of lymphangions through mechanosensitive means and might help explain the lymphatic dysfunctions that result from impaired mechanosensitivity."

The presented structures are composed of n-doped silicon nanoparticles or nanowires embedded in intrinsic silicon. An intense absorption peak is observed and could be tuned across the MIR range. While nanoparticles give a single broad absorption peak, the nanowires structure shows a broadband absorption of more than 70% from λ = 5 to 13 µm reaching up to 99% at 7 µm. The absorption peak could be extended to more than 20 µm by increasing the length of the nanowire. Increasing the diameter of the nanoparticles gives higher absorption, reaching just above 90% efficiency at λ = 11 µm for a diameter of 1500 nm. Changing the geometrical parameters of each structure is thoroughly studied and analyzed to obtain highest absorption in MIR.

Recently, helping-like behaviour has been observed in rats, but whether it is oriented towards rescue, social contact with others, or other goals remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether helping-like behaviour could be observed in mice similar to that in rats. Because mice are social animals widely used in neuroscience, the discovery of helping-like behaviour in mice would be valuable in clarifying the psychological and biological mechanisms underlying pro-sociability. We constrained mice inside tubes. Subject mice were allowed to move freely in cages with tubes containing constrained conspecifics. The subject mice released both cagemates and stranger mice but did not engage in opening empty tubes. Furthermore, the same behaviour was observed under aversive conditions and with anesthetised conspecifics. Interestingly, hungry mice opened the tubes containing food before engaging in tube-opening behaviour to free constrained conspecifics. Mice showed equal preferences for constrained and freely moving conspecifics. We demonstrated for the first time that mice show tube-opening behaviour. Furthermore, we partly clarified the purpose and motivation of this behaviour. An effective mouse model for helping-like behaviour would facilitate research on the mechanisms underlying prosocial behaviour.",GAS2-like 1 coordinates cell division through its association with end-binding proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967572,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Cell division involves the tightly coordinated rearrangement of actin and microtubules (MTs). We have previously shown that a member of the family of growth arrest-specific 2-like proteins, GAS2-like 1 (G2L1) regulates actin-MT crosstalk through its associations with plus-end microtubule tip-binding (EB) proteins. Here we show that G2L1 is involved in the regulation of cell division. We show that the depletion of G2L1 results in a reduction in the number of cells undergoing cell division and a significant proportion of those cells that do divide are either multinucleated, display deformed nuclei, or undergo cell division at a much slower rate. Exogenous expression of G2L1 mutants revealed that the association of G2L1 with EB1 is critical for regulated cell division and blocking this interaction inhibits cell division as observed in cells lacking G2L1. Taken together, our data suggest that G2L1 controls the precise regulation and successful progression of cell division through its binding to EB-proteins.",Trapping single atoms on a nanophotonic circuit with configurable tweezer lattices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967571,Nature communications,2019 04 16,"Trapped atoms near nanophotonics form an exciting platform for bottom-up synthesis of strongly interacting quantum matter.

Here we implement a configurable optical tweezer array over a planar photonic circuit tailored for cold atom integration and control for trapping and high-fidelity imaging of one or more atoms in an array directly on a photonic structure. Using an optical conveyor belt formed by a moving optical lattice within a tweezer potential, we show that single atoms can be transported from a reservoir into close proximity of a photonic interface, potentially allowing for the synthesis of a defect-free atom-nanophotonic hybrid lattice. Our experimental platform can be integrated with generic planar photonic waveguides and resonators, promising a pathway towards on-chip many-body quantum optics and applications in quantum technology.","Identification of a Novel Anti-cancer Protein, FIP-bbo, from Botryobasidium botryosum and Protein Structure Analysis using Molecular Dynamic Simulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967569,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Fungal immunoregulatory proteins (FIP) are effective small molecule proteins with broad-spectrum immunomodulatory and anti-cancer activities and can be potential agents for the development of clinical drugs and health food additives. In this study, a new member of FIP named FIP-bbo was obtained through Botryobasidium botryosum genome mining. FIP-bbo has the typical characteristics of FIP but is genetically distant from other FIPs. Recombinant FIP-bbo (rFIP-bbo) was produced in an optimized E. coli expression system, and the pure protein was isolated using a Ni-NTA column. Antineoplastic experiments suggested that FIP-bbo is similar to LZ-8 in inhibiting various cancer cells (Hela, Spac-1, and A549) at lower concentrations, but it is not as potent as LZ-8. The molecular mechanism by which FIP-bbo, FIP-fve, and LZ-8 are cytotoxic to cancer cells has been discussed based on molecular dynamics simulation. Point mutations that may improve the thermal stability of FIP-fve and FIP-bbo were predicted. These results not only present a new candidate protein for the development of anticancer adjuvants, but also provide an approach for designing FIPs with high anticancer activity.",Control of nanostructure and pinning properties in solution deposited YBa2Cu3O7-x nanocomposites with preformed perovskite nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967568,Scientific reports,2019 04 16,"Solution deposited YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) nanocomposites with preformed nanoparticles represent a promising cost-effective approach for superior critical current properties under applied magnetic fields.

We describe a three-round screen for increased L-DOPA production in S. cerevisiae using FACS enrichment of an enzyme-coupled biosensor for L-DOPA. Multiple rounds of screening were enabled by a single build of a barcoded in vitro transposon-mediated disruption library. New background strains for screening were built for each iteration using results from previous iterations. The same in vitro transposon-mediated disruption library was integrated by homologous recombination into new background strains in each round of screening. Compared with creating new transposon insertions in each round, this method takes less time and saves the cost of additional sequencing to characterize transposon insertion sites. In the first two rounds of screening, we identified deletions that improved biosensor compartmentalization and, consequently, improved our ability to screen for L-DOPA production. In a final round, we discovered that deletion of heme oxygenase (HMX1) increases total heme concentration and increases L-DOPA production, using dopamine measurement as a proxy. We further demonstrated that deleting HMX1 may represent a general strategy for P450 function improvement by improving activity of a second P450 enzyme, BM3, which performs a distinct reaction.","Evaluation of MEDAG gene expression in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: associations with histological features, regional lymph node metastasis and prognosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967566,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma accounts﻿ for a large proportion of papillary thyroid carcinoma, especially among new cases.

In this study, differentially expressed genes were identified with microarray from The Cancer Genome Atlas, followed by analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, western blot and Oil Red O staining were carried out to evaluate expression levels and functional alterations. Mesenteric Estrogen Dependent Adipogenesis expression was observed in almost all cases of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas, and the location of expression was associated with histological subtype. High expression was correlated with metastasis and poor disease-free survival. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis indicated that Mesenteric Estrogen Dependent Adipogenesis expression may be associated with metabolic reprogramming to influence metastasis and prognosis. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how Mesenteric Estrogen Dependent Adipogenesis affects metastasis and the prognosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients and suggest that Mesenteric Estrogen Dependent Adipogenesis expression may be a novel prognostic marker in these patients.",Evaluation of an untargeted nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach to expand coverage of low molecular weight dissolved organic matter in Arctic soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967565,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"Characterizing low molecular weight (LMW) dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils and evaluating the availability of this labile pool is critical to understanding the underlying mechanisms that control carbon storage or release across terrestrial systems. However, due to wide-ranging physicochemical diversity, characterizing this complex mixture of small molecules and how it varies across space remains an analytical challenge. Here, we evaluate an untargeted approach to detect qualitative and relative-quantitative variations in LMW DOM with depth using water extracts from a soil core from the Alaskan Arctic, a unique system that contains nearly half the Earth's terrestrial carbon and is rapidly warming due to climate change. We combined reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, and nano-electrospray ionization coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in positive- and negative-ionization mode. The optimized conditions were sensitive, robust, highly complementary, and enabled detection and putative annotations of a wide range of compounds (e.g. amino acids, plant/microbial metabolites, sugars, lipids, peptides). Furthermore, multivariate statistical analyses revealed subtle but consistent and significant variations with depth. Thus, this platform is useful not only for characterizing LMW DOM, but also for quantifying relative variations in LMW DOM availability across space, revealing hotspots of biogeochemical activity for further evaluation.",The free energy landscape of the oncogene protein E7 of human papillomavirus type 16 reveals a complex interplay between ordered and disordered regions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967564,Scientific reports,2019 04 14,"When present, structural disorder makes it very challenging to characterise the conformational properties of proteins. This is particularly the case of proteins, such as the oncogene protein E7 of human papillomavirus type 16, which contain both ordered and disordered domains, and that can populate monomeric and oligomeric states under physiological conditions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is emerging as a powerful method to study these complex systems, most notably in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. Here we use NMR chemical shifts and residual dipolar couplings as structural restraints in replica-averaged molecular dynamics simulations to determine the free energy landscape of E7. This landscape reveals a complex interplay between a folded but highly dynamical C-terminal domain and a disordered N-terminal domain that forms transient secondary and tertiary structures, as well as an equilibrium between a high-populated (98%) dimeric state and a low-populated (2%) monomeric state. These results provide compelling evidence of the complex conformational heterogeneity associated with the behaviour and interactions of this disordered protein associated with disease."

In conclusion, iFISH is a versatile and expandable resource, which can greatly facilitate the use of DNA FISH in research and diagnostics.",Efficient allelic-drive in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967548,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Gene-drive systems developed in several organisms result in super-Mendelian inheritance of transgenic insertions. Here, we generalize this ""active genetic"" approach to preferentially transmit allelic variants (allelic-drive) resulting from only a single or a few nucleotide alterations. We test two configurations for allelic-drive: one, copy-cutting, in which a non-preferred allele is selectively targeted for Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) cleavage, and a more general approach, copy-grafting, that permits selective inheritance of a desired allele located in close proximity to the gRNA cut site. We also characterize a phenomenon we refer to as lethal-mosaicism that dominantly eliminates NHEJ-induced mutations and favors inheritance of functional cleavage-resistant alleles. These two efficient allelic-drive methods, enhanced by lethal mosaicism and a trans-generational drive process we refer to as ""shadow-drive"", have broad practical applications in improving health and agriculture and greatly extend the active genetics toolbox.",Influenza A virus ribonucleoproteins form liquid organelles at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967547,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Influenza A virus has an eight-partite RNA genome that during viral assembly forms a complex containing one copy of each RNA. Genome assembly is a selective process driven by RNA-RNA interactions and is hypothesized to lead to discrete punctate structures scattered through the cytosol. Here, we show that contrary to the accepted view, formation of these structures precedes RNA-RNA interactions among distinct viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), as they assemble in cells expressing only one vRNP type. We demonstrate that these viral inclusions display characteristics of liquid organelles, segregating from the cytosol without a delimitating membrane, dynamically exchanging material and adapting fast to environmental changes. We provide evidence that viral inclusions develop close to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites, depend on continuous ER-Golgi vesicular cycling and do not promote escape to interferon response. We propose that viral inclusions segregate vRNPs from the cytosol and facilitate selected RNA-RNA interactions in a liquid environment.",Measurement of carrier lifetime in micron-scaled materials using resonant microwave circuits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967546,Nature communications,2019 04 16,"The measurement of minority carrier lifetimes is vital to determining the material quality and operational bandwidth of a broad range of optoelectronic devices. Typically, these measurements are made by recording the temporal decay of a carrier-concentration-dependent material property following pulsed optical excitation. Such approaches require some combination of efficient emission from the material under test, specialized collection optics, large sample areas, spatially uniform excitation, and/or the fabrication of ohmic contacts, depending on the technique used. In contrast, here we introduce a technique that provides electrical readout of minority carrier lifetimes using a passive microwave resonator circuit. We demonstrate >105 improvement in sensitivity, compared with traditional photoemission decay experiments and the ability to measure carrier dynamics in micron-scale volumes, much smaller than is possible with other techniques. The approach presented is applicable to a wide range of 2D, micro-, or nano-scaled materials, as well as weak emitters or non-radiative materials.",Deletion of Dtnbp1 in mice impairs threat memory consolidation and is associated with enhanced inhibitory drive in the amygdala.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967545,Translational psychiatry,2019 04 18,"Schizophrenia is a severe and highly heritable disorder. Dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1), also known as dysbindin-1, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Specifically, dysbindin-1 mRNA and protein expression are decreased in the brains of subjects with this disorder. Mice lacking dysbinidn-1 also display behavioral phenotypes similar to those observed in schizophrenic patients. However, it remains unknown whether deletion of dysbindin-1 impacts functions of the amygdala, a brain region that is critical for emotional processing, which is disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. Here, we show that dysbindin-1 is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Deletion of dysbindin-1 in male mice (Dys-/-) impaired cued and context-dependent threat memory, without changes in measures of anxiety. The behavioral deficits observed in Dys-/- mice were associated with perturbations in the BLA, including the enhancement of GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal neurons, increased numbers of parvalbumin interneurons, and morphological abnormalities of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons. Our findings highlight an important role for dysbindin-1 in the regulation of amygdalar function and indicate that enhanced inhibition of BLA pyramidal neuron activity may contribute to the weakened threat memory expression observed in Dys-/- mice.",The role of enhanced velocity shears in rapid ocean cooling during Super Typhoon Nepartak 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967544,Nature communications,2019 04 16,"Typhoon is a major cause of multiple disasters in coastal regions of East Asia. To advance our understanding of typhoon-ocean interactions and thus to improve the typhoon forecast for the disaster mitigation, two data buoys were deployed in the western North Pacific, which captured Super Typhoon Nepartak (equivalent to Category 5) in July 2016 at distances <20 km from the typhoon's eye center. Here we demonstrate that the unprecedented dataset combined with the modeling results provide new insights into the rapid temperature drop (~1.5 °C in 4 h) and the dramatic strengthening of velocity shear in the mixed layer and below as the driving mechanism for this rapid cooling during the direct influence period of extremely strong winds. The shear instability and associated strong turbulence mixing further deepened the mixed layer to ~120 m. Our buoys also observed that inertial oscillations appeared before the direct wind influence period.",Mapping vaccination coverage to explore the effects of delivery mechanisms and inform vaccination strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967543,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"The success of vaccination programs depends largely on the mechanisms used in vaccine delivery. National immunization programs offer childhood vaccines through fixed and outreach services within the health system and often, additional supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are undertaken to fill gaps and boost coverage. Here, we map predicted coverage at 1 × 1 km spatial resolution in five low- and middle-income countries to identify areas that are under-vaccinated via each delivery method using Demographic and Health Surveys data. We compare estimates of the coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP3), which is typically delivered through routine immunization (RI), with those of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) for which SIAs are also undertaken. We find that SIAs have boosted MCV coverage in some places, but not in others, particularly where RI had been deficient, as depicted by DTP coverage. The modelling approaches outlined here can help to guide geographical prioritization and strategy design.",Competitive endogenous RNA is an intrinsic component of EMT regulatory circuits and modulates EMT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967542,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis suggests an intrinsic mechanism to regulate biological processes. However, whether the dynamic changes of ceRNAs can modulate miRNA activities remains controversial. Here, we examine the dynamics of ceRNAs during TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We observe that TGFBI, a transcript highly induced during EMT in A549 cells, acts as the ceRNA for miR-21 to modulate EMT. We further identify FN1 as the ceRNA for miR-200c in the canonical SNAIL-ZEB-miR200 circuit in MCF10A cells. Experimental assays and computational simulations demonstrate that the dynamically induced ceRNAs are directly coupled with the canonical double negative feedback loops and are critical to the induction of EMT. These results help to establish the relevance of ceRNA in cancer EMT and suggest that ceRNA is an intrinsic component of the EMT regulatory circuit and may represent a potential target to disrupt EMT during tumorigenesis.",A Bayesian mixture model for clustering droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data from population studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967541,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"The recently developed droplet-based single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology makes it feasible to perform a population-scale scRNA-seq study, in which the transcriptome is measured for tens of thousands of single cells from multiple individuals. Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we develop a Bayesian mixture model for single-cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. BAMM-SC takes raw count data as input and accounts for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from extensive simulation studies and applications of BAMM-SC to in-house experimental scRNA-seq datasets using blood, lung and skin cells from humans or mice demonstrate that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with considerable improved clustering accuracy, particularly in the presence of heterogeneity among individuals.",The fishery performance indicators for global tuna fisheries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967539,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"We characterize the ecological, economic, and community performance of 21 major tuna fisheries, accounting for at least 77% of global tuna production, using the Fishery Performance Indicators. Our analysis reveals that the biggest variations in performance among tuna fisheries are driven by the final markets that they target: international sashimi market tuna fisheries considerably outperform a comparison set of 62 non-tuna fisheries in the Fishery Performance Indicator database, international canned tuna market fisheries perform similarly to the comparison set, and tuna fisheries supplying local markets in coastal states considerably underperform the comparison set. Differences among regional fishery management organizations primarily reflect regional species composition and market access, despite stark variation in governance, management, and other enabling conditions. With a legacy of open access, tuna's harvest sector performance is similar across all fisheries, reflecting only a normal return on the capital and skill invested: industrial vessels slightly outperform semi-industrial and artisanal vessels. Differences emerge in the post-harvest sector however, as value chains able to preserve quality and transport fish to high value markets outperform others."

However, some patients with MM develop primary resistance to BTZ, whereas others develop resistance after treatment. In this study, we investigated relationships between BTZ resistance and dysfunction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in patients with MM. Bone marrow samples were collected from patients with MM and healthy donors for lncRNA microarray and survival analyses. To investigate functions and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated BTZ resistance in MM, we performed CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry analyses, dual luciferase report gene assays, and RNA pulldown assays with samples from nude mice carrying tumor xenografts and in clinical samples. Differentially expressed lncRNA myocardial infarction associated transcripts (MIAT) were highly expressed in patients with MM compared with healthy controls, and were predictive of poor survival outcomes. Moreover, MIAT expression was significantly increased in BTZ-resistant patients with MM compared with newly diagnosed patients with MM, and was identified as a BTZ-inducible lncRNA. Specifically, BTZ upregulated MIAT expression through increased stat1 phosphorylation. Silencing of MIAT inhibited MM cell growth and sensitized MM cells to BTZ by negatively regulating miR-29b. Our data demonstrated the utility of MIAT as a tool for overcoming BTZ resistance in patients with MM.",Auditory sensory memory span for duration is severely curtailed in females with Rett syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967526,Translational psychiatry,2019 04 18,"Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, is typified by profound cognitive impairment and severe language impairment, rendering it very difficult to accurately measure auditory processing capabilities behaviorally in this population. Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of RTT patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT.High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with RTT and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven RTT and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the RTT group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while RTT patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.",Donor-Dependent Factors Influencing Contamination Rates of Conjunctival Swabs of Human Donor Eyes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967524,Annals of transplantation,2019 05 02,"BACKGROUND This study investigated the effect of donor-dependent factors on contamination rates of conjunctival swabs of human donor eyes. MATERIAL AND METHODS From July 2015 to September 2017 a total of 1008 conjunctival swabs from 504 consecutive human donor eyes were analyzed. Cross-tabulation, chi-squared tests, and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the effect of donor-dependent factors on contamination rates of conjunctival swabs. RESULTS The mean conjunctival swabs contamination rate was 28.4%. Donors with the diagnosis of carcinoma or metastases were associated with an increased conjunctival swab contamination rate [odds ratio (OR)=1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2-2.6, p=0.007; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.6, p=0.016; respectively]. However, the age, sex, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and donors who received chemotherapy did not significantly increase the conjunctival swab contamination risk. CONCLUSIONS Donors with the diagnosis of a carcinoma or metastases seemed to be predisposed to increased conjunctival swab contamination risk.",Clopidogrel-Associated Migratory Inflammatory Polyarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967523,The American journal of case reports,2019 06 10,"BACKGROUND Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that plays an important role in primary management and secondary prevention of thrombotic vascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It is generally well tolerated by most patients, but rare adverse effects such as inflammatory arthritis has been noted. A very few cases of migratory polyarthritis secondary to clopidogrel have been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT We describe 2 cases of acute migratory polyarthritis associated with clopidogrel that resolved with discontinuation of clopidogrel and did not recur after prasugrel initiation. In the first case, the patient presented with migratory polyarthritis approximately 2-3 days after initiating clopidogrel, and the symptoms lasted in each joint for 1-2 days. In the second case, the migratory polyarthritis started 1 week after initiating clopidogrel, and the symptoms lasted in each joint for approximately 2-3 days. The symptoms completely resolved after discontinuing clopidogrel in both the cases, which is typical of an immune-mediated drug reaction. A diagnosis of acute migratory inflammatory polyarthritis related to clopidogrel was determined in both cases by excluding other conditions causing inflammatory arthritis. In both cases, the eosinophil count was within normal limits, thereby differentiating the disease process from an acute allergic reaction. CONCLUSIONS Identifying the etiology of inflammatory arthritis in a patient on clopidogrel needs extensive evaluation. The diagnosis of clopidogrel-related inflammatory arthritis is often missed due to lack of awareness. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential, as the symptoms completely resolve after discontinuing clopidogrel.",Successful management of absent sternum in an infant using porcine acellular dermal matrix.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967520,Archives of plastic surgery,2019 04 10,"Congenital absent sternum is a rare birth defect that requires early intervention for optimal long-term outcomes. Descriptions of the repair of absent sternum are limited to case reports, and no preferred method for management has been described. Herein, we describe the use of porcine acellular dermal matrix to reconstruct the sternum of an infant with sternal infection following attempted repair using synthetic mesh. The patient was a full-term male with trisomy 21, agenesis of corpus callosum, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, right-sided aortic arch, and congenital absence of sternum with no sternal bars. Following removal of the infected synthetic mesh, negative pressure wound therapy with instillation was used to manage the open wound and provide direct antibiotic therapy. When blood Creactive protein levels declined to ≤2 mg/L, the sternum was reconstructed using porcine acellular dermal matrix. At 21 months postoperative, the patient demonstrated no respiratory issues. Physical examination and computed tomography imaging identified good approximation of the clavicular heads and sternal cleft and forward curvature of the ribs. This case illustrates the benefits of negative pressure wound therapy and acellular dermal matrix for the reconstruction of absent sternum in the context of infected sternal surgical site previously repaired with synthetic mesh.",Rubella (German measles) revisited.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967519,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,2019 04 11,"Rubella is generally a mild and self-limited disease in children. During pregnancy, rubella can have potentially devastating effects on the developing fetus. Postnatal rubella is transmitted primarily by inhalation of virus-laden airborne droplets or direct contact with infected nasopharyngeal secretions. In susceptible pregnant women, the virus may cross the placenta and spread through the vascular system of the developing fetus. Postnatally acquired rubella typically begins with fever and lymphadenopathy, followed by an erythematous, maculopapular rash. The rash classically begins on the face, spreads cephalocaudally, becomes generalised within 24 hours, and disappears within 3 days. Maternal rubella, especially during early pregnancy, may lead to miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, premature labour, intrauterine growth retardation, and congenital rubella syndrome. Cataracts, congenital heart defects, and sensorineural deafness are the classic triad of congenital rubella syndrome and they typically occur if the fetal infection occurs in the first 11 weeks of gestation. Laboratory confirmation of rubella virus infection can be based on a positive serological test for rubella-specific immunoglobulin M antibody; a four-fold or greater increase in rubella-specific immunoglobulin G titres between acute and convalescent sera; or detection of rubella virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is mainly symptomatic. Universal childhood immunisation and vaccination of all susceptible patients with rubella vaccine to decrease circulation of the virus are cornerstones to prevention of rubella and, more importantly, congenital rubella syndrome.",Poisoning by toxic plants in Hong Kong: a 15-year review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967518,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,2019 04 11,"Hong Kong has a great diversity of plants, many of which are toxic to humans.

Mean heart rate (fH) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous fH increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean fH and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of fH indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system. We suggest that this criterion could be applied to other animals exposed to natural or imposed trauma, thus improving protocols involving animal handling, including veterinarian procedures.",Joint angular excursions during cyclical behaviors differ between tetrapod feeding and locomotor systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967515,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 05 01,"Tetrapod musculoskeletal diversity is usually studied separately in feeding and locomotor systems. However, comparisons between these systems promise important insight into how natural selection deploys the same basic musculoskeletal toolkit - connective tissues, bones, nerves and skeletal muscle - to meet the differing performance criteria of feeding and locomotion. In this study, we compare average joint angular excursions during cyclic behaviors - chewing, walking and running - in a phylogenetic context to explore differences in the optimality criteria of these two systems. Across 111 tetrapod species, average limb-joint angular excursions during cyclic locomotion are greater and more evolutionarily labile than those of the jaw joint during cyclic chewing. We argue that these findings reflect fundamental functional dichotomies between tetrapod locomotor and feeding systems. Tetrapod chewing systems are optimized for precise application of force over a narrower, more controlled and predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to fracture the substrate, the size and mechanical properties of which are controlled at ingestion and further reduced and homogenized, respectively, by the chewing process. In contrast, tetrapod limbed locomotor systems are optimized for fast and energetically efficient application of force over a wider and less predictable range of displacements, the principal aim being to move the organism at varying speeds relative to a substrate whose geometry and mechanical properties need not become more homogeneous as locomotion proceeds. Hence, the evolution of tetrapod locomotor systems has been accompanied by an increasing diversity of limb-joint excursions, as tetrapods have expanded across a range of locomotor substrates and environments."

Identification of differently expressed cytokines and chemokines may help to understand scarring and fibrotic processes following trabeculectomy, and to make predictions for the outcome of fistulating surgery in the future. Furthermore, the identification of cell signaling pathways involved in fibrosis offers the opportunity for a more specific antifibrotic therapy with reduced side effects, and an improvement in long-term surgical outcome.Eight samples of AH were collected during trabeculectomy surgery and commercially available cytokine/chemokine arrays were used. Specific, differently expressed proteins (cytokines/chemokines) in AH samples from patients with positive and negative surgery outcomes were detected. These proteins were classified based on their known profibrotic, inflammatory, adhesive, and apoptotic properties. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were among the most important profibrotic cytokines that we detected. Differences in the fold change of protein expression were highly significant between patients after successful and failed trabeculectomy surgery, and these were processed and visualized using ExprEssence software.This pilot study revealed differences in concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in AH between the two examined groups of patients. Our findings suggest that a positive outcome from trabeculectomy is strongly related to an inhibition of the fibrosis process.",The resistant effect of SIRT1 in oxidative stress-induced senescence of rat nucleus pulposus cell is regulated by Akt-FoxO1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967498,Bioscience reports,2019 05 21,"Objective: The senescence of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells induced by oxidative stress is one of the important causes of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Herein, we investigated the role and action mechanism of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in oxidative stress-induced senescence of rat NP cell.Methods: Premature senescence of rat NP cells was induced by sublethal concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (100 μM). SIRT1 was activated with SRT1720 (5 μM) to explore its effect on NP cells senescence. FoxO1 and Akt were inhibited by AS1842856 (0.2 μM) and MK-2206 (5 μM), respectively, to explore the role of Akt-FoxO1-SIRT1 axis in rat NP cells. Pretreatment with the resveratrol (20 μM), a common antioxidant and indirect activator of SIRT1, was done to investigate its role in senescent rat NP cells.Results: The mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1 were decreased in H2O2-induced senescent rat NP cells, and that specific activation of SIRT1 suppresses senescence. And the Akt-FoxO1 pathway, as the upstream of SIRT1, might be involved in the regulation of H2O2-induced senescence of rat NP cells by affecting the expression of SIRT1. In addition, the resveratrol played an anti-senescence role in rat NP cells, which might affect the Akt-FoxO1-SIRT1 axis.Conclusion: SIRT1 ameliorated oxidative stress-induced senescence of rat NP cell which was regulated by Akt-FoxO1 pathway, and resveratrol exerted anti-senescence effects by affecting this signaling axis.",SNP rs2596542G>A in MICA is associated with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967497,Bioscience reports,2019 05 21,"The association of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2596542G>A and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been broadly studied, with inconsistent results.

Eligible articles were searched in PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, Embase, VIP, Web of Science, and CBM databases up to November 2018. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were applied. A total of 11 articles, including 4528 HCC patients and 16,625 control subjects, were analyzed.

First, Snail is a more important EMT transcription factors for colon cancer prognosis, compared with Twist and Slug. Then, we found that apigenin effectively inhibits the activity of Snail. Apigenin could inhibit the EMT, migration, and invasion of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through the NF-κB/Snail pathway. Snail is a key regulator of EMT in colon cancer and Snail inhibitor apigenin may be a therapeutic application for patients with colon cancer.",LSINCT5 predicts unfavorable prognosis and exerts oncogenic function in osteosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967495,Bioscience reports,2019 06 12,"The dysregulated expression of LSINCT5 (long stress-induced non-coding transcript 5) has been found in various human tumors, and was generally related to cancer progression and unfavorable prognosis. Although the role of LSINCT5 in osteosarcoma was reported not long ago, the sample size of that study was limited. Our study presented more evidence about the clinical significance and biological function of LSINCT5 in osteosarcoma. In our results, we found LSINCT5 expression was increased in osteosarcoma tissue samples and cell lines, and high LSINCT5 expression was associated with advanced Enneking stage, large tumor size, high histological grade and present distant metastasis. Meanwhile, we observed high LSINCT5 expression was correlated with worse overall survival, and high LSINCT5 expression could be an independent poor predictor for overall survival in osteosarcoma cases. Moreover, we found inhibition of LSINCT5 expression suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and LSINCT5 overexpression dramatically facilitated cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro In conclusion, our study suggests that LSINCT5 exerts oncogenic function in osteosarcoma cells, and may be a potential predictor for clinical outcome in osteosarcoma patients.",Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with clinical characteristics and poor prognosis of multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967494,Bioscience reports,2019 04 10,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and multiple myeloma (MM) and its impact on clinical characteristics and prognosis. Fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 139 MM patients who had been diagnosed and treated from January 2010 to May 2018 and 50 PBMCs samples from healthy donors were obtained. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for detection of EBV-DNA. The results indicated a significantly higher EBV-DNA concentration among 139 MM patients compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the expression of EBV-DNA was positively correlated with the serum free light chain ratio (sFLCR) and disease PD/relapse (P<0.05). Especially, in EBV-DNA high-expression MM patients, EBV-DNA concentration forpatients with sFLCR≥100 was higher than that of patients with sFLCR<100. EBV-DNA concentration was higher in patients with disease PD/relapse than those without disease PD/relapse. In univariate analysis, the progress free survival(PFS)was inferior in MM patients with high expression of EBV-DNA, high LDH, and high-risk according to mSMART and IMWG, stage III according to R-ISS staging, extramedullary lesions, and genetic changes (P<0.05). However, in multivariate analysis, LDH, poor karyotype, R-ISS staging and mSMART were independent prognostic factors for PFS. Taken together, our studies suggest that an association exists between EBV infection and clinical characteristics of MM patients, and EBV infection appears to have a slight impact on the prognosis of MM. However, the results require further validation in other independent prospective MM cohorts.",Myosin Va and spermine synthase: partners in exosome transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967493,Bioscience reports,2019 05 12,"A recent paper in Bioscience Reports (BSR20182189) describes the discovery of an interaction between the motor protein myosin Va and the metabolic enzyme spermine synthase. Myosin Va is a molecular motor which plays a key role in vesicle transport. Mutations in the gene which encodes this protein are associated with Griscelli syndrome type 1 and the 'dilute' phenotype in animals. Spermine synthase catalyzes the conversion of spermidine to spermine. This largely cytoplasmic enzyme can also be localized to the soluble fraction in exosomes. Mutations in the spermine synthase gene are associated with Snyder Robinson mental retardation syndrome. The interaction between the two proteins was detected using the yeast two hybrid method and verified by microscale thermophoresis of recombinant proteins. Knockdown of the MYO5A gene reduced the expression of mRNA coding for spermine synthase. The amount of this transcript was also reduced in cells derived from a patient with Griscelli syndrome type 1. This suggests that, in addition to a direct physical interaction between the two proteins, myosin Va also modulates the transcription of the spermine synthase gene. The mechanism for this modulation is currently unknown. These findings have implications for Griscelli syndrome type 1 and Snyder Robinson mental retardation syndrome. They also suggest that interactions between myosin Va and soluble exosome proteins such as spermine synthase may be important in the mechanism of exosome transport.",Moderating effect of the neighbourhood physical activity environment on the relation between psychosocial factors and physical activity in children: a longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967488,Journal of epidemiology and community health,2019 06 13,"Few studies have examined the moderating role of neighbourhood environments on the relation between psychosocial factors and physical activity, and results of these studies are mixed.

Experiments focusing on proteoform analysis in drug time course or perturbation studies or in large patient cohorts greatly benefit from the reproducible quantification of single peptides across samples. However, such studies often require labeling of hundreds of micrograms of peptides such that the cost for labeling reagents represents a major contribution to the overall cost of an experiment. Here, we describe and evaluate a robust and cost-effective protocol for TMT labeling that reduces the quantity of required labeling reagent by a factor of eight and achieves complete labeling. Under- and over-labeling of peptides derived from complex digests of tissues and cell lines were systematically evaluated using peptide quantities of between 12.5 and 800 μg and TMT-to-peptide ratios (wt/wt) ranging from 8:1 to 1:2 at different TMT and peptide concentrations. When reaction volumes were reduced to maintain TMT and peptide concentrations of at least 10 mM and 2 g/L, respectively, TMT-to-peptide ratios as low as 1:1 (wt/wt) resulted in labeling efficiencies of > 99 % and excellent intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility. The utility of the optimized protocol was further demonstrated in a deep-scale proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of patient-derived xenograft tumor tissue benchmarked against the labeling procedure recommended by the TMT vendor. Finally, we discuss the impact of labeling reaction parameters for N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-based chemistry and provide guidance on adopting efficient labeling protocols for different peptide quantities."

Previously, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 pathway activates the pro-apoptotic transcriptional co-regulator Cited2 in vitro after DNA damage. In the present study, we report that Cited2 protein expression is also dramatically increased following stroke/ischemic insult. Critically, utilizing conditional knockout mice, we show that Cited2 is required for neuronal cell death, both in culture and in mice after ischemic insult. Importantly, determining the mechanism by which Cited2 levels are regulated, we found that E2F transcription factor (E2F) family members participate in Cited2 regulation. First, E2F1 expression induced Cited2 transcription, and E2F1 deficiency reduced Cited2 expression. Moreover, determining the potential E2F-binding regions on the Cited2 gene regulatory sequence by ChIP analysis, we provide evidence that E2F1/4 proteins bind to this DNA region. A luciferase reporter assay to probe the functional outcomes of this interaction revealed that E2F1 activates and E2F4 inhibits Cited2 transcription. Moreover, we identified the functional binding motif for E2F1 in the Cited2 gene promoter by demonstrating that mutation of this site dramatically reduces E2F1-mediated Cited2 transcription. Finally, E2F1 and E2F4 regulated Cited2 expression in neurons after stroke-related insults. Taken together, these results indicate that the E2F-Cited2 regulatory pathway is critically involved in stroke injury.",Overview of the Components of Cardiac Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967471,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 05 18,"Metabolism in organs other than the liver and kidneys may play a significant role in how a specific organ responds to chemicals. The heart has metabolic capability for energy production and homeostasis. This homeostatic machinery can also process xenobiotics. Cardiac metabolism includes the expression of numerous organic anion transporters, organic cation transporters, organic carnitine (zwitterion) transporters, and ATP-binding cassette transporters. Expression and distribution of the transporters within the heart may vary, depending on the patient's age, disease, endocrine status, and various other factors. Several cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme classes have been identified within the heart. The P450 hydroxylases and epoxygenases within the heart produce hydroxyeicosatetraneoic acids and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, metabolites of arachidonic acid, which are critical in regulating homeostatic processes of the heart. The susceptibility of the cardiac P450 system to induction and inhibition from exogenous materials is an area of expanding knowledge, as are the metabolic processes of glucuronidation and sulfation in the heart. The susceptibility of various transcription factors and signaling pathways of the heart to disruption by xenobiotics is not fully characterized but is an area with implications for disruption of normal postnatal development, as well as modulation of adult cardiac health. There are knowledge gaps in the timelines of physiologic maturation and deterioration of cardiac metabolism. Cross-species characterization of cardiac-specific metabolism is needed for nonclinical work of optimum translational value to predict possible adverse effects, identify sensitive developmental windows for the design and conduct of informative nonclinical and clinical studies, and explore the possibilities of organ-specific therapeutics.","Mechanisms, Detection, and Relevance of Protein Acetylation in Prokaryotes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967470,mBio,2019 05 01,"Posttranslational modification of a protein, either alone or in combination with other modifications, can control properties of that protein, such as enzymatic activity, localization, stability, or interactions with other molecules. N-ε-Lysine acetylation is one such modification that has gained attention in recent years, with a prevalence and significance that rival those of phosphorylation. This review will discuss the current state of the field in bacteria and some of the work in archaea, focusing on both mechanisms of N-ε-lysine acetylation and methods to identify, quantify, and characterize specific acetyllysines. Bacterial N-ε-lysine acetylation depends on both enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms of acetylation, and recent work has shed light into the regulation of both mechanisms. Technological advances in mass spectrometry have allowed researchers to gain insight with greater biological context by both (i) analyzing samples either with stable isotope labeling workflows or using label-free protocols and (ii) determining the true extent of acetylation on a protein population through stoichiometry measurements. Identification of acetylated lysines through these methods has led to studies that probe the biological significance of acetylation. General and diverse approaches used to determine the effect of acetylation on a specific lysine will be covered.",Phage-Encoded LuxR-Type Receptors Responsive to Host-Produced Bacterial Quorum-Sensing Autoinducers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967469,mBio,2019 06 10,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of cell-to-cell communication that bacteria use to orchestrate collective behaviors. QS relies on the cell-density-dependent production, accumulation, and receptor-mediated detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs). Gram-negative bacteria commonly use N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as their AIs, and they are detected by LuxR-type receptors. Often, LuxR-type receptors are insoluble when not bound to a cognate AI. In this report, we show that LuxR-type receptors are encoded on phage genomes, and in the cases we tested, the phage LuxR-type receptors bind to and are solubilized specifically by the AHL AI produced by the host bacterium. We do not yet know the viral activities that are controlled by these phage QS receptors; however, our observations, coupled with recent reports, suggest that their occurrence is more widespread than previously appreciated. Using receptor-mediated detection of QS AIs could enable phages to garner information concerning the population density status of their bacterial hosts. We speculate that such information can be exploited by phages to optimize the timing of execution of particular steps in viral infection.IMPORTANCE Bacteria communicate with chemical signal molecules to regulate group behaviors in a process called quorum sensing (QS). In this report, we find that genes encoding receptors for Gram-negative bacterial QS communication molecules are present on genomes of viruses that infect these bacteria. These viruses are called phages. We show that two phage-encoded receptors, like their bacterial counterparts, bind to the communication molecule produced by the host bacterium, suggesting that phages can ""listen in"" on their bacterial hosts. Interfering with bacterial QS and using phages to kill pathogenic bacteria represent attractive possibilities for development of new antimicrobials to combat pathogens that are resistant to traditional antibiotics. Our findings of interactions between phages and QS bacteria need consideration as new antimicrobial therapies are developed.",Two Health or Not Two Health? That Is the Question.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967467,mBio,2019 05 06,"How much drug-resistant infections in livestock contribute to disease in humans is controversial. While zoonoses are a prominent cause of emerging infections, and the profligate use of antibiotics as growth promoters is expected to lead to the spread of resistance, this resistance could remain concentrated in animal pathogens and only rarely spill over into humans. A recent paper compares genomes of Escherichia coli isolates from human bloodstream infections in England, focused on the Cambridge area, with isolates collected from farms and the food chain in the east of the country, seeking evidence of transmission (C. Ludden, K. E. Raven, D. Jamrozy, T. Gouliouris, et al., mBio 10:e02693-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.02693-18). While the human and livestock populations were clearly distinct, with very limited evidence for transmission of E. coli or resistance elements to humans, the results also illustrate our limited ability to infer historical transmission events from even the best samples. The implications for the One Health framework, aiming to unify human and veterinary medicine, are discussed.",Dengue and Zika Virus 5' Untranslated Regions Harbor Internal Ribosomal Entry Site Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967466,mBio,2019 05 01,"The Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family encompasses numerous enveloped plus-strand RNA viruses. Dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is the leading cause of serious arthropod-borne disease globally. The genomes of DENV, like the genomes of yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile fever virus (WNV), or Zika virus (ZIKV), control their translation by a 5'-terminal capping group. Three other genera of Flaviviridae are remarkable because their viruses use internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) to control translation, and they are not arthropod transmitted. In 2006, E. Harris' group published work suggesting that DENV RNA does not stringently need a cap for translation. They proposed that instead DENV translation is controlled by an interplay between 5' and 3' termini. Here we present evidence that the DENV or ZIKV 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) alone have IRES competence. This conclusion is based, first, on the observation that uncapped monocistronic mRNAs 5' terminated with the DENV or ZIKV 5'-UTRs can efficiently direct translation of a reporter gene in BHK and C6/36 cells and second, that either 5'-UTR placed between two reporter genes can efficiently induce expression of the downstream gene in BHK cells but not in C6/36 cells. These experiments followed observations that uncapped DENV/ZIKV genomic transcripts, 5' terminated with pppAN… or GpppAN…, can initiate infections of mammalian (BHK) or mosquito (C6/36) cells. IRES competence of the 5'-UTRs of DENV/ZIKV raises many open questions regarding the biology and control, as well as the evolution, of insect-borne flaviviruses.IMPORTANCE Members of the genus Flavivirus of Flaviviridae are important human pathogens of great concern because they cause serious diseases, sometimes death, in human populations living in tropical, subtropical (dengue virus [DENV], Zika virus [ZIKV], and yellow fever virus), or moderate climates (West Nile virus). Flaviviruses are known to control their translation by a cap-dependent mechanism. We have observed, however, that the uncapped genomes of DENV or ZIKV can initiate infection of mammalian and insect cells. We provide evidence that the short 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of DENV or ZIKV genomes can fulfill the function of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). This strategy frees these organisms from the cap-dependent mechanism of gene expression at an as yet unknown stage of proliferation. The data raise new questions about the biology and evolution of flaviviruses, possibly leading to new controls of flavivirus disease.",Core Metabolism Shifts during Growth on Methanol versus Methane in the Methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967465,mBio,2019 05 01,"Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 is an obligate methylotroph which grows on methane or methanol with similar growth rates. It has long been assumed that the core metabolic pathways must be similar on the two substrates, but recent studies of methane metabolism in this bacterium suggest that growth on methanol might have significant differences from growth on methane. In this study, both a targeted metabolomics approach and a 13C tracer approach were taken to understand core carbon metabolism in M. buryatense 5GB1 during growth on methanol and to determine whether such differences occur. Our results suggest a systematic shift of active core metabolism in which increased flux occurred through both the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and the partial serine cycle, while the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was incomplete, in contrast to growth on methane. Using the experimental results as constraints, we applied flux balance analysis to determine the metabolic flux phenotype of M. buryatense 5GB1 growing on methanol, and the results are consistent with predictions based on ATP and NADH changes. Transcriptomics analysis suggested that the changes in fluxes and metabolite levels represented results of posttranscriptional regulation. The combination of flux balance analysis of the genome-scale model and the flux ratio from 13C data changed the solution space for a better prediction of cell behavior and demonstrated the significant differences in physiology between growth on methane and growth on methanol.IMPORTANCE One-carbon compounds such as methane and methanol are of increasing interest as sustainable substrates for biological production of fuels and industrial chemicals. The bacteria that carry out these conversions have been studied for many decades, but gaps exist in our knowledge of their metabolic pathways. One such gap is the difference between growth on methane and growth on methanol. Understanding such metabolism is important, since each has advantages and disadvantages as a feedstock for production of chemicals and fuels. The significance of our research is in the demonstration that the metabolic network is substantially altered in each case and in the delineation of these changes. The resulting new insights into the core metabolism of this bacterium now provide an improved basis for future strain design.",Genetic Screen in Chlamydia muridarum Reveals Role for an Interferon-Induced Host Cell Death Program in Antimicrobial Inclusion Rupture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967464,mBio,2019 05 01,"Interferon-regulated immune defenses protect mammals from pathogenically diverse obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the genus Chlamydia Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is especially important in controlling the virulence of Chlamydia species and thus impacts the modeling of human chlamydial infection and disease in mice. How IFN-γ contributes to cell-autonomous defenses against Chlamydia species and how these pathogens evade IFN-γ-mediated immunity in their natural hosts are not well understood. We conducted a genetic screen which identified 31 IFN-γ-sensitive (Igs) mutants of the mouse model pathogen Chlamydia muridarum Genetic suppressor analysis and lateral gene transfer were used to map the phenotype of one of these mutants, Igs4, to a missense mutation in a putative chlamydial inclusion membrane protein, TC0574. We observed the lytic destruction of Igs4-occupied inclusions and accompanying host cell death in response to IFN-γ priming or various proapoptotic stimuli. However, Igs4 was insensitive to IFN-γ-regulated cell-autonomous defenses previously implicated in anti-Chlamydia trachomatis host defense in mice. Igs4 inclusion integrity was restored by caspase inhibitors, indicating that the IFN-γ-mediated destruction of Igs4 inclusions is dependent upon the function of caspases or related prodeath cysteine proteases. We further demonstrated that the Igs4 mutant is immune restricted in an IFN-γ-dependent manner in a mouse infection model, thereby implicating IFN-γ-mediated inclusion destruction and host cell death as potent in vivo host defense mechanisms to which wild-type C. muridarum is resistant. Overall, our results suggest that C. muridarum evolved resistance mechanisms to counter IFN-γ-elicited programmed cell death and the associated destruction of intravacuolar pathogens.IMPORTANCE Multiple obligatory intracellular bacteria in the genus Chlamydia are important pathogens. In humans, strains of C. trachomatis cause trachoma, chlamydia, and lymphogranuloma venereum. These diseases are all associated with extended courses of infection and reinfection that likely reflect the ability of chlamydiae to evade various aspects of host immune responses. Interferon-stimulated genes, driven in part by the cytokine interferon gamma, restrict the host range of various Chlamydia species, but how these pathogens evade interferon-stimulated genes in their definitive host is poorly understood. Various Chlamydia species can inhibit death of their host cells and may have evolved this strategy to evade prodeath signals elicited by host immune responses. We present evidence that chlamydia-induced programmed cell death resistance evolved to counter interferon- and immune-mediated killing of Chlamydia-infected cells.",JC Polyomavirus Uses Extracellular Vesicles To Infect Target Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967463,mBio,2019 06 10,"The endemic human JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immune-suppressed patients. The mechanisms of virus infection in vivo are not understood because the major target cells for virus in the brain do not express virus receptors and do not bind virus. We found that JCPyV associates with extracellular vesicles (EVs) and can infect target cells independently of virus receptors. Virus particles were found packaged inside extracellular vesicles and attached to the outer side of vesicles. Anti-JCPyV antisera reduced infection by purified virus but had no effect on infection by EV-associated virus. Treatment of cells with the receptor-destroying enzyme neuraminidase inhibited infection with purified virus but did not inhibit infection by EV-associated virus. Mutant pseudoviruses defective in sialic acid receptor binding could not transduce cells as purified pseudovirions but could do so when associated with EVs. This alternative mechanism of infection likely plays a critical role in the dissemination and spread of JCPyV both to and within the central nervous system.IMPORTANCE JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a severe and often fatal neurodegenerative disease in immunocompromised or immunomodulated patients. The mechanisms responsible for initiating infection in susceptible cells are not completely known. The major attachment receptor for the virus, lactoseries tetrasaccharide c (LSTc), is paradoxically not expressed on oligodendrocytes or astrocytes in human brain, and virus does not bind to these cells. Because these are the major cell types targeted by the virus in the brain, we hypothesized that alternative mechanisms of infection must be responsible. Here we provide evidence that JCPyV is packaged in extracellular vesicles from infected cells. Infection of target cells by vesicle-associated virus is not dependent on LSTc and is not neutralized by antisera directed against the virus. This is the first demonstration of a polyomavirus using extracellular vesicles as a means of transmission.",Red- and Blue-Light Sensing in the Plant Pathogen Alternaria alternata Depends on Phytochrome and the White-Collar Protein LreA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967462,mBio,2019 05 01,"The filamentous fungus Alternaria alternata is a common postharvest contaminant of food and feed, and some strains are plant pathogens. Many processes in A. alternata are triggered by light. Interestingly, blue light inhibits sporulation, and red light reverses the effect, suggesting interactions between light-sensing systems. The genome encodes a phytochrome (FphA), a white collar 1 (WC-1) orthologue (LreA), an opsin (NopA), and a cryptochrome (CryA) as putative photoreceptors. Here, we investigated the role of FphA and LreA and the interplay with the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We created loss-of function mutations for fphA, lreA, and hogA using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Sporulation was reduced in all three mutant strains already in the dark, suggesting functions of the photoreceptors FphA and LreA independent of light perception. Germination of conidia was delayed in red, blue, green, and far-red light. We found that light induction of ccgA (clock-controlled gene in Neurospora crassa and light-induced gene in Aspergillus nidulans) and the catalase gene catA depended on FphA, LreA, and HogA. Light induction of ferA (a putative ferrochelatase gene) and bliC (bli-3, light regulated, unknown function) required LreA and HogA but not FphA. Blue- and green-light stimulation of alternariol formation depended on LreA. A lack of FphA or LreA led to enhanced resistance toward oxidative stress due to the upregulation of catalases and superoxide dismutases. Light activation of FphA resulted in increased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of HogA. Our results show that germination, sporulation, and secondary metabolism are light regulated in A. alternata with distinct and overlapping roles of blue- and red-light photosensors.IMPORTANCE Light controls many processes in filamentous fungi. The study of light regulation in a number of model organisms revealed an unexpected complexity. Although the molecular components for light sensing appear to be widely conserved in fungal genomes, the regulatory circuits and the sensitivity of certain species toward specific wavelengths seem different. In N. crassa, most light responses are triggered by blue light, whereas in A. nidulans, red light plays a dominant role. In Alternaria alternata, both blue and red light appear to be important. In A. alternata, photoreceptors control morphogenetic pathways, the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species, and the production of secondary metabolites. On the other hand, high-osmolarity sensing required FphA and LreA, indicating a sophisticated cross talk between light and stress signaling."

Traditionally, these binding sites are thought to be accessible to endogenous ligands from the aqueous phase. Recent advances in structural biology of GPCRs, along with biophysical and computational studies suggest that amphiphilic and lipophilic molecules may gain access to these receptors by first partitioning into the membrane and then reaching via lateral diffusion through the lipid bilayer. In addition, several crystal structures of class A and class B GPCRs bound to their ligands offer unprecedented details on the existence of lipid-facing allosteric binding sites outside the transmembrane helices that can be reached only via lipid pathways. The highly ordered structure of the lipid bilayer may guide lipophilic or amphiphilic drug molecule to a specific depth within the bilayer, affecting its local concentration near the binding site, and influencing its binding kinetics. Additionally, the constraints of the lipid bilayer including its composition and biophysical properties might play a critical role in ""pre-organizing"" ligand molecules in apposite orientation and conformation to facilitate receptor binding. Despite its conspicuous involvement in molecular recognition processes, the critical role of membrane in ligand-binding mechanism to lipid-exposed transmembrane binding sites remains poorly understood, and warrants comprehensive investigation. The knowledge of mechanistic understanding of structure-membrane interactions relationship of drugs will not only provide useful insights to receptor binding kinetics, but also enhance our ability to take advantage of the apparent membrane contributions in rational design of drugs targeting transmembrane proteins with improved efficacy and safety. In this minireview, we summarize recent structural and computational studies in this direction, elucidating lipid pathways of ligand access and binding mechanisms for several orthosteric and allosteric ligands of class A and class B GPCRs.",Inhaled Iloprost Versus Epoprostenol in Heart Transplant Recipients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967439,Respiratory care,2019 04 10,"Acute right ventricular dysfunction is a challenging problem in the immediate postoperative period following orthotopic heart transplantation.

The axon initial segment (AIS) separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment and controls the microtubule dependent transport into the axon. Interestingly, the AIS has a characteristic microtubule organization; it contains bundles of closely spaced microtubules with electron dense cross-bridges, referred to as microtubule fascicles. The microtubule binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS and when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells forms microtubule arrays that closely resemble AIS fascicles in neurons. However, the precise role of TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation in neurons has not been studied. Here we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study AIS microtubule organization. We show that in cultured rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes, TRIM46 levels steadily increase at the AIS during early neuronal differentiation and at the same time closely spaced microtubules form, whereas the fasciculated microtubules appear at later developmental stages. Moreover, we localized TRIM46 to the electron dense cross-bridges and show that depletion of TRIM46 causes loss of cross-bridges and increased microtubule spacing. These data indicate that TRIM46 has an essential role in organizing microtubule fascicles in the AIS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region at the proximal axon where the action potential is initiated. In addition the AIS separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment, where it controls protein transport to establish and maintain neuron polarity. Cargo vesicles destined for the axon recognize specialized microtubule tracks that enter the AIS. Interestingly the microtubules entering the AIS form crosslinked bundles, called microtubule fascicules. Recently we found that the microtubule binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS, where it may organize the AIS microtubules. In the present study we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study the AIS microtubules during neuron development and identified an essential role for TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation."

Bitter compounds regulate gut hormone secretion and gastrointestinal motility through bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) located in the taste buds on the tongue and in the enteroendocrine cells. Gastric accommodation (GA) is an important physiologic function. However, the role of TAS2R agonists in regulating GA remains unclear. To clarify whether GA is influenced by bitter stimulants, we examined the effect of TAS2R agonist denatonium benzoate (DB), administered intraorally and intragastrically, by measuring the consequent intrabag pressure in the proximal stomach of guinea pigs. Effects of the Kampo medicine rikkunshito (RKT) and its bitter components liquiritigenin and naringenin on GA were also examined. Intraoral DB (0.2 nmol/ml) administration enhanced GA. Intragastric DB administration (0.1 and 1 nmol/kg) promoted GA, whereas higher DB doses (30 μmol/kg) inhibited it. Similar changes in GA were observed with intragastric (1000 mg/kg) and intraoral (200 mg/ml) RKT administration. Liquiritigenin and naringenin also promoted GA. These findings suggest that GA is affected by the stimulation of TAS2Rs in the oral cavity or gut in guinea pigs.",Smart Drug Release from Medical Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967402,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 04 10,"Medical devices are becoming key players on health monitoring and treatment. Advances in materials science and electronics have paved the way to the design of advanced wearable, insertable and implantable medical devices suitable for the prevention and cure of diseases and the physical or functional replacement of damaged tissues or organs. However, intimate and prolonged contact of the medical devices with the human body increases the risks of adverse foreign-body reactions and biofilm formation. Drugs can be included in/on the medical device not only to minimize the risks but also to improve the therapeutic outcomes. Drug-eluting medical devices can deliver the drug in the place where it is needed using lower doses and avoiding systemic effects. Drug-device combination products that release the drug following pre-stablished rates have already demonstrated their clinical relevance. The aim of this mini-review is to bring attention to medical devices that can actively regulate drug release as a function of tiny changes in their environment, caused by the pathology itself, microorganisms adhesion or some external events. Thus, endowing medical devices with stimuli-responsiveness should allow for precise, on-demand regulated release of the ancillary drugs to expand the therapeutic performance of the medical device and also should serve as a first step to offer personalized solutions to each patient. Main sections deal with smart drug-eluting medical devices that are sensitive to infection-related stimuli, natural healing processes, mechanical forces, electric fields, ultrasound, near-infrared radiation, or chemicals such as vitamin C.","Sexual dimorphism, estrous cycle and laterality determine the intrinsic and synaptic properties of medial amygdala neurons in rat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967401,Journal of cell science,2019 05 08,"The posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) is a sex steroid-sensitive area that modulates different social behavior by relaying chemosensorial information to hypothalamic nuclei. However, little is known about MePD cell type diversity and functional connectivity. Here, we have characterized neurons and synaptic inputs in the right and left MePD of adult male and cycling female (in diestrus, proestrus or estrus) rats. Based on their electrophysiological properties and morphology, we found two coexisting subpopulations of spiny neurons that are sexually dimorphic. They were classified as Class I (predominantly bitufted-shaped neurons showing irregular spikes with frequency adaptation) or Class II (predominantly stellate-shaped neurons showing full spike frequency adaptation). Furthermore, excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto MePD cells were modulated by sex, estrous cycle and hemispheric lateralization. In the left MePD, there was an overall increase in the excitatory input to neurons of males compared to cycling females. However, in proestrus, the MePD neurons received mainly inhibitory inputs. Our findings indicate the existence of hemispheric lateralization, estrous cycle and sexual dimorphism influences at cellular and synaptic levels in the adult rat MePD."

RBPs are increasingly appreciated as being essential for normal hematopoiesis, and they are understood to play fundamental roles in hematological malignancies by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Alternative splicing has been shown to play roles in the development of specific hematopoietic lineages, and sequence-specific mutations in RBPs lead to dysregulated splicing in myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. RBPs that regulate translation contribute to the development and function of hematological lineages, act as nodes for the action of multiple signaling pathways, and contribute to hematological malignancies.

However, we analyzed only 3 patients. Herein, we conducted a retrospective study including lung tissue samples from 24 patients with pulmonary LCDD (pLCDD) matched with samples from 13 patients with pulmonary AL kappa amyloidosis used as controls. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics identified immunoglobulin kappa peptides as the main protein component of the tissue deposits in all patients. Interestingly, in pLCDD, IGKV1 was the most common kappa family detected (86.4%) and, IGKV1-8 was overrepresented compared with pulmonary AL kappa amyloidosis (75% vs 11.1%, p=0.0033). Furthermore, IGKV1-8 was predominantly associated with a diffuse cystic pattern (94%) in pLCDD.

After the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016, vaccine development efforts based on different platforms were initiated. Several candidates have since been evaluated in clinical phase I studies. Of these, a Zika purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV), adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), yielded high seroconversion rates. Sanofi Pasteur further optimized the vaccine in terms of production scale, purification conditions and regulatory compliance, using its experience in flavivirus vaccine development. Here we report that the resulting optimized vaccine (ZPIV-SP) elicited robust seroneutralizing antibody responses and provided complete protection from homologous Zika virus strain challenge in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. ZPIV-SP also showed improved immunogenicity compared with the first-generation vaccine, and improved efficacy in the more permissive interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Finally, analysis of the IgG response directed towards nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) suggests that viral NS1 was efficiently removed during the optimized purification process of ZPIV-SP. Together, these results suggest that the optimized vaccine is well suited for further evaluation in larger animal models and late-stage clinical studies.","Pertussis vaccine effectiveness in a frequency matched population-based case-control Canadian Immunization Research Network study in Ontario, Canada 2009-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967309,Vaccine,2019 04 17,"Resurgences of pertussis have occurred in several high-income countries, often linked to waning of immunity from acellular pertussis vaccines.

In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) seems to provide a protective anti-inflammatory response. Due to the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these diseases, we have masked ERβ ligands, including diarylpropionitrile (DPN), as boronate esters that release the active estrogen in the presence of H2O2. Here we demonstrate their synthesis, decreased binding affinities, kinetics of release, and selectivity toward ROS. The most promising ligand can be unmasked in the presence of pathological H2O2 to modulate ERβ transcription in cells.","Kinase inhibitions in pyrido[4,3-h] and [3,4-g]quinazolines: Synthesis, SAR and molecular modeling studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967303,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 04 21,"New pyrido[3,4-g]quinazoline derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their inhibitory potency toward 5 protein kinases (CLK1, DYRK1A, GSK3, CDK5, CK1).

We conducted a single-site, cross-sectional study of 78 adults with congenital heart disease followed at Washington University School of Medicine. Data considered in the analyses included retrospectively obtained clinical information and patients' self-assessed psychosocial functioning and health status. To identify the clinical and psychosocial variables associated with depression, we built a stepwise multivariate model to measure the relative contribution of these variables to depression status. The prevalence of depression in our sample was 26%. Our model accounted for approximately 67% of the variability in depression scores. The final model consisted of the Cardiac Denial of Impact Scale, expectations domain of Barriers to Care, and the energy and social domains of the Rand 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Clinical variables did not predict variability in depression scores. In conclusion, greater cardiac denial and negative expectations of the healthcare team were associated with increased depression symptoms in ACHD.",Relation Between Cigarette Smoking and Heart Failure (from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967285,The American journal of cardiology,2019 06 10,"We studied the association between cigarette smoking and incident heart failure (HF) in a racially diverse US cohort. We included 6,792 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with information on cigarette smoking at baseline, characterized by status, intensity, burden, and time since quitting. Adjudicated outcomes included total incident HF cases and HF stratified by ejection fraction (EF) into HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; EF ≤ 40%) and preserved EF (HFpEF; EF ≥ 50%). We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and accounted for competing risk of each HF type. Mean age was 62 ± 10 years; 53% were women, 61% were nonwhite, and 13% were current smokers. A total of 279 incident HF cases occurred over a median follow-up of 12.2 years. The incidence rates of HFrEF and HFpEF were 2.2 and 1.9 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively. Current smoking was associated with higher risk of HF compared with never smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 3.09); this was similar for HFrEF (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.27 to 5.25) and HFpEF (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.15 to 5.49).

Race-related dissimilarities have been identified in cardiovascular patients in terms of age of presentation, co-morbidities, socioeconomic status, and treatment approach as well as genetically driven race-related disparities in responsiveness to medications. Antiplatelet therapy represents a fundamental component of therapy in cardiovascular patients, especially in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. It has been argued that the different level of platelet reactivity and varying response to antiplatelet therapy among races may account in part for worse outcomes in certain populations. The purpose of this review is to describe genotypic and phenotypic race-related differences in platelet reactivity and responsiveness to cardiovascular treatment, focusing on antiplatelet therapy to highlight the need establish a more effective and targeted antithrombotic strategy.",Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Cardiogenic Shock Utilizing Hemodialysis for Acute Kidney Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967283,The American journal of cardiology,2019 05 12,"In the setting of cardiogenic shock (CS), impaired biventricular function can cause acute decrease in renal function via reduced renal perfusion and increased renal venous pressure. We sought to analyze the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with CS who utilized renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) for acute kidney injury (AKI-HD). We utilized data from the National Inpatient Sample to calculate national rates of in-hospital mortality, use of temporary mechanical support, vascular injury requiring surgery, length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization cost from 2010 to September 2015. We compared the in-hospital outcomes between CS with AKI-HD and a propensity score-matched group without AKI-HD. We identified 6,076 hospitalizations (weighted n = 24,272) with CS and AKI-HD and 76,878 (weighted n = 378,553) with CS not AKI-HD. Among these cases 48.1% (n = 39,403, weighted n = 193,746) had ST elevation myocardial infarction as the cause of CS. Patients with CS and AKI-HD had higher comorbidity burden and they were also more likely to receive mechanical circulatory support device (absolute standardized difference >10% for all comparisons) compared with CS patients without AKI-HD. After matching 4,457 cases for patient-level and hospital-level characteristics, CS with AKI-HD was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality (75.74% vs 51.58%, p <0.001), use of temporary mechanical support (24.0% vs 19.3%, p <0.001), LOS (21.4 vs14.4 days, p <0.001) and cost ($80,406 vs $52,833, p <0.0001).

However, its precise immunological mechanism is not fully understood. To investigate this, diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were established by feeding C57BL/6 male mice a high-fat diet for 16 weeks. DIO and lean control mice were infected intranasally with 3000 pfu of influenza A virus (IAV) (PR8/H1N1). Interestingly, we found adipose tissue located along the bronchus in naïve DIO mice. In addition, the Nos2 level was significantly higher and Arg1 level was significantly lower in lung macrophages of naïve DIO mice, consistent with an M1-skewed phenotype. The survival rate and body weight of DIO mice infected with IAV were significantly lower than those of lean control mice and associated with higher viral load in the lungs of DIO mice. Histopathological analysis demonstrated higher numbers of inflammatory cells in the lungs of DIO mice after IAV infection. Levels of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β), in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were altered after IAV infection; in particular, IFN-α and IFN-β levels were significantly suppressed in the BALF of DIO mice. In vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with ligands of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8, a pattern recognition receptor for single-stranded RNA, and levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were similarly altered. In addition, levels of IFN-α and IFN-β were significantly lower in culture supernatants of alveolar macrophages sorted from naïve DIO mice and infected with IAV, compared to those in macrophages sorted from lean control mice. Collectively, these results suggest that macrophages may be the main contributors to poor outcomes of influenza virus infection in obesity.",Bacterial β-glucuronidase alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice: A possible crucial new diagnostic and therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967260,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 27,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are devastating diseases of the gut.

Based on the observation that PACT is specifically expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) at the mid-neurogenic period, we examine the role of PACT in this embryonic neural stem cell niche. Here, we provide the first evidence that PACT increases neurosphere formation, as well as expression of Notch target genes and the neural stem cell marker Sox2 in primary neural stem cells in vitro. Consistently, introduction of PACT into the mouse embryonic brain in utero increased the fraction of cells localizing to the VZ. We also show that the PACT-enhanced stemness of neural stem cells is PKR-independent. At the molecular level, PACT was revealed to physically interact with C promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1) and dramatically strengthen the association between CBF1 and Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which indicates stabilization of the Notch transcriptional coactivation complex responsible for Notch target gene expression. Taken together, our study indicates that PACT is a novel transcriptional coactivator of the Notch pathway playing a pivotal role during mammalian brain development.",Antibodies against H1N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin cross-react with prohibitin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967257,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 27,"Influenza virus infection is associated with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), but its pathogenesis remains unclear.

We immunoprecipitated islet protein with this cross-reactive antibody and identified the bound antigen as prohibitin by mass spectrometry. We then expressed the prohibitin protein in bacteria and confirmed the antibody binding to prohibitin by Western blot. We also verified the cross-reactivity of the antibody by prohibitin-siRNA transfection in islet beta cells. We conclude that prohibitin is an autoantigen that cross-reacts with influenza virus HA.

Altered functional demands can also shift the passive force-length relationship. The extent that passive mechanical properties differ within a muscle group (e.g. spine extensors) or between homologous muscles of different species is unknown. It was hypothesized that multifidus, believed to specialize in spine stabilization, would generate greater passive tensile stresses under isometric conditions than erector spinae, which have more generalized functions of moving and stabilizing the spine; observing greater multifidus moduli in different species would strengthen this hypothesis. Permeabilized fibre bundles (n = 337) from the multifidus and erector spinae of mice, rats, and rabbits were mechanically tested. A novel logistic function was fit to the experimental data to fully characterize passive stress and modulus. Species had the greatest effect on passive muscle parameters with mice having the largest moduli at all lengths. Rats generated less passive stress than rabbits due to a shift of the passive force-length relationship towards longer muscle lengths. Rat multifidus generated slightly greater stresses than erector spinae, but no differences were observed between mouse muscles. The secondary objective was to determine the parameters required to simulate the passive force-length relationship. Experimental data were compared to the passive muscle model in OpenSim. The default OpenSim model, optimized for hindlimb muscles, did not fit any of the spine muscles tested; however, the model could accurately simulate experimental data after adjusting the input parameters. The optimal parameters for modelling the passive force-length relationships of spine muscles in OpenSim are presented.",Reliability and Validity of the Newton Screen for Alcohol and Cannabis Misuse in a Pediatric Emergency Department Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967250,The Journal of pediatrics,2019 04 21,"To determine the test-retest reliability, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity of a recently devised screen (the Newton screen) for alcohol and cannabis use/misuse, and its predictive validity at follow-up.",Factors Associated with Successful First High-Risk Infant Clinic Visit for Very Low Birth Weight Infants in California.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967249,The Journal of pediatrics,2019 04 10,"To determine rates of at least 1 high-risk infant follow-up (HRIF) visit by 12 months corrected age, and factors associated with successful first visit among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in a statewide population-based setting."

Current analytical methods for veterinary drug residue screening involve lengthy sample preparation, extraction, and instrumental analysis steps. This method identifies veterinary drug residues in several different incurred animal tissues more quickly than conventional analytical methods. This LMJSSP-MS method uses an ambient ionization technology called liquid microjunction surface sampling probe along with a data dependent scan function of a quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer. Collected product ion spectra are searched against the mzCloud™ online mass spectral database to identify veterinary drug residues found in incurred animal tissue samples. Examples of veterinary drugs identified with this method include flunixin, tilmicosin, pentobarbital, xylazine, and ketamine. Optimization of method parameters is described and discussed. The limit of identification (LOI) of this method is estimated to be approximately 1 μg g-1 for xylazine and ketamine.",Sensitive and anti-interference stripping voltammetry analysis of Pb(II) in water using flower-like MoS2/rGO composite with ultra-thin nanosheets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967187,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"Herein, combined with the outstanding adsorption ability of flower-like MoS2 with ultra-thin nanosheets and the good electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), a sensitive and anti-interference electrochemical sensing interface for the analysis of Pb(II) was constructed by using MoS2/rGO nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (MoS2/rGO-GCE). The stripping behavior of Pb(II) was estimated using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), a high sensitivity of 50.80 μA μM-1 was achieved, and the limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.005 μM (3σ method). The reasons for the excellent electrochemical performance of MoS2/rGO-GCE toward Pb(II) is that the excellent adsorption capacity and electrical conductivity, and the redox reaction of Pb(II) occurs directly on the surface of the MoS2/rGO nanocomposite. Moreover, series interference experiments were systematically conducted, the sensitivity of Pb(II) has no obvious change in the presence of other coexist heavy metal ions. In addition, an intriguing interference phenomenon between Pb(II) and Cu(II) was found. When Cu(II) exists in the solution, two stripping peaks of Pb(II) were observed, this phenomenon can be explained that the form of PbCu alloy or intermetallic compounds during the preconcentration process. Further experiments indicated that the proposed method has good stability and reproducibility. Finally, the accurate detection result of Pb(II) in wastewater sample gathered from Wangxiaoying wastewater treatment plant were obtained.",Short-chain oligonucleotide detection by glass nanopore using targeting-induced DNA tetrahedron deformation as signal amplifier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967186,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"Glass capillary nanopore has been developed as a promising sensing platform for bioassay with single-molecule resolution. Although the diameter of glass capillary nanopore can be easily tuned, direct event-readouts of small biomacromolecules, like short-chain oligonucleotide fragments (within ∼20 nucleotides) remain great challenge, which limited by the configuration of the conical-shaped nanopore and the instrumental temporal resolution. Here, we exploit a smart strategy for glass nanopore detection of short-chain oligonucleotides by using relatively big-sized tetrahedral DNA nanostructures as a signal amplifier, which can amplify the signals and retard the translocation speed meanwhile. The tetrahedral DNA nanostructure with a hairpin loop sequence in one edge, undergoes a shape transformation upon the complementary combination of the target oligonucleotides, in which the presence of short-chain target oligonucleotide can be readout due to obvious variation in amplitude of ion current pulse that caused by volume change of the DNA tetrahedral. Therefore, this strategy is promising for extending glass nanopore sensing platform for sensitive detection of short-chain oligonucleotides.",Uncertainty estimation and misclassification probability for classification models based on discriminant analysis and support vector machines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967184,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"Uncertainty estimation provides a quantitative value of the predictive performance of a classification model based on its misclassification probability. Low misclassification probabilities are associated with a low degree of uncertainty, indicating high trustworthiness; while high misclassification probabilities are associated with a high degree of uncertainty, indicating a high susceptibility to generate incorrect classification. Herein, misclassification probability estimations based on uncertainty estimation by bootstrap were developed for classification models using discriminant analysis [linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)] and support vector machines (SVM). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as variable reduction technique prior classification. Four spectral datasets were tested (1 simulated and 3 real applications) for binary and ternary classifications. Models with lower misclassification probabilities were more stable when the spectra were perturbed with white Gaussian noise, indicating better robustness. Thus, misclassification probability can be used as an additional figure of merit to assess model robustness, providing a reliable metric to evaluate the predictive performance of a classifier.",Staring at protein-surfactant interactions: Fundamental approaches and comparative evaluation of their combinations - A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967183,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"Protein-surfactant interactions have been explored for decades owing to their widespread application in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries and their importance to biochemical systems. However, they require further study owing to their compositional complexity and the innate limitations of current analytical approaches. In this review, we briefly introduce a series of individual approaches used for the qualitative and quantitative investigation of protein-surfactant interactions, including absorbance- or emission-based spectroscopy, scattering-based spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, calorimetry, computation and microscopy. More importantly, we then compare and evaluate various combinations of these approaches and provide comprehensive critical assessments and comments regarding their application to the advanced study of protein-surfactant interactions at the molecular level.",Isoelectric focusing array with immobilized pH gradient and dynamic scanning imaging for diabetes diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967182,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"A traditional immobilized pH gradient (IPG) has a high stability for isoelectric focusing (IEF) but suffers from time-consuming rehydration, focusing and staining-imaging as well as complex performance. To address these issues, an IEF system with an array of 24 IPG columns (10 mm × 600 μm × 50 μm) and dynamic scanning imaging (DSI) was firstly designed for protein focusing. Moreover, two IPG columns (pH 4-9 and pH 6.7-7.7 of 10 mm in length) were firstly synthesized for IEF. A series of experiments were carried out based on the IEF array. In contrast to a traditional IPG IEF with more than 10 h rehydration, 5-14 h IEF and ca 10 h stain-imaging, the IEF array had the following merits: 25 min rehydration for sample loading, 4 min IEF, and 2 min dynamics scanning of 24 columns, well addressing the issues of traditional IEF. Furthermore, the IEF array had fair sensitivity (LOD of 60 ng), good recovery (95%), and high stability (1.02% RSD for intra-day and 2.16% for inter-day). Finally, the developed array was successfully used for separation and determination of HbA1c (a key biomarker for diabetes diagnosis) in blood samples. All these results indicated the applicability of the developed IEF array to diabetes diagnosis.",Sub-1 mL sample requirement for simultaneous determination of 17 organic and inorganic anions and cations in Antarctic ice core samples by dual capillary ion chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967181,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"The significant advance of delivering high value multi-species data from sub-1 mL ice core sample volumes allows higher temporal resolution in deposition records of inorganic and low molecular weight organic anions and cations. The determination of these species is a fundamental strategic requirement in modern paleoclimate studies. Herein, for the first time, a dual capillary ion chromatography (Cap-IC) based method for the simultaneous separation of 17 organic and inorganic anions and cations in low volume Antarctic ice core samples is presented. The total amount of sample required for direct injection has been reduced to 190 μL, which is 35 times lower than the amount of sample required by standard ion chromatography methods. A dual Cap-IC system configured for the simultaneous determination of cations and anions was used throughout. A range of chromatographic parameters was optimised for both anion and cation systems to obtain baseline separations of all target analytes in a suitable run time and to minimise the amount of sample required. Baseline separation of matrix and trace 'marker' ions were achieved in less than 35 min, after injecting only 40 μL of sample in each IC system. Limits of detection (LODs) for all analytes determined were within a range similar to that achieved by previously published standard bore IC-based methods. Intra- and inter-day repeatability were evaluated, with both parameters being typically below 3% for peak area. In further validation of the method, a comparative analysis of a set of 420 ice core samples from Aurora Basin North site, Antarctica, previously analysed by standard IC, established that the proposed low sample volume technique was applicable as a routine measurement approach in ice core analysis projects.",Single drop microextraction in a 96-well plate format: A step toward automated and high-throughput analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967180,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"In this study, an innovative and high-throughput parallel-single-drop microextraction (Pa-SDME) using the [P6,6,6,14+]2[MnCl42-] magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) as extraction phase is demonstrated, for the first time, in the determination of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, bisphenol A, butylparaben, benzophenone and triclocarban from environmental aqueous samples. This experimental setup comprised of a 96-well plate system containing a set of magnetic pins which aided in stabilizing the MIL drops and enabled the simultaneous extraction of up to 96 samples. Using this low-cost experimental apparatus, the sample throughput was lower than 1 min per sample. This novel approach exhibits a number of advantages over classical SDME approaches, particularly in maintaining a stable solvent microdrop and facilitating high-throughput analysis. Experimental conditions were carefully optimized using one-factor-at-a-time and multivariate designs. The optimal conditions employed 5.38 ± 0.55 mg (n = 10) of MIL, a sample volume of 1.5 mL at pH 6, and dilution in 20 μL of acetonitrile. The analytical parameters of merit were determined under the optimized conditions and highly satisfactory results were achieved, with LODs ranging from 1.5 to 3 μg L-1 and coefficients of determination higher than 0.994.

Accurate and sensitive detection of miRNA is crucially significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, a MnO2 nanosheet-mediated ratiometric fluorescence biosensor was designed for miRNA detection and imaging in living cells. It contained MnO2 nanosheets acting as DNA carrier, and fluorescent donor (FAM)-labeled hairpin H1 (recognition probe) and fluorescent acceptor (TAMRA)-labeled hairpin H2 (amplification probe). When the biosensor entered cell by endocytosis, MnO2 nanosheets were degraded to Mn2+ via intracellular glutathione (GSH) and the adsorbed hairpins H1 and H2 were released. The intracellular target miRNA-21 hybridized with the recognition unit of H1 to initiate catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and a large amount of H1-H2 duplexes were produced. This brought fluorescent donor FAM and fluorescent acceptor TAMRA into close proximity to produce fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), inducing a ratiometric fluorescent response (donor signal decreased and acceptor signal enhanced) for miRNA-21 detection. Furthermore, this method could be applied to differentiate the expression levels of miRNA-21 in HeLa, HepG-2 and L02 cells. These results indicated that the proposed method possessed great potential in the early diagnosis of miRNA-related diseases.",Carbon dots synthesized at room temperature for detection of tetracycline hydrochloride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967178,Analytica chimica acta,2019 04 10,"The traditional synthesis methods of carbon dots (CDs) have some disadvantages of complicated operation and a large amount of energy consumption. To address these limitations, we synthesized yellow-green luminescent CDs at room temperature according to the principle of amine-aldehyde condensation in this work. This reaction is simple, economical, energy saving and is extremely consistent with the concept of green synthesis and sustainable development. In addition, studies have found that tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) can quench the fluorescence of the as-prepared CDs through Inner filter effect (IFE). The changes of the fluorescence intensity also have a good linear relationship with the concentration of TC in the range of 10.0-400.0 μM, and the detection limit is 6.0 μM. This method has been successfully used to determine the tetracycline content of tetracycline tablets. Finally, the interaction mechanism between TC and CDs was analyzed and discussed."

For example, children must learn the logical semantics of the scalar quantifier some and its pragmatically enriched meaning: 'some but not all'. Some studies have shown that 'scalar implicature' - that some implies 'some but not all' - poses a challenge even to nine-year-olds, while others find success by age three. We asked whether reports of children's successes might be due to the computation of exclusion inferences (like contrast or mutual exclusivity) rather than scalar implicatures. We found that young children (N = 214; ages 4;0-7;11) sometimes compute symmetrical exclusion inferences rather than asymmetric scalar inferences. These data suggest that a stronger burden of evidence is required in studies of implicature; before concluding that children compute implicatures, researchers should first show that children exhibit sensitivity to asymmetric entailment in the task.",Human papillomavirus 16 and p16 positive nasal cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in immunocompetent men in their twenties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967163,The Journal of laryngology and otology,2019 05 16,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is usually associated with long-term ultraviolet light exposure.

Diagnostic emphasis has shifted from the morphology of a tumor under the microscope to an integrated approach based on morphologic and molecular features, including gene mutations, chromosomal copy number alterations, and gene rearrangements. In 2016, the World Health Organization provided guidelines for making an integrated diagnosis that incorporates both morphologic and molecular features in a subset of brain tumors. The integrated diagnosis now applies to infiltrating gliomas, a category that includes diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma grades II, III, and IV, and oligodendroglioma, grades II and III, thereby encompassing the most common primary intra-axial central nervous system tumors. Other neoplasms such as medulloblastoma, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes, certain supratentorial ependymomas, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor are also eligible for integrated diagnosis, which can sometimes be aided by characteristic immunohistochemical markers. Since 2016, advances in molecular neuro-oncology have resulted in periodic updates and clarifications to the integrated diagnostic approach. These advances reflect expanding knowledge on the molecular pathology of brain tumors, but raise a challenge in rapidly incorporating new molecular findings into diagnostic practice. This review provides a background on the molecular characteristics of primary brain tumors, emphasizing the molecular basis for classification of infiltrating gliomas, the most common entities that are eligible for an integrated diagnosis. We then discuss entities within the diffuse gliomas that do not receive an integrated diagnosis by WHO 2016 criteria, but have distinctive molecular features that are important to recognize because their clinical behavior can influence clinical management and prognosis. Particular attention is given to the histone H3 G34R/G34V mutant astrocytomas, an entity to consider when faced with an infiltrating glioma in the cerebral hemisphere of children and young adults, and to the group of histologically lower grade diffuse astrocytic gliomas with molecular features of glioblastoma, an important category of tumors to recognize due to their aggressive clinical behavior.",The role of microglia in viral encephalitis: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967139,Journal of neuroinflammation,2019 04 21,"Viral encephalitis is still very prominent around the world, and traditional antiviral therapies still have shortcomings. Some patients cannot get effective relief or suffer from serious sequelae. At present, people are studying the role of the innate immune system in viral encephalitis. Microglia, as resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS), can respond quickly to various CNS injuries including trauma, ischemia, and infection and maintain the homeostasis of CNS, but this response is not always good; sometimes, it will exacerbate damage. Studies have shown that microglia also act as a double-edged sword during viral encephalitis. On the one hand, microglia can sense ATP signals through the purinergic receptor P2Y12 and are recruited around infected neurons to exert phagocytic activity. Microglia can exert a direct antiviral effect by producing type 1 interferon (IFN-1) to induce IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression of themselves or indirect antiviral effects by IFN-1 acting on other cells to activate corresponding signaling pathways. In addition, microglia can also exert an antiviral effect by inducing autophagy or secreting cytokines. On the other hand, microglia mediate presynaptic membrane damage in the hippocampus through complement, resulting in long-term memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in patients with encephalitis. Microglia mediate fetal congenital malformations caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The gene expression profile of microglia in HIV encephalitis changes, and they tend to be a pro-inflammatory type. Microglia inhibited neuronal autophagy and aggravated the damage of CNS in HIV encephalitis; E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino (pelia) expressed by microglia promotes the replication of virus in neurons. The interaction between amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) produced by neurons and activated microglia during viral infection is uncertain. Although neurons can mediate antiviral effects by activating receptor-interacting protein kinases 3 (RIPK3) in a death-independent pathway, the RIPK3 pathway of microglia is unknown. Different brain regions have different susceptibility to viruses, and the gene expression of microglia in different brain regions is specific. The relationship between the two needs to be further confirmed. How to properly regulate the function of microglia and make it exert more anti-inflammatory effects is our next research direction.",The CIMP-high phenotype is associated with energy metabolism alterations in colon adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967137,BMC medical genetics,2019 04 21,"CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is found in 15-20% of malignant colorectal tumors and is characterized by strong CpG hypermethylation over the genome. The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not still fully understood.

Certain antipsychotic drugs, e.g. risperidone, are more likely to induce HPRL because of relative accumulation within the adenohypophysis. Nevertheless, due to competition for pituitary DRD2s by high dopamine levels may limit antipsychotic-induced HPRL.

Social and genetic mating systems of avian brood parasites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967092,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Classic evolutionary theory predicts that monogamy should be intimately linked with parental care. It has long been assumed, therefore, that avian brood parasites-which lay their eggs in the nests of 'host' species and provide little, if any, parental care-should be overwhelmingly promiscuous. However, recent studies have revealed that the social mating systems of brood parasites are surprisingly diverse, encompassing lek polygyny, monogamy, polygamy and promiscuity. What ecological or phylogenetic factors explain this variation, and why are some brood parasites apparently monogamous? Here we review the social and genetic mating systems of all 75 brood parasitic species for which data are available and evaluate several hypotheses that may help explain these patterns. We find that social monogamy is widespread, often co-occurring with territoriality and cooperative behaviour by the mated pair. Comparative studies, though preliminary, suggest that in some species, monogamy is associated with low host density and polygamy with higher host density. Interestingly, molecular data show that genetic and social mating systems can be entirely decoupled: genetic monogamy can occur in parasitic species that lack behavioural pair-bonds, possibly as a by-product of territoriality; conversely, social monogamy has been reported in parasites that are genetically polygamous. This synthesis suggests that social and genetic monogamy may result from very different selective pressures, and that male-female cooperative behaviours, population density and territoriality may all interact to favour the evolution of monogamous mating in brood parasites. Given that detailed descriptive data of social, and especially genetic, mating systems are still lacking for the majority of brood parasitic species, definitive tests of these hypotheses await future work.

Despite the long history of study, we are still far from understanding how insect societies have evolved and how social cohesion in their colonies is maintained. Here we suggest inquiline social parasites of insect societies as an under-exploited experimental tool for understanding sociality. We draw on examples from obligate inquiline (permanent) social parasites in wasps, ants and bees to illustrate how these parasites may allow us to better understand societies and learn more about the evolution and functioning of insect societies. We highlight three main features of these social parasite-host systems-namely, close phylogenetic relationships, strong selective pressures arising from coevolution and multiple independent origins-that make inquiline social parasites particularly suited for this aim; we propose a conceptual comparative framework that considers trait losses, gains and modifications in social parasite-host systems. We give examples of how this framework can reveal the more elusive secrets of sociality by focusing on two cornerstones of sociality: communication and reproductive division of labour. Together with social parasites in other taxonomic groups, such as cuckoos in birds, social parasitism has a great potential to reveal the mechanisms and evolution of complex social groups.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Parasitic interactions are so ubiquitous that all multicellular organisms have evolved a system of defences to reduce their costs, whether the parasites they encounter are the classic parasites which feed on the individual, or brood parasites which usurp parental care. Many parallels have been drawn between defences deployed against both types of parasite, but typically, while defences against classic parasites have been selected to protect survival, those against brood parasites have been selected to protect the parent's inclusive fitness, suggesting that the selection pressures they impose are fundamentally different. However, there is another class of defences against classic parasites that have specifically been selected to protect an individual's inclusive fitness, known as social immunity. Social immune responses include the anti-parasite defences typically provided for others in kin-structured groups, such as the antifungal secretions produced by termite workers to protect the brood. Defences against brood parasites, therefore, are more closely aligned with social immune responses. Much like social immunity, host defences against brood parasitism are employed by a donor (a parent) for the benefit of one or more recipients (typically kin), and as with social defences against classic parasites, defences have therefore evolved to protect the donor's inclusive fitness, not the survival or ultimately the fitness of individual recipients This can lead to severe conflicts between the different parties, whose interests are not always aligned. Here, we consider defences against brood parasitism in the light of social immunity, at different stages of parasite encounter, addressing where conflicts occur and how they might be resolved. We finish with considering how this approach could help us to address longstanding questions in our understanding of brood parasitism.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"In arms races with parasites, hosts can evolve defences exhibiting extensive variability within populations, which signals individual identity ('signatures'). However, few such systems have evolved, suggesting that the conditions for their evolution are uncommon. We review (a) polymorphic egg markings that allow hosts of brood-parasitic birds to recognize and reject parasitic eggs, and (b) polymorphic tissue antigens encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which present self- and pathogen-derived peptides to T cells of the immune system. Despite the profound differences between these systems, they share analogous features: (i) self/non-self discrimination by a highly specific recognition system (bird eyes and T-cell antigen receptor, respectively), which antagonists may escape by evolving evasion or mimicry; (ii) a self substrate upon which diversifying selection can act (eggs, and MHC molecules); (iii) acquired knowledge of self (resulting in acceptance of own eggs, and immune tolerance); and (iv) fitness costs associated with attack on self or lack of parasite detection. We suggest that these features comprise a set of requirements for parasites to drive the evolution of identity signatures in hosts, which diminish the likelihood of recognition errors. This may help to explain the variety of trajectories arising from arms races in different antagonistic contexts.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness provides a framework for understanding the evolution of social behaviour between kin, including parental and alloparental care. Brood parasitism is a reproductive tactic in which parasites exploit the care of other individuals of the same species (conspecific parasitism) or different species (interspecific parasitism) to rear their brood. Here, drawing from examples in birds and social insects, we identify two insights into brood parasitism that stem from inclusive fitness theory. First, the kin structure within nests, or between neighbouring nests, can create a niche space favouring the evolution of conspecific parasitism. For example, low average relatedness within social insect nests can increase selection for reproductive cheats. Likewise, high average relatedness between adjacent nests of some birds can increase a female's tolerance of parasitism by her neighbour. Second, intrabrood conflict will be high in parasitized broods, from the perspective of both parasite and host young, relative to unparasitized broods. We also discuss offspring recognition by hosts as an example of discrimination in a kin-selected social behaviour. We conclude that the inclusive fitness framework is instructive for understanding aspects of brood parasite and host evolution. In turn, brood parasites present some unique opportunities to test the predictions of inclusive fitness theory.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Brood parasitism is a specialized form of parasitism in which the offspring of a parasite develops on the food provisions gathered by a host species for its own young. Obligate brood parasitic lineages have lost the ability to acquire provisions for their young and thus rely entirely on the location of an appropriate host to serve as a food-provider. Solitary bees provide some of the most fascinating examples of brood parasitism in animals. Most solitary bees build and provision their own nests. Some, however, usurp the nests of other species of bees. These brood parasites, or 'cuckoo' bees, deposit their eggs on the pollen provisions collected by a host bee for her own offspring. The provisions stored by the host bee are not sufficient to sustain the development of both the host's larva and that of the brood parasite and the parasite must kill the offspring of its host in order to obtain enough nourishment to complete its development. As a consequence, there is fierce competition between the host bee seeking to protect her nest from attack and the brood parasite seeking to avoid detection by the host in order to successfully deposit her eggs in an appropriate nest. In this paper, I review the behaviours that allow brood parasitic bees to escape detection by their hosts. Identifying these behaviours, and placing them within the general context of strategies employed by brood parasitic bees to parasitize the nests of their hosts, is key to understanding how brood parasitic lineages may have evolved from nest-building ancestors, decrypting the selective pressures that drive evolutionary transitions from one strategy to another and, more broadly, revealing how similar selective pressures in widely divergent lineages of animals have given rise to remarkably convergent behaviours.

Passing on the costs of parental care to others occurs widely in birds, insects and fish, and often exerts selection pressure on hosts that in turn evolve defences. Brood parasites have therefore provided an illuminating system for researching coevolution. Nevertheless, much remains unknown about how ecology and evolutionary history constrain or facilitate brood parasitism, or the mechanisms that shape or respond to selection. In this special issue, we bring together examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate the diverse ways in which recent research is addressing these gaps. This special issue also considers how research on brood parasitism may benefit from, and in turn inform, related fields such as social evolution and immunity. Here, we argue that progress in our understanding of coevolution would benefit from the increased integration of ideas across taxonomic boundaries and across Tinbergen's Four Questions: mechanism, ontogeny, function and phylogeny of brood parasitism. We also encourage renewed vigour in uncovering the natural history of the majority of the world's brood parasites that remain little-known. Indeed, it seems very likely that some of nature's brood parasites remain entirely unknown, because otherwise we are left with a puzzle: if parental care is so costly, why is brood parasitism not more common?

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Interspecific brood parasitism occurs in several independent lineages of birds and social insects, putatively evolving from intraspecific brood parasitism. The cuckoo catfish, Synodontis multipunctatus, the only known obligatory non-avian brood parasite, exploits mouthbrooding cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika, despite the absence of parental care in its evolutionary lineage (family Mochokidae). Cuckoo catfish participate in host spawning events, with their eggs subsequently collected and brooded by parental cichlids, though they can later be selectively rejected by the host. One scenario for the origin of brood parasitism in cuckoo catfish is through predation of cichlid eggs during spawning, eventually resulting in a spatial and temporal match in oviposition by host and parasite. Here we demonstrate experimentally that, uniquely among all known brood parasites, cuckoo catfish have the capacity to re-infect their hosts at a late developmental stage following egg rejection. We show that cuckoo catfish offspring can survive outside the host buccal cavity and re-infect parental hosts at a later incubation phase by exploiting the strong parental instinct of hosts to collect stray offspring. This finding implies an alternative evolutionary origin for cuckoo catfish brood parasitism, with the parental response of host cichlids facilitating its evolution.

Solid fouling is defined as the undesired attachment of solid contaminants including ice, clathrates, waxes, inorganic scale, polymers, proteins, dust and biological materials. We first provide an overview of the surface design approaches typically applied across the scope of solid fouling and explain how these disparate research efforts can be united to an extent under a single framework. We discuss how the elastic modulus and the operating length scale of a foulant determine its ability or inability to elastically deform surfaces. When surface deformation occurs, minimization of the substrate elastic modulus is critical for the facile de-bonding of a solid contaminant. Foulants with low modulus or small deposition sizes cannot deform an elastic bulk material and instead de-bond more readily from surfaces with chemistries that minimize their interfacial free energy or induce a particular repellant interaction with the foulant. Overall, we review reported surface design strategies for the reduction in solid fouling, and provide perspective regarding how our framework, together with the modulus and length scale of a foulant, can guide future antifouling surface designs.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 06 13,"To save energy and reduce environmental impacts, new technologies towards a development of a sustainable 'greener' economy are needed. The main opportunity to improve sustainability by reducing emissions is within the transport sector. More than 90% of all goods worldwide are transported by ships. Particularly maritime ships using heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil play a major role. The total fuel consumption of shipping in 2016 was about 250 m t (domestic ca. 50 m t, international shipping ca. 200 m t). The vast portion of the energy consumption of a ship is the need to overcome the drag between ship hull and water-depending on the shape of the vessel and its size up to 90% of total fuel consumption. This means reducing drag helps to save fuel and reduces carbon emissions as well as pollution considerably. Different techniques for drag reduction are known, e.g. the micro-bubble technique or the bulbous bow. We investigated a novel bioinspired technique since 2002: the application of biomimetic surfaces with long-term stable air layers on ship hulls, serving as a slip agent. This technology is based on the Salvinia Effect, allowing a permanent stabilization of air layers under water. In this case study, we analysed the possible savings, which also could be combined with modified micro-bubble technologies. We calculated, based on a selection of five ship types, representing 75% of the world fleet, that air-layer hull coatings could lead to estimated savings of 32.5 million tons of fuel (meaning 13.0% of the worldwide shipping fuel consumption), equal to 18.5 billion US$ and 130.0 million tons of CO2e per year.

The coated samples show water contact angle of 164 ± 7° and tilt angle of 5 ± 1°. Droplet dynamics of the coated surfaces was investigated. Surfaces exhibited self-cleaning properties. In addition, mechanical, chemical and thermal stability tests were performed.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 11,"Orb webs absorb the impact energy of prey and transmit vibratory information to the spider with minimal structural damage. The structural properties of the web and the arrangement of threads within the web affect transmission time during the prey impact. The objective of the present study is to determine damping, stiffness, and transmissibility of healthy and damaged spider webs. Experimental results show that stiffness and transmissibility diminish from the inner to outer spiral threads and gradient variation in the structural properties of spiral threads enhances signal transmission capability toward the centre regardless of the position of prey impact within the healthy web. Spiral threads exhibit excellent prey retention properties due to their stretching capability. Kinetic energy produced by prey is absorbed in the threads, which help the spider to analyse the prey retention properties and also determine the response time. The minor damage (up to 25%) does not alter the basic characteristics of the web due to self-adjustment of tension within the web. Damping, natural frequency, stiffness and transmissibility decrease with the increase in the percentage of damaged web. The present study addresses the structural sustainability of the spider web irrespective of minor damages and also provides guidance in designing the structures under impact.

In this study, a coating using a simple and scalable fabrication technique was used to produce superliquiphobic surfaces with a low tilt angle. The coating comprises hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles with a binder of methylphenyl silicone resin to achieve superhydrophobicity. After ultraviolet-ozone treatment of the coating, an additional coating of fluorosilane was deposited to achieve superliquiphobicity with low tilt angle. Data for these coatings are presented showing the ability to repel water and oil, anti-icing properties down to -60°C, self-cleaning, and the ability to maintain superliquiphobicity in hot environments up to about 95°C, after soaking in deionized water for more than 200 h at room temperature and for about 50 h at 50°C and 70°C, and in chemical environments with low pH values.

Three water collecting mechanisms including heterogeneous wettability, grooved surfaces, and Laplace pressure gradient, were investigated on flat, cylindrical, conical surfaces, and conical array. It is found that higher water repellency in flat surfaces results in higher water collection rate and inclination angle (with respect to the vertical axis) has little effect. Surfaces with heterogeneous wettability have higher water collection rate than surfaces with homogeneous wettability. Both cylindrical and conical surfaces resulted in comparable water collection rate. However, only the cone transported the water droplets to its base. Heterogeneity, higher inclination and grooves increased the water collection rate. A cone has a higher collection rate per unit area than a flat surface with the same wettability. An array of cones has higher collection rate per unit area than a single cone, because droplets in a conical array coalesce, leading to higher frequency of droplets falling. Adding heterogeneity further increases the difference. Based on the findings, scaled-up designs of beetle-, grass- and cactus-inspired surfaces and nets are presented.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 12,"Figures of merit for future tokamak fusion power plants (FPPs) are presented. It is argued that extrapolation from present-day experiments to proposed FPPs must follow a consistent development path, demonstrating the largest required leaps in intermediate devices to allow safe extrapolation to an FPP. This concerns both plasma physics and technology. At constant plasma parameters, the figures of merit depend on both major radius R and magnetic field B. We propose to use the term 'size' for a combination of R and B to avoid ambiguities in scaling arguments. Two routes to FPPs are discussed: the more conventional one increasing R, based on the assumption that B is limited by present technology; and an alternative approach assuming the availability of new technology for superconducting coils, allowing higher B. It is shown that the latter will lead to more compact devices, and, assuming a criterion based on divertor impurity concentration, is in addition more favourable concerning the exhaust problem. However, in order to obtain attractive steady-state tokamak FPPs, the required plasma parameters still require considerable progress with respect to present experiments. A credible strategy to arrive at these must hence be shown for both paths. In addition, the high-field path needs a demonstration of the critical technology items early on.

Fusion offers the potential of predictable, safe power with no carbon emissions and fuel sources lasting for millions of years. However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve in a controlled, steady-state fashion. The most promising path is via magnetic confinement in a device called a tokamak. A magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) power plant requires many different science, technology and engineering challenges to be met simultaneously. This requires an integrated approach from the outset; advances are needed in individual areas but these only bring fusion electricity closer if the other challenges are resolved in harmony. The UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has developed a wide range of skills to address many of the challenges and hosts the JET device, presently the only MCF facility capable of operating with both the fusion fuels, deuterium and tritium. Recently, several major new UKAEA facilities have been funded and some have started operation, notably a new spherical tokamak (MAST Upgrade), a major robotics facility (RACE), and a materials research facility (MRF). Most recently, work has started on Hydrogen-3 Advanced Technology (H3AT) for tritium technology and a group of Fusion Technology Facilities.

The confinement quality is considered to be a key factor, having an impact on the size of the reactor and exhaust power that has to be managed. Plasma eruptions can cause excessive erosion if not mitigated, with implications for maintenance and availability. Disruptions are a major concern-one large disruption could terminally damage the reactor so it is important to understand the loads they impart to the structure, and put in place appropriate protection and an effective avoidance/mitigation strategy. Managing the exhaust of heat and particles from the plasma is likely to be a significant issue, which may be mitigated if an advanced confinement regime can be identified. The advanced divertor structures that may be required to handle the exhaust have a significant impact on the design of a fusion reactor. Three strategies can be identified to take account of the physics challenges, with different implications for the timescale to fusion power: (1) a staged approach with the size of each step determined by our confidence in the predictive capability of our models; (2) a single, big step with contingency built into the design where possible to accommodate the uncertainty in physics predictions and (3) a single big step with optimistic physics assumptions and no contingency, accepting the increased financial and reputational risk that comes with such an approach.

In particular, I want to discuss how a fusion reactor can be economically viable without employing too advanced physics and technology. It certainly will be a pulsed machine (approx. 20 000 s pulses) with thermal energy storage (turbine is steady state). I also want to discuss the optimum machine size and toroidal field for such a machine and why I think that high field and smaller plasmas may not necessarily make a fusion reactor more competitive. When one extrapolates from today's knowledge on ITER construction, even considering that ITER can be built much cheaper, it is clear that a fusion power plant will cost more than 10 or more likely more than 15 billion Euros/Dollars (the first of a kind even approx. 30 billion). Therefore, in order to have an economically attractive fusion reactor, it needs to produce a large amount of power (on the order of 2.5 GW electric). The possible size (R ∼ 10 m) and reasonably conservative physics basis of such a machine will be briefly described in the presentation. If we are successful in achieving advanced physics in a burning plasma, e.g. in ITER, then we can make the machine slightly smaller but the principal arguments for a large machine will not change significantly. Key technologies and their status will be discussed with particular emphasis on a realistic blanket and divertor design and the size and issues of a tritium-plant (T-plant) for such a machine as well as the challenges which have to be overcome beyond what is needed for ITER. Finally, a simple economic consideration will be discussed to show that a large machine could be economically viable, even in today's environment, in particular, in competition with renewables.

The ring-shaped magnetic confinement of tokamaks, which emerged in the 1960s, was quickly identified as the most promising approach and remains so today although a practical commercial reactor remains decades away.

Some, such as inertial confinement fusion, have emerged from nuclear weapons programs and others from academic efforts. A few have been spun out into start-up companies funded by venture capital and wealthy individuals.

Their key advantage is high plasma pressure, and the important β parameter indicating the efficiency of the magnetic field use is introduced. High-temperature superconductors are described along with the opportunities they allow for higher magnetic fields at higher current densities and more modest cryogenic temperatures.

Its rise to dominance is primarily driven by advancements in computing power and the need to model systems of increasing complexity. The multiscale modelling paradigm is now accompanied by a vibrant ecosystem of multiscale computing software (MCS) which promises to address many challenges in the development of multiscale applications. In this paper, we define the common steps in the multiscale application development process and investigate to what degree a set of 21 representative MCS tools enhance each development step. We observe several gaps in the features provided by MCS tools, especially for application deployment and the preparation and management of production runs. In addition, we find that many MCS tools are tailored to a particular multiscale computing pattern, even though they are otherwise application agnostic. We conclude that the gaps we identify are characteristic of a field that is still maturing and features that enhance the deployment and production steps of multiscale application development are desirable for the long-term success of MCS in its application fields.

As a result of coevolution with their hosts, baculoviruses developed unique life cycles characterized by the production of two distinctive virion phenotypes, occlusion-derived virus and budded virus, which are responsible for mediating primary infection in insect midgut epithelia and spreading systemic infection within infected insects, respectively. In this article, advances associated with virus-host interactions during the baculovirus life cycle are reviewed. We mainly focus on how baculoviruses exploit versatile strategies to overcome diverse host barriers and establish successful infections. For example, in the midgut, baculoviruses encode enzymes to degrade peritrophic membranes and use a series of per os infectivity factors to initiate primary infection. A viral fibroblast growth factor is expressed to attract tracheoblasts that spread the virus for systemic infection. Baculoviruses use different strategies to suppress host defence systems, including apoptosis, melanization and RNA interference. Additionally, baculoviruses can manipulate host physiology and induce 'tree-top disease' for optimal virus replication and dispersal. These advances in our understanding of baculoviruses will greatly inform the development of more effective baculoviral pesticides.

These natural enemies include both bacteria and fungi and they use diverse methods to infect and kill nematodes. For instance, nematode-trapping fungi can sense host signals and produce special trapping devices to capture nematodes, whereas endo-parasitic fungi can kill nematodes by spore adhesion and invasive growth to break the nematode cuticle. By contrast, nematophagous bacteria can secrete virulence factors to kill nematodes. In addition, some bacteria can mobilize nematode-trapping fungi to kill nematodes. In response, nematodes can also sense and defend against the microbial pathogens using strategies such as producing anti-microbial peptides regulated by the innate immunity system.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"It has long been known that phytopathogenic bacteria react to plant-specific stimuli or environmental factors. However, how bacterial cells sense these environmental cues remains incompletely studied. Recently, three kinds of histidine kinases (HKs) were identified as receptors to perceive plant-associated or quorum-sensing signals. Among these kinases, HK VgrS detects iron depletion by binding to ferric iron via an ExxE motif, RpfC binds diffusible signal factor (DSF) by its N-terminal peptide and activates its autokinase activity through relaxation of autoinhibition, and PcrK specifically senses plant hormone-cytokinin and elicits bacterial responses to oxidative stress. These HKs are critical sensors that regulate the virulence of a Gram-negative bacterium, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Research progress on the signal perception of phytopathogenic bacterial HKs suggests that inter-kingdom signalling between host plants and pathogens controls pathogenesis and can be used as a potential molecular target to protect plants from bacterial diseases.

Feeding of the lepidopteran insect Mythimna separata triggers defence signalling and increases anti-herbivore benzoxazinoids (Bxs) in the insect-damaged maize leaves. However, the herbivory-elicited within-leaf and leaf-to-leaf systemic signalling in maize remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that simulated M. separata herbivory and mechanical wounding elicited increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), JA-Ile (JA-isoleucine conjugate) and Bxs in the damaged areas and in specific systemic regions within a leaf. Importantly, increased contents of Bxs were detected in a systemic leaf, and consistently, this leaf exhibited increased defence against M. separata. Increased JA/JA-Ile and altered transcriptome, including Bx biosynthesis genes, were detected in systemic leaves after wounding or simulated herbivory treatments, although only simulated herbivory induced increase of the contents of Bxs systemically. Promoter and co-expression analysis revealed that transcription factors bHLH57 and WRKY34 may regulate Bx biosynthesis genes in systemic leaves. Moreover, leaf ablation experiment indicated that the systemic signal rapidly exited the local leaves within 30 min after elicitation.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in defence response of host plants versus pathogens. While generation and detoxification of ROS is well understood, how varied ability of different isolates of pathogens to overcome host ROS, or ROS contribution to a particular isolate's pathogenicity, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation of the ROS pathway, in combination with the insulin pathway, increases the pathogenicity of invasive species Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The results showed a positive correlation between fecundity and pathogenicity of different nematode isolates. The virulent isolates from introduced populations in Japan, China and Europe had significantly higher fecundity than native avirulent isolates from the USA. Increased expression of Mn-SOD and reduced expression of catalase/ GPX-5 and H2O2 accumulation during invasion are associated with virulent strains. Additional H2O2 could improve fecundity of Bu. xylophilus. Furthermore, depletion of Mn-SOD decreased fecundity and virulence of Bu. xylophilus, while the insulin pathway is significantly affected. Thus, we propose that destructive pathogenicity of Bu. xylophilus to pines is partly owing to upregulated fecundity modulated by the insulin pathway in association with the ROS pathway and further enhanced by H2O2 oxidative stress. These findings provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in plant-pathogen interactions and adaptive evolution of invasive species.

A DUF3129 family of proteins is widely encoded in the genomes of fungal pathogens. A few studies in plant and insect pathogens indicated that the DUF3129 genes are required for fungal penetration of host cuticles with an unclear mechanism. We found that a varied number of DUF3129 proteins is present in different fungal species and the proteins are evolutionarily diverged from each other at the inter- and intra-specific levels. By using the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii as a model, we performed experiments and found that the seven DUF3129 proteins encoded by this fungus are localized to cellular lipid droplets (LDs). Individual deletion of these genes did not affect fungal formation of the infection structure appressoria and the accumulation of LDs in fungal conidia. When compared with the wild-type (WT) strain, insect bioassays revealed that the virulence of most null mutants were significantly impaired during topical infection but not during injection of insects. Carbon starvation and the subsequent Western blot analysis indicated that the LD-specific perilipin protein was completely degraded in the WT cells whereas varied levels of perilipin could be detected in the mutant cells, which signified that depletion of LD content was delayed in mutant cells, and DUF3129 proteins are therefore involved in LD degradation. We also provided biochemical evidence that these DUF3129 genes are transcriptionally regulated by a yeast Ste12-like transcription factor.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Many hemipteran insects that can transmit plant viruses in a persistent and transovarial manner are generally associated with a common obligate bacterial symbiont Sulcia and its β-proteobacterial partner. Rice dwarf virus (RDV), a plant reovirus, can bind to the envelope of Sulcia through direct interaction of the viral minor outer capsid protein P2 with the bacterial outer membrane protein, allowing the virus to exploit the ancient oocyte entry path of Sulcia in rice leafhopper vectors. Here, we show that RDV can hitchhike with both Sulcia and its β-proteobacterial partner Nasuia to ensure their simultaneous transovarial transmission. Interestingly, RDV can move through the outer envelope of Nasuia and reside in the periplasmic space, which is mediated by the specific interaction of the viral major outer capsid protein P8 and the porin channel on the bacterial outer envelope. Nasuia porin-specific antibody efficiently interferes with the binding between RDV and the Nasuia envelope, thus strongly preventing viral transmission to insect offspring. Thus, RDV has evolved different strategies to exploit the ancient oocyte entry paths used by two obligate bacterial symbionts in rice leafhoppers. Our results thus reveal that RDV has formed complex, cooperative interactions with both Sulcia and Nasuia during their joint transovarial transmission.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Plant secondary metabolites and their biosynthesis have attracted great interest, but investigations of the activities of hidden intermediates remain rare. Gossypol and related sesquiterpenes are the major phytoalexins in cotton. Among the six biosynthetic intermediates recently identified, 8-hydroxy-7-keto-δ-cadinene (C234) crippled the plant disease resistance when accumulated upon gene silencing. C234 harbours an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl thus is a reactive electrophile species. Here, we show that C234 application also dampened the Arabidopsis resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ( Psm). We treated Arabidopsis with C234, Psm and ( Psm+C234), and analysed the leaf transcriptomes. While C234 alone exerted a mild effect, it greatly stimulated an over-response to the pathogen. Of the 7335 genes affected in the ( Psm+C234)-treated leaves, 3476 were unresponsive without the chemical, in which such functional categories as 'nucleotides transport', 'vesicle transport', 'MAP kinases', 'G-proteins', 'protein assembly and cofactor ligation' and 'light reaction' were enriched, suggesting that C234 disturbed certain physiological processes and the protein complex assembly, leading to distorted defence response and decreased disease resistance. As C234 is efficiently metabolized by CYP71BE79, plants of cotton lineage have evolved a highly active enzyme to prevent the phytotoxic intermediate accumulation during gossypol pathway evolution.

These vesicles are acidified and fused to lysosomes, their contents digested and useful compounds extracted. Indigestible contents can be exocytosed. Macropinocytosis has been known for approaching 100 years and is described in both metazoa and amoebae, but not in plants or fungi. Its evolutionary origin goes back to at least the common ancestor of the amoebozoa and opisthokonts, with apparent secondary loss from fungi. The primary function of macropinocytosis in amoebae and some cancer cells is feeding, but the conserved processing pathway for macropinosomes, which involves shrinkage and the retrieval of membrane to the cell surface, has been adapted in immune cells for antigen presentation. Macropinocytic cups are large actin-driven processes, closely related to phagocytic cups and pseudopods and appear to be organized around a conserved signalling patch of PIP3, active Ras and active Rac that directs actin polymerization to its periphery. Patches can form spontaneously and must be sustained by excitable kinetics with strong cooperation from the actin cytoskeleton. Growth-factor signalling shares core components with macropinocytosis, based around phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), and we suggest that it evolved to take control of ancient feeding structures through a coupled growth factor receptor.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Macropinosome formation occurs as a localized sequence of biochemical activities and associated morphological changes, which may be considered a form of signal transduction leading to the construction of an organelle. Macropinocytosis may also convey information about the availability of extracellular nutrients to intracellular regulators of metabolism. Consistent with this idea, activation of the metabolic regulator mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) in response to acute stimulation by growth factors and extracellular amino acids requires internalization of amino acids by macropinocytosis. This suggests that macropinocytosis is necessary for mTORC1-dependent growth of metazoan cells, both as a route for delivery of amino acids to sensors associated with lysosomes and as a platform for growth factor-dependent signalling to mTORC1 via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the Akt pathway. Because the biochemical signals required for the construction of macropinosomes are also required for cell growth, and inhibition of macropinocytosis inhibits growth factor signalling to mTORC1, we propose that signalling by growth factor receptors is organized into stochastic, structure-dependent cascades of chemical reactions that both build a macropinosome and stimulate mTORC1. More generally, as discrete units of signal transduction, macropinosomes may be subject to feedback regulation by metabolism and cell dimensions.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Nucleic acids are a rapidly emerging therapeutic modality with the potential to become the third major drug modality alongside antibodies and small molecules. Owing to the unfavourable physico-chemical characteristics of nucleic acids, such as large size and negative charge, intracellular delivery remains a fundamental challenge to realizing this potential. Delivery technologies such as lipids, polymers and peptides have been used to facilitate delivery, with many of the most successful technologies using macropinocytosis to gain cellular entry; mostly by default rather than design. Fundamental knowledge of macropinocytosis is rapidly growing, presenting opportunities to better tailor design strategies to target this pathway. Furthermore, certain types of tumour cells have been observed to have high levels of macropinocytic activity and traffic cargo to favourable destinations within the cell for endosomal release, providing unique opportunities to further use this entry route for drug delivery. In this article, we review the delivery systems reported to be taken up by macropinocytosis and what is known about the mechanisms for regulating macropinocytosis in tumour cells. From this analysis, we identify new opportunities for exploiting this pathway for the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to tumour cells.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 19,"In tumour cells, macropinocytosis functions as an amino acid supply route and supports cancer cell survival and proliferation. Initially demonstrated in oncogenic KRAS-driven models of pancreatic cancer, macropinocytosis triggers the internalization of extracellular proteins via discrete endocytic vesicles called macropinosomes. The incoming protein cargo is targeted for lysosome-dependent degradation, causing the intracellular release of amino acids. These protein-derived amino acids support metabolic fitness by contributing to the intracellular amino acid pools, as well as to the biosynthesis of central carbon metabolites. In this way, macropinocytosis represents a novel amino acid supply route that tumour cells use to survive the nutrient-poor conditions of the tumour microenvironment. Macropinocytosis has also emerged as an entry mechanism for a variety of nanomedicines, suggesting that macropinocytosis regulation in the tumour setting can be harnessed for the delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics. A slew of recent studies point to the possibility that macropinocytosis is a pervasive feature of many different tumour types. In this review, we focus on the role of this important uptake mechanism in a variety of cancers and highlight the main molecular drivers of macropinocytosis in these malignancies.

Macrophages and dendritic cells are especially active in this process, but all cells can be stimulated to initiate this remarkable form of endocytosis. Although much is known about the membrane lipid and actin requirements for initiating macropinocytosis, less is known about the membrane that forms the macropinosome and the fate of that membrane once the macropinosome enters the cell interior. Since macropinocytosis is a specialized form of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE), studies of the constitutive internalization and trafficking of cargo proteins and membrane that enter cells independently of clathrin could reveal the types of membrane that form the macropinosome and the machinery that handles cargo sorting and recycling during the maturation of the macropinosome.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Macrophages respond to several stimuli by forming florid membrane ruffles that lead to fluid uptake by macropinocytosis. This type of induced macropinocytosis, executed by a variety of non-malignant and malignant cells, is initiated by transmembrane receptors and is involved in nutrient acquisition and mTOR signalling. However, macrophages also perform a unique type of constitutive ruffling and macropinocytosis that is dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. Calcium-sensing receptors are responsible for this activity. This distinct form of macropinocytosis enables macrophages to continuously sample their microenvironment for antigenic molecules and for pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns, as part of their immune surveillance functions. Interestingly, even within the monocyte lineage, there are differences in macropinocytic ability that reflect the polarized functional roles of distinct macrophage subsets. This review discusses the shared and distinct features of both induced and constitutive macropinocytosis displayed by the macrophage lineage and their roles in physiology, immunity and pathophysiology. In particular, we analyse the role of macropinocytosis in the uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and its contribution to foam cell and atherosclerotic plaque formation. We propose a combined role of scavenger receptors and constitutive macropinocytosis in oxidized LDL uptake, a process we have termed 'receptor-assisted macropinocytosis'.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Macropinocytosis is a prevalent and essential pathway in macrophages where it contributes to anti-microbial responses and innate immune cell functions. Cell surface ruffles give rise to phagosomes and to macropinosomes as multi-functional compartments that contribute to environmental sampling, pathogen entry, plasma membrane turnover and receptor signalling. Rapid, high resolution, lattice light sheet imaging demonstrates the dynamic nature of macrophage ruffling. Pathogen-mediated activation of surface and endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in macrophages upregulates macropinocytosis. Here, using multiple forms of imaging and microscopy, we track membrane-associated, fluorescently-tagged Rab8a expressed in live macrophages, using a variety of cell markers to demonstrate Rab8a localization and its enrichment on early macropinosomes. Production of a novel biosensor and its use for quantitative FRET analysis in live cells, pinpoints macropinosomes as the site for TLR-induced activation of Rab8a. We have previously shown that TLR signalling, cytokine outputs and macrophage programming are regulated by the GTPase Rab8a with PI3 Kγ as its effector. Finally, we highlight another effector, the phosphatase OCRL, which is located on macropinosomes and interacts with Rab8a, suggesting that Rab8a may operate on multiple levels to modulate phosphoinositides in macropinosomes.

However, despite Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory, we are far from the complete description of basic processes such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and photosynthesis. After more than half a century, the chemiosmotic theory may need updating, thanks to the latest structural data on respiratory chain complexes. In particular, up-to date technologies, such as those using fluorescence indicators following proton displacements, have shown that proton translocation is lateral rather than transversal with respect to the coupling membrane. Furthermore, the definition of the physical species involved in the transfer (proton, hydroxonium ion or proton currents) is still an unresolved issue, even though the latest acquisitions support the idea that protonic currents, difficult to measure, are involved. Moreover, FoF1-ATP synthase ubiquitous motor enzyme has the peculiarity (unlike most enzymes) of affecting the thermodynamic equilibrium of ATP synthesis. It seems that the concept of diffusion of the proton charge expressed more than two centuries ago by Theodor von Grotthuss is to be taken into consideration to resolve these issues.

Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Tendinous structures are generally thought of as biological springs that operate with a fixed stiffness, yet recent observations on the mechanical behaviour of aponeuroses (broad, sheet-like tendons) have challenged this general assumption. During in situ contractions, aponeuroses undergo changes in both length and width and changes in aponeuroses width can drive changes in longitudinal stiffness. Here, we explore if changes in aponeuroses width can modulate elastic energy (EE) storage in the longitudinal direction. We tested this idea in vivo by quantifying muscle and aponeuroses mechanical behaviour in the turkey lateral gastrocnemius during landing and jumping, activities that require rapid rates of energy dissipation and generation, respectively. We discovered that when aponeurosis width increased (as opposed to decreased), apparent longitudinal stiffness was 34% higher and the capacity of aponeuroses to store EE when stretched in the longitudinal direction was 15% lower. These data reveal that biaxial loading of aponeuroses allows for variation in tendon stiffness and energy storage for different locomotor behaviours.","A new ophiocistioid with soft-tissue preservation from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte, and the evolution of the holothurian body plan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966985,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Reconstructing the evolutionary assembly of animal body plans is challenging when there are large morphological gaps between extant sister taxa, as in the case of echinozoans (echinoids and holothurians). However, the inclusion of extinct taxa can help bridge these gaps. Here we describe a new species of echinozoan, Sollasina cthulhu, from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte, UK. Sollasina cthulhu belongs to the ophiocistioids, an extinct group that shares characters with both echinoids and holothurians. Using physical-optical tomography and computer reconstruction, we visualize the internal anatomy of S. cthulhu in three dimensions, revealing inner soft tissues that we interpret as the ring canal, a key part of the water vascular system that was previously unknown in fossil echinozoans. Phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest that Sollasina and other ophiocistioids represent a paraphyletic group of stem holothurians, as previously hypothesized. This allows us to reconstruct the stepwise reduction of the skeleton during the assembly of the holothurian body plan, which may have been controlled by changes in the expression of biomineralization genes.",Background mortality drivers of European tree species: climate change matters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966984,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Increases in tree mortality rates have been highlighted in different biomes over the past decades. However, disentangling the effects of climate change on the temporal increase in tree mortality from those of management and forest dynamics remains a challenge. Using a modelling approach taking tree and stand characteristics into account, we sought to evaluate the impact of climate change on background mortality for the most common European tree species. We focused on background mortality, which is the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of abrupt disturbances, to avoid confusion with mortality events unrelated to long-term changes in temperature and rainfall. We studied 372 974 trees including 7312 dead trees from forest inventory data surveyed across France between 2009 and 2015. Factors related to competition, stand characteristics, management intensity, and site conditions were the expected preponderant drivers of mortality. Taking these main drivers into account, we detected a climate change signal on 45% of the 43 studied species, explaining an average 6% of the total modelled mortality. For 18 out of the 19 species sensitive to climate change, we evidenced greater mortality with increasing temperature or decreasing rainfall. By quantifying the mortality excess linked to the current climate change for European temperate forest tree species, we provide new insights into forest vulnerability that will prove useful for adapting forest management to future conditions.",Effects of landscape complexity on pollinators are moderated by pollinators' association with mass-flowering crops.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966983,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Conserving and restoring semi-natural habitat, i.e. enhancing landscape complexity, is one of the main strategies to mitigate pollinator decline in agricultural landscapes. However, we still have limited understanding of how landscape complexity shapes pollinator communities in both crop and non-crop habitat, and whether pollinator responses to landscape complexity vary with their association with mass-flowering crops. Here, we surveyed pollinator communities on mass-flowering leek crops and in nearby semi-natural habitat in landscapes of varying complexity. Surveys were done before and during crop bloom and distinguished between pollinators that visit the crop frequently (dominant), occasionally (opportunistic), or not at all (non-crop). Forty-seven per cent of the species in the wider landscape were also observed on leek flowers. Crop pollinator richness increased with local pollinator community size and increasing landscape complexity, but relationships were stronger for opportunistic than for dominant crop pollinators. Relationships between pollinator richness in semi-natural habitats and landscape complexity differed between groups with the most pronounced positive effects on non-crop pollinators. Our results indicate that while dominant crop pollinators are core components of crop pollinator communities in all agricultural landscapes, opportunistic crop pollinators largely determine species-richness responses and complex landscapes are local hotspots for both biodiversity conservation and potential ecosystem service provision.",Polar gigantism and the oxygen-temperature hypothesis: a test of upper thermal limits to body size in Antarctic pycnogonids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966982,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"The extreme and constant cold of the Southern Ocean has led to many unusual features of the Antarctic fauna. One of these, polar gigantism, is thought to have arisen from a combination of cold-driven low metabolic rates and high oxygen availability in the polar oceans (the 'oxygen-temperature hypothesis'). If the oxygen-temperature hypothesis indeed underlies polar gigantism, then polar giants may be particularly susceptible to warming temperatures. We tested the effects of temperature on performance using two genera of giant Antarctic sea spiders (Pycnogonida), Colossendeis and Ammothea, across a range of body sizes. We tested performance at four temperatures spanning ambient (-1.8°C) to 9°C. Individuals from both genera were highly sensitive to elevated temperature, but we found no evidence that large-bodied pycnogonids were more affected by elevated temperatures than small individuals; thus, these results do not support the predictions of the oxygen-temperature hypothesis. When we compared two species, Colossendeis megalonyx and Ammothea glacialis, C. megalonyx maintained performance at considerably higher temperatures. Analysis of the cuticle showed that as body size increases, porosity increases as well, especially in C. megalonyx, which may compensate for the increasing metabolic demand and longer diffusion distances of larger animals by facilitating diffusive oxygen supply.","Lethal and sublethal synergistic effects of a new systemic pesticide, flupyradifurone (Sivanto®), on honeybees.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966981,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"The honeybee ( Apis mellifera L.) is an important pollinator and a model for pesticide effects on insect pollinators. The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF. We suggest that pesticide RA also test for common chemical mixture synergies on behaviour and survival.",Do traits separated by metamorphosis evolve independently?

We then develop how multivariate methods can limit several issues by revealing genetic patterns that are invisible when only considering trait-by-trait genetic correlations. Finally, we detail how Lande's work on sexual dimorphism can be applied in measuring G matrices across life stages. The methods and tools described here will contribute towards building a predictive framework for trait evolution across life stages.","Reasons to doubt the generalizability, reliability, and diagnosticity of fast mapping (FM) for rapid lexical integration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966979,Cognitive neuroscience,2019 04 10,"The possibility of fast mapping (FM) promoting rapid lexical integration challenges complementary systems accounts of word learning.

It was found that there was a note on a 24th problem focusing on the problem of simplicity of proofs. One of the lines of research that was generated from this problem was the identification of proofs. In this article, we present a possible method for exploring the identification of proofs based on the membership problem original from the theory of polynomial rings. To show this, we start by giving a complete worked-out example of a membership problem, that is the problem of checking if a given polynomial belongs to an ideal generated by finitely many polynomials. This problem can be solved by considering Gröbner bases and the corresponding reductions. Each reduction is a simplification of the polynomial and it corresponds to a rewriting step. In proving that a polynomial is a member of an ideal, a rewriting process is used, and many different such processes can be considered. To better illustrate this, we consider a graph where each rewriting step corresponds to an edge, and thus a path corresponds to a rewriting process. In this paper, we consider the identification of paths, within the context of the membership problem, to propose a criterion of identification of proofs.

First, condition-dependent expression of male sexual traits makes it likely that sexual selection increases female fitness if reproductively successful males disproportionately transfer genes that are under natural selection in both sexes, such as genes for foraging efficiency. Condition-dependence is a form of phenotypic plasticity if some of the variation in net resource acquisition and assimilation is attributable to the environment rather than solely genetic in origin. Second, the optimal allocation of resources into different condition-dependent traits depends on their marginal fitness gains. As male condition improves, this can therefore increase or, though rarely highlighted, actually decrease the expression of sexually selected traits. It is therefore crucial to understand how condition determines male allocation of resources to different sexually selected traits that vary in their immediate effects on female reproductive output (e.g. ornaments versus coercive behaviour). In addition, changes in the distribution of condition among males as the environment shifts could reduce phenotypic variance in certain male traits, thereby reducing the strength of sexual selection imposed by females. Studies of adaptive evolution under rapid environmental change should consider the possibility that phenotypic plasticity of sexually selected male traits, even if it elevates male fitness, could have a negative effect on female reproductive output, thereby increasing the risk of population extinction.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Basal or standard metabolic rate reflects the minimum amount of energy required to maintain body processes, while the maximum metabolic rate sets the ceiling for aerobic work. There is typically up to three-fold intraspecific variation in both minimal and maximal rates of metabolism, even after controlling for size, sex and age; these differences are consistent over time within a given context, but both minimal and maximal metabolic rates are plastic and can vary in response to changing environments. Here we explore the causes of intraspecific and phenotypic variation at the organ, tissue and mitochondrial levels. We highlight the growing evidence that individuals differ predictably in the flexibility of their metabolic rates and in the extent to which they can suppress minimal metabolism when food is limiting but increase the capacity for aerobic metabolism when a high work rate is beneficial. It is unclear why this intraspecific variation in metabolic flexibility persists-possibly because of trade-offs with the flexibility of other traits-but it has consequences for the ability of populations to respond to a changing world. It is clear that metabolic rates are targets of selection, but more research is needed on the fitness consequences of rates of metabolism and their plasticity at different life stages, especially in natural conditions.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Theory suggests that evolutionary changes in phenotypic plasticity could either hinder or facilitate evolutionary rescue in a changing climate. Nevertheless, the actual role of evolving plasticity in the responses of natural populations to climate change remains unresolved. Direct observations of evolutionary change in nature are rare, making it difficult to assess the relative contributions of changes in trait means versus changes in plasticity to climate change responses. To address this gap, this review explores several proxies that can be used to understand evolving plasticity in the context of climate change, including space for time substitutions, experimental evolution and tests for genomic divergence at environmentally responsive loci. Comparisons among populations indicate a prominent role for divergence in environmentally responsive traits in local adaptation to climatic gradients. Moreover, genomic comparisons among such populations have identified pervasive divergence in the regulatory regions of environmentally responsive loci. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that divergence in plasticity plays a prominent role in adaptation to climatic gradients over space, indicating that evolving plasticity is also likely to play a key role in adaptive responses to climate change through time. This suggests that genetic variation in plastic responses to the environment (G × E) might be an important predictor of species' vulnerabilities to climate-driven decline or extinction.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"How populations and species respond to modified environmental conditions is critical to their persistence both now and into the future, particularly given the increasing pace of environmental change. The process of adaptation to novel environmental conditions can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the expression of phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to express varying phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions), and (2) evolution via selection for particular phenotypes, resulting in the modification of genetic variation in the population. Plasticity, because it acts at the level of the individual, is often hailed as a rapid-response mechanism that will enable organisms to adapt and survive in our rapidly changing world. But plasticity can also retard adaptation by shifting the distribution of phenotypes in the population, shielding it from natural selection. In addition to which, not all plastic responses are adaptive-now well-documented in cases of ecological traps. In this theme issue, we aim to present a considered view of plasticity and the role it could play in facilitating or hindering adaption to environmental change. This introduction provides a re-examination of our current understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and sets the theme issue's contributions in their broader context. Four key themes emerge: the need to measure plasticity across both space and time; the importance of the past in predicting the future; the importance of the link between plasticity and sexual selection; and the need to understand more about the nature of selection on plasticity itself. We conclude by advocating the need for cross-disciplinary collaborations to settle the question of whether plasticity will promote or retard species' rates of adaptation to ever-more stressful environmental conditions.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Little is known about the life-history trade-offs and limitations, and the physiological mechanisms that are associated with phenotypic adaptation to future ocean conditions. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the within- and trans-generation life-history responses and aerobic capacity of a marine polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, to elevated temperature and elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity for its entire lifespan. In addition, transplants between treatments were carried out at both the egg mass and juvenile stage to identify the potential influence of developmental effects. Within-generation, life-history trade-offs caused by the timing of transplant were only detected under elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity conditions. Polychaetes transplanted at the egg mass stage grew slower and had lower activities of energy metabolism enzymes but reached a larger maximum body size and lived longer when compared with those transplanted as juveniles. Trans-generation exposure to both elevated temperature and elevated temperature and salinity conditions restored 20 and 21% of lifespan fecundity, respectively. Trans-generation exposure to elevated temperature conditions also resulted in a trade-off between juvenile growth rates and lifespan fecundity, with slower growers showing greater fecundity. Overall, our results suggest that future ocean conditions may select for slower growers. Furthermore, our results indicate that life-history trade-offs and limitations will be more prevalent with the shift of multiple global change drivers, and thus there will be greater constraints on adaptive potential.

Especially, transgenerational plasticity (TGP), where parental environment influences offspring plasticity in future environments, could compensate for otherwise negative effects of environmental change on offspring sexual traits. We conducted a mate choice experiment using stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) with different thermal histories (ambient 17°C or elevated 21°C) within and across generations under simulated ocean warming using outdoor mesocosms. Parentage analysis of egg clutches revealed that maternal developmental temperature and reproductive (mesocosm) environment affected egg size, with females that developed at 17°C laying smaller eggs in 21°C mesocosms, likely owing to metabolic costs at elevated temperature. Paternal developmental temperature interacted with the reproductive environment to influence mating success, particularly under simulated ocean warming, with males that developed at 21°C showing lower overall mating success compared with 17°C males, but higher mating success in 21°C mesocosms. Furthermore, mating success of males was influenced by the interaction between F1 developmental temperature and F0 parent acclimation temperature, demonstrating the potential role of both TGP and within-generation plasticity in shaping traits involved in sexual selection and mate choice, potentially facilitating rapid responses to environmental change.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Plant and animal parents may respond to environmental conditions such as resource stress by altering traits of their offspring via heritable non-genetic effects. While such transgenerational plasticity can result in progeny phenotypes that are functionally pre-adapted to the inducing environment, it is unclear whether such parental effects measurably enhance the adult competitive success and lifetime reproductive output of progeny, and whether they may also adversely affect fitness if offspring encounter contrasting conditions. In glasshouse experiments with inbred genotypes of the annual plant Polygonum persicaria, we tested the effects of parental shade versus sun on (a) competitive performance of progeny in shade, and (b) lifetime reproductive fitness of progeny in three contrasting treatments. Shaded parents produced offspring with increased fitness in shade despite competition, as well as greater competitive impact on plant neighbours. Inherited effects of parental light conditions also significantly altered lifetime fitness: parental shade increased reproductive output for progeny in neighbour and understorey shade, but decreased fitness for progeny in sunny, dry conditions. Along with these substantial adaptive and maladaptive transgenerational effects, results show complex interactions between genotypes, parent environment and progeny conditions that underscore the role of environmental variability and change in shaping future adaptive potential.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"In a rapidly changing world, understanding the processes that influence a population's ability to respond to natural selection is critical for identifying how to preserve biodiversity. Two such processes are phenotypic plasticity and sexual selection. Whereas plasticity can facilitate local adaptation, sexual selection potentially impedes local adaptation, especially in rapidly changing or variable environments. Here we hypothesize that, when females preferentially choose males that sire plastic offspring, sexual selection can actually facilitate local adaptation to variable or novel environments by promoting the evolution of adaptive plasticity. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating whether male sexual signals could indicate plasticity in their offspring and, concomitantly, their offspring's ability to produce locally adapted phenotypes. Using spadefoot toads ( Spea multiplicata) as our experimental system, we show that a male sexual signal predicts plasticity in his offspring's resource-use morphology. Specifically, faster-calling males (which are preferred by females) produce more plastic offspring; such plasticity, in turn, enables these males' offspring to respond adaptively to the spadefoots' highly variable environment. The association between a preferred male signal and adaptive plasticity in his offspring suggests that female mate choice can favour the evolution and maintenance of phenotypic plasticity and thereby foster adaptation to a variable environment.

However, current plastic responses will only remain adaptive under future conditions if informative environmental cues are still available. We briefly summarize current knowledge of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic underpinnings of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, before highlighting the potentially complex effects of global change on cue availability and reliability. We then illustrate some of these aspects with a case study, comparing plasticity of blue tit breeding phenology in two contrasted habitats: evergreen and deciduous forests. Using long-term datasets, we investigate the climatic factors linked to the breeding phenology of the birds and their main food source. Blue tits occupying different habitats differ extensively in the cues affecting laying date plasticity, as well as in the reliability of these cues as predictors of the putative driver of selective pressure, the date of caterpillar peak. The temporal trend for earlier laying date, detected only in the evergreen populations, is explained by increased temperature during their cue windows.

Theory suggests that extreme conditions will expose cryptic phenotypes, with a concomitant increase in trait variation. Although some empirical support for this exists, it is also well established that physiological mechanisms (e.g. heat shock protein expression) change when organisms are exposed to constant versus fluctuating temperatures. To determine the effect of common, rare and novel temperatures on the release of hidden variation, we exposed fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, to five fluctuating and four constant temperature regimes (constant treatments: 23.5, 25, 28.5 and 31°C; all fluctuating treatments shared a minimum temperature of 22°C at 00.00 and a maximum of 25, 28, 31, 34 or 37°C at 12.00). We measured each individual's length weekly over 60 days, critical thermal maximum (CTmax), five morphometric traits (eye anterior-posterior distance, pelvic fin length, pectoral fin length, pelvic fin ray count and pectoral fin ray count) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA, absolute difference between left and right morphometric measurements; FA is typically associated with stress). Length-at-age in both constant and fluctuating conditions decreased with temperature, and this trait's variance decreased with temperature under fluctuating conditions but increased and then decreased in constant temperatures. CTmax in both treatments increased with increasing water temperature, while its variance decreased in warmer waters. No consistent pattern in mean or variance was found across morphometric traits or FA. Our results suggest that, for fathead minnows, variance can decrease in important traits (e.g. length-at-age and CTmax) as the environment becomes more stressful, so it may be difficult to establish comprehensive rules for the effects of rarer or stressful environments on trait variation.

Crystal records can be used to reconstruct magma reservoir histories, and the resulting time and length scales are converging with those accessible through numerical modelling of magma system dynamics. The goal of this contribution is to summarize constraints derived from crystal chronometry (radiometric dating and modelling intracrystalline diffusion durations), in order to facilitate use of these data by researchers in other fields. Crystallization ages of volcanic minerals typically span a large range (104-105 years), recording protracted activity in a given magma reservoir. However, diffusion durations are orders of magnitude shorter, indicating that the final mixing and assembly of erupted magma bodies is rapid. Combining both types of data in the same samples indicates that crystals are dominantly stored at near- or sub-solidus conditions, and are remobilized rapidly prior to eruptions. These observations are difficult to reconcile with some older numerical models of magma reservoir dynamics. However, combining the crystal-scale observations with models which explicitly incorporate grain-scale physics holds great potential for understanding dynamics within crustal magma reservoirs.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 12,"The trans-crustal magma system paradigm is forcing us to re-think processes responsible for magma evolution and eruption. A key concept in petrology is the liquid line of descent (LLD), which relates a series of liquids derived from a single parent, and therefore tracks the inverse of the crystallization path. It is common practice to attribute multiple magma compositions, and/or multiple melt compositions (from melt inclusions and matrix glass), to a single LLD. However, growing evidence for rapid, and often syn-eruptive, assembly of multiple magma components (crystals and melts) from different parts of a magmatic system suggests that erupted magma and melt compositions will not necessarily represent a single LLD, but instead may reflect the multiple paths in pressure-temperature space. Here, we use examples from mafic magmatic systems in both ocean island and arc settings to illustrate the range of melt compositions present in erupted samples, and to explore how they are generated, and how they interact. We highlight processes that may be deduced from mafic melt compositions, including the mixing of heterogeneous primitive liquids from the mantle, pre-eruptive magma storage at a range of crustal and sub-Moho depths, and syn-eruptive mixing of melts generated from these storage regions. The relative dominance of these signatures in the glasses depends largely on the water content of the melts. We conclude that preserved melt compositions provide information that is complementary to that recorded by the volatile contents of crystal-hosted melt inclusions and coexisting mineral compositions, which together can be used to address questions about both the pre- and syn-eruptive state of volcanic systems.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 12,"Geodetic observations on volcanoes can reveal important aspects of crustal magma chambers. The rate of decay of deformation with distance reflects the centroid depth of the chamber. The amplitude of the deformation is proportional to the product of the pressure change and volume of the reservoir. The ratio of horizontal to vertical displacement is sensitive to chamber shape: sills are efficient at generating vertical displacement, while stocks produce more horizontal deformation. Geodesy alone cannot constrain important parameters such as chamber volume or pressure; furthermore, kinematic models have no predictive power. Elastic response combined with influx proportional to pressure gradient predicts an exponentially decaying flux, leading to saw-tooth inflation cycles observed at some volcanoes. Yet many magmatic systems exhibit more complex temporal behaviour. Wall rock adjacent to magma reservoirs cannot behave fully elastically. Modern conceptual models of magma chambers also include cumulate and/or mush zones, with potentially multi-level melt lenses. A viscoelastic shell surrounding a spherical magma chamber significantly modifies the predicted time-dependent response; post-eruptive inflation can occur without recharge if the magma is sufficiently incompressible relative to the surrounding crust (Segall P. 2016 J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth, 121, 8501-8522). Numerical calculations confirm this behaviour for both oblate and prolate ellipsoidal chambers surrounded by viscoelastic aureoles. Interestingly, the response to a nearly instantaneous pressure drop during an explosive eruption can be non-monotonic as the rock around the chamber relaxes at different rates. Pressure-dependent recharge of a non-Newtonian magma in an elastic crust leads to an initially high rate of inflation which slows over time; behaviour that has been observed in some magmatic systems.

Development of this conceptual model was based on observations of the products of magmatism at spreading ridges, including Iceland. Petrological barometry and tracking of the solidification process has been used to show that the Icelandic crust is built by crystallization over a range of depths. The available petrological evidence indicates that most of the active rift zones are not underlain by extensive and pervasive crystal mush. Instead, the microanalytical observations from Iceland are consistent with a model where magmatic processing in the lower crust occurs in sills of decimetric vertical thickness. This stacked sills mode of crustal accretion corresponds to that proposed for the oceanic crust on the basis of ophiolite studies. A key feature of these models is that the country rock for the sills is hot but subsolidus. This condition can be met if the porosity in thin crystal mushes at the margins of the sills is occluded by primitive phases, a contention that is consistent with observations from cumulate nodules in Icelandic basalts. The conditions required for the stabilization of trans-crustal mushes may not be present in magmatic systems at spreading ridges.

The reservoir may contain regions of very low fraction intergranular melt, partially molten rock (mush) and melt lenses (or magma chambers) containing high melt fraction eruptible magma, as well as pockets of exsolved magmatic fluids. The various parts of the system may be separated by a sub-solidus rock or be connected and continuous. Magma reservoirs and their wall rocks span a vast array of rheological properties, covering as much as 25 orders of magnitude from high viscosity, sub-solidus crustal rocks to magmatic fluids.

The melt is injected not just beneath the central volcanoes, but also at discrete locations along the rift zones and above the centre of the underlying mantle plume. We suggest that the high strain rates required to produce seismicity at depths of 10-25 km in a normally ductile part of the Icelandic crust are linked to the exsolution of carbon dioxide from the basaltic melts. The seismicity and geobarometry provide complementary information on the way that the melt moves through the crust, stalling and fractionating, and often freezing in one or more melt lenses on its way upwards: the seismicity shows what is happening instantaneously today, while the geobarometry gives constraints averaged over longer time scales on the depths of residence in the crust of melts prior to their eruption.

The cause of unrest has critical implications for the potential eruptive hazard (e.g. used in constructing Bayesian Event Trees), but is frequently the subject of debate, even at well-studied systems. Here, we propose a set of multi-disciplinary observations and numerical models that could be used to evaluate conceptual models about the cause of unrest. These include measurements of gas fluxes and compositions and the isotopic signature of some components (e.g. H2, He, C, SO2, H2 O, CH4 and CO2), the spatial and temporal characteristics of ground deformation, thermal output, seismicity, changes in gravity, and whether there is topographic uplift or subsidence spanning hundreds to thousands of years. In several volcanic systems, both magmatic and non-magmatic unrest is occurring at the same time.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Impatience-the failure to wait or tolerate delayed rewards (e.g. food, drug and monetary incentives)-is a common behavioural tendency in humans. However, when rigidly and rapidly expressed with limited regard for future, often negative consequences, impatient or impulsive actions underlie and confer susceptibility for such diverse brain disorders as drug addiction, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depressive disorder. Consequently, 'waiting' impulsivity has emerged as a candidate endophenotype to inform translational research on underlying neurobiological mechanisms and biomarker discovery for many of the so-called impulse-control disorders. Indeed, as reviewed in this article, this research enterprise has revealed a number of unexpected targets and mechanisms for intervention. However, in the context of drug addiction, impulsive decisions that maximize short-term gains (e.g. acute drug consumption) over longer-term punishment (e.g. unemployment, homelessness, personal harm) defines one aspect of impulsivity, which may or may not be related to rapid, unrestrained actions over shorter timescales. We discuss the relevance of this distinction in impulsivity subtypes for drug addiction with reference to translational research in humans and other animals.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Self-control refers to the ability to deliberately reject tempting options and instead select ones that produce greater long-term benefits. Although some apparent failures of self-control are, on closer inspection, reward maximizing, at least some self-control failures are clearly disadvantageous and non-strategic. The existence of poor self-control presents an important evolutionary puzzle because there is no obvious reason why good self-control should be more costly than poor self-control. After all, a rock is infinitely patient. I propose that self-control failures result from cases in which well-learned (and thus routinized) decision-making strategies yield suboptimal choices. These mappings persist in the decision-makers' repertoire because they result from learning processes that are adaptive in the broader context, either on the timescale of learning or of evolution. Self-control, then, is a form of cognitive control and the subjective feeling of effort likely reflects the true costs of cognitive control. Poor self-control, in this view, is ultimately a result of bounded optimality.

This is exemplified by the Savage framework, the most popular framework in decision-making research. There, decision-makers are assumed to choose from among available decision options as if they maximized subjective expected utility, which is given by the utilities of outcomes in different states weighted with subjective beliefs about the occurrence of those states. Beliefs are captured by probabilities and new information is incorporated using Bayes' Law. The primary concern of the Savage framework is to ensure that decision-makers' choices are rational. Here, we use concepts from computational complexity theory to expose two major weaknesses of the framework. Firstly, we argue that in most situations, subjective utility maximization is computationally intractable, which means that the Savage axioms are implausible. We discuss empirical evidence supporting this claim. Secondly, we argue that there exist many decision situations in which the nature of uncertainty is such that (random) sampling in combination with Bayes' Law is an ineffective strategy to reduce uncertainty. We discuss several implications of these weaknesses from both an empirical and a normative perspective.

Impulsivity is implicated in virtually all externalizing behaviours and disorders, and figures prominently in the aetiology and long-term sequelae of substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite its robust clinical and predictive validity, the study of impulsivity is complicated by its multidimensional nature, characterized by a variety of trait-like personality dimensions, as well as by more state-dependent neurocognitive dimensions, with variable convergence across measures. This review provides a hierarchical framework for linking self-report and neurocognitive measures to latent constructs of impulsivity and, in turn, to different psychopathology vulnerabilities, including substance-specific addictions and comorbidities.

Choice impulsivity is typically quantified as temporal discounting, a well-documented phenomenon in which a reward's subjective value diminishes as the delay to its delivery is increased. However, an individual's proclivity to-or more commonly aversion to- risk can influence nearly all of the standard experimental tools available for measuring temporal discounting. Despite this interaction, risk preference is a behaviourally and neurobiologically distinct construct that relates to the economic notion of utility or subjective value. In this opinion piece, we discuss the mathematical relationship between risk preferences and time preferences, their neural implementation, and propose ways that research in psychiatry could, and perhaps should, aim to account for this relationship experimentally to better understand choice impulsivity and its clinical implications.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 12,"Immediate and long-term mechanisms interact in the regulation of action. We will examine neurobiology and practical clinical consequences of these interactions. Long-term regulation of immediate behavioural control is based on analogous responses to highly rewarding or stressful stimuli: (i) impulsivity is a failure of the balance between activation and inhibition in the immediate regulation of action. (ii) Sensitization is a persistently exaggerated behavioural or physiological response to highly salient stimuli, such as addictive stimuli or inescapable stress. Sensitization can generalize across classes of stimuli. (iii) Impulsivity, possibly related to poor modulation of catecholaminergic and glutamatergic functions, may facilitate development of long-term sensitized responses to stressful or addictive stimuli. In turn, impulsivity is prominent in sensitized behaviour. (iv) While impulsivity and sensitization are general components of behaviour, their interactions are prominent in the course of bipolar disorder, emphasizing roles of substance-use, recurrent course and stressors. (v) Suicide is a complex and severe behaviour that exemplifies the manner in which impulsivity facilitates behavioural sensitization and is, in turn, increased by it, leading to inherently unpredictable behaviour. (vi) Interactions between impulsivity and sensitization can provide targets for complementary preventive and treatment strategies for severe immediate and long-term behavioural disorders.

The psychologies mediating this effect may become maladaptive in the developed world where food is readily available contributing, potentially, to overeating and obesity. Here, we report our development of a novel touchscreen task in mice allowing comparisons of the impact of food delay and food magnitude across species. We show that mice exhibit the typical preference, as shown by humans, for variable over fixed delays to rewards but no preference when it comes to fixed versus variable reward amounts and further show that this bias is sensitive to manipulations of the 5-HT2C receptor, a key mediator of feeding and impulse control.

Imprinted genes are widely expressed in the brain and have been linked to various phenotypes, including behaviours related to risk tolerance. In this paper, we analyse a model of evolutionary bet-hedging in a system with imprinted gene expression. Previous analyses of bet-hedging have shown that natural selection may favour alleles and traits that reduce reproductive variance, even at the expense of reducing mean reproductive success, with the trade-off between mean and variance depending on the population size. In species where the sexes have different reproductive variances, this bet-hedging trade-off differs between maternally and paternally inherited alleles. Where males have the higher reproductive variance, alleles are more strongly selected to reduce variance when paternally inherited than when maternally inherited. We connect this result to phenotypes connected with specific imprinted genes, including delay discounting and social dominance. The empirical patterns are consistent with paternally expressed imprinted genes promoting risk-averse behaviours that reduce reproductive variance. Conversely, maternally expressed imprinted genes promote risk-tolerant, variance-increasing behaviours. We indicate how future research might further test the hypotheses suggested by our analysis.

This principle, homophily, could structure populations into distinct social groups. We tested this hypothesis in a bottlenose dolphin population that appeared to be clustered around a specialized foraging tactic involving cooperation with net-casting fishermen, but in which other potential drivers of such social structure have never been assessed. We measured and controlled for the contribution of sex, age, genetic relatedness, home range and foraging tactics on social associations to test for homophily effects. Dolphins tended to group with others having similar home ranges and frequency of using the specialized foraging tactic, but not other traits. Such social preferences were particularly clear when dolphins were not foraging, showing that homophily extends beyond simply participating in a specific tactic. Combined, these findings highlight the need to account for multiple drivers of group formation across behavioural contexts to determine true social affiliations. We suggest that homophily around behavioural specialization can be a major driver of social patterns, with implications for other social processes. If homophily based on specialized tactics underlies animal social structures more widely, then it may be important in modulating opportunities for social learning, and therefore influence patterns of cultural transmission.",Cross-cultural evidence does not support universal acceleration of puberty in father-absent households.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966893,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Evolutionary social scientists have proposed several adaptive hypotheses for this finding. Though there is variation in the detail of these hypotheses, they all assume that family environment in early life influences the development of life-history strategy, and, broadly, that early reproductive development is an adaptive response to father absence. Empirical evidence to support these hypotheses, however, has been derived from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) populations. Data from a much broader range of human societies are necessary in order to properly test adaptive hypotheses. Here, we review the empirical literature on father absence and puberty in both sexes, focusing on recent studies that have tested this association beyond the WEIRD world. We find that relationships between father absence and age at puberty are more varied in contexts beyond WEIRD societies, and when relationships beyond the father-daughter dyad are considered.

The fact that it is so common, and rates vary between different populations, raising the question of whether in some circumstances it might be an adaptive trait. In this review, we outline some of the evolutionary explanations put forward for preterm birth. We specifically address the hypothesis of the predictive adaptive response, setting it in the context of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, and explore the predictions that this hypothesis makes for the potential causes and consequences of preterm birth. We describe how preterm birth can be triggered by a range of adverse environmental factors, including nutrition, stress and relative socioeconomic status. Examining the literature for any associated longer-term phenotypic changes, we find no strong evidence for a marked temporal shift in the reproductive life-history trajectory, but more persuasive evidence for a re-programming of the cardiovascular and endocrine system, and a range of effects on neurodevelopment. Distinguishing between preterm birth as a predictive, rather than immediate adaptive response will depend on the demonstration of a positive effect of these alterations in developmental trajectories on reproductive fitness.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 26,"A discrepancy between the phenotype of an individual and that which would confer optimal responses in terms of fitness in an environment is termed 'mismatch'. Phenotype results from developmental plasticity, conditioned partly by evolutionary history of the species and partly by aspects of the developmental environment. We discuss two categories of such mismatch with reference primarily to nutrition and in the context of evolutionary medicine. The categories operate over very different timescales. A developmental mismatch occurs when the phenotype induced during development encounters a different environment post-development. This may be the result of wider environmental changes, such as nutritional transition between generations, or because maternal malnutrition or placental dysfunction give inaccurate information about the organism's likely future environment. An evolutionary mismatch occurs when there is an evolutionarily novel environment. Developmental plasticity may involve immediate adaptive responses (IARs) to preserve survival if an environmental challenge is severe, and/or predictive adaptive responses (PARs) if the challenge does not threaten survival, but there is a fitness advantage in developing a phenotype that will be better adapted later. PARs can have long-term adverse health consequences if there is a developmental mismatch. For contemporary humans, maternal constraint of fetal growth makes PARs likely even if there is no obvious IAR, and this, coupled with the pervasive nutritionally dense modern environment, can explain the widespread observations of developmental mismatch, particularly in populations undergoing nutritional transition. Both developmental and evolutionary mismatch have important public health consequences and implications for where policy interventions may be most effective.

High birth weight caused by maternal gestational diabetes is also associated with later diabetes, suggesting that fetal over-nutrition also has programming effects. Post-natal factors (excess weight gain/obesity, smoking, poor diets and physical inactivity) interact with fetal exposures to increase disease risk. Animal studies have shown permanent metabolic effects in offspring after alterations to maternal or early post-natal diets but evidence in humans is largely limited to observational and quasi-experimental situations such as maternal famine exposure. Randomized trials of maternal nutritional interventions during pregnancy have so far had limited follow-up of the offspring. Moreover, interventions usually started after the first trimester and therefore missed key peri-conceptional or early pregnancy events such as epigenetic changes, placentation and fetal organogenesis. Recent and ongoing trials intervening pre-conceptionally and powered for long-term offspring follow-up will address these issues.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 04 26,"Plasticity is assumed to enable beneficial adjustment to the environment. In this context, developmental plasticity is generally approached within a two-stage framework, whereby adjustments to ecological cues in stage 1 are exposed to selection in stage 2. This conceptual approach may have limitations, because in species providing parental investment, particularly placental mammals such as humans, initial adjustments are not to the environment directly, but rather to the niche generated by parental phenotype (in mammals, primarily that of the mother). Only as maternal investment is withdrawn is the developing organism exposed directly to prevailing ecological conditions. A three-stage model may therefore be preferable, where developmental trajectory first adjusts to maternal investment, then to the external environment. Each offspring experiences a trade-off, benefitting from maternal investment during the most vulnerable stages of development, at the cost of exposure to investment strategies that maximize maternal fitness. Maternal life-history trade-offs impact the magnitude and schedule of her investment in her offspring, generating lifelong effects on traits related to health outcomes. Understanding the imprint of maternal capital on offspring is particularly important in species demonstrating social hierarchy. Interventions targeting maternal capital might offer new opportunities to improve health outcomes of both mother and offspring.

In some cases, these changes may increase offspring fitness but, in others, they can elevate parental fitness at a cost to the fitness of their offspring. We show that in Kalahari meerkats ( Suricata suricatta), the circulating glucocorticoid (GC) hormones of pregnant females affect the growth and cooperative behaviour of their offspring. We performed a 3-year experiment in wild meerkats to test the hypothesis that GC-mediated maternal effects reduce the potential for offspring to reproduce directly and therefore cause them to exhibit more cooperative behaviour. Daughters (but not sons) born to mothers treated with cortisol during pregnancy grew more slowly early in life and exhibited significantly more of two types of cooperative behaviour (pup rearing and feeding) once they were adults compared to offspring from control mothers. They also had lower measures of GCs as they aged, which could explain the observed increases in cooperative behaviour. Because early life growth is a crucial determinant of fitness in female meerkats, our results indicate that GC-mediated maternal effects may reduce the fitness of offspring, but may elevate parental fitness as a consequence of increasing the cooperative behaviour of their daughters.

Methods and Results The cohort consisted of 3271 participants (1712 males and 1559 females) who had BMI and blood pressure ( BP ) repeatedly measured 4 to 11 times during 2004 to 2015 and information on incident hypertension. Four distinct trajectory groups were identified using latent class growth mixture model: low-stable (n=1497), medium-increasing (n=1421), high-increasing (n=291), sharp-increasing (n=62). Model-estimated levels and linear slopes of BMI at each age point between ages 20 and 40 were calculated in 1-year intervals using the latent class growth mixture model parameters and their first derivatives, respectively. Compared with the low-stable group, the hazard ratios and 95% CI were 2.42 (1.88, 3.11), 4.25 (3.08, 5.87), 11.17 (7.60, 16.41) for the 3 increasing groups, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the standardized odds ratios and 95% CI of model-estimated BMI level for incident hypertension increased in 20 to 35 years, ranging from 0.80 (0.72-0.90) to 1.59 (1.44-1.75); then decreased gradually to 1.54 (1.42-1.68). The standardized odds ratio s of level-adjusted linear slopes increased from 1.22 (1.09-1.37) to 1.79 (1.59-2.01) at 20 to 24 years; then decreased rapidly to 1.12 (0.95-1.32). Conclusions These results indicate that the level-independent BMI trajectories during young adulthood have significant impact on hypertension risk. Age between 20 and 30 years is a crucial period for incident hypertension, which has implications for early prevention.",Axonal changes in experimental prion diseases recapitulate those following constriction of postganglionic branches of the superior cervical ganglion: a comparison 40 years later.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966865,Prion,2019 04 19,"The major neurological feature of prion diseases is a neuronal loss accomplished through either apoptosis or autophagy. In this review, I compared axonal alterations in prion diseases to those described 40 years earlier as a result of nerve ligation. I also demonstrated that autophagic vacuoles and autophagosomes are a major part of dystrophic neurites. Furthermore, I summarized the current status of the autophagy in prion diseases and hypothesize, that spongiform change may originate from the autophagic vacuoles. This conclusion should be supported by other methods, in particular laser confocal microscopy. We observed neuronal autophagic vacuoles in different stages of formation, and our interpretation of the 'maturity' of their formation may or may not equate to actual developmental stages. Initially, a part of the neuronal cytoplasm was sequestrated within double or multiple membranes (phagophores) and often exhibited increased electron-density. The intracytoplasmic membranes formed labyrinth-like structures that suggest a multiplication of those membranes. The autophagic vacuoles then expand and eventually, a vast area of the cytoplasm was transformed into a merging mass of autophagic vacuoles. Margaret R. Matthews published a long treatise in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in which she had described in great detail the ultrastructure of postganglionic branches of the superior cervical ganglion in the rat following ligation of them. The earliest changes observed by Matthews between 6 h to 2 days in the proximal stump were distensions of proximal axons. Analogously, in our models, an increased number of 'regular' (round) and 'irregular' MVB and some autophagic vacuoles were observed collectively, both processes were similar."

A latitudinal cline in the critical day lengths for the photoperiodic induction of diapause has been reported in various insect species. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this cline have remained elusive. We approached this issue in the flesh fly Sarcophaga similis, in which the photoperiodic time measurement system meets the ""external coincidence model."" In this model, measuring day lengths depends on whether the photoinducible phase (φi), determined by a circadian clock, is exposed to light or not. First, we detected a clear latitudinal cline in the critical day lengths of flies collected from 4 localities at different latitudes. The phase positions of the φi, which can be verified by night interruption photoperiods, also showed a clear latitudinal cline. This result supports the hypothesis that the latitudinal cline in the critical day length is produced by the difference in the phase positions of the φi among different strains. A sexual difference in the critical day length for photoperiodic induction has also been detected in various species. In this study, a sexual difference in the critical day length was observed in the southern strains but there was no sexual difference in the phase positions of the φi. This result indicates that both sexes measure photoperiods in the same manner. Males are less sensitive than females to the light pulse given at the φi, suggesting a quantitative difference in the photoperiodic time measurement and counter systems. This study clearly reveals that distinct mechanisms induce latitudinal and sexual differences in the critical day length for the photoperiodic induction of diapause in a fly.",Association of STMN1 with survival in solid tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966849,The International journal of biological markers,2019 04 10,"The prognostic value of Stathmin 1 (STMN1) in malignant solid tumors remains controversial.

While women globally are predominantly at risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), FSW are additionally vulnerable to violence from clients, police, and pimps associated with their occupation. FSW are therefore at risk of cumulative trauma from polyvictimization, or violence from multiple types of perpetrators. Polyvictimization is a driver of morbidity and mortality in numerous populations, but there has been little research on how multiple types of victimization are related to one another in FSW. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 754 FSW from three cities in the Russian Federation. Surveys assessed lifetime experiences of client, police, intimate partner, and pimp violence. Multivariate log-binomial and Poisson regression were used to test associations between these types of violence. Forty-five percent experienced any type of violence, including 31.7% from clients, 16.0% from police, 15.7% from intimate partners, and 11.4% from pimps. One fifth (20.4%) experienced polyvictimization. Client violence was central to polyvictimization: Only 5.9% of polyvictimization occurs without client violence. When client violence was not present, police, pimp, or IPV co-occurred significantly less than would be expected under an assumption that these types of violence occur independently ( p < .001). However, they co-occurred more than would be expected when client violence is present. After adjusting for other types of violence experienced and demographic factors, experiencing client violence was independently associated with police violence (adjusted relative risk [ARR] = 2.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.67, 4.59]), IPV (ARR = 3.67, 95% CI [1.95, 6.89]), and pimp violence (ARR = 5.26, 95% CI [2.80, 9.86]). Client violence may drive exposure to other types of violence and enable polyvictimization in a way that other types of violence do not in this setting. Violence prevention interventions may achieve maximal effect in reducing multiple types of violence by focusing on client violence.",Self-Reported Reasons for Abstinence from Illicit Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966846,Substance use & misuse,2019 05 10,"To provide a more balanced understanding of the initiation and restraint of substance use, educators, clinicians, and researchers would benefit from a review of research assessing the reasons nonusers report for having abstained from drugs.",Regulatory B lymphocytes: development and modulation of the host immune response during disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966845,Immunotherapy,2019 05 15,"The role of B lymphocytes (B cells) in immunogenic responses has become increasingly important over the past decade, focusing on a new B-cell subtype: regulatory B-cells (Bregs).

In this review, the occurrence of Breg type in various conditions, along with evidence supporting discovered functions and proposed purposes will be explored. An example of such regulatory functions includes the induction or suppression of various T lymphocyte phenotypes in response to a particular stimulus. Should Bregs prove effective in mediating immune responses, and correlate with favorable disease outcome, they may serve as a novel therapeutic to combat disease and prevent infection. However, the induction, function and stability of these cells remain unclear and further investigation is needed to better understand their role and therapeutic efficacy.","The roles of apoptosis, autophagy and unfolded protein response in arbovirus, influenza virus, and HIV infections.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966844,Virulence,2019 06 10,"Virus infection induces different cellular responses in infected cells.

We retrospectively analyzed the charts of a total of 302 cycles performed in 273 patients attending Diyar Life ART Centre between January 2014 and January 2017. After excluding 232 cycles, we compared pregnancy outcomes of 34 patients who had suboptimal endometrial lining and underwent PRP + FET and 36 patients who had optimal endometrial lining and underwent only FET. We observed that, endometrial thickness was higher after 48 hours from PRP when compared to endometrial thickness before PRP (10 mm vs. 6.25 mm, p < .001). Clinical pregnancy rate, and importantly live birth rate were also significantly higher in PRP group than the control group.

Endometrial tissue samples were obtained from the 24 women with bilateral hydrosalpinx range 19-46 years before and after the surgical treatment, and normal endometrial tissues were collected from five women without hydrosalpinx and evaluated as a control group. In endometrial samples of hydrosalpinx patients; it was observed that large and unregulated interstitial spaces representing the organellar destruction, membranous whorl structures associated with organelle destruction, thinning in the surface epithelium, decreasing in numbers of microvillus and pinopodes in microvilli cells, increasing in heterochromatin and picnotic changes in the nucleus, expansion, and vacuolization in the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the apical cytoplasm and intraepithelial macrophages and lymphocytes were rised in number. Although mild structural changes were observed in endometrial tissues obtained after surgical treatment of hydrosalpinx, surface epithelium, glandular and stromal cell structures were more similar to control endometrial specimens. In conclusion; serious structural changes have occurred in endometrial tissues of hydrosalpinx patients. These structural abnormalities have removed after surgical treatment so it is considered that surgical treatment is effective in patients with hydrosalpinx."

It builds on recent scholarship to argue for the significance of slaves in the acquisition of plant material and related knowledge in pharmaceutical, acclimatization, and private gardens on the French colonial island. I highlight the degree to which French colonial officials relied on slaves' ethnobotanical knowledge but neglected to include such information in their published works. Rather than seeking to explore the status of such knowledge within European frameworks of natural history as an endpoint of knowledge production, this essay calls upon us to think about the plant knowledge that slaves possessed for its practical implementations in the local island context. Both female and male slaves' plant-based knowledge enriched - even initiated - practices of cultivation and preparation techniques of plants for nourishment and medicinal uses. Here, cultivational knowledge and skills determined a slave's hierarchical rank.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reviewing literature to provide an updated response to health care providers.","Patterns of All-Cause Mortality in Papua New Guinea, 2011.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966781,Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2019 04 10,"Existing estimates of mortality for Papua New Guinea (PNG) have primarily been based on models using little empirical data, and without estimation of life expectancy at subnational level. We used data on deaths from the 2000 and 2011 censuses and indirect demographic methods to estimate under-5 mortality (5q0), adult mortality (45q15), and life expectancy by province and sex. A Socioeconomic Composite Index was constructed to assess the plausibility of life expectancy estimates. We generated 5q0 estimates (68 per 1000 live births for males and 58 for females), 45q15 (269 per 1000 for males and 237 for females), and life expectancy (62.0 years for males and 64.3 for females) in PNG in 2011. Provinces with low life expectancy had correspondingly low levels of development as measured by the Composite Index, and vice versa. These subnational estimates of mortality levels and patterns maybe useful at the provincial level to improve population health in PNG.",Surgical Tips for Performing Open Fasciotomies for Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome of the Leg.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966780,Foot & ankle international,2019 04 10,"Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) of the leg is a debilitating condition that has previously been characterized in athletes and military personnel.

The data were based on the vital registration system in China from 2003 to 2012. The annual percentage change used Joinpoint Regression Analysis. Spline functions were fitted to the age-period-cohort analysis. The average age-adjusted diabetes mortality rate was higher in women than in men, and it was higher in urban than in rural residents among both genders. The trend analysis of diabetes showed a favorable pattern among urban residents in both genders. Mortality increased with age, and compared with period and cohort effects, age effects were the most important risk factor in diabetes mortality. Although the overall trends in diabetes mortality decelerated, aging and rural-urban differences could still be driving the epidemic underlining a continued need for the priorities for health care programs to focus on predictors in diabetes mortality."

The formative assessment identified specific training and practice facilitation needs and provided valuable insight for choosing evaluation metrics. Incorporating staff input fostered staff engagement in laying the foundation of the transformation and helped build a sense of ownership of the transformative process. Through the formative assessment process we gained insight into the organization's HIV practice and improved our ability to align practice transformation goals with evaluation metrics to better measure changes resulting from the model implementation.

Less than half of participants (47.2%) were aware of PrEP; however, when it was described to them, the majority (72.2%) indicated PrEP acceptability. In multivariable analyses, condomless anal sex was negatively associated with PrEP awareness, and higher levels of vicarious stigma and anticipated PrEP disclosure to sexual partners were positively associated with PrEP acceptability. Our findings indicate the need for targeted interventions to increase PrEP awareness among MSM engaged in high-risk behaviors and implementation strategies that address sociocultural factors to accelerate PrEP utilization among MSM in Taiwan.","Interprofessional Collaboration and On-the-Job Training Improve Access to HIV Testing, HIV Primary Care, and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966764,AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,2019 06 07,"The HIV Continuum of Care is a global priority, yet vulnerable patients face access/retention challenges.

Semistructured focus groups and in-depth individual interviews were conducted among 57 adolescents 16-17 years of age, living with and without HIV, and 25 clinical service providers. Adolescents and service providers expressed concerns that the availability of PrEP would lead to sexual disinhibition and a reduction in condom use among adolescents. Unexpected positive impacts included predictions that PrEP might encourage disclosure in serodiscordant partnerships and help normalize pill-taking in the community.

Experiments are able to provide only limited insights on the dynamics of blend morphology of these organic materials because of the challenges in extracting microstructural characterization amidst the poor contrast in electron microscopy. We present results from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CGMD) describing the morphological evolution of P3HT/PCBM active layer under solution processing in chlorobenzene (CB). We examine the impact of various processing parameters such as weight ratio, degree of polymerization (DOP), thermal annealing, and preheating on the BHJ active layers using morphological characterizations from atomic trajectories. Simulated diffraction patterns are compared with experimental results of X-ray diffraction and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Both simulated scattering and experimental X-ray diffraction and X-ray scattering measurements reveal increase in crystallinity for P3HT upon annealing until PCBM weight fraction ∼50%. The solubility of PCBM being greater in CB than that of P3HT facilitates the phase separation of the polymer during early stages of solvent evaporation. An increase in the average size of the P3HT domain relative to the preannealed morphology, is due to phase segregation and crystallization of the polymer upon annealing. Percolation for PCBM remains unchanged until PCBM constitutes at least one-half of the composition. Although 1.0:2.0 weight ratio is predicted to be ideal for balanced charge transport, 1.0:1.0 weight ratio is the most beneficial of overall power conversion based on exciton generation and charge separation at the interface. DOP of P3HT molecules is another important design variable as larger P3HT molecules tend to entangle more often deteriorating molecular order of P3HT phase in the active layer. Preheating the ternary mixture of P3HT, PCBM, and CB modifies the structural order and morphology of the BHJ due to changes in PCBM diffusion into the P3HT phase.",Construction of a Quadrangular Tetramer and a Cage-Like Hexamer from Three-Helix Bundle-Linked Fusion Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966743,ACS synthetic biology,2019 05 17,"Self-assembled protein nanostructures have gained interest, owing to their potential applications in biomaterials; however, successful design and construction of protein nanostructures are limited. Herein, we constructed fusion protein 1 by linking the C-terminus of a dimerization domain and the N-terminus of another dimerization domain with a three-helix bundle protein, where it self-assembled mainly into tetramers. By replacing the C-terminal dimerization domain of 1 with a trimerization domain (fusion protein 2), hexamers were mainly obtained. According to ab initio structural models reconstructed from the small-angle X-ray scattering data, the tetramer of 1 and hexamer of 2 adopted quadrangle and cage-like structures, respectively, although they were combinations of different conformations. High-speed atomic force microscopy observations indicated that the tetramer and hexamer exhibit conformational dynamics. These results show that the present method utilizing three-helix bundle-linked fusion proteins is useful in the construction of protein nanostructures.",Photo- and Aromatic Stacking-Induced Green Emissive Peptidyl Nanoparticles for Cell Imaging and Monitoring of Nucleic Acid Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966742,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 02,"Owing to their potential applications in biomedicine and biotechnology, peptide nanostructures that exhibit stable intrinsic fluorescence in the visible range are highly desired. This research proposes a facile strategy to construct peptidyl virus-like nanoparticles (NVPs) that show green luminescence by coassembly of two bioactive ferrocene-diphenylalanine-based (Fc-FF) peptides. The green fluorescence of NVPs was originated from the highly ordered structures assembled by the amphiphilic Fc-FF-based peptides via strong π-π stacking interactions. In the assemblies, Fc-FF chromophore can be hydrolyzed under the natural light irradiation, which eliminates the fluorophore quenching effect of Fc and increases the aromatic stacking interactions, thereby giving rise to strong fluorescent nanoparticles. The NVPs could cross cytomembrane barriers by virtue of the HIV V3 peptide and the nuclear localization signal, and could thus be used for long-term cell imaging with excellent photostability and biocompatibility in physiological condition. In addition, NVPs could package DNA and be used to monitor the delivery of DNA, indicating great potential in the tracking and monitoring of genetic biological processes.","Spontaneous Formation of a Cross-Linked Supramolecular Polymer Both in the Solid State and in Solution, Driven by Platinum(II) Metallacycle-Based Host-Guest Interactions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966741,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 24,"The recent progress in platinum(II) coordination-driven supramolecular polymers has had a substantial effect on the design of functional soft materials.

The real-time views showed that during discharge flower-like Li2O2 formed in the electrolyte with DBBQ but small toroid without DBBQ. Upon charge, Li2O2 decomposes at a slow rate from bottom to top in the absence of DBBQ, yet with an outside-in approach in the presence of DBBQ. Bigger discharge products and more efficient decomposition pathways in the DBBQ-containing system reveal the catalytic activity of DBBQ straightforwardly.

Unlike natural enzymes, the nanoscale properties of nanozymes endow them with the potential to regulate their enzymatic-like activity from different perspectives. The mechanisms behind those methods are intriguing. In this Review, we introduce these mechanisms from the aspects of surface chemistry, surface modification, molecular imprinting, and hybridization and then focus attention on some specific catalytic mechanisms of several representative nanozymes. The applications of nanozymes ranging from bioassay, imaging, to disease therapy are also discussed in detail to prove the fact that the inherent physicochemical properties of nanomaterials not only make nanozymes the analogues of biological enzymes, but also endow them with incomparable advantages and broad prospects in biomedical fields. Finally, four characteristics and some challenges of nanozymes are summarized.","Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Mediates Nitric-Oxide-Induced Chilling Tolerance and Defense Response in Postharvest Peach Fruit.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966738,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"The function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) on nitric oxide (NO)-induced chilling tolerance and defense response in postharvest peach fruit was explored. The postharvest fruit were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, exogenous NO donor), cPTIO (NO scavenger), and neomycin (IP3 inhibitor). It turned out that SNP treatment mitigated chilling injury (CI) and stimulated NO accumulation in postharvest peach fruit. Further, SNP enhanced phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity and, thereby, stimulated IP3 prodution. SNP also upregulated the activity and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR). In addition, SNP enhanced the expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) and weakened the activity and expression of lipoxygenase (LOX) and phospholipase D (PLD). These above impacts stimulated by SNP treatment were blocked by the addition of cPTIO and neomycin.

Among these fluorophores, benzopyran-coumarin (BC) based fluorescent platform has attracted increasing attention as it shows multiple appropriate fluorescent and imaging capacities. Nevertheless, the analytical potential of BC is still urgently needed to be further excavated as its detection performance is hindered by the inherent drawbacks of current BC skeleton, that is, limited number of reactive sites. As such, in this work, by simply introducing electron-withdrawing (EW) substituent groups, we reconstructed BC skeleton to afford two fluorescent probes, BCB (-Br substitued) and BCN (-NO2 substitued), both of which featured two highly reactive sites. These two probes were capable of detecting peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and biothiols (hydrogen sulfide, glutathione, cysteine, and homocysteine) through naked eye and UV-vis absorption analysis in buffer solution. In addition, BCB was able to specifically sense biothiols with fluorescent analysis while BCN, with - NO2 instead of -Br, displayed more prominent fluorescent specificity toward ONOO-.

Recently, evidence has shown that these EDCs could cause chronic health problems, such as obesity, and referred to as metabolic disruptors. However, the disturbance to lipid metabolism caused by OPFRs remains poorly understood, especially at biological molecular levels. Herein, we used the human hepatocellular cells (HepG2) to study the lipid metabolism disruption caused by nine OPFRs (halogenated-, aryl-, and alkyl-containing). All the tested OPFRs, excluding the long carbon chain alkyl-OPFRs, could cause intracellular triglyceride (TG) and/or total cholesterol (TC) accumulation. In detail, aryl-OPFRs (TPhP and TCP) induced both TC and TG deposition. Halogenated-OPFRs (TCEP, TBPP, TDCPP, and TCPP) induced intracellular TG accumulation, and only TDCPP also induced TC accumulation. Furthermore, TPhP induced lipid accumulation through regulation genes encoding proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid, and fatty acid synthesis. All the halogenated-OPFRs cause TG accumulation only, enacted through β-oxidation rather than lipid synthesis. TPhP and TDCPP induced TC accumulation through both PPARγ and srebp2 signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction including decreased oxygen consumption rate and ATP content may also contribute to lipid metabolic disruption by the tested OPFRs. Our data indicated that halogenated- and aryl-OPFRs may not be safe candidates, and further information should be made available as potential for, as well as the mechanism of, metabolic disruption. And long carbon chain alkyl-OPFRs may be safer than the other two groups."

Since up to now primarily poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been investigated to shield non-viral carriers for systemic delivery, we report on the use of polysarcosine (pSar) as a potential alternative for steric stabilization. A redox-sensitive, cationizable lipo-oligomer structure (containing two cholanic acids attached via a bioreducible disulfide linker to an oligoaminoamide backbone in T-shape configuration) was equipped with azide-functionality by solid phase supported synthesis. After mixing with small interfering RNA (siRNA), lipopolyplexes formed spontaneously and were further surface-functionalized with polysarcosines. Polysarcosine was synthesized by living controlled ring-opening polymerization using an azide-reactive dibenzo-aza-cyclooctyne-amine as an initiator. The shielding ability of the resulting formulations was investigated with biophysical assays and by near-infrared fluorescence bioimaging in mice. The modification of ~100 nm lipopolyplexes was only slightly increased upon functionalization. Cellular uptake into cells was strongly reduced by the pSar shielding. Moreover, polysarcosine-shielded polyplexes showed enhanced blood circulation times in bioimaging studies compared to unshielded polyplexes and similar to PEG-shielded polyplexes. Therefore, polysarcosine is a promising alternative for the shielding of non-viral, lipo-cationic polyplexes.",Enzymatic Degradation of Poly(butylene succinate) Copolyesters Synthesized with the Use of Candida antarctica Lipase B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966722,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Biodegradable polymers are an active area of investigation, particularly ones that can be produced from sustainable, biobased monomers, such as copolymers of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS). In this study, we examine the enzymatic degradation of poly(butylene succinate-dilinoleic succinate) (PBS-DLS) copolymers obtained by ""green"" enzymatic synthesis using lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB). The copolymers differed in their hard to soft segments ratio, from 70:30 to 50:50 wt %. Enzymatic degradation was carried out on electrospun membranes (scaffolds) and compression-moulded films using lipase from Pseudomomas cepacia. Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as a reference aliphatic polyester. The degradation process was monitored gravimetrically via water uptake and mass loss. After 24 days, approx. 40% mass loss was observed for fibrous materials prepared from the PBS-DLS 70:30 copolymer, as compared to approx. 10% mass loss for PBS-DLS 50:50. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis were used to examine changes in chemical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning light microscopy (LSM) revealed changes in degree of crystallinity, and changes in surface morphology, consistent with a surface erosion mechanism. We conclude that the obtained copolymers are suitable for tissue engineering applications thanks to tuneable degradation and lack of acidification during breakdown.","Modular Synthesis of Bioreducible Gene Vectors through Polyaddition of N,N'-Dimethylcystamine and Diglycidyl Ethers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966721,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Bioreducible, cationic linear poly(amino ether)s (PAEs) were designed as promising gene vectors. These polymers were synthesized by the reaction of a disulfide-functional monomer, N,N'-dimethylcystamine (DMC), and several different diglycidyl ethers. The resulting PAEs displayed a substantial buffer capacity (up to 64%) in the endosomal acidification region of pH 7.4⁻5.1. The PAEs condense plasmid DNA into 80⁻200 nm sized polyplexes, and have surface charges ranging from +20 to +40 mV. The polyplexes readily release DNA upon exposure to reducing conditions (2.5 mM DTT) due to the cleavage of the disulfide groups that is present in the main chain of the polymers, as was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Upon exposing COS-7 cells to polyplexes that were prepared at polymer/DNA w/w ratios below 48, cell viabilities between 80⁻100% were observed, even under serum-free conditions. These polyplexes show comparable or higher transfection efficiencies (up to 38%) compared to 25 kDa branched polyethylenimine (PEI) polyplexes (12% under serum-free conditions). Moreover, the PAE-based polyplexes yield transfection efficiencies as high as 32% in serum-containing medium, which makes these polymers interesting for gene delivery applications.",Modification of PSf/SPSf Blended Porous Support for Improving the Reverse Osmosis Performance of Aromatic Polyamide Thin Film Composite Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966720,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this study, modification of polysulfone (PSf)/sulfonated polysulfone (SPSf) blended porous ultrafiltration (UF) support membranes was proposed to improve the reverse osmosis (RO) performance of aromatic polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes. The synergistic effects of solvent, polymer concentration, and SPSf doping content in the casting solution were investigated systematically on the properties of both porous supports and RO membranes. SEM and AFM were combined to characterize the physical properties of the membranes, including surface pore natures (porosity, mean pore radius), surface morphology, and section structure. A contact angle meter was used to analyze the membrane surface hydrophilicity. Permeate experiments were carried out to evaluate the separation performances of the membranes. The results showed that the PSf/SPSf blended porous support modified with 6 wt % SPSf in the presence of DMF and 14 wt % PSf had higher porosity, bigger pore diameter, and a rougher and more hydrophilic surface, which was more beneficial for fabrication of a polyamide TFC membrane with favorable reverse osmosis performance. This modified PSf/SPSf support endowed the RO membrane with a more hydrophilic surface, higher water flux (about 1.2 times), as well as a slight increase in salt rejection than the nascent PSf support. In a word, this work provides a new facile method to improve the separation performance of polyamide TFC RO membranes via the modification of conventional PSf porous support with SPSf.",A Radio-Fluorogenic Polymer-Gel Makes Fixed Fluorescent Images of Complex Radiation Fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966719,Polymers,2019 04 12,"We review the development and application of an organic polymer-gel capable of producing fixed, three-dimensional fluorescent images of complex radiation fields. The gel consists for more than 99% of γ-ray-polymerized (~15% conversion) tertiary-butyl acrylate (TBA) containing ~100 ppm of a fluorogenic compound, e.g., maleimido-pyrene (MPy). The radio-fluorogenic effect depends on copolymerization of the MPy into growing chains of TBA on radiation-induced polymerization. This converts the maleimido residue, which quenches the pyrene fluorescence, into a succinimido moeity (SPy), which does not. The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the yield of free-radicals formed and hence to the local dose deposited. Because the SPy moieties are built into the polymer network, the image is fixed. The method of preparing the gel and imaging the radiation-induced fluorescence are presented and discussed. The effect is illustrated with fluorescent images of the energy deposited in the gel by beams of X-rays, electrons, and protons as well as a radioactive isotope.",Analysis of the Models of Motion of Aqueous Solutions of Polymers on the Basis of Their Exact Solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966718,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The qualitative properties of solutions of a hereditary model of motion of aqueous solutions of polymers, its modification in the limiting case of short relaxation times, and a similar second grade fluid model are studied. Unsteady shear flows are considered. In the first case, their properties are similar to those of motion of a usual viscous fluid. Other models can include weak discontinuities, which are retained in the course of fluid motion. Exact solutions are found by using the group analysis of the examined systems of equations. These solutions describe the fluid motion in a gap between coaxial rotating cylinders, the stagnation point flow, and the motion in a half-space induced by plane rotation (analog of the Karman vortex). The problem of motion of an aqueous solution of a polymer in a cylindrical tube under the action of a streamwise pressure gradient is considered. In this case, a flow with straight-line trajectories is possible (analog of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow). In contrast to the latter, however, the pressure in the flow considered here depends on all three spatial variables.",An Analytical Model of Interlaminar Fracture of Polymer Composite Reinforced by Carbon Fibres Grafted with Carbon Nanotubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966717,Polymers,2019 04 12,"An analytical model was developed to study the interlaminar fracture behaviour of polymer composite reinforced by carbon fibres grafted with carbon nanotubes. Delamination properties, such as load with displacement or crack (R-curve) and toughness with crack (GR-curve), can be obtained from this model. The bridging laws presented, based on the CNT pullout mechanism (CNT pullout from polymer matrix) and the CNT sword-in-sheath mechanism (CNT breakage), were incorporated into the proposed analytical model to investigate the influence of the structure of CNT growth onto CFs (CNT@CFs) on delamination properties. The numerical results showed that different toughening mechanisms led to different features of GR-curves, R-curves, and load with displacement curves. Parametric study demonstrated that strengthening the CNT@CF interface resulted in significant improvement in toughness. Further, it was found that elastic deformation of CNTs played an important role in the toughness improvement in the CNT sword-in-sheath mechanism, but no such role was evident in the CNT pullout mechanism.","Sol-Gel Synthesis, Spectroscopic and Thermal Behavior Study of SiO₂/PEG Composites Containing Different Amount of Chlorogenic Acid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966716,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this work, new phenol-based materials have been synthesized by the sol-gel method, in which different amounts of the phenolic antioxidant chlorogenic acid (CGA) (from 5 wt % to 20 wt %) were embedded in two different silica matrices: pure silica and silica-based hybrids materials, containing 50 wt % of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The incorporation of CGA in different sol-gel matrices might protect them from degradation, which could cause the loss of their properties. The two series of materials were chemically characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, the thermal behavior of both series of materials containing CGA was studied by thermogravimetry under both air and inert N₂ flowing gas atmosphere. The bioactivity was evaluated by soaking the synthesized hybrids in a simulated body fluid, showing that the bioactivity of the silica matrix is not modified by the presence of PEG and CGA.",Fabric Coated with Shape Memory Polyurethane and Its Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966715,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In order to provide thermo-physiological comfort to the wearer, textile materials should have some functional property like water-resistance or water vapor transmission (WVT), so that perspiration can evaporate and be transmitted from the body surface to the environment even in extreme weather conditions that require wind and rain proof. Shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) could possibly be a candidate; it is a functional textile material that meets such requirements. In this research, we synthesized a series of SMPUs, which are responsive materials, to test whether these coated cotton fabrics could provide thermal insulation with lower permeability at low temperature or low relative humidity (RH), and high permeability at room temperature or above, or high relative humidity with its water-resistance property. In this paper, we have proposed a segmented shape memory polyurethane for coated textiles in order to have a water-resistant textile with good water vapor transmitting ability."

In this context, lignin could be considered a promising candidate to be used as a bio-sourced thickening agent to formulate eco-friendly lubricating greases. In this work, alkali lignin (AL) was chemically modified with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE). Afterwards, the epoxidized lignin was properly dispersed in castor oil (CO) in order to obtain an oleogel for lubricant applications. The epoxidized lignins were characterized by means of epoxy index determination, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The epoxide-functionalized lignin-based oleogels were analyzed from both rheological and tribological points of view. It was found that the viscosity, consistency and viscoelastic functions of these oleogels clearly increased with the epoxy index of the epoxide-modified lignin compound. Thermo-rheological characterization of these oleogels revealed a slight thermal dependence of the viscoelastic moduli below 100 °C, but a significant softening above that critical temperature. In general, these oleogels showed low values of the friction coefficient under the mixed lubrication regime as compared to the neat castor oil.",Heterogeneous Catalytic Composites from Palladium Nanoparticles in Montmorillonite Intercalated with Poly (Vinyl Pyrrolidone) Chains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966703,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this study, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) chains intercalated montmorillonite (MMT) matrices has been demonstrated as an excellent scaffolding material for the immobilization of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles to prepare efficient heterogeneous catalysts for Heck reactions. Multiple layers (up to four) of PVP chains can intercalate the interlayer space of the MMT, resulting in an increase therein from 1.25 to 3.22 nm. MMT/PVP with PVP loading (20%) was selected as the platform for the immobilization of Pd. The in-situ reduction of the chelated Pd2+ into Pd⁰ in the interlayer space of MMT/PVP composite could be easily achieved. For the prepared Pd@MMT/PVP catalytic composite, a unique maze-like microstructure of Pd nanoparticles tightly encaged by PVP chains and by lamellae of layered silica has been detected by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furthermore, the microstructure is well elucidated in molecular level by positron annihilation lifetime analysis of the Pd@MMT/PVP catalytic composite. The prepared Pd@MMT/PVP catalysts were highly active for the Heck coupling reactions between aromatic halides and alkenes, and could be recycled 9 times without significant decreases in coupling yields. The excellent comprehensive catalytic performances of the Pd@MMT/PVP catalytic composites are mainly attributed to their unique maze-like microstructure.",Visco-Hyperelastic Model with Damage for Simulating Cyclic Thermoplastic Elastomers Behavior Applied to an Industrial Component.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966702,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this work a nonlinear phenomenological visco-hyperelastic model including damage consideration is developed to simulate the behavior of Santoprene 101-73 material. This type of elastomeric material is widely used in the automotive and aeronautic sectors, as it has multiple advantages. However, there are still challenges in properly analyzing the mechanical phenomena that these materials exhibit. To simulate this kind of material a lot of theories have been exposed, but none of them have been endorsed unanimously. In this paper, a new model is presented based on the literature, and on experimental data. The test samples were extracted from an air intake duct component of an automotive engine. Inelastic phenomena such as hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity and damage are considered singularly in this model, thus modifying and improving some relevant models found in the literature. Optimization algorithms were used to find out the model parameter values that lead to the best fit of the experimental curves from the tests. An adequate fitting was obtained for the experimental results of a cyclic uniaxial loading of Santoprene 101-73.",Effect of Graphene Nano-Additives on the Local Mechanical Behavior of Derived Polymer Nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966701,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this study, indentation tests of graphene-based polymer nanocomposites were carried out to determine the local elastic mechanical properties. The samples consist of epoxy matrix with graphene additives. Additives were added at levels of 0% as a control, 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% by weight. The local elastic properties such as moduli and hardness were calculated. After each indentation, the prints were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It seems that the local mechanical properties of nanocomposite samples were improved as the amount of nano-additives increased. Based on the curve displacement and surface imaging, we can conclude that the nano-additives influenced the overall plastic mechanical behavior of the samples. For simulating micro-indentation test, a finite element analysis model was developed using ABAQUS software and compared to experimental tests. Good correlation was observed.",Fused Deposition Modeling of ABS-Barium Titanate Composites: A Simple Route towards Tailored Dielectric Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966700,Polymers,2019 04 12,"A process for the development, characterization and correlation of composite materials for 3D printing is presented, alongside the processing of a polymer-ceramic functional composite using fused deposition modeling (FDM). The composite was developed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as the matrix material filled with barium titanate (BT) micro-powder up to 35 vol % (74.2 wt %). The ABS-BT composites exhibited a shear thinning behavior with increasing ceramic content. The composite was 3D printed into structural and functional test samples using FDM by adapting and optimizing the print parameters. Structural characterization revealed increasingly brittle behavior at higher filler ratios, with the ultimate tensile strength falling from 25.5 MPa for pure ABS to 13.7 MPa for the ABS-35 vol % BT composite. Four-point flexural tests showed a similar decrease in flexural strength with increasing ceramic content. Functional characterization revealed an increase in the relative permittivity at 200 kHz from 3.08 for pure ABS to 11.5 for the composite with 35 vol % BT. These results were correlated with the Maxwell-Garnett and Jayasundere-Smith effective medium models. The process described in this work can be used for other 3D printing processes and provides a framework for the rapid prototyping of functional composites into functional parts with reliable properties. The ABS-BT composite shows promise as a functional dielectric material, with potential applications as capacitors and light-weight passive antennas.",Trithiocarbonate-Functionalized PNiPAAm-Based Nanocomposites for Antimicrobial Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966699,Polymers,2019 04 12,"In this study, four trithiocarbonate-functionalized PNiPAAms with different molecular weights were synthesized and used as a matrix to form composites with silver nanoparticles. Nanocomposites with several polymer-to-silver ratios P:Ag⁺ were prepared in order to evaluate the influence of silver loading. UV studies showed a thermoresponsive behavior of the nanocomposites with a thermo-reversibility according to cooling-heating cycles. Release kinetics demonstrated that the release of silver ions is mainly influenced by the size of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which themselves depend on the polymer length. Antimicrobial tests against E. coli and S. aureus showed that some of the nanocomposites are antimicrobial and even full killing could be induced.",Preparation and Properties of 3D Printed Alginate⁻Chitosan Polyion Complex Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966698,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing holds great potential for preparing sophisticated scaffolds for tissue engineering. As a result of the shear thinning properties of an alginate solution, it is often used as 3D printing ink. However, it is difficult to prepare scaffolds with complexity structure and high fidelity, because the alginate solution has a low viscosity and alginate hydrogels prepared with Ca2+ crosslinking are mechanically weak. In this work, chitosan powders were dispersed and swelled in an alginate solution, which could effectively improve the viscosity of an alginate solution by 1.5⁻4 times. With the increase of chitosan content, the shape fidelity of the 3D printed alginate⁻chitosan polyion complex (AlCh PIC) hydrogels were improved. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs showed that the lateral pore structure of 3D printed hydrogels was becoming more obvious. As a result of the increased reaction ion pairs in comparison to the alginate hydrogels that were prepared with Ca2+ crosslinking, AlCh PIC hydrogels were mechanically strong, and the compression stress of hydrogels at a 90% strain could achieve 1.4 MPa without breaking. In addition, human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs) adhered to the 3D printed AlCh PIC hydrogels and proliferated with time, which indicated that the obtained hydrogels were biocompatible and could potentially be used as scaffolds for tissue engineering.",Compression Garments for Medical Therapy and Sports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966697,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Compression garments are elastic clothing with an engineered compression gradient that can be worn on limbs, upper, lower, or full body to use for therapy and sports.

Using the high-dilution coupling of the bi-functional monomers maleic acid and bis(chloroethyl)ether in a sol-gel chemistry synthesis, 11-membered chelate rings infused with three oxygen donor atoms were created and characterized, and their structures confirmed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses. The macrocyclic gel, designed for selective host-guest adsorption and complexation of metal substrates, was initially tested against an aqueous set of 14 metal competitive solutions, where it demonstrated exclusive selectivity for Bi3+aq, with the other metals exhibiting zero adsorption. Further analysis using binary and single ion Bi3+-containing solutions showed a near-complete removal of Bi3+ using this polycyclic hydrogel, with 98% extraction efficiency and q = 9.80 mg/g. These results clearly confirm that the 1,4,7-trioxacycloundecane-8,11-dione cyclic sites are most suitable for high selectivity and capture of Bi. The metal substrates were entrapped within the 1,4,7-trioxacycloundecane-8,11-dione cyclic sites. Evidently, by exploiting the host-guest complexation chemistry of macrocycles, we were able to design hydrogel adsorbents whose networks were comprised entirely of macrocyclic active groups for possible purification works of copper involving bismuth impurities, and/or for efficient selective uptake and recovery of bismuth trace ions existing in highly competitive environments such as sea water.",Tensile Creep Behavior of Quasi-Unidirectional E-Glass Fabric Reinforced Polypropylene Composite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966695,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The present work addressed the creep behavior of quasi-unidirectional E-glass fabric reinforced polypropylene composites under off-axis tensile loading.

The creep response of off-axis samples of quasi-unidirectional composites under a constant loading level can be clearly observed. A phenomenological viscoplasticity model was built for describing the creep behavior of the composite. To improve the accuracy of prediction, cyclic loading-unloading tests were adopted to determine the material constants in the model. The predicted results in terms of the strains after a load over a period of time were found to be satisfactory, compared with the experimental results. In addition, same failure mechanism was found in off-axis samples under quasi-static and creep loading cases."

The PNA was fabricated by the sequential depositions of the SiO₂ and Ag layers on a UV-nanoimprinted nanodot array with a pitch of 500 nm, a diameter of 250 nm, and a height of 100 nm. During the deposition processes, the shape of the nanodots changed to that of nanolenses, and the gap between the nanolenses was decreased via sidewall deposition. To examine the feasibility of the fabricated PNA for enhanced fluorescence application, a streptavidin-Cy5 (SA-Cy5) conjugate dissolved in a saline buffer solution was spotted on the PNA, and the fluorescence signals of the SA-Cy5 were measured and compared with those on a bare glass substrate. The enhancement factor was affected by the gap between the nanolenses, and the maximum enhancement factor of ~128 was obtained from the PNA with a SiO₂ layer thickness of 150 nm and an Ag layer thickness of 100 nm.

The UV⁻Vis spectroscopic analysis, which was employed to monitor the reaction, revealed the rapid formation of yellowish-brown products at pH 12 and 90 °C, and the great impact of glucose content on the quantity of the products. The FT-IR analysis validated the formation of melanoidin colorants. The silk fiber dyed with the PGA/Glc reaction products at pH 3 displayed a yellowish-brown color, and had very good wash and rub fastness, but poor light fastness. The incorporation of the UV-absorbing moiety into the PGA/Glc reaction products enhanced their light stability. The SEM analysis revealed that the dyed silk fiber was covered by polymeric substances.

We illustrate how it is possible to assign 13C NMR spectra of cyclic olefin-based copolymers by selecting the proper tools, which include synthesis of copolymers with different comonomer content and by catalysts with different symmetries, the use of one- or two-dimensional NMR techniques. The consideration of conformational characteristics of copolymer chain, as well as the exploitation of all the peak areas of the spectra by accounting for the stoichoimetric requirements of the copolymer chain and the best fitting of a set of linear equation was obtained.

The results were compared to blends of PVC/di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most commonly used commercial plasticizer. DEHP has come under scrutiny, due to its suspected endocrine-disrupting behaviour, and the proposed diol dibenzoates have previously been shown to have the potential to be green, safe candidates for DEHP replacement. The thermal and mechanical properties of PVC/dibenzoate blends were determined, and include glass transition temperature (Tg), the elongation at break, maximum stress, apparent moduli, torsional modulus, and surface hardness. The C3, C5, and C6 dibenzoates performed as well as or better than DEHP, with the exception of torsional modulus, further supporting their use as green plasticizers. For blends with 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate, differential scanning calorimetry and torsional temperature sweeps suggested that the compound partly crystallizes within PVC blends over the course of two days, thereby losing the ability to effectively plasticize PVC. However, upon heating to temperatures above 60 °C, effective plasticization was again observed. 1,4-Butanediol dibenzoate is thereby a reversible heat-activated plasticizer or processing aid with excellent plasticizer properties at mildly elevated temperatures.",Dual Stimuli-Responsive P(NIPAAm-co-SPA) Copolymers: Synthesis and Response in Solution and in Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966679,Polymers,2019 04 12,"We present the synthesis and solution properties of dual stimuli-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-spiropyran acrylate) (P(NIPAAm-co-SPA)) copolymers of varying composition prepared via nitroxide-mediated copolymerization.

In aqueous solution, a custom-made setup using a fiber-coupled 200 W Hg(Xe) lamp with 340 and 540 nm filters was used and additional heating of the copolymer solutions during irradiation allowed to study influence of the presence of either the spiropyran or merocyanine form on the cloud point temperature. Hereby, it was found that increasing the SPA content leads to a more pronounced difference between both states and decreasing cloud points in general.",Prediction of the Tensile Response of Carbon Black Filled Rubber Blends by Artificial Neural Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966678,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The precise experimental estimation of mechanical properties of rubber blends can be a very costly and time-consuming process. The present work explores the possibilities of increasing its efficiency by using artificial neural networks to study the mechanical behavior of these widely used materials. A multilayer feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network model, with a strain and the carbon black content as input parameters and stress as an output parameter, has been developed to predict the uniaxial tensile response of vulcanized natural rubber blends with different contents of carbon black in the form of engineering stress-strain curves. A novel procedure has been created for the simulation of the optimized artificial neural network model with input datasets generated by a regression model of an experimental dependence of tensile strain-at-break on the carbon black content in the investigated blends. Errors of the prediction of experimental stress-strain curves, as well as of tensile strain-at-break, tensile stress-at-break and M100 tensile modulus were estimated for all simulated stress-strain curves. The present study demonstrated that the performance of a developed neural network model to predict the stress-strain curves of rubber blends with different contents of carbon black is also exceptionally high in the case of a network that had never learned the input data, which makes it a suitable tool for extensive use in practice.",Green Binder Based on Enzymatically Polymerized Eucalypt Kraft Lignin for Fiberboard Manufacturing: A Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966676,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The capability of laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila to drive oxidative polymerization of Eucalyptus globulus Kraft lignin (KL) was studied as a previous step before applying this biotechnological approach for the manufacturing of medium-density fiberboards (MDF) at a pilot scale. This method, which improves the self-bonding capacity of wood fibers by lignin enzymatic cross-linking, mimics the natural process of lignification in living plants and trees. An interesting pathway to promote these interactions could be the addition of lignin to the system. The characterization of E. globulus KL after enzymatic treatment showed a decrease of phenolic groups as well as the aromatic protons without loss of aromaticity. There was also an extensive oxidative polymerization of the biomolecule. In the manufacture of self-bonded MDF, the synergy generated by the added lignin and laccase provided promising results. Thus, whenever laccase was present in the treatment, MDF showed an increase in mechanical and dimensional stability for increasing amounts of lignin. In a pilot scale, this method produced MDF that meets the requirements of the European standards for both thickness swell (TS) and internal bonding (IB) for indoor applications.",Use of Irradiated Polymers after Their Lifetime Period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966675,Polymers,2019 04 12,"This article deals with the study of the utilisation of irradiated HDPE products after their end-of-life cycle. Today, polymer waste processing is a matter of evermore intensive discussion. Common thermoplastic waste recycling-especially in the case of wastes with a defined composition-is generally well-known-and frequently used. On the contrary, processing cross-linked plastics is impossible to do in the same way as with virgin thermoplastics-mainly due to the impossibility of remelting them. The possibility of using waste in the form of grit or a powder, made from cross-linked High Density PolyEthylene (rHDPEx) products, after their end-of-life cycle, as a filler for virgin Low Density PolyEthylene (LDPE) was tested in a matrix. It was found that both the mechanical behaviour and processability of new composites with an LDPE matrix, with rHDPEx as a filler, depend-to a high degree-on the amount of the filler. The composite can be processed up to 60% of the filler content. The Polymer Mixture Fluidity dropped significantly, in line with the amount of filler, while the mechanical properties, on the other hand, predominantly grew with the increasing amount of rHDPEx.",Post Self-Crosslinking of Phthalonitrile-Terminated Polyarylene Ether Nitrile Crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966674,Polymers,2019 04 12,"A novel phthalonitrile-terminated polyaryl ether nitrile (PEN-Ph) was synthesized and characterized. The crystallization behavior coexisting with the crosslinking behavior in the PEN-Ph system was confirmed by rheological measurements. DSC was applied to study the crystallization kinetics and crosslinking reaction kinetics. Through the Avrami equation modified by Jeziorny, the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics were analyzed, and the Avrami exponent of about 2.2 was obtained. The analysis results of more intuitive polaring optical microscopy (POM) and SEM indicated that the shape of the crystals is similar to spherical. Moreover, the activation energy of the crystallization behavior and crosslinking behavior were obtained by the Kissinger method, and the values were about 152.7 kJ·mol-1 and 174.8 kJ·mol-1, respectively. This suggests that the activation energy of the crystallization behavior is lower than that of the crosslinking behavior, indicating that the crystallization behavior is more likely to occur than the crosslinking behavior and the crystals of PEN-Ph can be self-crosslinked to form single-polymer composites.",Exploring the Long-Term Hydrolytic Behavior of Zwitterionic Polymethacrylates and Polymethacrylamides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966673,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The hydrolytic stability of polymers to be used for coatings in aqueous environments, for example, to confer anti-fouling properties, is crucial. However, long-term exposure studies on such polymers are virtually missing. In this context, we synthesized a set of nine polymers that are typically used for low-fouling coatings, comprising the well-established poly(oligoethylene glycol methylether methacrylate), poly(3-(N-2-methacryloylethyl-N,N-dimethyl) ammoniopropanesulfonate) (""sulfobetaine methacrylate""), and poly(3-(N-3-methacryamidopropyl-N,N-dimethyl)ammoniopropanesulfonate) (""sulfobetaine methacrylamide"") as well as a series of hitherto rarely studied polysulfabetaines, which had been suggested to be particularly hydrolysis-stable. Hydrolysis resistance upon extended storage in aqueous solution is followed by ¹H NMR at ambient temperature in various pH regimes. Whereas the monomers suffered slow (in PBS) to very fast hydrolysis (in 1 M NaOH), the polymers, including the polymethacrylates, proved to be highly stable. No degradation of the carboxyl ester or amide was observed after one year in PBS, 1 M HCl, or in sodium carbonate buffer of pH 10. This demonstrates their basic suitability for anti-fouling applications. Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylamide) proved even to be stable for one year in 1 M NaOH without any signs of degradation. The stability is ascribed to a steric shielding effect. The hemisulfate group in the polysulfabetaines, however, was found to be partially labile."

The rod possesses a 12-mm diameter carbon fiber core and a 3.5-mm thick outer shell. The rod was exposed to high-temperature immersion in water under hydraulic pressure. To understand the long-term service performance of the rod, immersions in water at 20 °C, 40 °C, or 60 °C under 20 MPa of pressure for 1 year were conducted on the water uptake and distribution in the rod. The water uptake data were fitted by Fickian diffusion law, and the diffusion coefficient and the maximum water uptake were derived. Water distribution in the rod as a function of the immersion time, temperature, and hydraulic pressure was analyzed theoretically. This study revealed the accelerating effects of the elevated temperatures and the hydraulic pressure on the water diffusion in the hybrid rod.",Microflow Mechanism of Oil Displacement by Viscoelastic Hydrophobically Associating Water-Soluble Polymers in Enhanced Oil Recovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966661,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Polymer flooding plays an important role in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), particularly in China, where partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymers (HAWP) are used in onshore and offshore reservoirs, respectively. Many researchers have highlighted the elasticity of HPAM, which can be used to improve the sweep efficiency, i.e., the ratio of the area swept by an injected fluid to the oil area. On the other hand, fewer studies exist on the elasticity of HAWP. In this study, we investigate the flow of HAWP and Xanthan solutions with identical viscosities in core experiments in terms of elasticity; results reveal that the HAWP can produce shear thickening in the core. The constitutive equation for the HAWP can be obtained using the simulation results matched with the experimental data. On the basis of these experiments, we established a two-phase flow model of a polymer and oil, including the continuity, momentum, constitutive, and phase equations. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method was used to track the interface between the two phases. A complex pore model was established based on the glass-etched model used in the experiment. We used the OpenFOAM platform to solve the mathematical model. The saturation, pressure, and stress tensor distributions were obtained. The results show that the displacement efficiency increased as the elasticity of the polymer increased; accordingly, the elasticity can enlarge the sweep area and decrease the residual oil saturation. As the elasticity increases, the stresses (the first normal stress, second normal stress, and shear stress) increase. Finally, the results obtained in this study can be used as a guideline in polymer design, screening, and optimization in the polymer flooding oilfields.",Selective and Efficient Arsenic Recovery from Water through Quaternary Amino-Functionalized Silica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966660,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The free-radical graft polymerization of acryloxyethyl-trimethylammonium chloride onto commercial silica particles was studied experimentally for extraction of arsenic ions from water. Two steps were used to graft acryloxyethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (Q) onto the surface of nanosilica: anchoring vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMSO) onto the surface of silica to modify it with double bonds and then grafting Q onto the surface of silica with potassium persulfate as an initiator. The products were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 13C, 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The results showed that it is easy to graft Q onto the surface of silica under radical polimerization. The morphology analysis of silica and modified silica indicated that the silica decreased the size scale after modification. Q/VTMSO-SiO₂ was tested for its ability to remove arsenic from drinking water. The results show that the new silica hybrid particles efficiently remove all arsenate ions. In addition, Q/VTMSO-SiO₂ showed better sorption capacities for other metal ions (such as copper, zinc, chromium, uranium, vanadium, and lead) than a commercial water filter.",Highly Efficient Flame Retardant Hybrid Composites Based on Calcium Alginate/Nano-Calcium Borate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966659,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Hybrid composites with low flammability based on renewable calcium alginate and nano-calcium borate were fabricated using an in situ method through a simple, eco-friendly vacuum drying process. The composites were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The combustion behavior and flammability of the composites were assessed by using the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimetry (CONE) tests. The composites showed excellent thermal stability and achieved nonflammability with an LOI higher than 60. Pyrolysis was investigated using pyrolysis⁻gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and the results showed that fewer sorts of cracking products were produced from the hybrid composites compared with the calcium alginate. A possible thermal degradation mechanism of composites was proposed based on the experimental data. The combined results indicate that the calcium borate had a nano-effect, accumulating more freely in the hybrid composites and contributing significantly to both the solid phase and gas phase, resulting in an efficient improvement in the flame retardancy of the composites. Our study provides a novel material with promising potentiality for flame retardant applications.",Surface Instability of Bilayer Hydrogel Subjected to Both Compression and Solvent Absorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966658,Polymers,2019 04 12,"The bilayered structure of hard thin film on soft substrate can lose stability and form specific patterns, such as wrinkles or creases, on the surface, induced by external stimuli. For bilayer hydrogels, the surface morphology caused by the instability is usually controlled by the solvent-induced swelling/shrinking and mechanical force. Here, two important issues on the instability of bilayer hydrogels, which were not considered in the previous studies, are focused on in this study. First, the upper layer of a hydrogel is not necessarily too thin. Thus we investigated how the thickness of the upper layer can affect the surface morphology of bilayer hydrogels under compression through both finite element (FE) simulation and theoretical analysis. Second, a hydrogel can absorb water molecules before the mechanical compression. The effect of the pre-absorption of water before the mechanical compression was studied through FE simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that when the thickness of the upper layer is very large, surface wrinkles can exist without transforming into period doublings. The pre-absorption of the water can result in folds or unexpected hierarchical wrinkles, which can be realized in experiments through further efforts.","Metal(II) Coordination Polymers Derived from Mixed 4-Imidazole Ligands and Carboxylates: Syntheses, Topological Structures, and Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966657,Polymers,2019 04 12,"Four new metal⁻organic coordination polymers [Cu(L)(mpa)]·3H₂O (1), [Co(L)(mpa)]·H₂O (2), [Zn(L)(mpa)]·H₂O (3), and [Cd(L)(mpa)(H₂O)]·H₂O (4) were synthesized by reactions of the corresponding metal(II) salts based on mixed ligands of 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-4-yl)benzene (L) and 4-methylphthalic acid (H₂mpa), respectively. The structures of the complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

Complex 4 has the same 2D layer structure with (4, 4) sql topology as complexes 2 and 3, but the inclined interpenetration of parallel sets of layers result in the formation with 2D + 2D → 3D framework.

Cellulose is a renewable and biodegradable natural polymer. Aerogel prepared using cellulose has the renewability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of cellulose, while also having other advantages, such as low density, high porosity, and a large specific surface area. Thus, it can be applied for many purposes in the areas of adsorption and oil/water separation, thermal insulation, and biomedical applications, as well as many other fields. There are three types of cellulose aerogels: natural cellulose aerogels (nanocellulose aerogels and bacterial cellulose aerogels), regenerated cellulose aerogels, and aerogels made from cellulose derivatives. In this paper, more than 200 articles were reviewed to summarize the properties of these three types of cellulose aerogels, as well as the technologies used in their preparation, such as the sol⁻gel process and gel drying. In addition, the applications of different types of cellulose aerogels were also introduced.",Model Studies on Load-Settlement Characteristics of Coarse-Grained Soil Treated with Geofiber and Cement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966655,Polymers,2019 04 12,"This study aims to verify the effectiveness of fiber reinforcing with and without cement on settlement controlling of subgrade models, and to investigate the effect of fiber reinforcement on the load-settlement behavior of subgrade models. To this end, laboratory subgrade model tests were conducted under different static vertical loads. Three subgrade models composed of different fillers were constructed in a rigid concrete tank, and the internal earth pressures and settlements at different depths were measured through an earth pressure cell and settlement plate. Results show that the fiber-reinforced model keeps a slight difference to the unreinforced model in terms of earth pressure distribution under lower applied surface pressure. However, the earth pressure at various locations under each surface pressure was obviously lower than that of the other two models due to the combined effect of fiber and cement. In addition, for the unreinforced subgrade model, the 60 cm settlement domain was restricted within 40 cm depth through fiber-cement and fiber reinforcing, and the total settlement under 100 kPa was decreased by 48.5% and 30.8%, respectively. Moreover, reinforced models present with different settlement deformation features. The inflection points, after which the rate of settlement decreased with increasing applied surface pressure, were observed in the pressure-settlement curves. Under 200 kPa, the fiber-cement and fiber reinforcement decreased the total settlement of the unreinforced model by 61.4% and 34.7%, respectively. The greater applied surface pressure, the more efficient was fiber-cement reinforcing in settlement controlling.",Gelatin/Nanohyroxyapatite Cryogel Embedded Poly(lactic-co-glycolic Acid)/Nanohydroxyapatite Microsphere Hybrid Scaffolds for Simultaneous Bone Regeneration and Load-Bearing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966654,Polymers,2019 04 12,"It is desirable to combine load-bearing and bone regeneration capabilities in a single bone tissue engineering scaffold. For this purpose, we developed a high strength hybrid scaffold using a sintered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP) microsphere cavity fitted with gelatin/nHAP cryogel disks in the center. Osteo-conductive/osteo-inductive nHAP was incorporated in 250⁻500 μm PLGA microspheres at 40% (w/w) as the base matrix for the high strength cavity-shaped microsphere scaffold, while 20% (w/w) nHAP was incorporated into gelatin cryogels as an embedded core for bone regeneration purposes. The physico-chemical properties of the microsphere, cryogel, and hybrid scaffolds were characterized in detail. The ultimate stress and Young's modulus of the hybrid scaffold showed 25- and 21-fold increases from the cryogel scaffold. In vitro studies using rabbit bone marrow-derived stem cells (rBMSCs) in cryogel and hybrid scaffolds through DNA content, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineral deposition by SEM/EDS, showed the prominence of both scaffolds in cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs in a normal medium. Calcium contents analysis, immunofluorescent staining of collagen I (COL I), and osteocalcin (OCN) and relative mRNA expression of COL I, OCN and osteopontin (OPN) confirmed in vitro differentiation of rBMSCs in the hybrid scaffold toward the bone lineage. From compression testing, the cell/hybrid scaffold construct showed a 1.93 times increase of Young's modulus from day 14 to day 28, due to mineral deposition. The relative mRNA expression of osteogenic marker genes COL I, OCN, and OPN showed 5.5, 18.7, and 7.2 folds increase from day 14 to day 28, respectively, confirming bone regeneration. From animal studies, the rBMSCs-seeded hybrid constructs could repair mid-diaphyseal tibia defects in rabbits, as evaluated by micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) and histological analyses. The hybrid scaffold will be useful for bone regeneration in load-bearing areas.",Acetyl Groups in Typha capensis: Fate of Acetates during Organosolv and Ionosolv Pulping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966652,Polymers,2019 04 12,"During biomass fractionation, any native acetylation of lignin and heteropolysaccharide may affect the process and the resulting lignin structure. In this study, Typha capensis (TC) and its lignin isolated by milling (MWL), ionosolv (ILL) and organosolv (EOL) methods were investigated for acetyl group content using FT-Raman, ¹H NMR, 2D-NMR, back-titration, and Zemplén transesterification analytical methods. The study revealed that TC is a highly acetylated grass; extractive free TC (TCextr) and TC MWL exhibited similar values of acetyl content: 6 wt % and 8 wt % by Zemplén transesterification, respectively, and 11 wt % by back-titration. In contrast, lignin extracted from organosolv and [EMIm][OAc] pulping lost 80% of the original acetyl groups. With a high acetyl content in the natural state, TC could be an interesting raw material in biorefinery in which acetic acid could become an important by-product."
