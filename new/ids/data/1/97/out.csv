This sense is then thought to provide a foundation for understanding symbolic numbers in formal education. Given this link, there has been interest in the extent to which the approximate number system (ANS) can be improved via dedicated training, as this could provide a route to improving performance in symbolic mathematics. However, current evidence regarding the trainability of the ANS comes largely from studies that have used short training durations, leaving open the question of whether improvements occur over a longer time span. To address this limitation, we utilized a perceptual learning approach to investigate the extent to which long-term (8,000+ trials) training modifies the ANS. Consistent with the general methodological approach common in the domain of perceptual learning (where learning specificity is commonly observed), we also examined whether ANS training generalizes to: (a) untrained locations in the visual field; (b) an enumeration task; (c) a higher-level ratio comparison task; and (d) arithmetic ability. In contrast to previous short-term training studies showing that ANS learning quickly asymptotes, our long-term training approach revealed that performance continued to improve even after thousands of trials. We further found that the training generalized to untrained visual locations. At post-test there was non-significant evidence for generalization to a low-level enumeration task, but not to our high-level tasks, including ratio comparison, multi-object tracking, and arithmetic performance. These results demonstrate the potential utility of long-term psychophysical training, but also suggest that ANS training alone (even long-duration training) may be insufficient to modify higher-level math skills.","Use of Auto-Injector for Methotrexate Subcutaneous Self-Injections: High Satisfaction Level and Good Compliance in SELF-I Study, a Randomized, Open-Label, Parallel Group Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547379,Rheumatology and therapy,2019 03 29,The objective of the study was to compare compliance and acceptability of a new auto-injector (AI) versus syringe for administration of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).,Chromoblastomycosis Caused by Fonsecaea nubica: First Report in Northern China and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547378,Mycopathologia,2019 03 18,"Chromoblastomycosis is found worldwide with higher incidence in tropical and subtropical regions. Fonsecaea spp. is one of the major causative agents of this disease. First case of chromoblastomycosis due to Fonsecaea nubica in Northern China is reported in a 75-year-old Chinese male. We firstly summarized molecular identification methods of Fonsecaea spp. and all the strains of F. nubica reported in the literature. Sequencing of internal transcribed spacer alone and/or combined with actin (ACT1), partial cell division cycle (CDC42) and partial beta-tubulin (BT2) were most commonly used to identify species, while lactase (Lac), homogentisate (HmgA) and polyketide synthase (PKS1) were also used in some cases. Most strains were isolated from South America and Eastern China. Five clinical cases of chromoblastomycosis due to F. nubica from Asia and Europe were also reviewed.

Chemokines as inflammatory mediators, which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes, can play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. The aim of this study was to examine the serum level of eotaxins (CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26) and the expression of C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CCR3) in patients with PD compared with healthy subjects. In this study, we measured the serum levels of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 with ELISA. In addition, gene and protein expression of CCR3 were measured by RT-PCR and flow cytometry techniques in PD patients (n = 30) and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (n = 30). All patients suffering from PD were assessed clinically through Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Motor Examination (UPDRS ME). The results of this study showed that there was no significant alteration in the serum level of these chemokines and also their receptor among patients with PD and healthy subjects. No significant correlation was observed between the eotaxins serum levels and the clinical measures of PD severity. Based on the results, it can be concluded that eotaxins cannot be considered as appropriate targets for the diagnosis or treatment of PD.","Relationship of leptin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor levels with body mass index and disease severity in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547374,Acta neurologica Belgica,2018 12 14,"A high prevalence of obesity in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) predisposes patients to metabolic changes.

Different materials are marketed and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for peripheral nerve graft reconstruction. The most frequently used materials are collagen and poly(DL-lactide-ε-caprolactone). Only one human nerve allograft is listed for peripheral nerve reconstruction by the FDA. All marketed nerve grafts are able to demonstrate sufficient nerve regeneration over small distances not exceeding 3.0 cm. A key question in the field is whether nerve reconstruction on large defect lengths extending 4.0 cm or more is possible. This review gives a summary of current clinical and experimental approaches in peripheral nerve surgery using artificial and non-artificial nerve grafts in short and long distance nerve defects. Strategies to extend nerve graft lengths for long nerve defects, such as enhancing axonal regeneration, include the additional application of Schwann cells, mesenchymal stem cells or supporting co-factors like growth factors on defect sizes between 4.0 and 8.0 cm.","A green, catalyst-free synthesis of pyrazolopyranopyrimidines in polyethylene glycol as a biodegradable medium at ambient temperature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547372,Molecular diversity,2018 12 14,"A facile, efficient and environmentally safe strategy for the synthesis of pyrazolopyranopyrimidines via one-pot, four-component reaction of hydrazine hydrate, barbituric acid, ethyl acetoacetate, and aromatic aldehydes in polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a safe solvent in the absence of catalyst at ambient temperature has been described.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical effectiveness evidence in the CS for pembrolizumab was based on one phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomised study (KEYNOTE-052), while the evidence for the comparator (carboplatin plus gemcitabine) was based on four studies, including one randomised controlled trial and three cohort studies. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the company conducted an indirect treatment comparison for both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), by firstly adjusting cross-study differences using a simulated treatment comparison approach and then synthesizing the evidence based on an assumption of constant hazard ratios using a standard meta-analysis model and time-varying hazard ratios using fractional polynomial models. The treatment effect of pembrolizumab was more favourable in the adjusted population compared with the observed effect in the KEYNOTE-052 study. The company submitted a de novo partitioned survival cohort simulation model, which partitions the OS time into PFS and post-progression survival. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with carboplatin plus gemcitabine was estimated to be £37,081 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, based on the results within the company's health economic model. Following a critique of the model, for their preferred base case the ERG corrected some minor model errors, chose a progression approach for estimating utilities, and revised the extrapolation of PFS and OS. The ERG's probabilistic base case ICER was estimated to be £67,068 per QALY gained. The ERG also undertook a range of exploratory sensitivity analyses which suggested that the ICER was highly uncertain. In particular, the choices of extrapolation for the OS of pembrolizumab and the stopping rule for pembrolizumab had the largest impacts on the ICER. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund as an option for treating locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in adults who have had platinum-containing chemotherapy, provided that pembrolizumab was stopped at 2 years of uninterrupted treatment, or earlier if the disease progresses, and the conditions of the managed access agreement for pembrolizumab are followed.",Obinutuzumab in Combination with Chemotherapy for the First-Line Treatment of Patients with Advanced Follicular Lymphoma : An Evidence Review Group Evaluation of the NICE Single Technology Appraisal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547368,PharmacoEconomics,2018 12 14,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the company that makes obinutuzumab (Roche Products Limited) to submit evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with chemotherapy, with or without obinutuzumab as maintenance therapy for adult patients with untreated, advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) in the UK. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical evidence was derived from two phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, open-label studies. Most evidence on obinutuzumab was based on the GALLIUM trial that compared obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by rituximab maintenance monotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL (grades 1-3a). Long-term clinical evidence was based on the PRIMA trial, studying the benefit of two years of rituximab maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with FL. The cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company relied on a partitioned survival cost-utility model, implemented in Microsoft® Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented in the company submission was <£20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Although the ERG concluded that the economic model met the NICE reference case to a reasonable extent, some errors were identified and several assumptions made by the company were challenged. A new base-case scenario produced by the ERG suggested an ICER that was higher than the company base case, but still below £30,000 per QALY gained. However, some ERG scenario analyses were close to or even above the threshold. This was the case in particular for assuming a treatment effect that did not extend beyond trial follow-up. These results led to an initial negative recommendation by the appraisal committee. Subsequently, the company submitted a revised base case focusing on patients at intermediate or high risk of premature mortality. Simultaneously, a further price discount for obinutuzumab was granted. In addition to the company's revised base case, the ERG suggested a restriction of the treatment effect to 5 years and implemented biosimilar uptake and cheaper prices for rituximab. All of these adjustments did not exceed £30,000 per QALY gained and therefore the use of obinutuzumab for patients with advanced FL and a Follicular Lymphoma International Predictive Index (FLIPI) score of two or more could be recommended."

The triple risk model proposed for sudden infant death syndrome involves the intersection of three risks: (1) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control (2), exogenous stressors, and (3) a vulnerable infant. Even though sex and age factor into some forms of inherited arrhythmogenic deaths in young individuals and adults, more appropriate a dual-risk disease model for adults involves exogenous stressors and a vulnerable individual. The vulnerability aspect clearly has a genetic component as underscored by a number of recent large-scale and high-throughput genetic testing studies performed in attempt to define the causes of sudden unexplained death. These studies often focus on 'cardiac' and channelopathy genes. Genetic testing often identify lists of rare or ultra-rare nonsynonymous variants, classified according to the ACMG guidelines as 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic', which may form the basis of diagnostic decisions and/or family counseling. However, computer algorithms used to categorize gene variants are not completely accurate and these variants are often not functionally tested to determine their pathogenicity. Due to conflicting computational predictions, a large number of variants are labeled as 'variants of uncertain significance' or VUS. Functional testing of these VUS can greatly assist to reclassify these VUS as 'likely benign' or 'likely pathogenic'. However, functional testing has its limits and by itself cannot be used to determine cause of death. Going forward, computer algorithms must be improved to take account of variants across multiple genes and efforts must be expanded to obtain clinical, familial and segregation data. Forensic genetic testing needs to be held to the same rigorous standards as defined by the NIH Clinical Genome Resource Consortium, where functional evaluation of a channelopathy variant is only one (but important) aspect of the overall picture.","Violence in the Early Bronze Age.

Between October 2015 and December 2018, we developed and pilot-tested the Home Visiting Budget Assistance Tool (HV-BAT) to standardize the collection of home visiting program costs and analyze costs for local implementing agencies (LIAs). Methods We recruited LIAs that implemented at least one of nine evidence-based home visiting models in 15 states implementing the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program. LIAs reported their costs to implement a home visiting model using the HV-BAT and provided feedback on the tool. We estimated annual total cost and cost per family served for each LIA, examined cost summary statistics for the sample, and analyzed whether and how LIA characteristics affected home visiting costs using regression analyses. Results Of the 168 LIAs invited to participate in the HV-BAT pilot study, 75 agreed to participate, and 45 across 14 states completed the HV-BAT. We estimated home visiting costs of approximately $8500 per family per year, but costs varied across LIAs (range $1970-$39,770; standard deviation = $5794). The marginal cost of adding a family declined as the number of families served by an LIA increased. Feedback from LIAs indicated that users had difficulty providing some details on costs (e.g., mileage for specific services), needed more detailed instructions, and desired a summary of subtotals and total costs reported in the HV-BAT. Conclusions The HV-BAT provides an approach to standardize cost data collection for home visiting programs. Pilot study results indicate that there may be significant economies of scale for home visiting services. This study provides preliminary estimates of costs that can help in program planning and budgeting.",Diagnosis using deep-learning artificial intelligence based on the endocytoscopic observation of the esophagus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547352,Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,2019 05 29,The endocytoscopic system (ECS) helps in virtual realization of histology and can aid in confirming histological diagnosis in vivo.

Compared with culture, 16S rDNA sequencing substantially improved the microbiological yield, a microbiological diagnosis was achieved in almost all patients with complicated PPE, and the specificity seemed to be high. 16S rDNA sequencing should be used together with culture in patients with PPE to guide antibiotic therapy.","Effects of Migration on Risky Sexual Behavior and HIV Acquisition in South Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, 2000-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547333,AIDS and behavior,2019 05 27,"While human mobility has been implicated in fueling the HIV epidemic in South Africa, the link between migration and HIV has not been systematically reviewed and quantified. We conducted a systematic review of the role of migration in HIV risk acquisition and sexual behaviour based on 29 studies published between 2000 and 2017. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis of the association between migration and HIV risk acquisition in four of the studies that used HIV incidence as an outcome measure. The systematic review results show that HIV acquisition and risky sexual behavior were more prevalent among both male and female migrants compared to their non-migrant counterparts. The meta-analysis results demonstrate that migration was significantly associated with increased HIV acquisition risk (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-2.14; I2 = 35.0%). There is an urgent need for effective combination HIV prevention strategies (comprising biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions) that target migrant populations.","Depression, ART Adherence, and Receipt of Case Management Services by Adults with HIV in North Carolina, Medical Monitoring Project, 2009-2013.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547332,AIDS and behavior,2019 04 11,"Depression among persons with HIV is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption and discontinuation, virological failure, and poor clinical and survival outcomes. Case management services can address needs for emotional counseling and other supportive services to facilitate HIV care engagement. Using 2009-2013 North Carolina Medical Monitoring Project data from 910 persons engaged in HIV care, we estimated associations of case management utilization with ""probable current depression"" and with 100% ART dose adherence. After weighting, 53.2% of patients reported receiving case management, 21.7% reported depression, and 87.0% reported ART adherence. Depression prevalence was higher among those reporting case management (24.9%) than among other patients (17.6%) (p < 0.01). Case management was associated with depression among patients living above the poverty level [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR), 2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-3.36], and not among other patients (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI 0.72-1.43). Receipt of case management was not associated with ART adherence (aPR, 1.00; 95% CI 0.95-1.05). Our analysis indicates a need for more effective depression treatment, even among persons receiving case management services. Self-reported ART adherence was high overall, though lower among persons experiencing depression (unadjusted prevalence ratio, 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.99).

We conducted two laboratory experiments to quantify whether predator-prey interactions between California killifish, Fundulus parvipinnis, and the polychaete Polydora cornuta vary with flow speed and chlorpyrifos exposure. In one experiment, only F. parvipinnis was exposed to chlorpyrifos; in the other, only P. cornuta was exposed. The flume included a 300-cm2 area of sediment with 24 P. cornuta in a central patch (98 cm2). We videotaped groups of three killifish for 50 min at one of four flow speeds (6, 9, 12, or 15 cm/s) and recorded the proportion of bites directed at the prey patch. Unexposed killifish directed 70% of their bites at the prey patch at 6 cm/s, and prey-patch selection decreased as flow increased. Killifish exposed to chlorpyrifos directed 41% of their bites at the prey patch at 6 cm/s with reduced prey-patch selection relative to unexposed fish at 9 and 12 cm/s. At 15 cm/s, both exposed and unexposed fish displayed non-selective biting. Worms were videotaped to quantify their deposit- and suspension-feeding activities. Exposing worms to chlorpyrifos reduced total feeding activity by ~30%. Suspension feeding was more common at faster flow speeds, but the time worms spent suspension feeding relative to deposit feeding was unaffected by chlorpyrifos. No behavioral changes were noted in either species when the other was exposed to chlorpyrifos. This study highlights how hydrodynamic conditions can alter the relative importance of a toxicant's effects on predator-prey interactions.","Freshwater neotropical oligochaetes as native test species for the toxicity evaluation of cadmium, mercury and their mixtures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547328,"Ecotoxicology (London, England)",2019 05 24,"The toxicity of metals, whether isolated or in mixtures, involves changes in biochemical processes as well as in cell membranes, which may lead to deleterious short- and long-term effects on the affected organisms. Among metals, cadmium and mercury stand out due to their abundance in nature, frequent use for industrial activities and biological accumulation, with high levels of residence in trophic chains. Benthic communities are particularly prone to metal pollution since metals usually accumulate in sediments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of mercury and cadmium, single and in mixture, to two native species of epibenthic oligochaetes: Allonais inaequalis and Dero furcatus. In order to assess the potential of these species as bioindicators, we compared their sensitivity with those of other internationally used species by applying the species sensitivity distribution approach. The 96h-LC50 of cadmium chloride was 627 and 364 μg L-1 for A. inaequalis and D. furcatus, respectively, evidencing that the latter species is almost twice as sensitive to this metal than A. inaequalis. For mercury chloride, the 96h-LC50 was 129 μg L-1 for A. inaequalis and 92 μg L-1 for D. furcatus. The sensitivities of these oligochaetes were superior or similar to that of other frequently used oligochaete test species such as Tubifex tubifex and Lumbriculus variegatus. The metal mixtures had synergism in general (D. furcatus) or at high doses only (A. inaequalis), implying a potentiation of their toxic effects when both metals co-occur in the environment. By comparing the derived toxicity values with concentrations of cadmium and mercury measured in the field, it can be concluded that aquatic organisms are likely to be at risk when exposed to the environmental relevant concentrations of cadmium and mercury here tested, especially when they are both present.",Allelopathic effects of Canada goldenrod leaf extracts on the seed germination and seedling growth of lettuce reinforced under salt stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547327,"Ecotoxicology (London, England)",2019 05 20,"Allelopathic effects on the seed germination and seedling growth of the natives play a crucial role in the successful invasion of numerous invaders. Meanwhile, soil salinity is an emerging driver of the spread of many invaders, especially in the colonization of saline habitats. Thus, the allelopathic effects of the invaders on the seed germination and seedling growth of the natives may be altered or even reinforced under salt stress. This study aims to address the allelopathic effects of the notorious invader Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.; goldenrod hereafter) on the seed germination and seedling growth of the native lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.; lettuce hereafter) under a gradient of salt stress. Goldenrod leaf extracts with high concentration significantly decreased root length, leaf shape index, germination percentage, germination potential, germination index, germination vigor index, and germination rate index of lettuce. However, goldenrod leaf extracts with low concentration significantly increased root length and leaf width of lettuce. Goldenrod leaf extracts with high concentration display more serious allelopathic effects on the seed germination and seedling growth of lettuce than those with low concentration. Salt stress regardless of concentration significantly decreased seedling height, root length, leaf shape index, and seedling biomass (fresh weight) of lettuce. The combined goldenrod leaf extracts and salt stress have a synergistic effect on seedling height, root length, leaf shape index, germination percentage, germination potential, germination index, and germination rate index of lettuce. Thus, the allelopathic effects of the invaders on the seed germination and seedling growth of the natives may be reinforced under salt stress. Accordingly, salt stress may be beneficial to the further invasion of the invaders mainly via the reduced growth performance of the natives.","Extension of longevity and reduction of inflammation is ovarian-dependent, but germ cell-independent in post-reproductive female mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547325,GeroScience,2019 04 07,"Cardiovascular disease, rare in premenopausal women, increases sharply at menopause and is typically accompanied by chronic inflammation. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that replacing senescent ovaries in post-reproductive mice with young, actively cycling ovaries restored many health benefits, including decreased cardiomyopathy and restoration of immune function. Our objective here was to determine if depletion of germ cells from young transplanted ovaries would alter the ovarian-dependent extension of life and health span. Sixty-day-old germ cell-depleted and germ cell-containing ovaries were transplanted to post-reproductive, 17-month-old mice. Mean life span for female CBA/J mice is approximately 644 days. Mice that received germ cell-containing ovaries lived 798 days (maximum = 815 days). Mice that received germ cell-depleted ovaries lived 880 days (maximum = 1046 days), 29% further past the time of surgery than mice that received germ cell-containing ovaries. The severity of inflammation was reduced in all mice that received young ovaries, whether germ cell-containing or germ cell-depleted. Aging-associated inflammatory cytokine changes were reversed in post-reproductive mice by 4 months of new-ovary exposure. In summary, germ cell depletion enhanced the longevity-extending effects of the young, transplanted ovaries and, as with germ cell-containing ovaries, decreased the severity of inflammation, but did so independent of germ cells. Based on these observations, we propose that gonadal somatic cells are programed to preserve the somatic health of the organism with the intent of facilitating future germline transmission. As reproductive potential decreases or is lost, the incentive to preserve the somatic health of the organism is lost as well.",Correction to: Fluid administration for acute circulatory dysfunction using basic monitoring: narrative review and expert panel recommendations from an ESICM task force.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547324,Intensive care medicine,2019 05 24,The original article can be found online.

The stop-signal involves both ""go"" and ""stop"" trials; previous research indicates that response times are reliably slower to ""go"" trials during tasks with vs. without intermittent ""stop"" trials. However, it is unclear whether this pattern reflects deliberate slowing to maximize inhibitory success (performance adjustment hypothesis) and/or disrupted bottom-up information processing due to increased cognitive demands (dual-task hypothesis). Given the centrality of ""go"" responding for estimating children's inhibitory speed, finding that children with ADHD slow differently -or for different reasons- has the potential to inform cognitive and self-regulatory theories of ADHD. The current study used a carefully-controlled experimental design to assess the mechanisms underlying stop signal-related slowing in ADHD. Children ages 8-13 with (n = 81) and without ADHD (n = 63) completed the stop-signal task and a control task that differed only in the presence/absence of ""stop"" trials. Using drift-diffusion modeling, Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed a pattern consistent with the performance adjustment hypothesis, such that children adopted more cautious response strategies (BF10 = 6221.78; d = 0.38) but did not show changes in processing speed (BF01 = 3.08; d = 0.12) or encoding/motor speed (BF01 = 5.73; d = 0.07) when inhibition demands were introduced. Importantly, the ADHD/Non-ADHD groups showed equivalent effects of intermittent ""stop"" trials (BF01 = 4.30-5.56). These findings suggest intact self-regulation/performance monitoring in the context of adapting to increased inhibitory demands in ADHD, which has important implications for the continued isolation of potential mechanisms associated with ADHD symptoms and impairment.",Gradients of connectivity distance in the cerebral cortex of the macaque monkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547311,Brain structure & function,2019 05 15,"Cortical connectivity conforms to a series of organizing principles that are common across species. Spatial proximity, similar cortical type, and similar connectional profile all constitute factors for determining the connectivity between cortical regions. We previously demonstrated another principle of connectivity that is closely related to the spatial layout of the cerebral cortex. Using functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI in the human cortex, we found that the further a region is located from primary cortex, the more distant are its functional connections with the other areas of the cortex. However, it remains unknown whether this relationship between cortical layout and connectivity extends to other primate species. Here, we investigated this relationship using both resting-state functional connectivity as well as gold-standard tract-tracing connectivity in the macaque monkey cortex. For both measures of connectivity, we found a gradient of connectivity distance extending between primary and frontoparietal regions. In the human cortex, the further a region is located from primary areas, the stronger its connections to distant portions of the cortex, with connectivity distance highest in frontal and parietal regions. The similarity between the human and macaque findings provides evidence for a phylogenetically conserved relationship between the spatial layout of cortical areas and connectivity.",ABO Blood Type and Hematoma Expansion After Intracerebral Hemorrhage: An Exploratory Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547310,Neurocritical care,2019 06 14,Blood type has become an increasingly recognized risk factor for coagulopathy.

Herein, the CL-FRIPS reagent has three moieties: (1) pyridine acting as the basic site to locate the proton, (2) 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO, a stable free radical) acting as the free radical precursor to generate the nascent free radical in the gas phase, and (3) N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated carboxylic acid acting as the coupling site to derivatize the N-terminus of peptides. The CL-FRIPS reagent allows for the characterization of peptides by generating sequencing ions, enzymatic cleavage-like radical-induced side chain losses, and the loss of TEMPO simultaneously via one-step collisional activation. Further collisional activation of enzymatic cleavage-like radical-induced side chain loss ions provides more information for the structure determination of peptides. The application of CL-FRIPS reagent to characterize peptides is proved by employing bovine insulin as the model peptide. Both scaffold structure of bovine insulin and sequencing information of each chain are achieved.

Answering these queries is frequently challenging, given the enormous and conflicting evidence that exists on this subject. There are several reasons to suspect a role for micronutrients in non-scarring alopecia. Micronutrients are major elements in the normal hair follicle cycle, playing a role in cellular turnover, a frequent occurrence in the matrix cells in the follicle bulb that are rapidly dividing. Management of alopecia is an essential aspect of clinical dermatology given the prevalence of hair loss and its significant impact on patients' quality of life. The role of nutrition and diet in treating hair loss represents a dynamic and growing area of inquiry. In this review we summarize the role of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, iron, selenium, and zinc, in non-scarring alopecia. A broad literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar was performed in July 2018 to compile published articles that study the relationship between vitamins and minerals, and hair loss. Micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals play an important, but not entirely clear role in normal hair follicle development and immune cell function. Deficiency of such micronutrients may represent a modifiable risk factor associated with the development, prevention, and treatment of alopecia. Given the role of vitamins and minerals in the hair cycle and immune defense mechanism, large double-blind placebo-controlled trials are required to determine the effect of specific micronutrient supplementation on hair growth in those with both micronutrient deficiency and non-scarring alopecia to establish any association between hair loss and such micronutrient deficiency.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article."

These autoimmune-mediated diseases occur more commonly in females and are often found during pregnancy or in the post-partum period. Autoimmune diseases can either affect parts of the pituitary or hypothalamus, or can involve both sellar and suprasellar structures. Most of these cases comprise primary hypophysitis (PRH). Over the years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of reported PRH cases and related disorders, including hypophysitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors. With this increasing data, more light is being shed on the spectrum of clinical presentations, biochemical and imaging abnormalities of these disorders. Regardless, these disorders are still relatively rare. The clinical presentation can vary vastly, based on the type of pituitary cell or the area of the suprasellar region affected. The severity can range from clinically silent disease to progressive and rapid deterioration and death, likely due to unrecognized central adrenal insufficiency. Although biopsy remains a gold standard for diagnosing these disorders, the current standard of practice is biochemical assessment for hormonal deficiencies and imaging studies. In several instances, these disorders spontaneously resolve, but medical or surgical intervention might be necessary to treat symptomatic disease. Due to the subtlety and a vast spectrum of clinical manifestations which could often be asymptomatic, and the rarity of the occurrence of these diseases in clinical practice, the diagnosis can be easily missed which could potentially lead to substantial morbidity or mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to have a strong clinical suspicion and pursue timely biochemical and imaging studies to initiate prompt treatment. In this article, we review the various autoimmune conditions that affect the sellar and suprasellar structures, their diagnostic approach and management of these disorders.",Measurement of IL-17AA and IL-17FF as Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers to Demonstrate Target Engagement in the Phase I Study of MCAF5352A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547287,The AAPS journal,2019 06 07,"The interleukin (IL)-17 pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many autoimmune diseases. MCAF5352A is a humanized monoclonal antibody which targets both IL-17A and IL-17F, thereby inhibiting the activity of IL-17 dimers (IL-17AA, IL-17AF, and IL-17FF). The pharmacokinetic profile of MCAF5352A has been characterized in both a Phase Ia single ascending dose study and a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose study. Two qualified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure total IL-17AA and IL-17FF levels in serum as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the Phase I studies. The two assays demonstrated specificity for IL-17AA or IL-17FF with sensitivity at low picogram/milliliter levels. The assay precision and accuracy also met acceptance criteria. Although total serum IL-17AA and IL-17FF levels were below the assay detection limits prior to administration of MCAF5352A, post-treatment levels in both the single and multiple dose cohorts became detectable and increased in a dose-dependent manner. These data are consistent with target engagement by MCAF5352A. Our work highlights bioanalytical challenges encountered while developing biomarker assays requiring high sensitivity and specificity.

Triterpenes, alkaloids, and sterols were isolated from Gleditsia species. Among them, triterpenoid saponins are very important metabolites owing to their various pharmacological activities. However, the triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis pathway has not been well characterized. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly for 14.3 Gbps of clean reads sequenced from nine tissues of G. sinensis. The results showed that 81,511 unique transcripts (unitranscripts) (47,855 unigenes) were constructed, of which 31,717 unigenes were annotated with Gene Ontology and EC numbers by Blast2GO against the NCBI-nr protein database. We also analyzed the metabolite contents in the same nine tissues by LS-MS/MS, and saponins including gleditsioside I were found in fruit at higher levels. Many of the genes with tissue-specific expression in fruit are involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and many of those have UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) activity. We constructed a saponin biosynthesis pathway and identified two key enzyme families in the triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis pathway, cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucosyltransferase, that are encoded by 37 unigenes and 77 unigenes, respectively. CYP72A, CYP716A, and CYP88D, which are known as key enzymes for saponin biosynthesis, were also identified among the P450s.

This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of aspartame, with or without associated early nutritional deficiency, on behavioral parameters suggestive of anxiety and electrophysiological features of the excitability-related phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Newborn Wistar rats (n = 80) were suckled under favorable (L9; n = 40) or unfavorable lactation conditions (L15; n = 40), consisting of litters with 9 or 15 pups, respectively. In each lactation condition, animals were divided into 4 groups that received per gavage, from postnatal day 8 to 28, 75 mg/kg/d or 125 mg/kg/d aspartame (groups ASP75 and ASP125), or water (vehicle group), or no treatment (naive group). Behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze [EPM]) were performed at postnatal days 86-95 and CSD was recorded between postnatal days 96-115. Compared to the control groups, aspartame dose-dependently reduced body weight, suggesting a negative impact on animal development; aspartame also caused behavioral changes suggestive of anxiety (shorter stay in the open arms in the EPM) and decelerated CSD (lower propagation speed). Some of these parameters were more affected in L15 animals, suggesting an interaction among aspartame and lactation condition. We concluded that early consumption of aspartame adversely affects development of the organism (weight loss), with actions on behavioral (anxiety-like) and cerebral electrophysiological (CSD) parameters. The data suggest caution in aspartame consumption by lactating mothers and their infants.",Effects of carbendazim and astaxanthin co-treatment on the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547284,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,2019 05 27,"There has been a controversy in the oncology field about the use of antioxidants along with chemotherapeutics in cancer treatment. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a potent antioxidant (astaxanthin) co-treatment with a promising anti-cancer drug (carbendazim), which is in phase I clinical trials, on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation. MCF-7 cells were treated with carbendazim, astaxanthin, or their combinations and incubated for 24 h. After the incubation, each treatment group was evaluated for proliferation, cell cycle progression, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using WST-1, flow cytometry, and CM-H2DCFDA, respectively. All tested carbendazim and astaxanthin combinations increased the anti-proliferative effect of Carb treatment alone and increased the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest compared to the DMSO-treated control. Astaxanthin, at all concentrations tested, reduced the elevated intracellular ROS levels induced by the carbendazim treatment. Our data suggest that astaxanthin and carbendazim co-treatment enhances the anti-proliferative effect of carbendazim as a single agent, while alleviating the carbendazim treatment-associated ROS production in MCF-7 cells. These findings may contribute to the current debate on the use of antioxidants along with anti-cancer drugs in cancer chemotherapy.",Pterostilbene exerts a protective effect via regulating tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse preimplantation embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547283,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,2019 05 27,"Pterostilbene (PTS) mainly enriched in small fruits such as berries and grapes exerts an antioxidant effect. However, the protective effects of PTS against endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) have not yet been elucidated in mouse preimplantation embryo. ERS plays an important role in regulating the pathological and physiological processes, including embryonic development. We explored the protective effect of PTS on the tunicamycin (TM)-induced ERS in mouse preimplantation embryos. In vitro, culture medium was supplemented with different concentrations of TM and PTS. Our result indicated that treatment of zygotes with 0.5 μg/ml TM significantly decreased the development of day 4 blastocysts (P < 0.05), whereas 0.25 μM PTS supplementation improved the development rate of blastocysts. Moreover, TM treatment significantly increased (P < 0.05) the apoptotic index and reduced the total cell number of the blastocyst, whereas PTS treatment counteracted these effects. Additionally, TM potently increased expression levels of ERS-related proteins, such as GRP78, ATF6, PERK, p-Perk, IRE1, ATF4, and CHOP (P < 0.05). However, PTS and PTS + TM treatment decreased expression levels of ERS-related proteins (P < 0.05). Furthermore, expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein and gene BCL2 significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in TM-treated embryo but increased by PTS treatment (P < 0.05), whereas expression levels of the pro-apoptotic protein and gene BAX increased (P < 0.05) with TM but significantly decreased (P < 0.05) with co-treatment with PTS. In summary, PTS treatment significantly increased the development potential of mouse embryo by reduction of ERS.",Statistical learning of anomalous regions in complex faux X-ray images does not transfer between detection and discrimination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547282,Cognitive research: principles and implications,2019 01 08,"The visual environment contains predictable information - ""statistical regularities"" - that can be used to aid perception and attentional allocation. Here we investigate the role of statistical learning in facilitating search tasks that resemble medical-image perception. Using faux X-ray images, we employed two tasks that mimicked two problems in medical-image perception: detecting a target signal that is poorly segmented from the background; and discriminating a candidate anomaly from benign signals. In the first, participants searched a heavily camouflaged target embedded in cloud-like noise. In the second, the noise opacity was reduced, but the target appeared among visually similar distractors. We tested the hypothesis that learning may be task-specific. To this end, we introduced statistical regularities by presenting the target disproportionately more frequently in one region of the space. This manipulation successfully induced incidental learning of the target's location probability, producing faster search when the target appeared in the high-probability region. The learned attentional preference persisted through a testing phase in which the target's location was random. Supporting the task-specificity hypothesis, when the task changed between training and testing, the learned priority did not transfer. Eye tracking showed fewer, but longer, fixations in the detection than in the discrimination task. The observation of task-specificity of statistical learning has implications for theories of spatial attention and sheds light on the design of effective training tasks.","An Examination of Preterm Birth and Residential Social Context among Black Immigrant Women in California, 2007-2010.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547281,Journal of community health,2018 12 14,"The foreign-born black population contributes a considerable amount of heterogeneity to the US black population. In 2005, black immigrants accounted for 20% of the US black population. Compared to native-born black women, black immigrant women are at lower risk for adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Some scholars posit that differential exposures to socioeconomic disadvantage and structural racism in the residential context may account for this advantage. However, to date, few studies offer comprehensive examinations of the black immigrant residential social context, particularly in settlement regions beyond predominantly black and historically segregated regions. Further, studies examining the black immigrant residential context typically use a single indicator, which limits discussion of the intersecting domains that simultaneously increase or decrease risk among black immigrants. We addressed these gaps by examining black immigrant neighborhoods in the state of California, where racial residential segregation of the black population is low. We operationalized the residential context of black immigrant women using three distinct attributes: immigrant co-ethnic density, black racial concentration, and neighborhood deprivation. We linked 2007-2010 California birth records of black immigrant women and 2010 census data on tract-level social attributes (N = 6930). OLS regression analyses showed that immigrant co-ethnic density, black racial concentration and neighborhood deprivation were not associated with preterm birth among black immigrants. Our findings indicate that in California, residential social context has little relation to black immigrant preterm birth-a finding that is unique compared to residential settings of other settlement contexts.","Structure, Molecular Modification, and Anti-radiation Activity of Melanin from Lachnum YM156 on Ultraviolet B-Induced Injury in Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547280,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 05 28,"The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effects of intracellular homogeneous melanin produced by Lachnum YM156 (LIM) against ultraviolet B (UVB) induced damage in mice. The possible structural formula of the LIM was concluded based on elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS). The LIM was modified by arginine to improve its water solubility and biological activities. LIM and ALIM show significant anti-radiation activity in which LIM and ALIM protect the skin under UV radiation. Results indicate that activities of anti-oxidant enzymes in skin were improved after treatment of LIM or ALIM. In addition, LIM and ALIM inhibited over expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The protection ability of ALIM was higher than that of LIM at the same dose. Thus, applied LIM and ALIM may be a promising radiation-protective agent.","Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Fistulo-Jejunostomy, a Preferred Technique after Failure of Endoscopic and Radiologic Management of Fistula Post Sleeve Gastrectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547278,Obesity surgery,2019 02 11,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy represents the most performed bariatric procedure in France.

To corroborate the protective or detrimental effects of both compounds from a neuro-inflammatory perspective, in vitro experiments were carried out in human astrocytes (U-373). Astrocytes were pre-treated with a range of concentrations of either cyanidin, chlorogenic acid or a combined treatment for a period of 30 min, before exposure to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge for 23.5 h, after which cytotoxicity (propidium iodide exclusion assay), cytoprotective effects (XTT assay) and effects on functional capacity (secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1) were evaluated. No treatment resulted in cytotoxicity, but high dose (20 µg/mL) LPS significantly reduced mitochondrial reductive capacity (p < 0.001). This effect was prevented in a dose-dependent manner by both cyanidin and chlorogenic acid, as well as by the combination treatment. However, in the absence of LPS, IL-6 secretion was significantly increased in response to 2 µM of either cyanidin or chlorogenic acid (both p < 0.0001), as well as the combination treatment (p < 0.01). MCP-1 secretion followed a similar trend, but did not reach statistical significance. Although we acknowledge the requirement for in vivo investigations to validate our interpretations, current data highlight the potential risk for antioxidant toxicity that is linked to high dose supplementation with single compound antioxidants. Research focused at elucidating synergistic effects between different antioxidants is required to minimise risk of adverse effects.",The impacts of laser zona thinning on hatching and implantation of vitrified-warmed mouse embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547262,Lasers in medical science,2018 12 14,"Embryo vitrification has advantages in assisted reproduction yet it also induces zona hardening. Laser zona thinning (LZT) is considered as a solution yet its efficacy and security have not been well studied. In this study, we used vitrified-warmed morulae from 2-month-old and 10-month-old ICR female mice as model to investigate the impacts that LZT treatment brings to the in vitro hatching process and implantation by analyzing hatching rate, implantation rate, and blastocyst quality. The results showed that the fully hatched rate was significantly higher after LZT treatment for both young (25.7% vs. 16.2%, P < 0.05) and aged (36.6% vs. 13.2%, P < 0.01) mice. For zona-thinned morulae in young mice, its onset of hatching occurred earlier (28.6% vs. 8.8%, P < 0.01) at D4 and with a greater percentage of U-shaped hatching at D5 (48.3% vs. 33.0%, P < 0.05). LZT treatment did not induce expression change of apoptosis-related genes in all groups (P > 0.05), but for young mice, the total cell number of day 5 blastocyst in zona-thinned group was significantly less than that of the control group (40.6 ± 5.1 vs. 59.9 ± 14.5, P < 0.01). At last, there was an increasing implantation rate in zona-thinned compared to the control group for young (63.8% vs. 52.5%, P > 0.05) and aged (55.6% vs. 47.2%; P > 0.05) mice after embryos were bilaterally transferred in the same recipient. In conclusion, the significant increase of fully hatched rate after LZT treatment is related to the advanced onset of hatching as well as the enhancement of superior hatching structure, and LZT also lead to a better implantation after embryo transfer.",Low-level laser therapy versus trunk stabilization exercises on sternotomy healing after coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547261,Lasers in medical science,2019 01 09,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) versus trunk stabilization exercises on sternotomy healing following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Forty-five male patients who had acute sternal instability post-CABG surgery in the age range of 45-65 years were divided randomly into three equal groups (n = 15). The laser group received LLLT, while the exercise group received trunk stabilization exercises. The control group only received a routine cardiac rehabilitation programme, which was also provided to both the laser and the exercise groups. All groups were offered 12 sessions over 4 weeks. Sternal separation, median sternotomy photographic analysis, pain and activities of daily living (ADL) performance were evaluated pre- and post-treatment. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. There was a significant decrease among the laser group in upper-sternal separation, while the exercise and control groups showed a non-significant decrease. In terms of mid-sternal separation, laser and exercise groups showed a significant decrease while the control group showed a non-significant decrease. In terms of lower-sternal separation, the exercise group showed a significant decrease, while the laser and control groups showed a non-significant decrease. Post-treatment between-groups analysis showed a significant difference only among the laser and control groups with regard to upper-sternal separation, while analysis of the laser, exercise and control groups in the case of upper-sternal separation and the between-groups comparison in terms of mid- and lower-sternal separation revealed no significant differences. LLLT and trunk stabilization exercises were found to be the most effective methods for sternotomy healing post-CABG surgery, with LLLT offering superior performance in the case of the upper sternum while trunk stabilization exercises were more effective for the lower sternum.",The Influence of a Xanthine-Catechin Chemical Matrix on in vitro Macrophage-Activation Triggered by Antipsychotic Ziprasidone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547260,Inflammation,2019 06 10,"Ziprasidone (ZIP) is an effective antipsychotic with low side effects than other second-generation antipsychotics. Despite this, there are reports of adverse events and previous studies associating the use of ZIP the inflammatory response. It is possible to infer that bioactive molecules present in some foods could attenuate peripheral inflammatory and oxidative stress potentially triggered ZIP. This is the case of guaraná xanthine-catechin chemical matrix (XC-Mix) that presents caffeine, theobromine, and catechin. The in vitro protocols using murine RAW 264.7 cell macrophages were ZIP-exposure in culture medium supplemented with chemical isolated and admixture of Caf, The, and Cat. Main results showed that supplementation with isolated and XC-mix had a lowering effect on 72 h macrophages proliferation. XC-mix with 1:1:1 proportion at 25 μg/mL of each caffeine, theobromine, and catechin, molecules present lowering effect on nitric oxide levels, oxidative stress markers (DNA oxidation quantified by 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine), lipoperoxidation, and protein carbonylation. XC-mix also decreased protein levels and downregulated genes of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α). At contrary, XC-Mix increased levels and upregulated gene of anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine. The results suggest that XC-matrix could present some beneficial action on peripheral proinflammatory effects ZIP-triggered.

In 6-12-year-olds (N = 2445; 51% birth-assigned boys), the Gender Identity Questionnaire for Children measured GV and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire measured six subdomains of ASD characteristics. Among nonclinical children, GV was associated with parent-reported difficulties orienting socially and stereotyped behaviors. GV was also associated with parent-reported clinical diagnoses of ASD, sensory processing disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. These findings suggest associations between specific ASD characteristics and GV in nonclinical children. Also, childhood GV should be further examined in a range of clinical populations, including ASD individuals.",Age as a Moderator of Social Skills Intervention Response Among Korean Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547257,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 23,"Few studies have investigated the effect of age on treatment effectiveness of evidence-based social skills training in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) adolescents.

We used the comparative risk assessment framework of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate CVD mortality attributable to diet; comprising eleven forms of CVDs, twelve food and nutrient groups and 27 risk-outcome pairs in four GBD regions including 51 countries by age and sex between 1990 and 2016. In 2016, dietary risks were associated with 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 1.7-2.5 million) in the WHO European Region, accounting for 22.4% of all deaths and 49.2% of CVD deaths. In terms of single dietary risks, a diet low in whole grains accounted for approximately 429,000 deaths, followed by a diet low in nuts and seeds (341,000 deaths), a diet low in fruits (262,000 deaths), a diet high in sodium (251,000 deaths), and a diet low in omega-3 fatty acids (227,000 deaths). Thus, with an optimized, i.e. balanced diet, roughly one in every five premature deaths could be prevented. Although age-standardized death rates decreased over the last 26 years, the absolute number of diet-related cardiovascular deaths increased between 2010 and 2016 by 25,600 deaths in Western Europe and by 4300 deaths in Central Asia. In 2016, approximately 601,000 deaths (28.6% of all diet-related CVD deaths) occurred among adults younger than 70 years.

With compelling non-epidemiological evidence, we posit that ubiquitous circadian disruption causes cancer and, moreover, that this is unexplored epidemiologically. This hypothesis offers a novel explanation why numerous studies in shift-workers evince inconsistent results: If circadian disruption is a ubiquitous causal phenomenon, confining assessments to the workplace, ignoring circadian disruption at play, and potential misclassification of 'who' is 'when' and 'how much' exposed to circadian disruption may disallow detecting the existence and magnitude of cancer risks.

In nature, plants function in complex environments where they encounter different biotic and abiotic stresses individually, sequentially or simultaneously. The adaptive response to a single stress does not always reflect how plants respond to such a stress in combination with other stresses. To identify genetic factors that contribute to the plant's ability to swiftly adapt to different stresses, we investigated the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to infection by the necrotrophic fungus B. cinerea when preceded by Pieris rapae herbivory or drought stress. Using 346 natural A. thaliana accessions, we found natural genetic variation in the level of resistance against single B. cinerea infection. When preceded by herbivory or drought stress, the level of B. cinerea resistance was differentially influenced in the 346 accessions. To study the genetic factors contributing to the differential adaptation of A. thaliana to B. cinerea infection under multi-stress conditions, we performed a genome-wide association study supported by quantitative trait loci mapping and fine mapping with full genome sequences of 164 accessions. This yielded several genes previously associated with defense to B. cinerea and additional candidate genes with putative roles in the plant's adaptive response to a combination of herbivory, drought and B. cinerea infection.",Cyanase-independent utilization of cyanate as a nitrogen source in ascomycete yeasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547239,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 01 29,"The occurrence of putative cyanases (EC 4.2.1.104) in the genomes of yeasts belonging to the ascomycete sub-phyla Saccharomycotina (budding yeasts) and Taphrinomycotina (fission yeasts) was investigated.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 plays a crucial role in recruiting BM cells expressing its receptor CXCR4. Recently, a CXCR4 antagonist, plerixafor, has been used to mobilize BM cells into the blood in efforts to enhance cell migration to sites of injury presumably improving healing. In this study, we employed zirconium-89 (89Zr)-oxine-labeled BM cells imaged with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to visualize and quantitate BM cell trafficking following acute bone injury and to investigate the effect of plerixafor on BM cell homing. Unilateral 1-mm incisions were created in the distal tibia of mice either on the same day (d0) or 24 h (d1) after 89Zr-oxine-labeled BM cell transfer (n = 4-6, 2-2.3 × 107 cells at 9.65-15.7 kBq/106 cells).

Bacillus licheniformis is a microbial mesophilic bacterium capable of secreting a large number of glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes, including a glycoside hydrolase from GH family 9 (BlCel9). Here, we conducted biochemical and biophysical studies of recombinant BlCel9, and its low-resolution molecular shape was retrieved from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. BlCel9 is an endoglucanase exhibiting maximum catalytic efficiency at pH 7.0 and 60 °C. Furthermore, it retains 80% of catalytic activity within a broad range of pH values (5.5-8.5) and temperatures (up to 50 °C) for extended periods of time (over 48 h). It exhibits the highest hydrolytic activity against phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), followed by bacterial cellulose (BC), filter paper (FP), and to a lesser extent carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The HPAEC-PAD analysis of the hydrolytic products demonstrated that the end product of the enzymatic hydrolysis is primarily cellobiose, and also small amounts of glucose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose are produced. SAXS data analysis revealed that the enzyme adopts a monomeric state in solution and has a molecular mass of 65.8 kDa as estimated from SAXS data. The BlCel9 has an elongated shape composed of an N-terminal family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c) and a C-terminal GH9 catalytic domain joined together by 20 amino acid residue long linker peptides. The domains are closely juxtaposed in an extended conformation and form a relatively rigid structure in solution, indicating that the interactions between the CBM3c and GH9 catalytic domains might play a key role in cooperative cellulose biomass recognition and hydrolysis.",Extremely thermoactive archaeal endoglucanase from a shallow marine hydrothermal vent from Vulcano Island.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547216,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 05 30,"Already-characterized microbial cellulases have proven to be highly useful for industrial processes, since they can withstand harsh industrial conditions with characteristics such as high thermo- and acid stability. These properties provide promising features for the process of plant biomass degradation and biofuel generation. Nevertheless, the number of known extremely thermoactive archaeal cellulases is low. Hence, the discovery of archaeal cellulases with different characteristics is crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable biorefinery. In this work, the metagenome of a high-temperature enrichment culture from marine environment of Vulcano Island was screened for the presence of novel endoglucanase-encoding genes of archaeal origin. The ORF vul_cel5A was detected, and the deduced protein was characterized as the most thermoactive endoglucanase described to date. Vul_Cel5A was identified as a thermoactive glycoside hydrolase family 5 endoglucanase, with the highest sequence identity (72-75%) to putative endoglucanases from archaeal genera. Vul_Cel5A showed the highest activity at notable 115 °C towards barley β-glucan (210.7 U/mg), and lichenan (209.9 U/mg), and further towards carboxymethyl cellulose (38.6 U/mg) and locust bean gum (83.0 U/mg). The endoglucanase exhibited a half-life time of 46 min at 100 °C and did not show any loss of activity after incubation for 48 h at 75 °C. Furthermore, Vul_Cel5A showed high affinity to barley β-glucan with a Km of 0.52 mg/mL and showed tolerance against various chemical reagents. Due to the outstanding high thermoactivity and thermostability and tolerance to acidic conditions, Vul_Cel5A represents a promising novel archaeal endo-β-glucanase for application in biorefineries for an efficient biomass pre-treatment.",Size of ischial fibro-ostosis is associated with heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547215,International orthopaedics,2018 12 14,The hypothesis of the present study was that degenerative fibro-ostosis (FO) of the ischial hamstring tendon insertion is a risk factor for heterotopic ossification (HO) following THA.,Comparison of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy versus microendoscopic discectomy for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547214,International orthopaedics,2019 04 02,"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and microendoscopic discectomy (MED) for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH), and to clarify whether PELD is more superior to MED.","Race/ethnicity, nativity, and lifetime risk of mental disorders in US adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547212,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2019 06 10,"There has been no comprehensive examination of how race/ethnicity and nativity intersect in explaining differences in lifetime prevalence of mental disorders among Asian, Black, Latino, and White adults.

Beef plant isolates (50) including 18 Gram-negative aerobes (GNA), 8 Gram-positive aerobes (GPA), 5 lactic acid bacteria (LAB), 9 Enterobacteriaceae (EB), and 10 generic Escherichia coli (GEC) were included for developing biofilms in mono- and co-culture with S. Typhimurium at 15 °C for 6 days. Five selected cultures in planktonic form and in biofilms were tested for susceptibility to two commonly used sanitizers (i.e. E-San and Perox-E Plus). In mono-cultures, ≥ 80, 67, 61, 20, and 13% of GEC, EB, GNA, LAB, and GPA, respectively, developed measurable biofilms after 2 days, while all co-culture pairings with S. Typhimurium achieved some level of biofilm production. The predominant effect of EB and only effect of GEC strains on the biofilm formation of S. Typhimurium was antagonistic, while that of Gram-positive bacteria was synergistic, with the effect being more prominent on day 6. The effect was highly variable for the GNA isolates. Six aerobic isolates that formed moderate/strong biofilms by day 2 greatly boosted the co-culture biofilm formation. Seven Gram-negative bacteria were antagonistic against the biofilm formation of the co-cultures. Both sanitizers completely inactivated the selected planktonic cultures, but were largely ineffective against biofilms. In conclusion, all beef plant isolates assessed formed biofilms when paired with S. Typhimurium.

Various mechanisms have been proposed. Although an antiplatelet agent is commonly recommended as thromboprophylaxis in NTDT, the role of platelets contributing to this hypercoagulable state is not well-defined. This study aims to evaluate the role of platelets contributing to hypercoagulability in NTDT patients using thrombin generation (TG). Platelet-rich (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were collected from NTDT patients (n = 30) and normal controls (n = 20) for TG measurement and compared. Controls had higher endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) in PPP (1204.97 nM.min vs 911.62 nM.min, p < 0.001) and PRP (1424.23 nM.min vs 983.99 nM.min, p < 0.001) than patients. Patients' mean normalized ETP ratio [{PRP ETP (patient)/PPP ETP (patient)}/{mean PPP ETP (controls)/mean PPP ETP (controls)}], demonstrated that the presence of platelet does not alter ETP (mean ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1.02, equivalence defined as 10%). Types of thalassaemia, splenectomy, and severity of liver iron overload did not significantly influence patients' ETP in PPP and PRP by multivariate analysis. Platelets did not increase the TG potential of NTDT patients. Instead of being hypercoagulable, our NTDT patients were hypocoagulable by ETP measurement, although this could not be conclusively demonstrated to correlate with their iron overloading state giving rise to reduced synthesis of coagulation factors. The guideline recommendations for thromboprophylaxis with antiplatelet agents in similar NTDT patients should be re-examined.",MicroRNA-124 inhibits TNF-α- and IL-6-induced osteoclastogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547186,Rheumatology international,2019 04 01,"Receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-independent osteoclastogenic pathway was reported recently. MicroRNA (miR)-124 has been known to suppress RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting NFATc1 expression. However, whether miR-124 regulates a RANKL-independent pathway has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined whether a RANKL-independent pathway is regulated by miR-124 in addition to the RANKL-dependent one. Using osteoclastogenic culture and pit-formation assay, we found that a miR-124 mimic inhibited osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated by TNF-α, IL-6, and M-CSF in the presence of osteoprotegerin. We also showed that the expression levels of osteoclast-specific genes and NFATc1 protein were suppressed in the miR-124 mimic-transfected cells by performing quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Our results indicate that miR-124 is important in inhibiting both RANKL-dependent and -independent osteoclast differentiation by suppressing NFATc1-mediated pathway.",Breaking the curse of dimensionality to identify causal variants in Breeding 4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547185,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 16,"In the past, plant breeding has undergone three major transformations and is currently transitioning to a new technological phase, Breeding 4. This phase is characterized by the development of methods for biological design of plant varieties, including transformation and gene editing techniques directed toward causal loci. The application of such technologies will require to reliably estimate the effect of loci in plant genomes by avoiding the situation where the number of loci assayed (p) surpasses the number of plant genotypes (n). Here, we discuss approaches to avoid this curse of dimensionality (n ≪ p), which will involve analyzing intermediate phenotypes such as molecular traits and component traits related to plant morphology or physiology. Because these approaches will rely on novel data types such as DNA sequences and high-throughput phenotyping images, Breeding 4 will call for analyses that are complementary to traditional quantitative genetic studies, being based on machine learning techniques which make efficient use of sequence and image data. In this article, we will present some of these techniques and their application for prioritizing causal loci and developing improved varieties in Breeding 4.",Characterisation of barley resistance to rhynchosporium on chromosome 6HS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547184,TAG.

However, emerging data suggest that vaccines may not protect all populations equally. Specifically, studies analyzing variation in vaccine-induced immunity have pointed to the critical impact of genetics, the environment, nutrition, the microbiome, and sex in influencing vaccine responsiveness. The significant contribution of sex to modulating vaccine-induced immunity has gained attention over the last years. Specifically, females typically develop higher antibody responses and experience more adverse events following vaccination than males. This enhanced immune reactogenicity among females is thought to render females more resistant to infectious diseases, but conversely also contribute to higher incidence of autoimmunity among women. Dissection of mechanisms which underlie sex differences in vaccine-induced immunity has implicated hormonal, genetic, and microbiota differences across males and females. This review will highlight the importance of sex-dependent differences in vaccine-induced immunity and specifically will address the role of sex as a modulator of humoral immunity, key to long-term pathogen-specific protection."

The increasing number of the alkyl chains of the ancillary bipy ligand shifts the ground- and excited-state potentials to the more negative values, although the introduction of the longer nonyl chain in P4 shows the opposite effect.

Both the [Mn(paada)]- and [Mn(nta)]- complexes turned out to contain two inner-sphere water molecules in aqueous solution. The exchange rate of these coordinated water molecules was slower in [Mn(paada)]- (k298ex = 90 × 107 s-1) than in [Mn(nta)]- (k298ex = 280 × 107 s-1). The complexes were also characterised using both DFT (TPSSh/def2-TZVP) and ab initio CAS(5,5) calculations. The lipophylic [Mn(C12Opaada)]- complex forms micelles in solution characterised by a critical micellar concentration (cmc) of 0.31 ± 0.01 mM. This complex also forms a rather strong adduct with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with an association constant of 5.5 × 104 M-1 at 25 °C. The enthalpy and entropy changes obtained for the formation of the adduct indicate that the binding event is driven by hydrophobic interactions.",The effect of gel structure on the in vitro digestibility of wheat starch-Mesona chinensis polysaccharide gels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547164,Food & function,2019 04 09,"The digestibility of wheat starch gels in the presence of Mesona chinensis polysaccharide (MCP) was studied. MCP was found to be the most effective polysaccharide in reducing wheat starch digestion in comparison to starch gels of similar hardness containing xanthan, guar, locust bean gum (LBG) and agar. A 33% reduction in the digestibility of intact starch gels containing 5% w/w MCP (after 120 minutes of digestion) was observed and this was attributed to the strengthening of the gels in the presence of high concentration of the polysaccharide. In contrast, despite a reduction in the firmness of the gel when 2% w/w MCP was present, there was a 7% reduction in starch digestibility and hence, firmness was deduced to be not solely responsible for the digestibility of the gels. When these gels were macerated, starch digestibility was reduced regardless of the MCP concentration. Starch digestion in the macerated samples seemed to cease after 10 minutes with about 30% more starch remaining when 5% w/w MCP was present, suggesting that the amount of starch available for digestion was reduced in the presence of MCP. The reduced availability of starch for digestion was hypothesised to be due to starch-MCP interactions, which formed amylose-MCP complexes that are likely to be resistant to enzymatic digestion. Overall, this work shows the potential for MCP to be utilized as an ingredient to reduce the glycaemic index.","Neptunium(iv)-hydroxamate complexes: their speciation, and kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547163,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 01 03,"Simple hydroxamic acids such as acteohydroxamic acid (AHA) have been identified as suitable reagents for the control of Pu and Np in advanced separation processes for nuclear fuel reprocessing such as the Advanced PUREX or UREX based recycle processes, due to their ability to strip the tetravalent form of Pu and Np from tri-butyl phosphate into nitric acid. However, both free and metal bound hydroxamates are known to undergo acid catalysed hydrolysis at low pH, the kinetics of which must be characterised before implementation of PUREX/UREX based reprocessing flowsheets. In support of this implementation, a comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic model that describes both the complex speciation and hydrolysis of AHA in the presence of Np(iv) has been developed. The model has two unique features: (i) in the case of the hydrolysis reaction kinetics, the model includes the hydrolysis of not only free AHA but also both the mono- and bishydroxamato-Np(iv) complexes; (ii) for the associated speciation calculations, the model explicitly includes the ionic strength dependence of not only the mono- and bishydroxamato-Np(iv) complexes but also the mono- and bisnitrato neptunium(iv) and monohydroxoneptunium(iv) complexes. For the latter three species, respective SIT coefficients of Δε1,NO3 = -0.13 ± 0.03 kg mol-1, , Δε2,NO3 = -0.37 ± 0.13 kg mol-1, Δε1,OH = -0.36 kg mol-1 and log10 K01,OH = -1.23 were also determined. Using experimental data from a series of kinetic studies on the Np(iv)-AHA system, this model has been used to determine the rate constants for hydrolysis of mono- and bis-acetohydroxamatoneptunium(iv) at 25 °C for the first time. These were found to be 3.5 × 10-5 ± 2.5 × 10-5 dm3 mol-1 s-1 and 1.9 × 10-3 ± 1.3 × 10-3 dm3 mol-1 s-1, respectively. Comparison of these values with the rate constants for hydrolysis of free AHA indicates that complexation of AHA with Np(iv) increases the rate of hydroxamate hydrolysis - an observation that we attribute to the electron withdrawing effect of the metal centre within the Np(iv)-AHA complex increasing the susceptibility of the AHA carbonyl carbon to nucleophilic attack, the accepted first step in its mechanism of hydrolysis.",Visible-light mediated carbamoyl radical addition to heteroarenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547162,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 01 10,"The generation of carbamoyl radicals, followed by their addition to heteroarenes, was performed under mild conditions through a metal-free photocatalyzed decarboxylation of oxamic acids.

IEEE International Inter-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support. IEEE International Multi-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support,2019 01 03,"In the surgical setting, team members constantly deal with a high-demand operative environment that requires simultaneously processing a large amount of information. In certain situations, high demands imposed by surgical tasks and other sources may exceed team member's cognitive capacity, leading to cognitive overload which may place patient safety at risk. In the present study, we describe a novel approach to integrate an objective measure of team member's cognitive load with procedural, behavioral and contextual data from real-life cardiac surgeries. We used heart rate variability analysis, capturing data simultaneously from multiple team members (surgeon, anesthesiologist and perfusionist) in a real-time and unobtrusive manner. Using audio-video recordings, behavioral coding and a hierarchical surgical process model, we integrated multiple data sources to create an interactive surgical dashboard, enabling the analysis of the cognitive load imposed by specific steps, substeps and/or tasks. The described approach enables us to detect cognitive load fluctuations over time, under specific conditions (e.g. emergencies, teaching) and in situations that are prone to errors. This in-depth understanding of the relationship between cognitive load, task demands and error occurrence is essential for the development of cognitive support systems to recognize and mitigate errors during complex surgical care in the operating room.",Exploring 6-Azaindole and 7-Azaindole Rings for Developing Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Allosteric Modulators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547095,Cannabis and cannabinoid research,2018 12 17,"Introduction and Objective: Org27569 is a prototypical allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). It belongs to the indole-2-carboxamide scaffold and has been intensively investigated in pharmacology and in structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. Although azaindoles are rare in natural products and differ only by the presence of an extra ring nitrogen, they were demonstrated as valuable bioisosteres in many pharmacologically important molecules. To extend the SAR investigation of the indole-2-carboxamide class of CB1 allosteric modulators, azaindole (pyrrolopyridine) rings were used to replace the indole ring of Org27569 analogs to explore the potential of azaindole-2-carboxamides as CB1 allosteric modulators. Using 6- and 7-azaindole in lieu of the indole moiety within this class of CB1 allosteric modulators indeed improved the aqueous solubility. Materials and Methods: We synthesized 6- and 7-azaindole-2-carboxamides and their indole-2-carboxamide counterparts. The molecules were evaluated by [3H]CP55,940 binding and [35S]GTPγS binding assays for their allosteric modulation of the CB1 receptor. Results: The 7-azaindole-2-carboxamides lost the ability to bind to the CB1 receptor. The 6-azaindole-2-carboxamides (e.g., 3c and 3d) showed markedly reduced binding affinities to the CB1 receptor in comparison with their indole-2-carboxamide counterparts. However, they behaved similarly as indole-2-carboxamides in potentiating the orthosteric agonist binding and inhibiting the orthosteric agonist-induced G-protein coupling. The results indicated that some azaindole scaffolds (e.g., 6-azaindole) are worth further exploration, whereas the 7-azaindole ring is not a viable bioisostere of the indole ring in the Org27569 class of CB1 allosteric modulators.",Subregional Hippocampal Thickness Abnormalities in Older Adults with a History of Heavy Cannabis Use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547094,Cannabis and cannabinoid research,2019 03 12,"Background and Aims: Legalization of cannabis (CB) for both medicinal and, in some states, recreational use, has given rise to increasing usage rates across the country. Of particular concern are indications that frequent CB use may be selectively harmful to the developing adolescent brain compared with adult-onset usage. However, the long-term effects of heavy, adolescent CB use on brain structure and cognitive performance in late-life remain unknown. A critical brain region is the hippocampus (HC), where there is a striking intersection between high concentrations of cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors and age-related pathology. Design: We investigated whether older adults (average age=66.6+7.2 years old) with a history of early life CB use show morphological differences in hippocampal subregions compared with older, nonusers. Methods: We performed high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with computational techniques to assess cortical thickness of the medial temporal lobe, neuropsychological testing, and extensive drug use histories on 50 subjects (24 formerly heavy cannabis users [CB+ group] abstinent for an average of 28.7 years, 26 nonusers [CB- group]). We investigated group differences in hippocampal subregions, controlling for age, sex, and intelligence (as measured by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading), years of education, and cigarette use. Results: The CB+ subjects exhibited thinner cortices in subfields cornu ammonis 1 [CA1; F(1,42)=9.96, p=0.0003], and CA2, 3, and the dentate gyrus [CA23DG; F(1,42)=23.17, p<0.0001], and in the entire HC averaged over all subregions [F(1,42)=8.49, p=0.006]. Conclusions: Negative effects of chronic adolescent CB use on hippocampal structure are maintained well into late life. Because hippocampal cortical loss underlies and exacerbates age-related cognitive decline, these findings have profound implications for aging adults with a history of early life usage.

The quasistatic motion model of the robot is formulated as a potential energy minimization problem. The Jacobian of the quasistatic motion model is used in calculating the actuations that steer the tip in the desired directions.

Although recent zebrafish genetic studies have linked cilia motility and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow defects with scoliosis progression, underlying mechanisms were not identified. Here, we use next-generation sequencing and conditional genetic methodologies to define the spatial and biological origins of spinal curve formation in ptk7 mutant zebrafish, a faithful IS model. We demonstrate that focal activation of proinflammatory signals within the spinal cord is associated with, and sufficient for, induction of spinal curvatures. Furthermore, administration of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to juvenile ptk7 mutants significantly reduces the incidence and/or severity of scoliosis phenotypes. Together, our results implicate neuroinflammation, downstream of CSF defects, in spinal curve formation and provide intriguing evidence that simple immunomodulating therapies might prove effective in managing idiopathic-like spinal deformities.",New neurons use Slit-Robo signaling to migrate through the glial meshwork and approach a lesion for functional regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547091,Science advances,2018 12 17,"After brain injury, neural stem cell-derived neuronal precursors (neuroblasts) in the ventricular-subventricular zone migrate toward the lesion. However, the ability of the mammalian brain to regenerate neuronal circuits for functional recovery is quite limited. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we show that neuroblast migration is restricted by reactive astrocytes in and around the lesion. To migrate, the neuroblasts use Slit1-Robo2 signaling to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in reactive astrocytes at the site of contact. Slit1-overexpressing neuroblasts transplanted into the poststroke brain migrated closer to the lesion than did control neuroblasts. These neuroblasts matured into striatal neurons and efficiently regenerated neuronal circuits, resulting in functional recovery in the poststroke mice. These results suggest that the positioning of new neurons will be critical for functional neuronal regeneration in stem/progenitor cell-based therapies for brain injury."

Methods & clinical development,2018 12 17,"Focusing T cell responses on the most vulnerable parts of HIV-1, the functionally conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins, is likely a key prerequisite for vaccine success. For a T cell vaccine to efficiently control HIV-1 replication, the vaccine-elicited individual CD8+ T cells and as a population have to display a number of critical traits. If any one of these traits is suboptimal, the vaccine is likely to fail. Fine-tuning of individual protective characteristics of T cells will require iterative stepwise improvements in clinical trials. Although the second-generation tHIVconsvX immunogens direct CD8+ T cells to predominantly protective and conserved epitopes, in the present work, we have used formulated self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) to deliver tHIVconsvX to the immune system. We demonstrated in BALB/c and outbred mice that regimens employing saRNA vaccines induced broadly specific, plurifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which displayed structured memory subpopulations and were maintained at relatively high frequencies over at least 22 weeks post-administration. This is one of the first thorough analyses of mRNA vaccine-elicited T cell responses. The combination of tHIVconsvX immunogens and the highly versatile and easily manufacturable saRNA platform may provide a long-awaited opportunity to define and optimize induction of truly protective CD8+ T cell parameters in human volunteers.",AAV8 Gene Therapy for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome in Macaques Elicited Transgene T Cell Responses That Are Resident to the Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547050,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2018 12 17,"Systemic delivery of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has been evaluated for the treatment of several liver diseases, including homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, and hemophilia. Here, we evaluated this approach for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome. We administered wild-type rhesus macaques with 1.0 × 1013 or 2.5 × 1013 genome copies/kg of an AAV serotype 8 vector expressing a codon-optimized version of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) from a liver-specific promoter. We extensively studied vector biodistribution, transgene expression, and immune responses following vector administration. All rhesus macaques survived until their scheduled necropsy at day 56 and showed no clinical abnormalities during the course of the study. Macaques administered with either vector dose developed a T cell response to the AAV capsid and/or transgene. We mapped the immunodominant epitope in the human UGT1A1 sequence, and we found no correlation between peripheral and tissue-resident lymphocyte responses. Upon further investigation, we characterized CD107a+, granzyme B+, CD4+, and CD8+ transgene-specific cellular responses that were restricted to tissue-resident T cells. This study highlights the importance of studying immune responses at the vector transduction site and the limited usefulness of blood as a surrogate to evaluate tissue-restricted T cell responses.",Lentiviral Vector Purification Using Genetically Encoded Biotin Mimic in Packaging Cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547049,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2018 12 18,"Lentiviral vectors (LVs) have recently witnessed an increasing demand in research and clinical applications. Their current purification processes represent the main bottleneck in their widespread use, as the methods used are cumbersome and yield low recoveries. We aimed to develop a one-step method to specifically purify LVs, with high yields and reduced levels of impurities, using the biotin-streptavidin system. Herein, packaging HEK293T cells were genetically engineered with a cyclical biotin-mimicking peptide displayed on a CD8α stalk, termed cTag8. LVs were modified with cTag8 by its passive incorporation onto viral surfaces during budding, without viral protein engineering or hindrance on infectivity. Expression of cTag8 on LVs allowed complete capture of infectious particles by streptavidin magnetic beads. As cTag8 binds streptavidin in the nanomolar range, the addition of micromolar concentrations of biotin resulted in the release of captured LVs by competitive elution, with overall yields of ≥60%. Analysis of eluted LVs revealed high purity with a >3-log and 2-log reduction in DNA contamination and host cell proteins, respectively. This one-step purification was also tested for scalable vector processing using monolith affinity chromatography, with an encouraging preliminary overall yield of 20%. This method will be of valuable use for both research and clinical applications of LVs.",Barcoding of Macaque Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells: A Robust Platform to Assess Vector Genotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547048,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2018 12 18,"Gene therapies using integrating retrovirus vectors to modify hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells have shown great promise for the treatment of immune system and hematologic diseases. However, activation of proto-oncogenes via insertional mutagenesis has resulted in the development of leukemia. We have utilized cellular bar coding to investigate the impact of different vector designs on the clonal behavior of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during in vivo expansion, as a quantitative surrogate assay for genotoxicity in a non-human primate model with high relevance for human biology. We transplanted two rhesus macaques with autologous CD34+ HSPCs transduced with three lentiviral vectors containing different promoters and/or enhancers of a predicted range of genotoxicities, each containing a high-diversity barcode library that uniquely tags each individual transduced HSPC. Analysis of clonal output from thousands of individual HSPCs transduced with these barcoded vectors revealed sustained clonal diversity, with no progressive dominance of clones containing any of the three vectors for up to almost 3 years post-transplantation. Our data support a low genotoxic risk for lentivirus vectors in HSPCs, even those containing strong promoters and/or enhancers. Additionally, this flexible system can be used for the testing of future vector designs.",Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Gene Therapy Extends the Lifespan of Lupus-Prone Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547047,Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development,2018 12 18,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by high levels of pathogenic autoantibodies and tissue damage. Multiple studies showed that dendritic cell (DC) activation plays a critical role in SLE pathogenesis. Human alpha 1 antitrypsin (hAAT) is a serine proteinase inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. In this study, we first examined the effects of hAAT on the functions of DCs from lupus-prone mice, and we showed that hAAT treatment efficiently inhibited CpG- (TLR9 agonist) induced activation of bone marrow-derived conventional and plasmacytoid DCs as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The hAAT treatment also attenuated DC help for B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin M (IgM) production. We next tested the protective effect of hAAT protein and gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 (rAAV8-CB-hAAT) in a spontaneous lupus mouse model, and we showed that both treatments decreased autoantibody levels. Importantly, rAAV8-CB-hAAT did not induce an immune response to its transgene product (hAAT), but it showed more pronounced therapeutic effects in reducing urine protein levels and extending the lifespan of these mice.

Moreover, the economic burden of UL on health care system is enormous due to the high cost of surgeries. Thus, therapeutic options with long-term efficacy to replace surgical management are urgently needed. For the development of such medical options, reliable preclinical research models are imperative. Ex vivo culture of UL cells has been the primary research model for decades. However, recent studies demonstrated that primary cell culture is not a suitable model for UL research, as primary cultures of ULs mostly consist of non-tumor fibroblasts.

Total folates varied from 175 to 440 μg/100 g for durian arils and from 15.0 to 417 μg/100 g for durian products. These contents are extraordinarily high compared to other fruits and may be correlated to the upregulated methionine biosynthesis pathway reported recently.

Typically PET systems are constructed with many regular gaps between the detector modules in a ring or box configuration, with additional axial gaps between the rings. Although this has been significantly reduced with the use of the compact high granularity SiPM photodetector technology, such a scanner design leads to a decrease in the number of annihilation photons that are detected causing lower scanner sensitivity. Moreover, the ability to precisely determine the line of response (LOR) along which the positron annihilated is diminished closer to the detector edges because the spatial resolution there is degraded due to edge effects. This happens for both monolithic based designs, caused by the truncation of the scintillation light distribution, but also for detector blocks that use crystal arrays with a number of elements that are larger than the number of photosensors and, therefore, make use of the light sharing principle. In this report we present a design for a small-animal PET scanner based on a single monolithic annulus-like scintillator that can be used as a PET insert in high-field Magnetic Resonance systems. We provide real data showing the performance improvement when edge-less modules are used. We also describe the specific proposed design for a rodent scanner that employs facetted outside faces in a single LYSO tube. In a further step, in order to support and prove the proposed edgeless geometry, simulations of that scanner have been performed and lately reconstructed showing the advantages of the design.",Enrichment and Genomic Characterization of a N2O-Reducing Chemolithoautotroph From a Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547029,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2018 12 17,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas and also leads to stratospheric ozone depletion. In natural environments, only a single N2O sink process is the microbial reduction of N2O to N2, which is mediated by nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ) encoded by nosZ gene. The nosZ phylogeny has two distinct clades, clade I and formerly overlooked clade II. In deep-sea hydrothermal environments, several members of the class Campylobacteria are shown to harbor clade II nosZ gene and perform the complete denitrification of nitrate to N2; however, little is known about their ability to grow on exogenous N2O as the sole electron acceptor. Here, we obtained an enrichment culture from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in the Southern Mariana Trough, which showed a respiratory N2O reduction with H2 as an electron donor. The single amplicon sequence variant (ASV) presenting 90% similarity to Hydrogenimonas species within the class Campylobacteria was predominant throughout the cultivation period. Metagenomic analyses using a combination of short-read and long-read sequence data succeeded in reconstructing a complete genome of the dominant ASV, which encoded clade II nosZ gene. This study represents the first cultivation analysis that shows the occurrence of N2O-respiring microorganisms in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent and provides the opportunity to assess their capability to reduce N2O emission from the environments.",Perfluorophenyl Derivatives as Unsymmetrical Linkers for Solid Phase Conjugation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547028,Frontiers in chemistry,2018 12 17,"Linkers play major roles in conjugation chemistry toward the advancement of drug discovery.

Research in high-income nations suggests that improved CVH is linked with decreased cognitive impairment risk, but it is unclear if this pattern is evident in low-income countries. Nationally-representative data collected in China were drawn from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGing and adult health Wave 1 (2007-2010; n = 11,295). Seven CVH factors were classified as ""ideal"" or ""not ideal"": smoking and drinking frequency, body mass index, physical activity level, blood pressure, diet, and self-reported anxiety. Additionally, scores from five cognitive performance tests (immediate and delayed verbal recall, forward and backward digit span, verbal fluency) were used to create a composite cognitive function variable. Linear regression analyses tested whether ideal CVH measures were associated with higher composite cognitive performance, controlling for sociodemographic factors. As hypothesized, ideal CVH was generally associated with higher cognitive performance. Low anxiety levels and reliable access to sufficient food (including produce) were particularly associated with higher cognitive function. These results suggest early detection and controlling modifiable CVH risks may protect aging individuals in China from cognitive decline.",Declining Condom Use Among Sex Workers in Western Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547024,Frontiers in public health,2018 12 17,"Introduction: Since the emergence of the HIV pandemic in the 1980s, high rates of condom use for penetrative sex have been reported among sex workers in Australia. The sex industry in Australia and elsewhere has changed over the previous decade with increasing proportions of sex workers working privately and lower proportions of sex workers working in brothels. There has also been some evidence of reductions in condom use, particularly during penetrative oral sex. We therefore decided to investigate sex workers' use of condoms during penetrative sex with clients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional mixed methods study of sex workers in Western Australia. The study involved an environmental scan of the sex industry in Western Australia, visits to brothels and other sexual services premises, a survey of sex workers and in-depth interviews. Results: We surveyed 354 male, female, and transgender sex workers in Western Australia. We found unexpectedly low rates of reported condom use with clients for all forms of penetrative sex. Of respondents who reported providing this type of service, 33% reported that all clients used condoms during oral sex, 69% during vaginal sex and 59% during anal sex. High levels of client demand for condomless sex was also reported, with 42% of sex workers reporting that all or most clients requested condomless oral sex. Increasing client demand, fear of losing clients and the ability to charge more for condomless sex were reported reasons for providing this service. Conclusions: There has been an apparent increase in sex workers reporting condomless penetrative sex with clients in Western Australia compared to a previous cross-sectional study. An increase in private sex work and client demand for condomless sex together with an economic downturn leading to increased competition for clients may be important contributing factors.",Similarities and Differences Between Staphylococcal and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndromes in Children: Results From a 30-Case Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547021,Frontiers in pediatrics,2018 12 17,"Introduction: Toxic shock syndromes (TSS) are severe shocks due to staphylococcal or streptococcal infection that require specific treatments. The early recognition of these shocks is crucial to improve their outcomes. Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS in children, in order to identify putative early clinical diagnostic criteria. Secondary objectives were to determine the toxin gene profiles of associated isolated strains and the relevance of measuring Vβ T-cell signatures to confirm the diagnosis. Study design: We performed a multicenter retrospective evaluation of clinical data, biological results, and treatment outcomes of children with a confirmed or probable case of staphylococcal or streptococcal TSS. Children were consecutively included if they were admitted to the pediatric intensive care units of Lyon (France), between January 2005 and July 2011. Results: Among the 30 analyzed children, 15 presented staphylococcal TSS and 15 streptococcal TSS. The most frequent origin of staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS was the lower respiratory tract (53%) and the genital tract (47%) respectively. Non-menstrual TSS syndrome cases presented more frequently with neurological alterations, and digestive signs were predominant in menstrual forms. Compared to Staphylococcal TSS, Streptococcal TSS presented with higher organ dysfunction scores (median Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score 20.9 (4.1-100) vs. 1.7 (1.3-2.3), p = 0.001), required respiratory support more frequently (80 vs. 33%, p = 0.02), were intubated for a longer time (3 days (0.75-5) vs. 1 day (0-1.5), p = 0.006) and had a non-significant trend of higher, case-fatality rate (20 vs. 7%, p = 0.60). The lack of antitoxin therapy was associated with higher case-fatality rate (50 vs. 4%, p = 0.04). The Vβ repertoire measurements exhibited toxin dependent-alterations in accordance with the toxin gene profiles of isolated strains in both types of toxic shock syndromes. Regarding toxin gene profiles of isolated strains, 10/15 Staphylococcus aureus belonged to clonal complex (CC) 30 and 6/12 Streptococcus pyogenes were emm1 type suggesting clonal etiologies for both staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS. Conclusion: Despite the involvement of functionally similar toxins, staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS differed by their clinical signs, origin of infection and prognosis. The detection of Vβ profiles was useful to confirm the diagnosis of staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS and for the identification of involved toxins.",Effect of different surface treatments and bonding modalities on the shear bond strength between metallic orthodontic brackets and glazed monolithic zirconia crowns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547019,Journal of orthodontic science,2018 12 17,To evaluate the effect of different surface treatments and bonding modalities on the shear bond strength (SBS) between metallic orthodontic brackets and zirconia crowns.

Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I-IV glioma treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) between the years of 2004-13 were identified. Patients were stratified based on WHO Grade and photon radiotherapy (XRT) vs. PBT. Univariate (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA) with OS were performed by Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank tests. Propensity score (PS) weighting was utilized to account for differences in patient characteristics and to minimize selection bias. Results: There were a total of 49,405 patients treated with XRT and 170 patients treated with PBT. Median follow-up time was 62.1 months. On MVA, the following factors were associated with receipt of PBT (all p < 0.05): WHO Grade I-II gliomas, treatment at an academic/research program, west geographic facility location, and surgical resection. After PS weighting, all patients treated with PBT were found to have superior median and 5 year survival than patients treated with XRT: 45.9 vs. 29.7 months (p = 0.009) and 46.1 vs. 35.5% (p = 0.0160), respectively. Conclusions: PBT is associated with improved OS compared to XRT for patients with gliomas. This finding warrants verification in the randomized trial setting in order to account for potential patient imbalances not adequately captured by the NCDB, such as tumor molecular characteristics and patient performance status. Importance of the Study: This is the first study that compares the outcomes of patients treated with photon based radiotherapy vs. proton based radiotherapy for patients with gliomas. In this retrospective analysis, the results demonstrate that proton therapy is associated with improved outcomes which support ongoing prospective, randomized clinical trials comparing the two modalities in patients with gliomas.",A Dual Mode Propulsion System for Small Satellite Applications‡.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547007,"Aerospace (Basel, Switzerland)",2018 12 16,"This study focused on the development of a chemical micropropulsion system suitable for primary propulsion and/or attitude control for a nanosatellite.

Particle size distribution (0.3-1 μm) was measured using a Grimm Environmental Dust Monitor and was conducted in two seasons, hot and cold (summer 2016 and winter 2016). The measurement was performed twice per month. Although the average number of particles at Azadi Terminal was more than the other two locations in both seasons but it was not significant) p > 0.05). The average number of particles larger than 0.3 μm was 286.72 ± 129.55 and 183.61 ± 86.79 cm-3 in winter and summer respectively. In relation to particles size distribution, the average number of particles larger than 0.4, 0.5, 0.65, 0.8 and 1 μm in winter and summer were 111.5 ± 120, 29.3 ± 23.7, 8.2 ± 5.8, 4 ± 3, 2 ± 1.5 and 52.5 ± 37, 14.4 ± 10.8, 6.1 ± 5, 3.8 ± 3.5, 2.3 ± 2 cm-3 respectively. In the current study the highest number of particles significantly observed in winter time in comparison to summer.

Network topology, and possible directed connections and unequal weights of nodes and links, are essential features of the model. The same influence spreading model is used for community detection in social networks and for analysis of network structures. Weaker connections give rise to more sub-communities whereas stronger ties increase the cohesion of a community. The validity of the method is demonstrated with different social networks. Our model takes into account different paths between nodes in the network structure. The dependency of different paths having common links at the beginning of their paths makes the model more realistic compared to classical structural, simulation and random walk models. The influence of all nodes in a network has not been satisfactorily understood. Existing models may underestimate the spreading power of interconnected peripheral nodes as initiators of dynamic processes in social, biological and technical networks.",Novel vaccines targeting dendritic cells by coupling allergoids to mannan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546997,Allergo journal international,2018 12 17,"Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the single disease-modifying treatment for allergy.

Management of ameloblastoma poses a challenge for all involved in the field of head and neck surgery because successful treatment requires not only adequate resection but also a functional and aesthetically acceptable reconstruction of the residual defect. Methods Patients who had histologically proven ameloblastoma between 1991 and 2009 were identified from the database of Aga Khan University Hospital. A review of all medical records, radiological images, operative reports and pathology reports was undertaken. Results A total of 15 patients with histologically confirmed ameloblastoma were identified. Out of 15 patients nine were males and six were females with age range from 20 to 60 years (mean age 43 years). The most common symptom found in our patient group was painless facial swelling. In 13 patients the origin of tumor was mandible and in the remaining two the tumor originated from maxilla. Eleven out of 15 patients underwent segmental mandibulectomy, two had maxillectomy and two had enucleation. All patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy required reconstruction. Reconstruction was done with microsurgical free tissue transfer in eight patients, non-vascularized iliac crest bone graft was used in one patient and two had plating only. All free flaps survived with no evidence of flap loss. The mean follow-up was eight years. There was no evidence of graft failure which was used in one patient. Complication was seen in only one of our patients in the form of plate exposure. Recurrence was seen in two of our cases who primarily underwent enucleation. All patients had satisfactory speech, cosmesis and mastication. Conclusion The management of ameloblastoma still poses a big challenge in spite of being the most common odontogenic tumor. In our study we have found that segmental mandibulectomy with disease-free margin of around 1 cm and immediate reconstruction with free tissue transfer have shown good results.",Phase II Trial of Pure Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Localized Carcinoma of the Prostate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546982,Cureus,2018 12 17,"Purpose To evaluate acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and the biochemical control of pure hypofractionated radiotherapy (without acceleration) for the treatment of prostate cancer. Methods and materials This phase II prospective trial evaluated low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients who received hypofractionated radiotherapy. Fifty-three patients with low-risk prostate cancer received 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 156 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer received 60 Gy in 20 fractions over eight weeks. Acute toxicity and late toxicity were graded per the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity scales and the Phoenix Definition (nadir plus two) defined biochemical failure. Results Median follow-up was 6.5 years. Acute phase grade 2/3 toxicity was 6%/0 and 8%/2% for GI and GU symptoms, respectively, and one grade 4 acute GU toxicity (0.5%). Late grade 2/3 GI and GU toxicity were 7%/0 and 8%/0.5%, respectively. There were no late grade 4 toxicities. The five-year freedom-from-biochemical-failure (FFBF) rates were 85% for low-risk patients and 80% for intermediate-risk patients. Conclusions Pure hypofractionation seems to be associated with low toxicity rates and biochemical control rates that are similar or better than those observed with accelerated hypofractionated or conventionally fractionated therapy.",Optimal Scene Time to Achieve Favorable Outcomes in Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: How Long Is Too Long?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546981,Cureus,2018 12 17,"Background Despite advances in resuscitation science and public health, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) cases have an average survival rate of only 12% nationwide, compared to 24.8% of cases occurring in hospital. Many factors, including resuscitation interventions, contribute to positive patient outcomes and have, therefore, been studied in attempts to optimize emergency medical services (EMS) protocols to achieve higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the field. However, no consensus has been met regarding the appropriate amount of time for EMS to spend on scene. Aim A favorable outcome is defined as patients that achieved the combination of ROSC and a final disposition of ""ongoing resuscitation in the emergency department (ED)."" The primary purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the scene time interval (STI) in which American urban EMS systems achieved the highest rates of favorable outcomes in non-traumatic OOHCAs. Methods All EMS-related data, including demographics, presenting rhythm, airway management, chemical interventions, and ROSC were recorded using a standardized EMS charting system by the highest-ranking EMS provider on the ambulance. The reports were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Conclusion Our data suggest that the optimal 20-minute STI for OOHCA patients in an urban EMS system is between 41 and 60 minutes. Interestingly, the 10-minute interval within the 41-60 minute cohort that provided the highest rate of ROSC was between 41 and 50 minutes. Generally, the longer the STI, the greater the percentage of favorable outcomes up to the 50-minute mark. Once past 50 minutes, a phenomenon of diminishing return was observed and the rates of favorable outcomes sharply declined. This suggests a possible ""sweet spot"" that may exist regarding the optimal scene time in a cardiac arrest encounter. Significant differences between the average number of interventions per patient were found, however, many confounding factors and the limited data set make the results difficult to generalize.",Evaluating a Change in Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546980,Cureus,2018 12 17,The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate if a change in practice from January 2013 to August 2015 affected the rate of surgical-site infections following kidney transplantation at the single academic medical center.

A Novel Technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546978,Cureus,2018 12 17,"Purpose The aim of the current study was to report the surgical outcome and complications of jejunostomy with enteroenterostomy for enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill trauma patients with prolonged nasogastric (NG) nutrition. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a level I trauma center in Shiraz, southern Iran during a one-year period from 2016 to 2017. We included a total number of 30 patients with severe trauma admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with more than three months NG nutrition and bowel atrophy. We performed a novel jejunostomy with an enteroenterostomy procedure for providing a route for enteral nutrition in all 30 patients. The rate of complications, such as dislodgement, clogging, obstruction, leakage, mucosal bleeding, and infection, were recorded and reported. We also recorded the hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS). Results We included a total number of 30 patients with a mean age of 35.64 ± 8.91 years, and there were 23 (76.6%) men and seven (23.4%) women among the patients. Overall, 14 (46.6%) patients experienced complications related to the jejunostomy with enteroenterostomy. The most common complication was nausea and vomiting (33.3%) and distention (33.3%), followed by surgical site infection (30.0%). The mean ICU LOS and hospital LOS was found to be 16.8 ± 3.7 and 24.3 ± 4.1 days, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 17 (56.6%), which was secondary to the primary injury and was not related to the procedure. Conclusion Jejunostomy with enteroenterostomy is a safe and feasible method for providing a route for EN in critically ill trauma patients with prolonged NG nutrition and bowel atrophy.",The Life and Work of Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov (1810-1881): An Outstanding Anatomist and Surgeon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546975,Cureus,2018 12 17,"Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov is considered one of the most important anatomists and surgeons in the history of medicine.

Our SICU suffered from poor communication and trust between nurses and physicians, negatively impacting the working environment and, potentially, patient care. Methods A SICU Task Force studied communication practices and identified areas for improvement, leading to several interventions. The daily physician rounding was altered to improve communication and to enhance the role of the registered nurses (RN) in rounds. Additionally, a formal night resident rounding time was implemented. Results A post-intervention survey focusing on cooperation, teamwork, and appreciation between nurses and physicians revealed improvement in these domains. Informal feedback from nurses and physicians indicated improved working relationships and satisfaction with the SICU environment. However, results of a national survey performed after the intervention did not show the same level of improvement. Conclusions A Task Force consisting of SICU nurses and physicians can effectively study a widespread communication issue and implement targeted interventions. While informal feedback may indicate improvement, it can be difficult to demonstrate improvement using formal surveys.",Relationship Between Thyroid Hormone Levels and Mean Platelet Count and Volume: Quantitative Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546973,Cureus,2018 12 17,"Background The hormones of the hypophysis-thyroid axis (HTA), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T4) and 3, 3', 5-L-triiodothyronine (T3), modulate the metabolism, differentiation, and proliferation of almost every cell in the body. Several studies have examined the effect of HTA hormones on platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV), but have reported inconsistent results. Our aim was to examine the association between HTA hormones and platelet count and MPV in a large cohort of the adult population of the United States. Methods  We used the continuous National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) which made available data on HTA hormones (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012) to examine the association between HTA hormones and platelet count and MPV. Analyses were performed with adjustments for the complex survey sampling methods of NHANES data. Unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear regressions were performed to examine the relationship between HTA hormones and platelet count and MPV. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race, alcohol use, smoking status, serum c-reactive protein, red blood cell folate, diabetes mellitus, glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, and hypertension. Results Of the 10,619 individuals eligible for inclusion in the analyses, 5,267 (49.6%) were females and 2,132 (20.08%) were African Americans. The mean ± standard deviation of platelet count was 256.4 ± 67.1 109/L, MPV 8.04 ± 0.92 fL, serum T4 7.92 ± 1.68 mg/dL, and serum T3 114.08 ± 24.6 ng/dL. In unadjusted analyses, an increase in the serum levels of T4 or T3 was associated with a significant increase in the platelet count and MPV (all p-values < 0.05). In contrast, an increase in serum TSH level was associated with a significant decrease in the platelet count (p-value = 0.05) but had no effect on MPV. After adjustment for potential confounders, serum T4 levels were significantly associated with platelet count but not with MPV. Individuals in the lowest quartile of T4 had 18.73 x 109/L lower platelet count than individuals in the upper-most quartile (p-value = 0.03). Serum TSH and serum T3 levels had no effect on platelet count or MPV after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Conclusions We report that only serum T4 levels, and not TSH or T3 levels, are independently associated with platelet count and there is no independent association between HTA hormones and MPV. Our findings suggest a possible role of serum T4 on thrombopoiesis or on platelet lifespan.",An AI-Based Heart Failure Treatment Adviser System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546972,IEEE journal of translational engineering in health and medicine,2018 12 17,"Management of heart failure is a major health care challenge. Healthcare providers are expected to use best practices described in clinical practice guidelines, which typically consist of a long series of complex rules. For heart failure management, the relevant guidelines are nearly 80 pages long. Due to their complexity, the guidelines are often difficult to fully comply with, which can result in suboptimal medical practices. In this paper, we describe a heart failure treatment adviser system that automates the entire set of rules in the guidelines for heart failure management. The system is based on answer set programming, a form of declarative programming suited for simulating human-style reasoning. Given a patient's information, the system is able to generate a set of guideline-compliant recommendations. We conducted a pilot study of the system on 21 real and 10 simulated patients with heart failure. The results show that the system can give treatment recommendations compliant with the guidelines. Out of 187 total recommendations made by the system, 176 were agreed upon by the expert cardiologists. Also, the system missed eight valid recommendations. The reason for the missed and discordant recommendations seems to be insufficient information, differing style, experience, and knowledge of experts in decision-making that were not captured in the system at this time. The system can serve as a point-of-care tool for clinics. Also, it can be used as an educational tool for training physicians and an assessment tool to measure the quality metrics of heart failure care of an institution.",Intuitive Clinician Control Interface for a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis: A Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546971,IEEE journal of translational engineering in health and medicine,2019 05 08,"This paper presents a potential solution to the challenge of configuring powered knee-ankle prostheses in a clinical setting. Typically, powered prostheses use impedance-based control schemes that contain several independent controllers which correspond to consecutive periods along the gait cycle. This control strategy has numerous control parameters and switching rules that are generally tuned by researchers or technicians and not by a certified prosthetist. We propose an intuitive clinician control interface (CCI) in which clinicians tune a powered knee-ankle prosthesis based on a virtual constraint control scheme, which tracks desired periodic joint trajectories based on a continuous measurement of the phase (or progression) of gait. The interface derives virtual constraints from clinician-designed joint kinematic trajectories. An experiment was conducted in which a certified prosthetist used the control interface to configure a powered knee-ankle prosthesis for a transfemoral amputee subject during level-ground walking trials. While it usually takes engineers hours of tuning individual parameters by trial and error, the CCI allowed the clinician to tune the powered prosthesis controller in under 10 min. This allowed the clinician to improve several amputee gait outcome metrics, such as gait symmetry. These results suggest that the CCI can improve the clinical viability of emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses."

Identifying the molecular mechanisms for inflammation-related HCC progression will contribute to improve the efficacy of current therapeutics for HCC patients. Many kinds of epigenetic factors, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been discovered to be important in HCC growth and metastasis. However, how the lncRNAs promote HCC progression and what's the application of lncRNA silencing in vivo in suppressing HCC remain to be further investigated. Here, we found that lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript1 (MALAT1) was upregulated in HCC tumor tissues, and knockdown of MALAT1 suppressed proliferation, cell cycle and invasion of HCC cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Knockdown of MALAT1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 and CXCL8 expression in HCC cells, which could be restored by overexpressing MALAT1. Mechanistically, MALAT1 recruited Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a catalytic subunit of chromatin remodeling complex switching/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF), to the promoter region of IL-6 and CXCL8, and thus facilitated NF-κB to induce the expression of these inflammatory factors. Importantly, in vivo silencing of MALAT1 in HCC tissues inhibited growth of HCC xenografts, and also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in HCC tissues accordingly. Our results demonstrate that MALAT1 promotes HCC progression by binding BRG1 to epigenetically enhance inflammatory response in HCC tissues, and silencing of MALAT1 may be a potential approach to the treatment of HCC.",Immunoprofiles of colorectal cancer from Lynch syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546958,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Colorectal cancers associated with Lynch syndrome are characterized by defective mismatch repair, microsatellite instability, high mutation rates, and a highly immunogenic environment. These features define a subset of cancer with a favorable prognosis and high likelihood to respond to treatment with anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) drugs. With the aim to define immune-evasive mechanisms and a potential impact hereof in colorectal cancers from Lynch syndrome versus hereditary cases with retained mismatch repair function, we immunohistochemically and transcriptionally profiled 270 tumors. Lynch syndrome-associated tumors showed an overrepresentation of tumor-infiltrating CD3, CD8 and CD68 positive cells, loss of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and up-regulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells. The gene expression signature of Lynch syndrome tumors was characterized by upregulation of genes related to antigen processing and presentation, apoptosis, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell activation. Tumors with loss of B2M and up-regulation of PD-L1 showed distinctive immunogenic profiles. In summary, our data demonstrate a complex tumor-host interplay where B2M loss and PD-L1 up-regulation influence immunological pathways and clinical outcome in Lynch syndrome tumors. Immunological classification may thus aid in the preselection of colorectal cancers relevant for treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies.",Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils predict therapeutic benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546957,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) show diverse predictive effects in the context of different cancer types and therapeutic regimens. In this study we investigated their relevance with therapeutic effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Two independent datasets including 271 mRCC patients treated by TKIs or IL-2/IFN-α based immunotherapy were retrospective included, and TINs were detected by immunohistochemistry. The presence of TINs was observed in 50 (45.0%) samples of the TKI cohort and in 73 (45.6%) samples of the immunotherapy cohort. TINs were associated with shorter overall survival (HR, 1.776; 95%CI, 1.191-2.650; p = 0.004) in the TKI cohort, but not in the immunotherapy cohort (HR, 1.074; 95%CI, 0.767-1.505; p = 0.672). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of TINs for TKI-treated patients (HR, 2.078, 95%CI, 1.352-3.195; p = 0.001), apart from other parameters. Moreover, survival benefit of TKI therapy was superior to IL-2/IFN-α immunotherapy only among TINs-absent patients (HR, 1.561; 95%CI, 0.927-2.629; p = 0.094). Data mining in the TCGA cohort of renal cell carcinoma revealed the predominant immunosuppressive function of TINs in renal cell carcinoma. The negative correlation between TINs and intratumoral CD8+ T cells was further confirmed in the TKI cohort (p = 0.019), the immunotherapy cohort (p = 0.001) and the TCGA cohort (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the presence of TINs was an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor in TKI-treated mRCC patients. TINs could also predict therapeutic benefit of TKIs over IL-2/IFN-α immunotherapy. These findings should be further confirmed within datasets of clinical trials or prospective observational studies.",IL-33 delays metastatic peritoneal cancer progression inducing an allergic microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546956,Oncoimmunology,2019 06 10,"Ovarian cancer is frequently diagnosed as peritoneal carcinomatosis. Unlike other tumor locations, the peritoneal cavity is commonly exposed to gut-breaching and ascending genital microorganisms and has a unique immune environment. IL-33 is a local cytokine that can activate innate and adaptive immunity. We studied the effectiveness of local IL-33 delivery in the treatment of cancer that has metastasized to the peritoneal cavity. Direct peritoneal administration of IL-33 delayed the progression of metastatic peritoneal cancer. Prolongation in survival was not associated with a direct effect of IL-33 on tumor cells, but with major changes in the immune microenvironment of the tumor. IL-33 promoted a significant increase in the leukocyte compartment of the tumor immunoenvironment and an allergic cytokine profile. We observed a substantial increase in the number of activated CD4+ T-cells accompanied by peritoneal eosinophil infiltration, B-cell activation and activation of peritoneal macrophages which displayed tumoricidal capacity. Depletion of CD4+ cells, eosinophils or macrophages reduced the anti-tumor effects of IL-33 but none of these alone were sufficient to completely abrogate its positive benefit. In conclusion, local administration of IL-33 generates an allergic tumor environment resulting in a novel approach for treatment of metastatic peritoneal malignancies, such as advanced ovarian cancer.",Inhibition of MEK with trametinib enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 inhibitor by regulating anti-tumor immunity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546955,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I downregulation is the primary immune evasion mechanism associated with failure in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies for cancer. Here, we examined the role of MEK signaling pathway inhibition in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) both in vitro and in vivo. We found that trametinib, a small molecule inhibitor of MEK, significantly enhanced MHC class I and PD-L1 expression in human HNSCC cell lines, and this occurred via STAT3 activation. Trametinib also further upregulated the increase in CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression caused by IFN-γ in HNSCC cells, which is associated with T cell infiltration in tumor tissues. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of trametinib combined with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in vivo, using SCCVII mouse syngeneic tumor model for HNSCC. While neither PD-L1 blockade nor trametinib treatment alone affected tumor growth, the combined therapy significantly delayed tumor growth. Our results indicate that in the combined therapy trametinib increases CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor site and upregulates antigen presentation, and this may be associated with enhanced PD-L1 blockade efficacy. Furthermore, our results suggest that this combination would therapeutically benefit patients with HNSCC.",The role of CMV in glioblastoma and implications for immunotherapeutic strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546954,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Controversy surrounds the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in glioblastoma (GBM). However, several studies have shown that CMV nucleic acids and proteins are present within GBM tumor tissue. CMV has been implicated in GBM pathogenesis by affecting tumor stem cell factors, angiogenesis and immune pathways. Anti-viral therapy has not been found to definitively improve outcomes for patients with GBM. Several studies have leveraged CMV by targeting CMV antigens using ex-vivo expanded T cells or dendritic cell vaccines. The initial results from these studies are promising and larger studies are underway.",A B cell-derived gene expression signature associates with an immunologically active tumor microenvironment and response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546953,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown great potential in treating solid tumors, inducing durable remission and prolonged survival time in responders. Despite their promise, a large fraction of patients remains unresponsive to these treatments highlighting the need for biomarkers that can predict patient sensitivity. Pre-treatment gene expression profiles for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become available, establishing a new medium by which to discover biomarkers that predict therapy response. In this study, we mined for transcriptomic correlates of response by applying immune cell-derived gene expression signatures to publicly available datasets containing matched gene expression and response efficacy information. These datasets were comprised of urothelial carcinoma patients receiving anti-PD-L1 (n = 25), melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 (n = 28), and melanoma patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 (n = 42). We identified one signature, derived from a subpopulation of B cells, with scores that were significantly and reproducibly elevated in patients experiencing clinical benefit following therapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and were additionally elevated in patients responsive to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Multivariate models revealed that this signature was associated with response independent of other response-predictive biomarkers, including tumor mutation burden. Functional annotation of the signature revealed it to be associated with features indicative of an immunologically active microenvironment, including B and T cell activation as well as antigen presentation activity. The preliminary findings presented detail a transcriptomic signature associated with response to multiple checkpoint inhibitors and suggest novel biological associations that warrant further investigation.","Identification of PD-L2, B7-H3 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint proteins in genetic subtypes of meningioma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546952,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Meningioma is the most common brain tumor in adults. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment. No chemotherapy exists. However, gene mutations now could explain ~ 80% of meningioma and targeted therapies based on these are being investigated. Furthermore, with the recent discovery of PD-L1 in malignant meningioma, clinical trials using immunotherapy have commenced. Here, we report for the first time the expression profiles of immune checkpoint proteins PD-L2, B7-H3 and CTLA-4 in meningioma and their association to common gene mutations. PD-L2 and B7-H3 expression was significantly greater than all immune checkpoint proteins studied, and particularly elevated in patients with gene mutations affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. CTLA-4 expressing CD3+ lymphocytes were observed in atypical and malignant meningioma and tumors harboring a PIK3CA or SMO mutation. These results identify novel targets for immunotherapy irrespective of grade and distinguish potential patient populations based on genetic classification for stratification into checkpoint inhibitor clinical trials.",HER2 signaling regulates the tumor immune microenvironment and trastuzumab efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546951,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Through whole-transcriptome profiling of HER2+ breast carcinomas (BCs), we previously showed that those sensitive to trastuzumab are addicted to this oncoprotein and are enriched in immune pathways, raising the hypothesis that HER2 itself regulates immune cell recruitment. In the present study we investigated the relationship between HER2 activity and the pro-trastuzumab tumor immune milieu. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analysis of 53 HER2+ BCs showed that trastuzumab-sensitive tumors expressed significantly higher levels of chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment, with higher infiltration of T cells and monocytes, and higher levels of PD-1 ligands than tumors that do not benefit from trastuzumab. In vitro analysis in HER2+ BC cells revealed that CCL2 production was induced by HER2 stimulation with EGF/HRG via the PI3K-NF-kB axis, and down-modulated by HER2 inhibition with trastuzumab. CCL2 expression was higher in HER2+/ER- than HER2+/ER+ BC cell lines, and degradation of ER by fulvestrant induced an enhancement in NF-κB transcriptional activity and consequent CCL2 expression. Trastuzumab efficacy relied on CCL2 levels and monocytes present in the tumor microenvironment in FVB mice bearing HER2+ mammary carcinoma cells. HER2 signals were also found to sustain the expression of PD-1 ligands in tumor cells via the MEK pathway. Overall, our results support the concept that the activated HER2 oncogene regulates recruitment and activation of tumor infiltrating immune cells and trastuzumab activity by inducing CCL2 and PD-1 ligands and that ER activity negatively controls the HER2-driven pro-trastuzumab tumor microenvironment.","B cells in esophago-gastric adenocarcinoma are highly differentiated, organize in tertiary lymphoid structures and produce tumor-specific antibodies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546950,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are correlated to prognosis of several kinds of cancer. Most studies focused on T cells, while the role of tumor-associated B cells (TABs) has only recently gained more attention. TABs contain subpopulations with distinct functions, potentially promoting or inhibiting immune responses. This study provides a detailed analysis of TABs in gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Flow cytometric analyses of single cell suspensions of tumor samples, mucosa, lymph nodes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of EAC patients and healthy controls revealed a distinct B cell compartment in cancer patients. B cells were increased in tumor samples and subset-analyses of TILs showed increased proportions of differentiated and activated B cells and an enrichment for follicular T helper cells. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that TABs were mainly organized in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which resemble lymphoid follicles in secondary lymphoid organs. A panel of 34 tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) expressed in EAC was identified based on public databases and TCGA data to analyze tumor-specific B cell responses using a LUMINEXTM bead assay and flow cytometry. Structural analyses of TLS and the detection of tumor-specific antibodies against one or more TAAs in 48.1% of analyzed serum samples underline presence of anti-tumor B cell responses in EAC. Interestingly, B cells were decreased in tumors with expression of Programmed Death Ligand 1 or impaired HLA-I expression. These data demonstrate that anti-tumor B cell responses are an additional and underestimated aspect of EAC. Our results are of immediate translational relevance to emerging immunotherapies."

Because of these intimate interactions, we investigated the capacity of EC to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) and modulate CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation in bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We found that EC from MM patients show a phenotype of semi-professional APC given that they express low levels of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, and of the inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOSL). In addition, they do not undergo the strong switch from immunoproteasome to standard proteasome subunit expression which is typical of mature professional APC such as dendritic cells. EC can trap and present antigen to CD8+ T cells, stimulating a central memory CD8+ T cell population that expresses Foxp3 and produces high amounts of IL-10 and TGF-β. Another CD8+ T cell population is stimulated by professional APC, produces IFN-γ, and exerts antitumor activity. Thus, two distinct CD8+ T cell populations coexist in the bone marrow of MM patients: the first population is sustained by EC, expresses Foxp3, produces IL-10 and TGF-β, and exerts pro-tumor activity by negatively regulating the second population. This study adds new insight into the role that EC play in MM biology and describes an additional immune regulatory mechanism that inhibits the development of antitumor immunity and may impair the success of cancer immunotherapy.",Identification and editing of stem-like cells in methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546937,Oncoimmunology,2018 12 17,"The cancer stem cell (CSC) paradigm posits that specific cells within a tumor, so-called CSC-like cells, have differing levels of tumorigenicity and chemoresistance. Original studies of CSCs identified them in human cancers and utilized mouse xenograft models to define the cancer initiating properties of these cells, thereby hampering the understanding of how immunity could affect CSCs. Indeed, few studies have characterized CSCs in the context of cancer immunoediting, and it is currently not clear how immunity could impact on the levels or stem-like behavior of CSCs. Using the well-studied 3'methylcholanthrene (MCA) model of primary sarcoma formation, we have defined a CSC-like population within MCA-induced sarcomas as expressing high levels of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) and low levels of CD90. These Sca-1+CD90- CSC-like cells had higher tumor initiating ability, could spontaneously give rise to Sca-1-negative cells, and formed more sarcospheres than corresponding non-CSC-like cells. Moreover, when examining MCA-induced sarcomas that were in the equilibrium phase of cancer growth, higher levels of CSC-like cells were found compared to MCA-induced sarcomas in the escape phase of cancer progression. Notably, CSC-like cells also emerged during escape from anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4 therapy, thus suggesting that CSC-like cells could evade immune therapy. Finally, we demonstrate that paradoxically, interferon (IFN)-γ produced in vivo by immune cells could promote the emergence of CSC-like cells. Our findings define the existence of a Sca1+CD90- CSC-like population in the MCA-sarcoma model capable of differentiation, tumorsphere formation, and increased tumor initiation in vivo. These cells may also act as mediators of immune resistance during cancer immunoediting and immune therapy.",Low Dose versus Standard Single Heartbeat Acquisition Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546936,Journal of clinical imaging science,2018 12 17,The aim of this study was to compare image quality and mean radiation dose between two groups of patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) using a 640-slice CT scanner with two protocols with different noise level thresholds expressed as standard deviation (SD).,Comparative Performances of Dipyridamole and Regadenoson to Detect Myocardial Ischemia using Cardiac Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Single-Photon Emission Computerized Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546935,Journal of clinical imaging science,2018 12 17,We evaluated the relative performances of dipyridamole (Dip) and regadenoson (Reg) in a cohort of patients referred for coronary artery disease diagnosis or follow-up using myocardial perfusion imaging.,"Review of the Major and Minor Salivary Glands, Part 2: Neoplasms and Tumor-like Lesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546932,Journal of clinical imaging science,2018 12 17,"The salivary glands are small structures in the head and neck, but can give rise to a wide variety of benign and malignant pathology.

It is, therefore, critical that radiologists pay careful attention to the salivary glands and have working knowledge of the key differentiating features of the most common neoplastic and nonneoplastic etiologies of salivary gland masses. The purpose of this review is to provide a succinct image-rich article illustrating the various causes of salivary gland masses via an extensive review of the primary literature.

Indicators of frailty are associated with poor outcomes. Commonly used frailty tools rely on motor skills that cannot be performed by this population. We determined the association between the Charlson Comorbidity Score (CCS), intraoperative hypotension (IOH), and a geriatric medicine consult index (GCI) with short-term mortality in hip fracture patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single institution over a 2-year period. Patients aged 65 years and older who sustained a hip fracture following a low-energy mechanism were identified using billing records and our orthopedic fracture registry. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic data, fracture classification and operative records, calculation of CCS, intraoperative details including hypotension, and assessments recorded in the geriatric consult notes. The GCI was calculated using 30 dichotomous variables contained within the geriatric consult note. The index, ranging from 0 to 1, included markers for physical and cognitive function, as well as medications. A higher GCI score indicated more markers for frailty. One hundred eight patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-four (59%) were females and the average age was 77.3 years. Thirty-five (32%) patients sustained femoral neck fractures, and 73 (68%) patients sustained inter-/pertrochanteric hip fractures. The 30-day mortality was 6%; the 90-day mortality was 13%. The mean GCI was 0.30 in the 30-day survivor group as compared to 0.52 in those who died. The mean GCI was 0.28 in patients who were alive at 90 days as compared to 0.46 in those who died. In contrast, the CCS and IOH were not associated with 30- or 90-day mortality. In our older hip fracture patients, an index calculated from information routinely obtained in the geriatric consult evaluation was associated with 30- and 90-day mortality, whereas the CCS and measures of IOH were not.",3D biofabrication for tubular tissue engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546921,Bio-design and manufacturing,2019 03 27,"The therapeutic replacement of diseased tubular tissue is hindered by the availability and suitability of current donor, autologous and synthetically derived protheses.

Here, we demonstrate an efficacy of SMTP-7 in a severe embolic stroke model in monkeys. The middle cerebral artery was embolized by an autologous blood clot. Saline, SMTP-7, or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 5 in each group) was given after 3 hours, and neurologic deficit scoring and infarct characterization were performed after 24 hours. Hemorrhagic infarct-accompanied premature death was observed for two animals in t-PA group. SMTP-7 treatment significantly reduced the sizes of infarct by 65%, edema by 37%, and clot by 55% compared to saline treatment. Plasma levels of the products of plasminogen activation (plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex) and sEH reaction (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid) in SMTP-7 group were 794% (P < 0.05) and 60% (P = 0.085) compared to saline group, respectively. No significant changes in the plasma levels of MMP-9, CRP, MCP-1, and S100B were found. There was an inverse correlation between plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex level and infarct volume (r = 0.93, P < 0.05), suggesting a role of thrombolysis in the SMTP-7 action to limit infarct development. In conclusion, SMTP-7 is effective in treating severe embolic stroke in monkeys under conditions where t-PA treatment tends to cause hemorrhagic infarct-associated premature death.",Association between childhood invalidation and borderline personality symptoms: self-construal and conformity as moderating factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546908,Borderline personality disorder and emotion dysregulation,2018 12 17,"Linehan (1993)'s biosocial model posits that borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms develop as a result of a transactional relationship between pre-existing emotional vulnerability and an invalidating childhood environment.

Even species considered to be at low extinction risk often show signs of local declines. Here, we evaluate the impact of eucalypt plantations, the best-known exotic tree species worldwide and its interaction with temperature and predators on amphibian development, growth, antipredator responses and physiology. For this purpose, we applied a fully factorial experiment crossing two types of leaf litter (native oak or eucalypt), two temperatures (15 and 20°C) and presence/absence of native predators. We found that leachates of eucalypt leaf litter reduced amphibian development and growth, compromised their antipredator responses and altered their metabolic rate. Increased temperature itself also posed serious alterations on development, growth, antioxidant ability and the immune status of tadpoles. However, the combined effects of eucalypt leaf litter and increased temperature were additive, not synergistic. Therefore, we show that non-lethal levels of a globally spread disruptor such as leachates from eucalypt leaf litter can seriously impact the life history and physiology of native amphibian populations. This study highlights the need to evaluate the status of wild populations exposed to human activities even if not at an obvious immediate risk of extinction, based on reliable stress markers, in order to anticipate demographic declines that may be hard to reverse once started. Replacing eucalypt plantations with native trees in protected areas would help improving the health of local amphibian larvae. In zones of economic interest, we would recommend providing patches of native vegetation around ponds and removing eucalypt leaf litter from pond basins during their dry phase.",Analysis of serum macrophage migration inhibitory factor and D-dopachrome tautomerase in systemic sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546906,Clinical & translational immunology,2018 12 17,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT), members of the same cytokine superfamily, are linked to the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases.

A prediction model for recurrence in patients with stage II colon cancer after curative surgical resection was developed. The present study retrospectively investigated 436 patients who underwent curative resection for stage II colon cancer at Osaka International Cancer Institute and Yao Municipal Hospital between 2004 and 2012. Several clinicopathological factors were examined and the Cox regression model was used to develop a prediction model for recurrence. The prediction model was validated in an independent group of 213 patients who underwent surgery at Osaka University Hospital between 2001 and 2012. Univariate analysis revealed that preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, preoperative obstruction, tumor invasion, lymphatic invasion and venous invasion were significantly correlated with disease-free survival. Using these variables, a classification and regression tree was constructed as a prediction model. The prediction models were validated by external datasets in an independent patient group. The concordance indices for DFS after current surgical resection were 0.675 in the learning set and 0.552 in the validation set. To conclude, a novel, reliable and personalized prognostic model was developed to predict recurrence in patients with stage II colon cancer, which may help clinicians to determine and perform adjuvant chemotherapy.",KRAS mutation and DNA repair and synthesis genes in non-small-cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546903,Molecular and clinical oncology,2018 12 17,"The aim of the present study was to assess the expression of select DNA repair and synthesis genes in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) according to KRAS mutation status. ERCC1, TS, RRM1, and BRCA1 mRNA expression levels were assessed from either primary or metastatic tumor specimens of patients diagnosed with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type (WT) advanced NSCLC. Total RNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens using the RNeasy FFPE kit and automatically purified using a QiaCube instrument. Quantification levels were analyzed by real-time one-step RT-PCR using QuantiFast technology, and the results were compared considering β-actin as the internal reference gene. One hundred and eighty-four patients with advanced NSCLC were evaluated for the analysis, of which 92 were KRAS-mutants. Nearly all patients had adenocarcinoma histology (96.7%). Among KRAS-mutants, the majority had a KRAS codon 12 mutation (88%), the most common being G12C (44.4% of cases). Mean ERCC1 levels were indicated to be significantly higher in KRAS-mutants when compared with KRAS WT patients (3,234±6.63 vs. 184±1.24; P=0.05). However, mean TS levels were significantly lower in the KRAS-mutant subgroup compared with the KRAS WT subgroup (4,481±3.756 vs. 5,941±6.4; P=0.039). KRAS-mutant NSCLCs are more likely to express high ERCC1 and low TS levels.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of Treg, iNKT and Breg cell subsets and their interrelationships in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of patients with B-cell NHL who received rituximab-based regimens and achieved a complete remission. A total of 20 patients and 20 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for investigation of Treg, iNKT and Breg cell subsets in PB and BM by flow cytometry and cell culture. Prior to administration of combination chemotherapy with rituximab, the patients had lower levels of Breg cells and, to a lesser degree, Treg cells, but not iNKT cells, in PB compared with controls. Compartmental differences in the levels of Treg and Breg cell subsets, but not iNKT cells, were observed between PB and BM, suggesting an increase in trafficking through the blood of these regulatory cell subsets to the marrow. Following complete remission, the levels of circulating Treg, iNKT and Breg cell subsets increased. The levels of Treg cells were not significantly associated with iNKT and Breg cell subsets, although negative correlations were observed. Taken together, these results may provide new insights into the potential role of regulatory cell subsets in patients with B-cell NHL.

Since the second surgical procedure, the patient has remained free from recurrence for >7 years. Although the prognosis of abdominal UPS was considered to be poor, even after curative surgery, the present case experienced a long-term survival of gastric UPS after undergoing surgical resection alone."

Bioinformatics methods, including functional enrichment and network analysis combined with survival analysis, are required to process a large volume of data to obtain further information on differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The RNA sequencing data related to HCC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed to screen DEGs, which were separately submitted to perform gene enrichment analysis to identify gene sets and signaling pathways, and to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Subsequently, hub genes were selected by the core level in the network, and the top hub genes were focused on gene expression analysis and survival analysis. A total of 610 DEGs were identified, including 444 upregulated and 166 downregulated genes. The upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the Gene Ontology analysis (GO): Cell division and in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway: Cell cycle, whereas the downregulated DEGs were enriched in GO: Negative regulation of growth and in the KEGG pathway: Retinol metabolism, with significant differences. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 was selected as the top hub gene by the PPI network, which exhibited a similar expression trend with the data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Survival analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between CDK1 expression level and overall survival in the TCGA group (P<0.01) and the GEO group (P<0.01). Therefore, high-throughput TCGA data analysis appears to be an effective method for screening tumor molecular markers, and high expression of CDK1 is a prognostic factor for HCC.",Radiotherapy-associated intra-abdominal angiosarcoma after prostatic adenocarcinoma: Case reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546886,Molecular and clinical oncology,2018 12 17,"Angiosarcoma is a rare soft tissue neoplasm, which accounts for <1% of all soft tissue tumours. It has been previously reported that the incidence rate of angiosarcomas increases following radiotherapy. The present study reports two cases of intra-abdominal angiosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy treatment. To the best of our knowledge, these associations have not been previously described in English literature. The patients aged 71 and 83 years were admitted to the center for abdominal pain and diarrhea. Each patient had previously had treatment with radiotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma. During their hospitalization, biopsies were obtained and the diagnosis of angiosarcoma was reached. In each patient the tumors had irregular proliferating vascular channels, lined by atypical endothelial cells, which varied from elongated and spindle-shaped to large and plump. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for the cytoplasmic endothelial markers cluster of differentiation (CD)31 and CD34. The recognition of these associations is important and their occurrence in this rare type of neoplasm should not mislead the pathologist and cause a misdiagnosis of the sarcoma.",Pathological complete response to mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab therapy for unresectable colon cancer with multiple paraaortic lymph node metastases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546885,Molecular and clinical oncology,2018 12 17,"Pathological complete response is achievable with mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab therapy for unresectable colorectal cancer with multiple paraaortic lymph node metastases (mCRC) despite right-sided colonic origin.

The tumor size was markedly decreased following 6 courses of chemotherapy, and all lymph node metastases had disappeared. The patient then underwent conventional right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection plus sampling excision of the paraaortic lymph nodes. The pathological diagnosis was a complete response. The patient is currently alive 5 years after surgery with no signs of recurrence. The present study reported the apparent effectiveness of conversion therapy (surgery) with combination treatment with mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab and radical surgery.

However, its use may lead to cardiovascular toxicities, the manifestations of which include arrhythmia, heart failure, acute myocardial ischemia and atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is among the severe reactions to the PTX cardiotoxicity, and a cause for substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence of PTX-induced AF is reportedly low (1.0-1.7% worldwide), and few cases have been reported in the literature. Thus, to emphasize the need for awareness of this side effect of PTX among clinicians, the report herein presents a case of AF induced by PTX in a patient with non-small-cell carcinoma. A 51-year-old man experienced AF following treatment with PTX. Amiodarone and metoprolol were administered to the patient to control cardiac rhythm and rate. After 3 days, the electrocardiogram was normalized and indicated normal heart rate and rhythm. According to this case, thorough attention should be paid during PTX treatment to monitor for signs of AF or other abnormalities in cardiac function.",Distinct HLA class I and II genotypes and haplotypes are associated with multiple sclerosis in Bahrain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546882,Biomedical reports,2018 12 17,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) has become prevalent in the Arabian Gulf area with high incidence in Bahrain due to environmental influences and genetic susceptibilities, but there is a lack of study into human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types in patients with MS in Bahrain. The present study aimed to study the HLA types expressed in MS patients compared with in control subjects. Blood samples from 50 Bahraini patients with MS and 50 Bahraini control subjects' were subjected to HLA tissue typing by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers. In comparison with those in control subjects, the allele frequencies of HLA class-I antigens A2, A9, A19, B5, B35 and B40 were higher in MS patients. For class II antigens, the allele frequencies of DR3, DR4 and DR16 were higher in MS patients. The allele frequency of DR15 was lower in MS patients than in control subjects but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.138). The higher prevalence of the HLA-ABDR allele was common among the female patients with MS, in relapse remission stage, in cases with higher expanded disability status scale scores and with disease duration between 4 and 9 years. Haplotype HLA-A2-B40-DR2 exhibited significantly higher frequency in MS patients compared with in control subjects (P=0.03). In conclusion, the results indicated different alleles associated with MS compared with previous reviews. The present study supports the importance of identifying genetic susceptibilities and targets for therapies in specific populations and individuals, to personalize disease management in terms of prediction, protective measures and treatment.","Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels in adults with diabetes mellitus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546881,Biomedical reports,2018 12 17,"In the present study, the aim was to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and measures of glycemic control including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in adult patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) from the north of Jordan. Another aim was to compare serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D between patients with good glycemic control and patients with uncontrolled DM. This was a cross-sectional study that included 261 participants with DM. The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, HbA1c was measured using turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay and FBG was measured using the hexokinase method. Data regarding other clinical variables were obtained from medical records or by self-reporting. Participants with good glycemic control exhibited significantly higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with participants with uncontrolled DM (P=0.03). Participants with sufficient vitamin D status (>30 ng/ml in serum) exhibited significantly lower HbA1c level compared with participants with deficient vitamin D (<20 ng/ml) status (P=0.02). Correlation analysis determined significant inverse correlations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and HbA1c and FBG levels (r=-0.23 and -0.17, respectively, both P<0.01). There were also significant correlations between duration of DM and HbA1c and FBG levels (both r=0.21, P<0.01). HbA1c level was also inversely correlated with participants' age (r=-0.19, P<0.01). Further multiple linear regression analysis revealed an inverse significant association between HbA1c and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (F=12.95, R2=0.48, P<0.01) but did not identify a similar association between FBG and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. These findings may encourage further research to identify if vitamin D supplementation may improve measures of glycemic control, and how vitamin D may affect glucose homeostasis in patients with DM.",Predictive value of combining the level of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 and antithrombin III for acute coronary syndrome risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546880,Biomedical reports,2018 12 17,"The aim of the present study was to observe the role of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and antithrombin III (AT-III) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and the combination of Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score to determine the value of coronary heart disease risk stratification. A total of 309 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: The ACS (183 cases) and control (126 cases) groups. Blood levels of Lp-PLA2 and AT-III were measured. Based on GRACE score, the patients with ACS were divided into three subgroups: Low risk (GRACE score ≤108), middle risk (GRACE score 109-140) and high risk (GRACE score >140). The levels of Lp-PLA2 and AT-III were compared among different groups, and based on Gensini score, patients with ACS were divided into four groups by quartiles. Lp-PLA2 levels in the ACS group were significantly increased compared with the control group (P<0.05), but the AT-III levels were decreased compared with the control group (P<0.05). In the ACS group, Lp-PLA2 levels increased sequentially from the low risk to high risk subgroups (all P<0.05); compared with the low risk and middle risk subgroups, the AT-III activity levels were decreased in the high risk subgroup, and the Gensini scores were increased (all P<0.05). In the ACS group, with the increase of Gensini scores, the levels of Lp-PLA2 and AT-III exhibited increasing and decreasing trends, respectively (P<0.05). The logistic regression model demonstrated that Lp-PLA2 [odds ratio (OR) =1.077; P<0.001]; and GRACE score (OR=1.026; P=0.028) were risk factors, while AT-III was a protective factor (OR=0.958; P=0.012) for ACS. Correlation analysis indicated a positive association of Lp-PLA2 level with Gensini scores (r=0.52; P<0.01) and GRACE score (r=0.48; P<0.01), and a negative association between AT-III level and Gensini scores (r=-0.25; P<0.01) and GRACE scores (r=-0.34; P<0.01).

The underlying mechanisms responsible for these inhibitory effects of progesterone are not fully known. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of progesterone on the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway and muscle contraction in the stomach. Single gastric smooth muscle cells from female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The expression of progesterone receptor (PR) mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. NO and cGMP levels were measured via specific ELISAs. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction of single gastric muscle cells preincubated with progesterone was measured via scanning micrometry in the presence or absence of the NO synthase inhibitor, Nω-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), or guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), and expressed as percent shortening from resting cell length. PR expression was detected in the stomach muscle cells. Progesterone inhibited ACh-induced gastric muscle cell contraction. Furthermore, progesterone increased NO and cGMP levels in single gastric muscle cells. Most notably, pre-incubation of muscle cells with either L-NNA or ODQ abolished the inhibitory action of progesterone on muscle contraction. These present observations suggest that progesterone promotes muscle cell relaxation in the stomach potentially via the NO/cGMP pathway.","Energy handling in renal tubular epithelial cells of the hamster, a native hibernator, under warm anoxia or reoxygenation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546878,Biomedical reports,2018 12 17,"Ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury causes several diseases, including acute kidney injury. Hibernating mammals survive periods of torpor with a marked drop in tissue perfusion, interspersed with periods of arousal, and consequently I-R injury. In the present study, sensitivity to anoxia and/or reoxygenation and alterations in cellular ATP and homeostasis of the two most energy consuming processes, protein translation and Na+-K+-ATPase function, were evaluated in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells of mouse or native hibernator hamster origin. Compared with the mouse cells, the hamster cells were less sensitive to anoxia and reoxygenation and ATP was preserved under anoxia. Anoxia triggered mechanisms that suppress protein translation in both species. However, under anoxia, the activity of ATPase, which is mostly attributed to Na+-K+-ATPase function, remained stable in the hamster cells but decreased in the mouse cells. In normoxia, ATPase activity in hamster cells was considerably lower than that in mouse cells. As the Na+-K+-ATPase pump preserves the ion gradient against passive leakage through ion channels, the lower energy demand for the function of this pump in hamster cells may indicate less ion leakage due to fewer ion channels. In accordance with this hypothesis, ouabain-treated hamster cells had a higher survival rate than mouse cells, indicating fewer ion channels and consequently slower deregulation of intracellular ion concentration and cell death due to Na+-K+-ATPase inhibition. Therefore, it is likely that the conserved energy from the suppression of protein translation is adequate enough to support the lower energy demand for Na+-K+-ATPase function and cell survival of hamster cells under anoxia. Clarifying how cells of a native hibernator manage energy under warm I-R may reveal novel and possible clinically applicable pathways for preventing I-R injury.",Canagliflozin improves obesity and insulin resistance in a diabetic patient with Cushings disease undergoing postoperative steroid therapy: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546877,Biomedical reports,2018 12 17,"A 47-year-old woman with diabetes treated with high-dose insulin was admitted to Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Japan, for screening of secondary diabetes mellitus and obesity. Laboratory tests and imaging studies were consistent with Cushing's disease (CD). The patient underwent trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery. The patient exhibited loss of body weight (85.9 to 80.0 kg), improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (11.2 to 7.8%) and required lower doses of insulin (112 to 46 U/day) 6 months after surgery. The patient's body weight and daily insulin dose remained stable during the following 5 months (6-11 months after surgery). At that point, the patient was administered with canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor. The patient required lower daily insulin dose without decreasing the dose of postoperative hydrocortisone concurrent to the administration of canagliflozin (100 mg/day). The patient's body weight decreased to 69.5 kg and withdrawal of insulin therapy was possible 8 months after initiation of canagliflozin. Despite withdrawal of insulin therapy, the HbA1c levels remained at <7.0%. Although surgical treatment is the first-choice treatment for CD, obesity-related metabolic disorders including diabetes are frequent in CD patients following surgery. Canagliflozin may be an effective treatment to reduce body weight and improve insulin resistance following surgical treatment of CD."

An effective strategy to surmount polymyxin resistance is combination therapy with FDA-approved non-antibiotic drugs. Herein we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the mechanism(s) of synergy between polymyxin B and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen against a polymyxin-resistant MDR cystic fibrosis (CF) Pseudomonas aeruginosa FADDI-PA006 isolate (polymyxin B MIC=8 mg/L , it is an MDR polymyxin resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from the lungs of a CF patient). The metabolome of FADDI-PA006 was profiled at 15 min, 1 and 4 h following treatment with polymyxin B (2 mg/L), tamoxifen (8 mg/L) either as monotherapy or in combination. At 15 min, the combination treatment induced a marked decrease in lipids, primarily fatty acid and glycerophospholipid metabolites that are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial membranes. In line with the polymyxin-resistant status of this strain, at 1 h, both polymyxin B and tamoxifen monotherapies produced little effect on bacterial metabolism. In contrast to the combination which induced extensive reduction (≥ 1.0-log2-fold, p ≤ 0.05; FDR ≤ 0.05) in the levels of essential intermediates involved in cell envelope biosynthesis. Overall, these novel findings demonstrate that the primary mechanisms underlying the synergistic bactericidal effect of the combination against the polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa CF isolate FADDI-PA006 involves a disruption of the cell envelope biogenesis and an inhibition of aminoarabinose LPS modifications that confer polymyxin resistance.","Does Size Really Matter? Probing the Efficacy of Structural Reduction in the Optimization of Bioderived Compounds - A Computational ""Proof-of-Concept"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546858,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2018 12 25,"Over the years, numerous synthetic approaches have been utilized in drug design to improve the pharmacological properties of naturally derived compounds and most importantly, minimize toxic effects associated with their transition to drugs. The reduction of complex bioderived compounds to simpler bioactive fragments has been identified as a viable strategy to develop lead compounds with improved activities and minimal toxicities. Although this 'reductive' strategy has been widely exemplified, underlying biological events remain unresolved, hence the unanswered question remains how does the fragmentation of a natural compound improve its bioactivity and reduce toxicities? Herein, using a combinatorial approach, we initialize a computational ""proof-of- concept"" to expound the differential pharmacological and antagonistic activities of a natural compound, Anguinomycin D, and its synthetic fragment, SB640 towards Exportin Chromosome Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1). Interestingly, our findings revealed that in comparison with the parent compound, SB640 exhibited improved pharmacological attributes, while toxicities and off-target activities were relatively minimal. Moreover, we observed that the reduced size of SB640 allowed 'deep access' at the Nuclear Export Signals (NES) binding groove of CRM1, which favored optimal and proximal positioning towards crucial residues while the presence of the long polyketide tail in Anguinomycin D constrained its burial at the hydrophobic groove. Furthermore, with regards to their antagonistic functions, structural inactivation (rigidity) was more pronounced in CRM1 when bound by SB640 as compared to Anguinomycin D. These findings provide essential insights that portray synthetic fragmentation of natural compounds as a feasible approach towards the discovery of potential leads in disease treatment.",Development of Fangjiomics for Systems Elucidation of Synergistic Mechanism Underlying Combination Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546857,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2018 12 25,"The rapid development of omics technology provides an opportunity for fulfilling the understanding of the synergistic mechanism of combination therapy.

Fangjiomics is a novel systems science based on a holistic theory integrated with reductionism which has been utilized to systematically elucidate the synergistic mechanisms underlying combination therapy using multi-target-, pathway- or network-based quantitative methods. Besides, our ability to understand the polyhierarchical structure in synergy is driven based on multi-level omics data fusion in Fangjiomics.

Bioluminescent bacteria with a variety of bioluminescence emission characteristics have been identified in Vibrionaceae, Shewanellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Bioluminescent bacteria are mainly found in marine habitats and they are either free-floating, sessile or have specialized to live in symbiosis with other marine organisms. On the molecular level, bioluminescence is enabled by a cascade of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes encoded by the lux operon with the gene order luxCDABEG. The luxA and luxB genes encode the α- and β- subunits, respectively, of the enzyme luciferase producing the light emitting species. LuxC, luxD and luxE constitute the fatty acid reductase complex, responsible for the synthesis of the long-chain aldehyde substrate and luxG encodes a flavin reductase. In bacteria, the heterodimeric luciferase catalyzes the monooxygenation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to the corresponding acids utilizing reduced FMN and molecular oxygen. The energy released as a photon results from an excited state flavin-4a-hydroxide, emitting light centered around 490 nm. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of bacterial bioluminescence have been spurred by the structural characterization of protein encoded by the lux operon. However, the number of available crystal structures is limited to LuxAB (Vibrio harveyi), LuxD (Vibrio harveyi) and LuxF (Photobacterium leiognathi).

We previously reported that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human liver stem cells (HLSCs) were able to limit tumor development. In this study, we evaluated whether EV derived from HLSCs could act in synergy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on apoptosis of CSCs isolated from renal carcinomas. For this purpose, we administered to renal CSCs, HLSC-EVs and TKIs, as co-incubation or sequential administration. We found that HLSC-EVs in combination with Sunitinb or Sorafenib significantly increased renal CSCs apoptosis induced by low TKI dose. At variance, no synergistic effect was observed when bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs were used. In particular, renal CSCs chemosensitivity to TKIs was enhanced when HLSC-EVs were either co-administered with TKIs or added after, but not before. CSC apoptosis was also incremented at a percentage comparable to that of co-administration when TKIs were loaded in HLSC-EVs. By a mechanistic point of view, Akt/mTOR and Erk and Creb intracellular pathways, known to be pivotal in the induction of tumor growth and survival, appeared modulated as consequence of TKIs/HLSC-EVs co-administration. Together, our results indicate that the synergistic effect of HLSC-EVs with TKIs may increase the response to TKIs at low doses, providing a rational for their combined use in the treatment of renal carcinoma.",Identification of rare levels of methylated tumor DNA fragments using an optimized bias based pre-amplification-digital droplet PCR (OBBPA-ddPCR).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546833,Oncotarget,2018 12 17,"The analysis of aberrant DNA methylations is used for the diagnosis of cancer as significant changes in the gene methylation pattern are often detected during early carcinogenesis.

We performed comprehensive next generation sequencing based genomic characterization of 11 cases of BIA-ALCL including sequence variant detection on 180 genes frequently mutated in haematological malignancy, genome-wide copy number assessment, structural variant detection involving the T-cell receptor loci and TRB deep-sequencing. We observed sequence variants leading to JAK/STAT activation in 10 out of 11 patients. We also observed germline TP53 mutations in two cases. In addition we detected a recurrent copy number loss involving RPL5 as well as copy number amplifications involving TNFRSF11A [RANK] (in 2 cases), MYC, P2RX7, TMEM119 and PDGFRA. In summary, our comprehensive genomic characterisation of 11 cases of BIA-ALCL has provided insight into potential pathobiological mechanisms (JAK/STAT, MYC and TP53) as well as identifying targets for future therapeutic intervention (TNFRSF11A, PDGFRA) in this rare entity.",A combined microfluidic-transcriptomic approach to characterize the extravasation potential of cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546831,Oncotarget,2018 12 17,"The reciprocal interaction between circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tissue-specific cells is influential for the progression of metastases. In particular, the process of extravasation relies on the complex cross-talk between cancer cells and other cellular players such as the endothelium and the secondary tissue. However, most in vitro studies only focus on one heterotypic cell-cell interaction and often lack of physiological relevance. In this project, we investigated both CTC-endothelium and CTC-secondary site interactions during cancer cell extravasation. We first used a microarray analysis of extravasated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to identify key markers involved in extravasation. Then, we developed a tri-culture microfluidic platform combining cancer cells, endothelium and a bone-mimicking (BMi) microenvironment to assess how organ tropism influences the extravasation potential of cancer cells from different tissues. Through the microarray analyses of extravasated cancer cells we found that extravasation is associated with upregulation of late-metastatic markers along with specific proteases, such as matrix metalloprotease (MMP), a-disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) and a-disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family members, which are all involved in endothelium glycocalyx shedding. Through the microfluidic extravasation assay, we found that the bone-like microenvironment increased invasion and motility of breast, bladder and ovarian cancer cell (MDA-MB-231, T24 and OVCAR-3). Among the three cell types, ovarian cancer cells presented the lowest migration rate and bladder cancer cells the highest, hence recapitulating their different level of bone tropism observed in vivo. Taken together, our results shed light on the importance of intercellular communication between CTCs and other non-tumor cells essential for promoting cancer cell extravasation.",Inhibition of breast cancer metastasis to the lungs with UBS109.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546830,Oncotarget,2019 06 10,"Synthetic monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin (MACs) are cytotoxic against several cancers including head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Mechanisms of action include depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibition of NF-κB, leading to apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that UBS109 (MAC), has preventive effects on bone loss induced by breast cancer cell lines. We determined whether UBS109 could inhibit and prevent lung metastasis, since lung metastasis of breast cancer is a major problem in addition to bone metastasis. A breast cancer lung metastasis (colonization) model was created by injection of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 into the tail vein of athymic nude mice, nu/nu. Animals were treated with vehicle or UBS109 at 5 or 15 mg/kg body weight by intraperitoneal injection once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. UBS109 at 15 mg/kg significantly inhibited lung metastasis/colonization as demonstrated by reduced lung weight consisting of tumor nodules. The body weight of animals treated with UBS109 15 mg/kg remained the same as in the other groups. UBS109 killed completely (100%) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 1.25 μM in a cytotoxicity assay in vitro. UBS109 15 mg/kg i.p. showed a maximal blood concentration (Cmax) of 432 ± 387 ng/mL at 15 min post injection. This is approximately 1.5 ng/ml in the blood of mice and equals 1.5 μM of UBS109. These in vitro and in vivo results are consistent with each other.",Exosomes impact survival to radiation exposure in cell line models of nervous system cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546829,Oncotarget,2018 12 17,"Radiation is utilized in the therapy of more than 50% of cancer patients. Unfortunately, many malignancies become resistant to radiation over time. We investigated the hypothesis that one method of a cancer cell's ability to survive radiation occurs through cellular communication via exosomes. Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles containing DNA, RNA, and protein. Three properties were analyzed: 1) exosome function, 2) exosome profile and 3) exosome uptake/blockade. To analyze exosome function, we show radiation-derived exosomes increased proliferation and enabled recipient cancer cells to survive radiation in vitro. Furthermore, radiation-derived exosomes increased tumor burden and decreased survival in an in vivo model. To address the mechanism underlying the alterations by exosomes in recipient cells, we obtained a profile of radiation-derived exosomes that showed expression changes favoring a resistant/proliferative profile. Radiation-derived exosomes contain elevated oncogenic miR-889, oncogenic mRNAs, and proteins of the proteasome pathway, Notch, Jak-STAT, and cell cycle pathways. Radiation-derived exosomes contain decreased levels of tumor-suppressive miR-516, miR-365, and multiple tumor-suppressive mRNAs. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the most represented networks included cell cycle, growth/survival. Upregulation of DNM2 correlated with increased exosome uptake. To analyze the property of exosome blockade, heparin and simvastatin were used to inhibit uptake of exosomes in recipient cells resulting in inhibited induction of proliferation and cellular survival. Because these agents have shown some success as cancer therapies, our data suggest their mechanism of action could be limiting exosome communication between cells. The results of our study identify a novel exosome-based mechanism that may underlie a cancer cell's ability to survive radiation.",Decreased levels of regulatory B cells in patients with acute pancreatitis: association with the severity of the disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546828,Oncotarget,2018 12 17,"Early stratification of the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) is clinically important. Regulatory B cells have been found to be associated with disease activity of autoimmune diseases. However, the role of Regulatory B cells in AP remains unknown. We investigate the dynamic longitudinal changes in circulating IL-10-producing B cells (B10) and memory CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells in patients with AP to evaluate their prediction utility for AP severity. B10, CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells, inflammatory markers and cytokines were detected in patients with AP immediately after admission to the hospital (day 1), then on the third and seventh days. We observed decreases in lymphocytes, CD19+, B10, CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells and lower mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 and CD86 on B10 or CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells in patients with AP, especially in those with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells from patients with AP suppressed the cytokine productions of CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, but had impaired ability to induce regulatory T cells response. B10 and CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells significantly increased in patients with mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) from day 1 to day 7, whereas these indexes remained stable in patients with SAP. B10 or CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells were negatively correlated with the severity index (APACHE II score), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, CD64 index), and cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that B10 and CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells could predict the development of SAP. Thus, the detection of B10 and CD19+CD24hiCD27hi cells may be a practical way to improve the early assessment of AP severity.",Decreased long intergenic noncoding RNA P7 predicts unfavorable prognosis and promotes tumor proliferation via the modulation of the STAT1-MAPK pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546827,Oncotarget,2018 12 17,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common neoplasm and is a leading cause of cancer-related death. Despite advances in the diagnosis and management of HCC, its prognosis remain unfavorable. Accumulating evidence has shown that long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) play central roles in the development of HCC. In this study, we identified a long intergenic noncoding RNA referred to as lincRNA P7 in HCC and explored its clinical significance and biological functions in HCC. The expression level of lincRNA P7 was significantly aberrantly deceased in HCC cancer tissues and cells lines. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that overexpression of lincRNA P7 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCC-derived cancer cells, whereas lincRNA P7 knockdown promoted cell growth. Mechanistically, lincRNA P7 blocked Erk1/2 signaling and repressed activation of the STAT1 pathway. In nude mouse models, we show that overexpression of lincRNA P7 effectively repressed HCC xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, a clinical investigation demonstrated that down-regulated lincRNA P7 expression correlated with liver cirrhosis, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, clinical stage of the tumor and recurrence. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the expression of lincRNA P7 was significantly related to overall survival (P = 0.003) and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.031). Collectively, our findings suggested that the down-regulation of lincRNA P7 predicts poor clinical outcomes for HCC patients and might be a powerful candidate prognostic biomarker and target in HCC.",Community Violence and Associated Psychological Problems Among Adolescents in the General Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546818,Journal of child & adolescent trauma,2018 12 17,"Based on a populational survey conducted among 1400 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years old, the aim of this study is to assess the relationships between their community violence experiences and their psychological health (anger, depressive symptoms, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms). One MANOVA confirms that both boys and girls who report at least one incident of physical community violence present more psychological difficulties, especially anger. Subsequent MANOVAs show that anger intensity varies depending on whether the youth was a direct victim or a witness only, as well as on the diversity of the types of violent manifestations and on acquaintance with the perpetrator, whereas the presence of injuries has no significant effect. This study highlights the importance of considering the context of the community violence incident, to clearly understand its relationships with the youth's psychological difficulties.",Phospholipase A2 in skin biology: new insights from gene-manipulated mice and lipidomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546811,Inflammation and regeneration,2018 12 17,"The skin represents one of the tissues that are most profoundly influenced by alterations in the quality of lipids (lipoquality). Lipids not only constitute cellular membranes, but also serve as bioactive lipid mediators and essential components of the skin barrier. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes supply fatty acids and lysophospholipids from membrane phospholipids, thereby variably affecting cutaneous homeostasis. Accordingly, perturbation of particular PLA2-driven lipid pathways can be linked to various forms of skin disease. In this review article, we highlight the roles of several PLA2 subtypes in cutaneous pathophysiology, as revealed by transgenic/knockout studies in combination with comprehensive lipidomics. We focus mainly on secreted PLA2 group IIF (sPLA2-IIF), which is associated with epidermal hyperplasia through mobilization of a unique lipid metabolite. We also address the distinct roles of sPLA2-IIE in hair follicles and sPLA2-IID in lymphoid immune cells that secondarily affect cutaneous inflammation, and provide some insights into species differences in sPLA2s. Additionally, we briefly overview the patatin-like phospholipase PNPLA1, which belongs to the Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) family, as a key regulator of skin barrier function through catalysis of a unique non-PLA2 reaction. These knowledges on lipid metabolism driven by various PLA2 subtypes will open novel opportunities for translated studies toward diagnosis and therapy of human skin diseases."

Materials and Methods: Elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) who had been admitted to neurosurgery departments from April 2015 to March 2017 were enrolled in this study. We collected data on regular medications at the time of admission and discharge. Furthermore, we retrospectively analyzed factors associated with potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). PIMs were defined as polypharmacy (≥ 6 medications used concurrently) or taking any of the unfavorable medications on the ""list of drugs to be prescribed with special caution"" in the ""Guidelines for Medical Treatment and Its Safety in the Elderly 2015"". Results: We gathered data on over 1900 medications (mean number, 5.04) prescribed to 197 patients (mean age, 76.9 years). PIMs were observed in 51.3% of patients on admission. The most common prescriptions resulting in PIMs were benzodiazepine agents, followed by loop diuretics and H2 receptor antagonists. The multivariate analysis revealed that age (odds ratio, 1.08; p < 0.01) and the number of prescribers (odds ratio, 6.16; p < 0.01) were significantly related to PIMs on admission. PIM exposure at the time of discharge accounted for 39.1%, a 12.2% decrease. Conclusion: More than half of the elderly patients were prescribed PIMs on admission; however, this exposure decreased by 12.2% at the time of discharge. Hospitalization is an optimal opportunity for reconsidering the necessity of medications and for changing the prescriptions according to patients' conditions.","Optimizing medical care for geriatric patients in Austria: defining a top five list of ""Choosing Wisely"" recommendations using the Delphi technique.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546795,European geriatric medicine,2018 12 17,Inappropriate use of diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures is common and potentially harmful for older patients.

Pink Noise and the Ethics of Interaction-Dominant Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546499,Nanoethics,2018 12 17,"There is a growing recognition within cognitive enhancement and neuroethics debates of the need for greater emphasis on cognitive artefacts. This paper aims to contribute to this broadening and expansion of the cognitive-enhancement and neuroethics debates by focusing on a particular form of relation or coupling between humans and cognitive artefacts: interaction-dominance. We argue that interaction-dominance as an emergent property of some human-cognitive artefact relations has important implications for understanding the attribution and distribution of causal and other forms of responsibility as well as agency relating to the actions of human-cognitive artefact couplings. Interaction-dominance is both indicated and constituted by the phenomenon of ""pink noise"". Understanding the role of noise in this regard will establish a necessary theoretical groundwork for approaching the ethical and political dimensions of relations between human cognition and digital cognitive artefacts. We argue that pink noise in this context plays a salient role in the practical, ethical, and political evaluation of coupling relations between humans and cognitive artefacts, and subsequently in the responsible innovation of cognitive artefacts and human-artefact interfaces.","""Just Carbon"": Ideas About Graphene Risks by Graphene Researchers and Innovation Advisors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546498,Nanoethics,2018 12 17,"Graphene is a nanomaterial with many promising and innovative applications, yet early studies indicate that graphene may pose risks to humans and the environment. According to ideas of responsible research and innovation, all relevant actors should strive to reduce risks related to technological innovations. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigated the idea of graphene as a risk (or not) held by two types of key actors: graphene researchers and innovation advisors at universities, where the latter are facilitating the movement of graphene from the laboratory to the marketplace. The most common idea found is that graphene is not a risk due to, e.g., low toxicity, low amounts produced/used, and its similarity to harmless materials (being ""just carbon""). However, some researchers and advisors also say that graphene is a risk, e.g., under certain conditions or due to a lack of risk-related information. We explain the co-existence of these seemingly contradictory ideas through (1) the semantic ambiguity of the word risk and (2) a risk/no-risk rhetoric, where risks are mentioned rhetorically only to be disregarded as manageable or negligible. We suggest that some of the ideas held by the researchers and innovation advisors constitute a challenge to responsible research and innovation regarding graphene. At the same time, we acknowledge the dilemma that the discourse of responsible innovation creates for the actors: denying graphene risks makes them irresponsible due to a lack of risk awareness, while affirming graphene risks makes them irresponsible due to their everyday engagement in graphene development. We therefore recommend more research into what researchers and innovation advisors should do in practice in order to qualify as responsible.",Giving Voice to Patients: Developing a Discussion Method to Involve Patients in Translational Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546497,Nanoethics,2018 12 17,"Biomedical research policy in recent years has often tried to make such research more 'translational', aiming to facilitate the transfer of insights from research and development (R&D) to health care for the benefit of future users. Involving patients in deliberations about and design of biomedical research may increase the quality of R&D and of resulting innovations and thus contribute to translation. However, patient involvement in biomedical research is not an easy feat. This paper discusses the development of a method for involving patients in (translational) biomedical research aiming to address its main challenges. After reviewing the potential challenges of patient involvement, we formulate three requirements for any method to meaningfully involve patients in (translational) biomedical research. It should enable patients (1) to put forward their experiential knowledge, (2) to develop a rich view of what an envisioned innovation might look like and do, and (3) to connect their experiential knowledge with the envisioned innovation. We then describe how we developed the card-based discussion method 'Voice of patients', and discuss to what extent the method, when used in four focus groups, satisfied these requirements. We conclude that the method is quite successful in mobilising patients' experiential knowledge, in stimulating their imaginaries of the innovation under discussion and to some extent also in connecting these two. More work is needed to translate patients' considerations into recommendations relevant to researchers' activities. It also seems wise to broaden the audience for patients' considerations to other actors working on a specific innovation.",Transaminase-Catalyzed Racemization with Potential for Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546495,ChemCatChem,2018 12 17,"Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) reactions in which a stereoselective enzyme and a racemization step are coupled in one pot would represent powerful tools for the production of enantiopure amines through enantioconvergence of racemates. The exploitation of DKR strategies is currently hampered by the lack of effective, enzyme-compatible and scalable racemization strategies for amines. In the present work, the proof of concept of a fully biocatalytic method for amine racemization is presented. Both enantiomers of the model compound 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine could be racemized in water and at room temperature using a couple of wild-type, non-proprietary, enantiocomplementary amine transaminases and a minimum amount of pyruvate/alanine as a co-substrate couple.

In the setting of shoulder paralysis, the integrity of the ipsilateral lower trapezius may be compromised. In this instance, the contralateral lower trapezius may be used with reasonable results. In the setting of irreparable rotator cuff tears, the procedure may be performed through an open or arthroscopically assisted technique. The latter avoids the need for an acromial osteotomy and risk of nonunion associated with repair of the osteotomy. Both are effective in reversing pseudoparesis or pseudoparalysis. Advanced degenerative changes have an effect on outcomes, resulting in less pain improvement, decreased range of motion, and greater need for reoperation with conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Nonetheless, the lower trapezius tendon transfer is an effective option for restoring active external rotation with relatively consistent results."

Both mono- and diprotonated species were considered. It has been shown that E-isomers of neutral imines can be stabilised by an intramolecular C=N-H···OMe hydrogen bond with a neighbouring methoxy group. Electron-donating OMe groups dramatically increase the basicity of the imino nitrogen, forcing the latter to abstract a proton from the proton sponge moiety in monoprotonated forms.

The Cu(I) catalyst not only participates in the alkyl diacyl peroxides decomposition to afford alkyl azides but also catalyzes the subsequent CuAAC reaction to produce the 1,2,3-triazoles.",Synthesis of indole-cycloalkyl[b]pyridine hybrids via a four-component six-step tandem process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546474,Beilstein journal of organic chemistry,2018 12 17,"The one-pot four-component reaction of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxopropanenitriles, aromatic aldehydes, cycloalkanones and ammonium acetate occurred via a six-step tandem Knoevenagel condensation-nucleophilic addition to carbonyl-Michael addition-N-cyclization-elimination-air oxidation sequence to afford structurally intriguing indole-cycloalkyl[b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile hybrid heterocycles in excellent yields.","Generation of 1,2-oxathiolium ions from (arysulfonyl)- and (arylsulfinyl)allenes in Brønsted acids.

Quenching of solutions of these cations with low nucleophilic media, aqueous HCl, leads to their deprotonation with a stereoselective formation of (arysulfonyl)butadienes (for instance, ArSO2-CR1=C-C(Me)=CH2, for R2 = R3 = Me, yields of 87-98%). Reactions of (arysulfonyl)allenes in the system TfOH (0.1 equiv)-HFIP (hexafluoropropan-2-ol) followed by hydrolysis give rise to allyl alcohols (ArSO2-CR1=CH-C(OH)R2R3, yields of 78-99%). Reflux of solutions of (arysulfonyl)allenes in the presence of TfOH (1 equiv) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene leads to the cyclization into thiochromene 1,1-dioxides in high yields.

Even though antimicrobial resistance is not a new problem, antibiotic development has failed to match the growth of resistant pathogens and hence, it is highly critical to discover new anti-infective drugs with novel mechanisms of action which will help reducing the burden of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in a myriad of vital cellular processes and have become an attractive target to treat diseases. Therefore, targeting PPI networks in bacteria may offer a new and unconventional point of intervention to develop novel anti-infective drugs which can combat the ever-increasing rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review describes the progress achieved towards the discovery of molecules that disrupt PPI systems in bacteria for which inhibitors have been identified and whose targets could represent an alternative lead discovery strategy to obtain new anti-infective molecules.",The influence of the cationic carbenes on the initiation kinetics of ruthenium-based metathesis catalysts; a DFT study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546471,Beilstein journal of organic chemistry,2018 12 17,"Cationic carbenes are a relatively new and rare group of ancillary ligands, which have shown their superior activity in a number of challenging catalytic reactions. In ruthenium-based metathesis catalysis they are often used as ammonium tags, to provide water-soluble, environment-friendly catalysts. In this work we performed computational studies on three cationic carbenes with the formal positive charge located at different distances from the carbene carbon. We show that the predicted initiation rates of Grubbs, indenylidene, and Hoveyda-Grubbs-like complexes incorporating these carbenes show little variance and are similar to initiation rates of standard Grubbs, indenylidene, and Hoveyda-Grubbs catalysts. In all investigated cases the partial charge of the carbene carbon atom is similar, resulting in comparable Ccarbene-Ru bond strengths and Ru-P/O dissociation Gibbs free energies.",Olefin metathesis catalysts embedded in β-barrel proteins: creating artificial metalloproteins for olefin metathesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546470,Beilstein journal of organic chemistry,2018 12 17,This review summarizes the recent progress of Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type olefin metathesis catalysts incorporated into the robust fold of β-barrel proteins.

No detailed studies of cancers in AYAs have described the epidemiology, treatment outcome, and social status in Japan. The present study defined AYAs as those aged 15-29 years old based on the US National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Data was collected from the hospital-based cancer registry and electronic medical charts at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital from 2007 to 2015. The present study analyzed the types of cancer, treatment methods and outcomes, fertility preservation, marital status, raising children, school admission, and employment status. A total of 362 (1.9%) cancer cases in AYAs (males 119, females 243) were identified. Carcinoma was the most common type of cancer in both sexes. Females had a high incidence of carcinoma of the genitourinary tract (28.0%). Fertility-sparing surgery (16.0%) was the most common method of fertility preservation. The 5-year survival was better in females (88.4%) than in males (79.9%). The percentage of married AYAs increased following cancer treatment. The proportion of unemployment increased following cancer treatment in all age groups and was greatest (12.6%) in those aged 20-24 years old. Compared with SEER data from the United States, the incidence of carcinoma was high among AYAs, particularly genitourinary tract carcinomas in females, while the incidence of melanoma and skin carcinomas was low. Therefore, AYAs with cancer requires social and economic support.",RBBP7 is a prognostic biomarker in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546458,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Retinoblastoma-binding protein 7 (RBBP7) is an important component of several complexes that regulate chromatin metabolism. It is overexpressed in certain cancer types and serves conflicting roles in tumor progression. In the present study, the expression and roles of RBBP7 were explored in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect RBBP7 expression in ESCC tissues. The mRNA sequencing profiles from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases were mined to analyze the mRNA expression of RBBP7 in tissues. Proliferation, clone formation, apoptosis and Transwell invasion/migration assays were performed to explore the roles of RBBP7 in ESCC. RBBP7 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues. The protein and mRNA expression levels of RBBP7 were significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. RBBP7 overexpression was associated with a poor overall survival in patients with ESCC. Furthermore, higher RBBP7 expression was significantly correlated with poor tumor differentiation, advanced regional lymph node involvement, and pathological TNM staging. Knockdown of RBBP7 in ESCC cells did not affect tumor apoptosis or tumor growth. However, the overexpression of RBBP7 significantly enhanced the invasion and migration of ESCC cells, whereas the knockdown of RBBP7 resulted in significantly decreased invasion and migration. The present study indicated that RBBP7 is a novel biomarker and prognosticator for patients with ESCC. Furthermore, RBBP7 serves crucial roles in promoting ESCC invasion and migration.",The possible different roles of denosumab in prevention and cure breast cancer bone metastases: A 'hypothesis-generator' study from clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546457,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"The most frequent site of recurrence in breast cancer (BC) is the bone, particularly in patients with 'luminal-like' disease. Denosumab has been shown to prevent aromatase inhibitors (AIs) induced bone resorption in postmenopausal early BC patients and reduce skeletal-related events (SREs) in bone metastatic breast cancer (BMBC). A 'real life' analysis of 90 BMBC patients treated with denosumab was performed. Eighty-six patients (95.6%) had 'luminal-like' disease, 72 (80%) had bone metastases at the time of first recurrence of disease. Among 50 patients with metachronous 'luminal-like' disease, 40 (80%) had first recurrence to the bone. Among these patients median time to skeletal recurrence (TSkR) was shorter for patients who were previously exposed to AIs compared to those who were not (53.0 vs. 102.0 months, respectively; P=0.0300) and longer for patients previously treated with tamoxifen compared to those who were not (102.0 vs. 59.0 months, respectively; P=0.0466). Both of them were not confirmed at multivariate analysis. In the overall population, 17 first SREs were observed (16 radiation therapy) and median time to first SRE was not reached. A statistically significant difference in the incidence of SREs was detected only between patients with exclusively osteolytic bone metastases vs. those without (P=0.013). The presence of exclusively-osteolytic bone metastases was the only factor significantly associated with a shorter time to first SRE (P=0.011). The only G3 toxicity reported was hypocalcemia in one patient. No osteonecrosis of the jaw events (ONJ) occurred. This study demonstrated that a pro-active attitude enables the treatment of the majority of patients with denosumab without significant class-related toxicities. The majority of SREs were from radiation therapy, so pain still remains the clinical hallmark of bone metastases, particularly for osteolytic ones. The suggestion that estrogen deprivation with AIs can favor a 'bone-related' risk conditions for developing bone metastases must be considered with caution and surely needs further validations.",Shank-associated RH domain-interacting protein expression is upregulated in entodermal and mesodermal cancer or downregulated in ectodermal malignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546455,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Shank-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN) is a type of linear ubiquitin chain-associated protein, which serves an important role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, organ development, immune and inflammatory reaction, initiation and development of malignant tumors. To evaluate SHARPIN expression in multiple malignant tumors derived from different germ layers, 14 types of cancer and their corresponding normal tissues were examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed to semi-quantify SHARPIN expression in multiple malignant tumors, and immunofluorescence was performed to evaluate the subcellular localization of SHARPIN in various malignant tumors. All the recruited cancer and paracancer samples originated from entoderm and mesoderm showed an upregulated expression of SHARPIN, whereas the cancer types that originated from ectoderm exhibited a downregulated or loss of SHARPIN expression. SHARPIN was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of cells and exhibited a faint signal in the nucleus, with the exception for lung cancer and esophagus cancer, in which malignant cells had aberrantly large nuclei and limited cytoplasm, which produced a signal in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm. Conclusively, SHARPIN expression was upregulated in entodermal and mesodermal cancer types, but downregulated in ectodermal cancer types, indicating SHARPIN could act as either oncogene or anti-oncogene in malignant tumors derived from different germ layers.",Role of miR-214 in modulating proliferation and invasion of human colon cancer SW620 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546454,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"This study investigated the role of miR-214 in modulating proliferation and invasion of human colon cancer SW620 cells. Fifty-five patients with colon cancer who were treated in China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from March 2014 to March 2015 were enrolled into this study. Their cancer and corresponding paracancerous tissues were collected and the expression levels of miR-214 were determined by RT-qPCR. A miR-214 expression vector was constructed. SW620 cells were transfected with the miR-214 expression vector and a blank vector. Cells transfected with the miR-214 expression vector were assigned to the miR-214 positive group and cells transfected with the blank vector were assigned to the miR-214 negative group. Cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay, Transwell migration assay and TUNEL apoptosis assay, respectively. The RT-qPCR results showed that the expression level of miR-214 in colon cancer tissue, as well as in miR-214 negative cells, was significantly lower than that in paracancerous tissue (P<0.05 for both). In cell comparison, the expression level of miR-214 in the miR-214 positive group was significantly higher than that in the miR-214 negative group (0.483±0.001 vs. 0.172±0.001; P<0.05). The proliferation level of SW620 cells in the miR-214 positive group was lower than that in the miR-214 negative group (P<0.05). The Transwell migration assay indicated that there were less cells penetrating the membrane in the miR-214 positive group than in the miR-214 negative group (P<0.05). In addition, The apoptosis rate of cells in the miR-214 negative group was significantly lower than that in the miR-214 positive group (P<0.05). Finally, the low expression of miR-214 was found in colon cancer, indicating that miR-214 is a cancer suppressor playing an opposing role in colon cancer onset and progression. Therefore, miR-214 can promote apoptosis of colon cancer cells SW620 by inhibiting their proliferation and invasion.",Association between the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-6R in the hepatocellular carcinoma microenvironment and postoperative recurrence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546452,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"The tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex system, involving mutual promotion and inhibition between cells and molecules. It results in alterations to inflammatory-associated factors, including a decrease in interleukin (IL)-2 and an increase in tumor necrosis factor, together with a characteristic elevation of IL-6. Following the synthesis and release of IL-6, HCC is stimulated through IL-6 binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-6R in 92 patients with HCC, and the association between IL-6/IL-6R expression levels and tumor recurrence was examined. Notably increased expression levels of IL-6 and IL-6R were observed in the HCC microenvironment, and recurrence occurred earlier in patients with high IL-6/IL-6R expression levels compared with those with low expression levels (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between patients in the two groups (P>0.05). Platelet levels <100×109/l, tumor-node-metastasis stage IIIa and high expression levels of IL-6/IL-6R were independent risk factors for postoperative recurrence (P<0.05). The present study proposed that high IL-6 and IL-6R expression in the HCC microenvironment promotes postoperative tumor recurrence, suggesting that these may be potential predictors of recurrence, and may be used as possible therapeutic targets to enhance the long-term survival of patients.",Expression of miR-204 in pediatric retinoblastoma and its effects on proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546451,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Expression, clinical significance and molecular mechanism of miR-204 in human retinoblastoma (RB) and para-carcinoma tissues were investigated. A total of 110 cases of RB tissues preserved after ophthalmectomy in the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University (People's Hospital of Hunan Province) from April 2013 to June 2017 were collected along with 100 cases of para-carcinoma normal tissues. The expression of miR-204 in RB tissues was detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and its associations with clinicopathological features were analyzed. Y79 cells were transfected with miR-204 mimics. A total of 80 pmol/l miR-204 mimics and 10 µl Lipofectamine 2000 were added into the experimental group. Cell proliferation was detected via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, apoptosis was detected via flow cytometry at 48 h after transfection, and the relative expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) messenger RNA (mRNA) and Sirt1 mRNA were detected via RT-qPCR. The results of MTT assay revealed that the measured value of the optical density (OD) in the experimental group at 48 h was obviously lower than that in the negative control group (p<0.001). The proportion of apoptotic cells in the experimental group was remarkably higher than that in the negative control group (p<0.001). Compared with those in the negative control group, the relative expression levels of Bcl-2 and Sirt1 mRNAs in the experimental group were significantly decreased (p<0.001). miR-204 may be involved in the occurrence and development of RB, which is significantly associated with clinical tissue differentiation, neural infiltration and lymph node metastasis in patients. miR-204 may inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of RB cells through downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Sirt1 in RB. Therefore, miR-204 may become a new biological index for early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation and biotherapy of RB.",Effects of mdig on proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546450,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Expression of mineral dust-induced gene (mdig) in lung cancer NCI-H1650 cells was detected to investigate the effects of mdig on proliferation and apoptosis of NCI-H1650 cells. NCI-H1650 lung cancer cells were cultured in vitro. The expression of mdig in NCI-H1650 cells was lowered using ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technique. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were used to detect the effects of mdig small interfering RNA (siRNA) on messenger RNA (mRNA) and the protein expression of mdig in lung cancer NCI-H1650 cells, respectively. The effect of mdig on the proliferation of NCI-H1650 cells was observed through 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and flow cytometry was used to detect the impact of mdig on cell cycle and apoptosis of NCI-H1650 cells. The influence of mdig on caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) proteins in NCI-H1650 cells were investigated via western blot analysis. The results of RT-qPCR and western blot analysis showed that mdig siRNA obviously inhibited the expression of mRNA and protein of mdig in NCI-H1650 cells. Results of the MTT assay showed mdig siRNA could significantly reduce the proliferation ability of NCI-H1650 cells. In addition cell cycle detection showed that mdig siRNA caused NCI-H1650 cell arrest at G1 phase. Apoptosis detection results indicated that mdig siRNA promoted apoptosis of NCI-H1650 cells. Western-blot analysis revealed that mdig siRNA upregulated the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1 proteins in NCI-H1650 cells. Mdig is highly expressed in lung cancer NCI-H1650 cells while mdig siRNA can inhibit proliferation of NCI-H1650 cells and accelerate apoptosis. The underlying mechanism may be related to inhibited cell cycle progression and upregulated expression of cleavage proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1).",High expression of class III β-tubulin in upper gastrointestinal cancer types.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546449,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) is a component of microtubules of neuronal cells that is upregulated in various cancer entities. To better understand the role of TUBB3 in upper gastrointestinal tract cancer types, the present study assessed TUBB3 expression in tissue microarrays including 189 gastric and 428 esophageal cancer. TUBB3 expression was detected in 62.4% of gastric cancer, 73.8% of esophageal adenocarcinoma and 88.7% of esophageal squamous cell cancer, while control samples of normal esophageal and gastric epithelium were TUBB3-negative. TUBB3 positivity was not associated with the International Union Against Cancer classification, World Health Organization grading, lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in any entity. Of note, TUBB3 expression was associated with tumor localization and prognosis in gastric cancer, with the tumor stage in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and with the resection margin in esophageal squamous cell cancer. In conclusion, the substantial rate of positivity for TUBB3 already in early stages of gastric cancer in combination with the lack of a further increase in frequency with tumor stage, may suggest, that TUBB3 upregulation is rather relevant for cancer development than for cancer progression. TUBB3 might be a suitable prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer types.",Oxidative stress induced by carboplatin promotes apoptosis and inhibits migration of HN-3 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546448,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is currently a serious public health problem in China; thus, it is urgent to identify effective treatment strategies for this disease. Previous studies demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve important roles in the apoptosis of LSCC cells. It has also been indicated that carboplatin (CBDCA), a second-generation platinum compound with broad antineoplastic properties, is able to induce oxidative stress to produce ROS, which in turn promotes apoptosis. Thus, the present study investigated if CBDCA is cytotoxic in LSCC cells due to the oxidative stress caused by ROS. Therefore, an MTT assay was performed to determine the cell viability of HN-3 LSCC cells following treatment with different doses of CBDCA. Subsequently, the expression levels of ROS and the rate of apoptosis/necrosis were evaluated in the cells. Following this, the HN-3 cells were co-treated with CBDCA and glutathione (GSH) or H2O2, followed by an MTT assay, a cell migration assay and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that CBDCA reduced the viability of HN-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and promoted the production of ROS and apoptosis at certain doses. Additionally, the combination treatment of CBDCA and H2O2 enhanced the inhibitory effects of CBDCA on cell viability and migration ability, and promoted apoptosis in HN-3 cells; whereas the combined treatment of CBDCA and GSH exerted opposite effects. The results of the present study demonstrated that CBDCA promotes the apoptosis of HN-3 cells through accumulation of ROS, which may provide a novel treatment strategy for treating LSCC."

However, the function of FKBP51 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains largely unknown. In the present study, increased FKBP51 expression was detected in PTC tissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues, and the expression level was associated with clinical tumor, node and metastasis stage. Using FKBP51-overexpressing K1 cells and FKBP51-knockdown TPC-1 cells, both human PTC cell lines, it was identified that FKBP51 promoted the migration and invasion of PTC, without affecting cell proliferation. Further investigation revealed that FKBP51 activated the NF-κB pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, and EMT was suppressed when NF-κB was inhibited. It was also assessed whether FKBP51 promoted the formation of cytoskeleton to promote migration and invasion of PTC using a tubulin tracker; however, no evidence of such an effect was observed. These results suggested that FKBP51 promotes migration and invasion through NF-κB-dependent EMT.",Co-expression network analysis of gene expression profiles of HER2+ breast cancer-associated brain metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546434,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Brain metastasis occurs in ~30% of patients with breast cancer, and patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer have a particularly high frequency of brain metastasis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify the hub differentially expressed genes from patients with HER2+ breast cancer between brain metastases and primary tumors. The potential candidate genes were investigated in another set of patient samples to confirm their relevance. The results indicated that a number of pathways altered significantly when breast cancer metastasized to the brain. Cyclophilin A (CypA) and ribosomal protein L17 (RPL17) were overexpressed in breast cancer-associated brain metastases, whereas tumor protein 63 (TP63) and von Willebrand factor A domain-containing 8 (VWA8) were significantly downregulated in breast cancer brain metastases. Furthermore, the expression of CypA and RPL17 in brain metastases were significantly increased compared with that in primary breast tumors, and the expression of TP63 and VWA8 in brain metastases were significantly decreased. This result indicated that the significant differences in expression observed between primary breast tumors and brain metastases were derived from significantly altered systems, including gene modules rather than single genes.",Treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with NY-ESO-1 specific TCR engineered-T cells in a phase I clinical trial: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546433,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"This article presented a case of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-positive patient with advanced cancer/testis antigen New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1) expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) who received adoptive cell therapy of T cell receptor engineered-T cells (TCR-T cells) targeting the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1. The appropriate clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of this therapy for this lung cancer patient. The patient had a clinical response to and was well-tolerated with this therapy in the clinical trial. In addition, a preliminary evaluation of the safety of NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell therapy was performed in four patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) enrolled in a clinical trial. It was well-tolerated and did not observe any serious adverse events post-infusion. Fever, anemia, and a decrease in white blood cell count were common adverse events, which were likely due to the TCR-T cell therapy. Two patients had clinical responses to NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell therapy, including the 44-year-old female patient with LADC, who achieved a short-term partial response for 4 months, improved in Karnofsky performance status, and had a recovery of drug sensitivity.

In the present study, clinical characteristics and experimental observations in 9 adult patients diagnosed with AMKL, who were recruited by the Sino-U.S. Shanghai Leukemia Co-operative Group, were analyzed in order to summarize the diagnostic experience and provide recommendations on diagnosing AMKL. All the patients were diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Organization diagnostic criteria. The mean age of the patients with AMKL was 59 years (range, 53-68 years). A total of 8 patients had different degrees of anemia, and 2 patients had <5% marrow blasts present in the bone marrow; however, the percentage of positive cells with cluster of differentiation (CD)41 and CD61 expression was >20%, as demonstrated by flow cytometry.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of AMKL requires a combination of the results of bone marrow smears and bone marrow biopsy, immunophenotype or immunohistochemistry. We recommend that routine immunophenotypic analysis should include the CD41 and CD61 markers for diagnosing acute leukemia when bone marrow morphology does not indicate the diagnosis.",The development of simultaneous measurement of viral load and physical status for human papillomavirus 16 and 18 co-infection using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546431,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 is known to be a major risk factor for cervical cancer. Increased prevalence of co-infection with these high-risk types has been observed in pre-cancerous and cancerous tissues. The determination of physical status and copy numbers of viruses is therefore useful in clinical settings. A simple multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for HPV16/HPV18 co-infection in one tube reaction was established in the present study using TaqMan®-based PCR for E2 and E6 viral DNA. The detection range was up to 106 copies with 100% specificity and high precision (CV of cycle time <0.5%). The analytical accuracy and robustness were verified by competitive assay using an unequal mixture of HPV16/HPV18 DNA. No significant effect was demonstrated when compared with the simplex qPCR. The detection of physical status was evaluated in cervical samples, including 5 pre-cancerous and 15 cancerous samples. No significant difference was observed between simplex and multiplex qPCR (P=0.372). In conclusion, the developed multiplex qPCR method successfully demonstrated the viral status of the common HPV types in one tube. This assay will facilitate viral assessment and monitoring of cervical cancer associated with HPV16 and HPV18 co-infection.",Correlation of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F expression with gastric cancer and prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546430,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Correlation of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XPF) expression with gastric cancer and prognosis was investigated. We randomly selected 76 gastric cancer patients who were admitted to the Second People's Hospital of Dezhou City and received treatment, and detected XPF expression in gastric cancer tissues (observation group) and normal gastric mucosa adjacent to tumor (control group) via immunohistochemistry. Correlation between XPF expression and clinicopathological indicators of gastric cancer was verified via single-factor Chi-square test. Cox's proportional hazard regression model was used in the analysis of influencing factors of patient's prognosis, and Kaplan-Meier was used to analyze the survival rates of XPF-positive and -negative patients. In the observation group, the XPF-positive rate was significantly higher than that in the control group with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). Single-factor analysis showed that XPF expression was correlated with the family history and Laurén classification (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the survival time of XPF-positive patients was shorter than that of XPF-negative patients (P<0.05). Multifactorial analysis using Cox's hazards model suggested that XPF was an independent factor affecting the prognosis of gastric cancer (P<0.05). In conclusion, XPF expression plays an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, and a high expression of XPF suggests a poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients.",Relationship between the genetic expression of WTAP and bladder cancer and patient prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546429,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"The relationship between the gene expression of Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) and bladder cancer was investigated to study the effect of its expression on patient prognosis. Sixty-two fresh specimens of bladder transitional cell cancer tissues were collected as the bladder cancer group, while 20 normal bladder mucosa specimens comprised the control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to detect the pathological differences between the groups and the immunohistochemistry was used to test the expression levels of WTAP in the tissues. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of WTAP. Moreover, western blot analysis was used to examine the WTAP expression levels. At the same time, Cox regression multi-factor survival analysis was conducted for the related factors to the prognoses of bladder cancer patients. The structures of cells in the bladder cancer group were destroyed as was evident by the shrunken cell nuclei, while the tissues in the control group were intact. WTAP expression in the bladder cancer group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group. A small number of mRNAs and proteins were higher in the bladder cancer group than that in the control group. The differences in WTAP expression between the bladder cancer and control groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). There were obvious differences in the postoperative recurrence risk between the patients with a negative WTAP protein expression and those with a positive one (P<0.05). In conclusion, WTAP may play an important role in the occurrence and development of bladder cancer and can be considered as a potential target for bladder cancer treatment, providing a new basis for clinical diagnoses.",Differential expression of PMCA2 mRNA isoforms in a cohort of Spanish patients with breast tumor types.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546427,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"The present study examined the mRNA expression levels of different isoforms of the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2) gene generated by alternative splicing at the first intracellular loop (site A) and C-terminal region (site C) in 85 human breast cancer tumor and 69 adjacent non-tumor tissues. Associations were identified between the expression of PMCA2 splice isoforms and the following clinical variables: Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, tumor size, staging and histological classification, and lymph node status. Transcripts including splice site A or splice site C were amplified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction using PMCA2 isoform-specific primers. Tumor and adjacent tissues were determined to express the different PMCA2 splice isoforms 2w, 2× and 2z (site A), and 2b (site C). The mRNA levels for these variants indicated high biological variability, but increased expression was observed in breast tumor tissues, compared with in adjacent tissues. Significantly increased PMCA2×/b expression levels were detected in breast tumor tissues histologically classified as lobulillar, compared with in ductal-types breast tumor tissues (P<0.028). Furthermore, PMCA2z expression was significantly associated with PR status (P<0.024, compared with in PR-negative tumor tissues), and PMCA2w expression was significantly associated with ER status (P<0.048, increased in ER-positive tumor tissues, compared with ER-negative tumor tissues). Finally, PMCA2b was overexpressed in HER2-positive tumor tissues, compared with in HER2-negative tumor tissues (P<0.014). The data demonstrated the differential mRNA expression of a number of splice site A and C variants of PMCA2 in breast tumor and adjacent tissues, depending on tumor hormone receptor status and histological classification. In agreement with previous data, PMCA2b was overexpressed in HER2-positive tumor tissues, indicating that high mRNA levels of this variant could be a marker of poor prognosis.",MicroRNA-128 targeting RPN2 inhibits cell proliferation and migration through the Akt-p53-cyclin pathway in colorectal cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546426,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignancy with high metastatic rates. The mechanism of miR-128 on the regulation of Ribophorin-II (RPN2) in CRC cells was explored in the present study. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or western blot analyses were conducted to detect miR-128 and RPN2 levels in tissues and cell lines. AmiR-128 overexpression model was constructed using miR-128 mimic transfection in HT29 CRC cells. Then, cell proliferation was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and the migratory and invasive abilities were measured by Transwell assay. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used to detect expression levels of protein kinase-B (Akt)-tumor protein 53 (p53)-cyclin pathway and metastasis-associated factors. In the present study, it was identified that aberrant decreased miR-128 was negatively correlated with RPN2 in CRC tissues. The increased RPN2 levels were significantly associated with poorly-differentiated histology, advanced stages and lymph nodes metastasis in patients with CRC. The survival rate of patients with CRC was also closely associated with RPN2 levels. In HT29 cells, miR-128 upregulation downregulated mRNA and protein levels of RPN2, and significantly inhibited cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities. Markedly decreased Akt phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and increased p53 levels were detected when cells were transfected with miR-128 mimics. Concurrently, decreased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and metastasis-associated protein 1, and increased levels of epithelial-cadherin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, were revealed in miR-128 mimic-transfected cells. Subsequent to screening with miRNA target prediction databases, the specificity of miR-128-targeted RPN2 was validated by a luciferase reporter assay. In conclusion, the results suggested that miR-128 was a specific negative regulator of RPN2, which regulated colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration by affecting the Akt-p53-cyclin pathway. These data may provide novel evidence for the therapeutic potential of miR-128-based treatments for colorectal cancer.",Cordyceps militaris fraction inhibits the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer cells through the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase 3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546425,Oncology letters,2018 12 17,"Cordyceps militaris is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine health supplement, and is also used in the development of anticancer agents. In our previous studies, it was revealed that C. militaris fraction (CMF) possessed an antitumor effect against K562 cells in vitro, induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in the S phase. The published results also demonstrated that CMF-induced apoptosis was involved in mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effects of CMF in NCI-H1299 and Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cell lines, which have high metastatic potential. MTT and clone formation assays were initially used to investigate the inhibitory effect of CMF on the viability of NCI-H1299 and LLC cells. The results of cell adhesion, wound healing, migration and Matrigel invasion assays in vitro indicated that NCI-H1299 cells (treated with 1, 3, 10 or 30 µg/ml CMF) and LLC cells (treated with 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 µg/ml CMF) demonstrated a concentration-dependent reduction in cell migration and invasion compared with the control. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the oral administration of CMF (65, 130 or 260 mg/kg) decreased the tumor growth and decreased the lung and liver metastasis in an LLC xenograft model, compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, western blot analysis was used to investigate the mechanism of the effect of CMF on the migration of NCI-H1299 cells and metastasis in the xenograft model. The results revealed that CMF may promote glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)-mediated degradation of β-catenin inhibited the phosphorylation of upstream protein kinase B (Akt), which resulted in the attenuation of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. These results suggested that CMF may possess potential for the treatment of lung cancer metastasis via the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of PAPSS2 in the differentiation of chondrocytes as well as their mechanisms. Using RNA interference-mediated via a lentivirus and a retrovirus, PAPSS2 gene silence and overexpression in ATDC5 chondrogenic cells were performed. Chondrocyte differentiation and chondrogenic-related gene markers associated with extracellular matrix formation were noted. The mRNA and protein expression for Wnt4, β-catenin and SOX9 genes were observed. The PAPSS2 transcript expression levels progressively decline in ATDC5-induced chondrocyte-like cells during differentiation. Silencing of PAPSS2 expression had a significantly attenuating effect on cell differentiation and decreased expression of collagen II and X. In contrast, over-expression of PAPSS2 promoted the differentiation of ATDC5 chondrogenic cells. The mRNA expression levels of Wnt4 and SOX9 decreased significantly in PAPSS2 knock down cells vs. control cells. However, this expression was increased in the cells over-expressing PAPSS2. These data indicate that PAPSS2 regulates aggrecan activity as well as cell differentiation. The findings favor a mechanism by which PAPSS2 induces differentiation in ATDC5 cells via direct regulation of early signaling events that promote formation of collagenous matrix components. This control is probably mediated via extracellular matrix formation Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.","Dynamic changes and diagnostic and prognostic significance of serum PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein in central nervous system infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546413,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The aim of the study was to analyze the dynamic changes and diagnostic and prognostic significance of serum procalcitonin (PCT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and s-100 protein in central nervous system infection. A total of 110 patients diagnosed with central nervous system infection in Department of Neurology in the People's Hospital of Rizhao from January 2014 to January 2016 were selected and retrospectively analyzed; they were divided into the bacterium (n=70) and virus (n=40) groups. Another 45 normal subjects were selected as the control group. PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein values in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were measured. The serum PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein levels in the bacterium group were significantly higher than those in the virus and control groups (p<0.05). The serum PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein levels in the bacterium and virus groups after treatment were obviously decreased compared with those before treatment (p<0.05). PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in the bacterium and virus groups had no statistically significant differences after treatment (p>0.05). PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein levels in deaths in bacterium group were significantly higher than those in survivors (p<0.05). The serum PCT, hs-CRP and s-100 protein levels, can serve as important indexes for the diagnosis of central nervous system infection and their dynamic changes can be used to monitor the changes in disease condition, severity of bacterial infection and prognosis, providing help for the clinical treatment thereof.",Gastric calcifying fibrous tumor: A clinicopathological study of nine cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546412,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics presented in 9 cases of gastric calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT), and investigate the expressions and clinical implications of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), estrogen receptor (ER) and vimentin in gastric CFTs. The clinical and pathological information of 9 patients with CFTs was investigated retrospectively. Subsequently, the expression of GPER, ER and vimentin were examined using immunohistochemistry, and a literature search for gastric CFT was conducted. The 9 patients were 40-71 years old with a mean age of 52.22 years, including 6 female and 3 male patients. Pathological features included dense hyalinized collagen fibers with a psammomatous body or dystrophic calcification, and the infiltration of scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemically, all cases expressed vimentin and GPER, whereas ER expression was negative. Using a database research, 25 studies regarding gastric CFT were identified, including 48 cases with a sex ratio (female:male) of 1.4:1. In addition, the number of female patients was twice the number of male patients in patients <50 years old, whereas the number was almost equal between women and men ≥50 years of age. Gastric CFT is a benign lesion with a good prognosis and a predilection for female patients, particularly premenopausal women. Estrogen may serve a role in this female predominance, and this may be mediated by GPER rather than ER.",MicroRNA-466 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting CCND1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546411,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"Emerging pieces of evidence indicate that microRNA-466 (miR-466) serves as a tumor suppressor in several human tumors, including colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. However, whether miR-466 is involved in osteosarcoma (OS) progression remains largely unknown. The present study demonstrated that miR-466 was significantly downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, it was revealed that the expression of miR-466 was negatively correlated with OS severity. Moreover, low miR-466 expression in patients with OS predicted poor prognosis. Through functional experiments, miR-466 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation and cell cycle of OS cells while inducing cellular apoptosis. In terms of mechanism, it was revealed that CCND1 was a target of miR-466 in OS cells. miR-466 overexpression suppressed CCND1 expression in OS cells. A reverse association was observed between the expression levels of miR-466 and CCND1 in OS tissues. Furthermore, CCND1 restoration in OS cells significantly rescued the effects of miR-466 on cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrated that miR-466 suppressed OS progression by targeting CCND1, suggesting that miR-466 may be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for OS prognosis and treatment.",Efficacy of several biological therapies for treating moderate to severe psoriasis: A network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546410,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The aim of the present meta-analysis was to systematically assess the efficacy of the various treatments available for moderate to severe psoriasis. PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched to select relevant studies up to February 2015. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as effect estimates. In addition, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 responses for the therapies were systematically assessed. A total of 33 randomized controlled trials were included in the present study. For the PASI 75 response rate, infliximab (5 mg) may be the most effective option for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Furthermore, the pooled results of the PASI 50 response rate demonstrated that infliximab (5 mg) and ustekinumab (90 mg) may be superior to other drugs for treating moderate to severe psoriasis. For the PASI 90 response rate, infliximab (5 mg), ustekinumab (90 mg) and briakinumab (weeks 0 and 4, 200 mg; week 8, 100 mg) exhibited improved results compared with other treatments. In conclusion, infliximab (5 mg) may be a superior option to treat moderate to severe psoriasis due to the relatively high PASI scores. However, despite the high PASI 90 responses, further studies are required to identify the efficacy of ustekinumab (90 mg) and briakinumab.",Effects of aspirin combined with cilostazol on thromboangiitis obliterans in diabetic patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546409,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The present study explored the effects of aspirin combined with cilostazolin in the treatment of diabetic patients with thromboangiitis obliterans and the effects on the related inflammatory factors. A total of 90 diabetic patients with thromboangiitis obliterans admitted to Weifang People's Hospital from August 2015 to June 2017 were selected and divided into the control group (n=45) and the combination group (n=45). Patients in the control group were given aspirin, and those in the combination group were given aspirin combined with cilostazol. Before treatment and 6 weeks after treatment, the clinical data including ankle-brachial index (ABI), 6-min walk test (6MWT) and test data including serum inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 of the two groups were collected for quantitative and statistical analysis. Compared with those in the control group, the ABI and 6MWT in the combination group could be effectively reduced, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). At the same time, cilostazol combined with aspirin could effectively reduce the levels of serum inflammatory factors MMP-2 and MMP-9 in patients, except for nitric oxide (NO), and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Compared with that before treatment, the control and the combination group can significantly improve the clinical symptoms of the patients, and aspirin combined with cilostazol can effectively improve the clinical curative effect of diabetic patients with thromboangitis obliterans and delay the progression of the disease.",Assessment of levels of D-dimer and interferon-γ in pediatric patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia and its clinical implication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546408,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"Levels of D-dimer and interferon-γ (INF-γ) in pediatric patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) were assessed to explore its clinical implication in evaluating the disease severity and patients' prognosis. Enrolled in this study as subjects were 185 pediatric patients with MPP who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical University and the First Hospital of Qiqihar City from January 2017 to October 2017 and 115 healthy children who underwent physical examination during the same time period. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of their pneumonia: Severe pneumonia group with 95 patients and mild pneumonia group with 90 patients. A total of 92 healthy children were assigned to the control group. Immunoassay was performed to measure the serum levels of D-dimer and INF-γ. The levels of these two markers were compared. In terms of D-dimer, the levels in pediatric patients in pneumonia groups were all higher than that in the healthy children (p<0.0001). After treatment for 120 h, the D-dimer and INF-γ levels in both pneumonia groups were lower than those before treatment (p<0.001). Among the patients in both the mild and severe pneumonia groups, those who developed extra-pulmonary complications had higher levels of D-dimer and INF-γ than those who did not developed extra-pulmonary complications (p<0.001). Increased levels of D-dimer and INF-γ were observed in pediatric patients with MPP. Assessment of the levels of D-dimer and INF-γ in serum may help with the diagnosis of severe MPP in children and predicting the occurrence of complications. This study provided more theoretical basis for the early diagnosis and identification of MPP in children, and can be used as a guideline in evaluating the severity and preventing complications.",Functional changes of airway epithelial cells and mitochondria in rat models of asthenic lung and phlegm blocking combined with cough variant asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546407,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The aim of this study was to investigated the functional changes of airway epithelial cells and mitochondria in rat models of asthenic lung and phlegm blocking combined with cough variant asthma (CVA).

On the basis of the CVA rat model induced and sensitized by ovalbumin and aluminum hydroxide, the rat models with asthenic lung and phlegm blocking combined with CVA were established via smoking stimulation. The rats in the control group were injected with equivalent normal saline. All rats were sacrificed after the model was successfully prepared. The lung histopathological sections of the two groups of rats were observed, and respiratory control ratio (RCR) of mitochondria and membrane potential changes were compared. The results showed that the rats in the model group had tracheal structure abnormities, epithelial cell damages, cilia structure defects, capillary injection, alveolar exudates, and inflammatory cells compared to those in the control group. RCR of mitochondria and membrane potential of rats in the model group were significantly lower than those of rats in the control group (P<0.05).

However, no study regarding the status of M1 and M2 macrophages has been reported in knee OA. To investigate the status of M1 and M2 macrophages in knee OA, synovial fluid as well as peripheral blood were collected from 80 patients with knee OA and 80 healthy controls. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to quantitatively detect the expression of CD11c as a marker for M1 macrophages and CD206 as a marker for M2 macrophages from synovial fluids. As confirmation, flow cytometry was employed to count the number of monocytes from whole blood using the CD86 (M1) and CD163 (M2) markers on monocytes. The ratio of M1 to M2 macrophages was shown to be markedly higher in knee OA than that of control and that the ratio was significantly positively correlated with level of Kellgren-Lawrence grade in knee OA, that is, the higher the ratio the more severe the knee OA seems to be. Thus, our study presented direct evidence for the involvement of macrophages in the pathogenesis of knee OA.",TNFAIP8 promotes cell growth by regulating the Hippo pathway in epithelial ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546405,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific and disease-free survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, the exact mechanism of the biological role of TNFAIP8 in EOC remains unclear. In the present study, a siRNA specifically targeting TNFAIP8 was prepared to knock down TNFAIP8 in EOC cells. Cell growth, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution in TNFAIP8-deficient EOC cells were determined. In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated by western blot analysis and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. It was demonstrated that the knockdown of TNFAIP8 inhibited EOC cell growth and colony formation, along with increased levels of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The results of the western blot analysis suggested that TNFAIP8 inhibited the expression of phosphorylated yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) while promoting total and nuclear YAP expression, followed by the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint protein expression in EOC. Overexpression of YAP in EOC cells efficiently attenuated cell growth inhibition in TNFAIP8-deficient EOC cells. In addition, knockdown of TNFAIP8 significantly impaired EOC tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, the data from the present study suggested that TNFAIP8 is an oncogene and a novel therapeutic target for EOC."

The mRNA levels of PVT1 and microRNA-143 in the myocardial tissues of rats were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Cardiac function, levels of myocardial injury markers and inflammatory indicators were detected following PVT1 knockdown. The regulatory effect of microRNA-143 on PVT1 was assessed using a luciferase reporter gene assay and RT-qPCR analysis. The specific role of PVT1 in regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway was detected using western blot analysis. PVT1 was downregulated and microRNA-143 was upregulated in the myocardial tissues of sepsis rats. The left ventricular peak pressure was markedly decreased in the sepsis rats. By contrast, the left ventricular end diastolic pressure, levels of inflammatory indicators, myocardial injury markers and complement proteins of C5 and C5a were increased in the sepsis rats. The above changes were reversed by PVT1 knockdown or the upregulation of microRNA-143. MicroRNA-143 was confirmed as being bound to PVT1 using the luciferase reporter gene assay and RT-qPCR analysis. Upregulated PVT1 was capable of activating the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Taken together, PVT1 was upregulated in the myocardial tissues of sepsis rats, which inhibited cardiac function and promoted the secretion of inflammatory factors; and the mechanism was associated with the MAPK/NF-κB pathway.",Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate the enteropathy of food allergies in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546392,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"Food allergy prevalence has steadily increased worldwide over the past decades and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies are gaining attention. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) exhibit similar immune regulatory properties to bone marrow-derived MSCs. hUC-MCSs can be prepared with fewer ethical constraints and are potential candidates for allergic disorder therapies. The current study aimed to investigate potential antiallergic properties of hUC-MSCs in mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced food allergy. Administration of hUC-MSCs cells intraperitoneally combined with oral gavage of the culture medium significantly alleviated OVA-induced diarrhea symptoms. Additionally, this treatment significantly decreased IgE levels and the percentage of T helper 2 cells in the blood, which were increased in mice with OVA-induced food allergy. The mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and inflammatory cell infiltration in mouse colons were significantly decreased in hUC-MSCs-treated animals compared with mice with OVA-induced food allergy. Goblet cells were detected in colons of allergy-induced mice and their numbers were reduced following treatment with hUC-MSCs. In addition, treatment with hUC-MSCs reestablished the gut flora. The results revealed that hUC-MSCs may have a potential application in food allergy therapy.",Activation of astrocytes and expression of inflammatory cytokines in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546391,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"The aim of the study was to investigate and discuss the activation of astrocytes and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Twenty Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal control (n=10) and EAE group (n=10). The rats in the EAE group were injected intraperitoneally with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 emulsion, and those in the control group were injected with the equivalent volume of normal saline. Wear neurological function scale was applied to evaluate the neurological functions of the rats, and the weight changes were recorded. At 21 days after immunization, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect the histomorphology, and immunofluorescence was used to measure the activation conditions of the brain astrocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were utilized to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of inflammatory factors. The disease occurred in rats of the EAE group at 9 days after immunization, and the incidence rate was 80%. The Wear score of the rats in the EAE group was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (P<0.05). At 9 days after immunization, the weight of the rats in the EAE group was obviously lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The inflammatory lesion of rats in the EAE group mainly occurred in the region of brain parenchyma. The glial fibrillary acidic protein level in the brain sections of the rats in the EAE group was markedly elevated compared with that in control group. The mRNA and protein levels of interleukin-10 in the rat brain in EAE group were decreased notably (P<0.05), while those of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α were increased significantly (P<0.05). The significant increases in the activation level of astrocytes and inflammatory cytokine level have a close relationship with EAE progression.",Exenatide reduces oxidative stress and cell death in testis in iron overload rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546390,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2018 12 17,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been demonstrated to affect the oxidative stress status in several in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a GLP-1 analogue, exenatide, on oxidative stress parameters and apoptotic markers in testicular cells in an iron overload rat model. To obtain this model, the animals were randomly divided into three groups (n=6/group). Rats in the control group received intraperitoneal injections of saline. Intraperitoneal iron dextran (60 mg/kg/day) was given to Group FE for 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The third group (Group Fe +E) was given subcutaneous injections of 10 µg/kg exenatide in two divided doses for 4 weeks in addition to iron dextran. Testes of all rats were immediately removed for immunohistochemical staining and to measure the malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity. A significant reduction was observed in caspase-8 and -3 enzyme staining in testicular stromal and endothelial cells in exenatide injected iron overloaded rats when compared with controls. Oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities were also significantly lower in exenatide-injected rats when compared with controls. These findings indicate that exenatide may be protective against the harmful effects of iron accumulation in testis. Further studies are required to evaluate how exenatide reduces oxidative stress and cell death in iron overloaded testis tissue.",Neuroinflammation in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546389,Clinical & experimental neuroimmunology,2018 12 17,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurocognitive disorder. Although both amyloid β peptide deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the AD brain have been established as pathological hallmarks of the disease, many other factors contribute in a complex manner to the pathogenesis of AD before clinical symptoms of the disease become apparent. Longitudinal pathophysiological processes cause patients' brains to exist in a state of chronic neuroinflammation, with glial cells acting as key regulators of the neuroinflammatory state. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms of glial function underlying AD pathogenesis remain elusive. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that peripheral inflammatory conditions affect glial cells in the brain through a process of neuroimmune communication. Such disease complexities make it difficult for the pathogenesis of AD to be understood, and impede the development of effective therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Relevant AD animal models are thus likely to serve as a key resource to overcome many of these issues. Furthermore, as the pathogenesis of AD might be linked to conditions both within the brain as well as peripherally, it might become necessary for AD to be studied as a whole-body disorder. The present review aimed to summarize insights regarding current AD research, and share perspectives for understanding glial function in the context of the pathogenesis of AD.",Non-operative management of blunt hepatic and splenic injuries-practical aspects and value of radiological scoring systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546386,European surgery : ACA : Acta chirurgica Austriaca,2018 12 17,"Non-operative management (NOM) of blunt hepatic and splenic injuries has become popular in haemodynamically stable adult patients, despite uncertainty about efficacy, patient selection, and details of management.

A large proportion of variability of somatic instability is explained by expansion size and patient's age at sampling, while individual-specific differences are attributed to additional factors. The age at onset is extremely variable in DM1, and inversely correlates with the expansion size and individual-specific differences in somatic instability. Three to five percent of DM1 patients carry repeat interruptions and some appear with later age at onset than expected for corresponding expansion size. Herein, we characterized somatic instability of interrupted DMPK expansions and the effect on age at onset in our previously described patients. Repeat-primed PCR showed stable structures of different types and patterns of repeat interruptions in blood cells over time and buccal cells. Single-molecule small-pool PCR quantification of somatic instability and mathematical modeling showed that interrupted expansions were characterized by lower level of somatic instability accompanied by slower progression over time. Mathematical modeling demonstrated that individual-specific differences in somatic instability had greater influence on age at onset in patients with interrupted expansions. Therefore, repeat interruptions have clinical importance for disease course in DM1 patients due to stabilizing effect on DMPK expansions in somatic cells."

Exhausted immune cells demonstrate poor effector function and sustained expression of certain immunomodulatory receptors, which can be therapeutically targeted. CD244 is a Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM) family immunoregulatory receptor found on many immune cell types-including NK cells, a subset of T cells, DCs, and MDSCs-that represents a potential therapeutic target. Here, we discuss the role of CD244 in tumor-mediated immune cell regulation.",Non-coding RNAs Function as Immune Regulators in Teleost Fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546368,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into proteins. ncRNAs function as key regulators of gene expression and chromatin modification. Recently, the functional role of ncRNAs in teleost fish has been extensively studied. Teleost fish are a highly diverse group among the vertebrate lineage. Fish are also important in terms of aquatic ecosystem, food production and human life, being the source of animal proteins worldwide and models of biomedical research. However, teleost fish always suffer from the invasion of infectious pathogens including viruses and bacteria, which has resulted in a tremendous economic loss to the fishing industry worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that ncRNAs, especially miRNAs and lncRNAs, may serve as important regulators in cytokine and chemokine signaling, antigen presentation, complement and coagulation cascades, and T cell response in teleost fish. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and understanding of the roles of both miRNAs and lncRNAs in immune regulation in teleost fish. Molecular mechanism insights into the function of ncRNAs in fish immune response may contribute to the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of fish diseases.",Injectable Biomimetic Hydrogels as Tools for Efficient T Cell Expansion and Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546367,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 23,"Biomaterial-based scaffolds are promising tools for controlled immunomodulation. They can be applied as three dimensional (3D) culture systems in vitro, whereas in vivo they may be used to dictate cellular localization and exert spatiotemporal control over cues presented to the immune system. As such, scaffolds can be exploited to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies such as adoptive T cell transfer, in which localization and persistence of tumor-specific T cells dictates treatment outcome. Biomimetic polyisocyanopeptide (PIC) hydrogels are polymeric scaffolds with beneficial characteristics as they display reversible thermally-induced gelation at temperatures above 16°C, which allows for their minimally invasive delivery via injection. Moreover, incorporation of azide-terminated monomers introduces functional handles that can be exploited to include immune cell-modulating cues. Here, we explore the potential of synthetic PIC hydrogels to promote the in vitro expansion and in vivo local delivery of pre-activated T cells. We found that PIC hydrogels support the survival and vigorous expansion of pre-stimulated T cells in vitro even at high cell densities, highlighting their potential as 3D culture systems for efficient expansion of T cells for their adoptive transfer. In particular, the reversible thermo-sensitive behavior of the PIC scaffolds favors straightforward recovery of cells. PIC hydrogels that were injected subcutaneously gelated instantly in vivo, after which a confined 3D structure was formed that remained localized for at least 4 weeks. Importantly, we noticed no signs of inflammation, indicating that PIC hydrogels are non-immunogenic. Cells co-delivered with PIC polymers were encapsulated within the scaffold in vivo. Cells egressed gradually from the PIC gel and migrated into distant organs. This confirms that PIC hydrogels can be used to locally deliver cells within a supportive environment. These results demonstrate that PIC hydrogels are highly promising for both the in vitro expansion and in vivo delivery of pre-activated T cells. Covalent attachment of biomolecules onto azide-functionalized PIC polymers provides the opportunity to steer the phenotype, survival or functional response of the adoptively transferred cells. As such, PIC hydrogels can be used as valuable tools to improve current adoptive T cell therapy strategies.",Ginsenoside F1 Promotes Cytotoxic Activity of NK Cells via Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1-Dependent Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546365,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Ginsenosides are the principal active components of ginseng and are considered attractive candidates for combination cancer therapy because they can kill tumors and have favorable safety profiles. However, the overall benefit of ginsenosides remains unclear, particularly in cancer immunosurveillance, considering the controversial results showing repression or promotion of immune responses. Here we identify a potentiating role of ginsenoside F1 (G-F1) in cancer surveillance by natural killer (NK) cells. Among 15 different ginsenosides, G-F1 most potently enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity in response to diverse activating receptors and cancer cells. G-F1 also improved cancer surveillance in mouse models of lymphoma clearance and metastatic melanoma that rely on NK cell activity. G-F1-treated NK cells exhibited elevated cytotoxic potential such as upregulation of cytotoxic mediators and of activation signals upon stimulation. NK cell potentiation by G-F1 was antagonized by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 blockade and recapitulated by IGF-1 treatment, suggesting the involvement of IGF-1. Thus, our results suggest that G-F1 enhances NK cell function and may have chemotherapeutic potential in NK cell-based immunotherapy. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for further comprehensive studies of ginsenosides in the immune cells mediating cancer surveillance and the development of putative therapeutics.",Host Regulators of Liver Fibrosis During Human Schistosomiasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546364,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Liver fibrosis is a wound-healing process purposely aimed at restoring organ integrity after severe injury caused by autoimmune reactions, mechanical stress or infections. The uncontrolled solicitation of this process is pathogenic and a pathognomonic feature of diseases like hepatosplenic schistosomiasis where exacerbated liver fibrosis is centrally positioned among the drivers of the disease morbidity and mortality. Intriguingly, however, liver fibrosis occurs and progresses dissimilarly in schistosomiasis-diseased individuals with the same egg burden and biosocial features including age, duration of residence in the endemic site and gender. This suggests that parasite-independent and currently poorly defined host intrinsic factors might play a defining role in the regulation of liver fibrosis, the hallmark of morbidity, during schistosomiasis. In this review, we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of all known host candidate regulators of liver fibrosis reported in the context of human schistosomiasis.",Lutzomyia longipalpis Saliva Induces Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression at Bite Sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546363,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Sand flies bite mammalian hosts to obtain a blood meal, driving changes in the host inflammatory response that support the establishment of Leishmania infection. This effect is partially attributed to components of sand fly saliva, which are able to recruit and activate leukocytes. Our group has shown that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) favors Leishmania survival in infected cells by reducing inflammatory responses. Here, we show that exposure to sand fly bites is associated with induction of HO-1 in vivo. Histopathological analyses of skin specimens from human volunteers experimentally exposed to sand fly bites revealed that HO-1 and Nrf2 are produced at bite sites in the skin. These results were recapitulated in mice ears injected with a salivary gland sonicate (SGS) or exposed to sand fly bites, indicating that vector saliva may be a key factor in triggering HO-1 expression. Resident skin macrophages were the main source HO-1 at 24-48 h after bites. Additionally, assays in vivo after bites and in vitro after stimulation with saliva both demonstrated that HO-1 production by macrophages was Nrf2-dependent. Collectively, our data demonstrates that vector saliva induces early HO-1 production at the bite sites, representing a major event associated with establishment of naturally-transmitted Leishmania infections.",Neutrophil Mechanosignaling Promotes Integrin Engagement With Endothelial Cells and Motility Within Inflamed Vessels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546362,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Neutrophils are the most motile of mammalian cells, a feature that enables them to protect the host against the rapid spread of pathogens from tissue into the circulatory system. A critical process is the recruitment of neutrophils to inflamed endothelium within post-capillary venules. This occurs through cooperation between at least four families of adhesion molecules and G-protein coupled signaling receptors. These adhesion molecules convert the drag force induced by blood flow acting on the cell surface into bond tension that resists detachment. A common feature of selectin-glycoprotein tethering and integrin-ICAM bond formation is the mechanics by which force acting on these specific receptor-ligand pairs influences their longevity, strength, and topographic organization on the plasma membrane. Another distinctly mechanical aspect of neutrophil guidance is the capacity of adhesive bonds to convert external mechanical force into internal biochemical signals through the transmission of force from the outside-in at focal sites of adhesive traction on inflamed endothelium. Within this region of the plasma membrane, we denote the inflammatory synapse, Ca2+ release, and intracellular signaling provide directional cues that guide actin assembly and myosin driven motive force. This review provides an overview of how bond formation and outside-in signaling controls neutrophil recruitment and migration relative to the hydrodynamic shear force of blood flow.",CD38: A Target for Immunotherapeutic Approaches in Multiple Myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546360,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 17,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). MM represents the second most frequent hematological malignancy, accounting 1% of all cancer and 13% of hematological tumors, with ~9,000 new cases per year. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and asymptomatic smoldering MM (SMM) usually evolve to active MM in the presence of increased tumor burden, symptoms and organ damage. Despite the role of high dose chemotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation and the introduction of new treatments, the prognosis of MM patients is still poor, and novel therapeutic approaches have been tested in the last years, including new immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). CD38 is a glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic functions, which is expressed on plasma cells and other lymphoid and myeloid cell populations. Since its expression is very high and uniform on myeloma cells, CD38 is a good target for novel therapeutic strategies. Among them, immunotherapy represents a promising approach. Here, we summarized recent findings regarding CD38-targeted immunotherapy of MM in pre-clinical models and clinical trials, including (i) mAbs (daratumumab and isatuximab), (ii) radioimmunotherapy, and (iii) adoptive cell therapy, using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-transfected T cells specific for CD38.

Acute and long-term manifestation of damaged heart tissue and disturbances of cardiac performance involve virus-triggered adverse activation of the immune response and both immunopathology, as well as, autoimmunity account for such immune-destructive processes. It is a matter of ongoing debate to what extent subclinical virus infection contributes to the debilitating sequela of the acute disease. In this review, we conceptualize the many functions of the proteasome in viral myocarditis and discuss the adaptation of this multi-catalytic protease complex together with its implications on the course of disease. Inhibition of proteasome function is already highly relevant as a strategy in treating various malignancies. However, cardiotoxicity and immune-related adverse effects have proven significant hurdles, representative of the target's wide-ranging functions. Thus, we further discuss the molecular details of proteasome-mediated activity of the immune response for virus-mediated inflammatory heart disease. We summarize how the spatiotemporal flexibility of the proteasome might be tackled for therapeutic purposes aiming to mitigate virus-mediated adverse activation of the immune response in the heart.",TLR9 Signaling Suppresses the Canonical Plasma Cell Differentiation Program in Follicular B Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546358,Frontiers in immunology,2019 06 16,"The relative potency and quality of mouse B cell response to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling varies significantly depending on the B cell subset and on the TLR member being engaged. Although it has been shown that marginal zone cells respond faster than follicular (FO) splenic B cells to TLR4 stimulus, FO B cells retain full capacity to proliferate and generate plasmablasts and plasma cells (PBs/PCs) with 2-3 days delayed kinetics. It is not clear whether this scenario could be extended to other members of the TLR family. Here, using quantitative cell culture conditions optimized for B cell growth and differentiation, we show that TLR9 signaling by CpG, while promoting vigorous proliferation, completely fails to induce differentiation of FO B cells into PBs/PCs. Little or absent Ig secretion following TLR9 stimulus was accompanied by lack of expression of cell surface markers and canonical transcription factors involved in PB/PC differentiation. Moreover, not only TLR9 did not induce plasmocyte differentiation, but it also strongly inhibited the massive PB/PC differentiation of FO B cells triggered by LPS/TLR4. Our study reveals unexpected opposite roles for TLR4 and TLR9 in the control of plasma cell differentiation program and disagrees with previous conclusions obtained in high-density cultures conditions on the generation of plasmocytes by TRL9 signaling. The potential implications of these findings on the role of TLR9 in controlling self-tolerance, clonal sizes and regulation of humoral responses are discussed."

The perception that bone marrow adipocytes are ""inert space fillers"" has been broken, and currently, bone marrow fat is unanimously considered to be the third largest fat depot, after subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. Bone marrow fat (BMF) acts as a metabolically active organ and plays an active role in energy storage, endocrine function, bone metabolism, and the bone metastasis of tumors. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs), as a component of the bone marrow microenvironment, influence hematopoiesis through direct contact with cells and the secretion of adipocyte-derived factors. They also influence the progression of hematologic diseases such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia, and may be a novel target when exploring treatments for related diseases in the future.

As with other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), tUS may be useful for altering cortical excitability and neuroplasticity for a variety of research and clinical applications. The effects of tUS on cortical excitability are still unclear, and further complications arise from the wide parameter space offered by various types of devices, transducer arrangements, and stimulation protocols. Diagnostic ultrasound imaging devices are safe, commonly available systems that may be useful for tUS. However, the feasibility of modifying brain activity with diagnostic tUS is currently unknown. Objective: We aimed to examine the effects of a commercial diagnostic tUS device using an imaging protocol on cortical excitability. We hypothesized that imaging tUS applied to motor cortex could induce changes in cortical excitability as measured using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor evoked potential (MEP) paradigm. Methods: Forty-three subjects were assigned to receive either verum (n = 21) or sham (n = 22) diagnostic tUS in a single-blind design. Baseline motor cortex excitability was measured using MEPs elicited by TMS. Diagnostic tUS was subsequently administered to the same cortical area for 2 min, immediately followed by repeated post-stimulation MEPs recorded up to 16 min post-stimulation. Results: Verum tUS increased excitability in the motor cortex (from baseline) by 33.7% immediately following tUS (p = 0.009), and 32.4% (p = 0.047) 6 min later, with excitability no longer significantly different from baseline by 11 min post-stimulation. By contrast, subjects receiving sham tUS showed no significant changes in MEP amplitude. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that tUS delivered via a commercially available diagnostic imaging ultrasound system transiently increases excitability in the motor cortex as measured by MEPs. Diagnostic tUS devices are currently used for internal imaging in many health care settings, and the present results suggest that these same devices may also offer a promising tool for noninvasively modulating activity in the central nervous system. Further studies exploring the use of diagnostic imaging devices for neuromodulation are warranted.",Oculomotor Performances Are Associated With Motor and Non-motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546341,Frontiers in neurology,2018 12 17,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients exhibit deficits in oculomotor behavior, yet the results are inconsistent across studies. In addition, how these results are associated with clinical symptoms is unclear, especially in China. Methods: We designed a case-control study in China including 37 PD patients and 39 controls. Clinical manifestations in PD patients were recorded. Oculomotor performance was measured by a video-based eye tracker system. Results: We found that six oculomotor parameters, including fixation stability, saccadic latency, smooth pursuit gain, saccade frequency, viewing range, and saccade frequency during free-viewing context, were significantly different in PD patients and control group. Combining application of these six parameters could improve diagnostic accuracy to over 90%. Moreover, pursuit gain was significantly associated with PD duration, UPDRS III, in PD patients. Saccade latency was significantly associated with PD duration, Berg balance score, RBD score, and Total LEDD in PD patients. Conclusions: PD patients commonly exhibit oculomotor deficits in multiple behavioral contexts, which are associated with both motor and non-motor symptoms. Oculomotor test may provide a valuable tool for the clinical assessment of PD.",The Role of Rumination and Negative Affect in Meaning Making Following Stressful Experiences in a Japanese Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546340,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"Stressful experiences can lead to meaning making that is seen as central in adjustment. Although rumination and negative affect are important factors of meaning making, little is known about the mechanisms involved. This study aimed to examine the meaning making process, focusing on the role of intrusive and deliberate rumination and negative affect. The principal hypotheses were as follows: negative affect is positively related to threat evaluation and intrusive rumination, while regret and guilt are positively related to deliberate rumination; intrusive rumination is negatively related to finding meaning, whereas deliberate rumination is positively related to finding meaning. A total of 383 undergraduate students were asked to remember their most stressful life event and complete a questionnaire containing the Event Related Rumination Inventory and items about negative affect, threat evaluation, and finding meaning about the stressful life event. For 342 of the final sample, structural equation modeling based on the study hypotheses showed that both deliberate and intrusive rumination immediately after the event were positively associated with finding meaning. Intrusive rumination at present, however, was negatively related to finding meaning.

The valence ratings obtained with both tools strongly agree. However, the arousal ratings only agree for pleasant food items, but not for unpleasant ones. Furthermore, the results obtained with the EmojiGrid show the typical universal U-shaped relation between the mean valence and arousal that is commonly observed for a wide range of (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory) affective stimuli, while the VAS tool yields a positive linear association between valence and arousal. We hypothesized that this disagreement reflects a lack of proper understanding of the arousal concept in the VAS condition. In a second experiment we attempted to clarify the arousal concept by asking participants to rate the valence and intensity of the taste associated with the perceived food items. After this adjustment the VAS and EmojiGrid yielded similar valence and arousal ratings (both showing the universal U-shaped relation between the valence and arousal). A comparison with the results from the first experiment showed that VAS arousal ratings strongly depended on the actual wording used, while EmojiGrid ratings were not affected by the framing of the associated question. This suggests that the EmojiGrid is largely self-explaining and intuitive. To test this hypothesis, we performed a third experiment in which participants rated food images using the EmojiGrid without an associated question, and we compared the results to those of the first two experiments. The EmojiGrid ratings obtained in all three experiments closely agree. We conclude that the EmojiGrid appears to be a valid and intuitive affective self-report tool that does not rely on written instructions and that can efficiently be used to measure food-related emotions.",Meaningful Memory? Eighteen-Month-Olds Only Remember Cartoons With a Meaningful Storyline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546338,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"In two studies we investigated the importance of a storyline for remembering cartoons across a delay of 2 weeks in 18-month-old infants by means of the visual paired-comparison (VPC) paradigm. In Study 1 seventy-one 18-month-olds were tested using similar cartoons as in a recent study from our lab while varying the richness of the storyline information. In a VPC task half of the infants watched uncompromised versions of the cartoons used in the recent study (Storyline Condition), whereas the other half watched Pixelized versions of the cartoons (number of pixels reduced by 98% covering up the narrative, but leaving perceptual details, e.g., colors, movements, the same, and Pixelized Condition). Two weeks later they were presented with the familiar cartoon and a novel cartoon from the same version (Storyline or Pixelized) simultaneously, while being eye-tracked. Results showed that only the infants in the Storyline Condition remembered the target cartoon, thus suggesting that the storyline is important for memory. However, an alternative interpretation of the results could be that what made the infants in the Storyline Condition remember the target cartoon was not the storyline, but the static conceptual information of the objects and agents present in the cartoon (which was not visible in the Pixelized version). To test this possibility, a control study was created. In Study 2 thirty-six infants were therefore presented with a version of the cartoon in which we broke down the temporal presentation into 1 s segments and presented these out of order. This was done to preserve the static conceptual information (e.g., objects and agents) while still disturbing the storyline. Results showed that the infants in this condition still did not remember the target cartoon, suggesting that the meaningfulness of the storyline - and not only static conceptual information - is important for later memory.",Combining Song-And Speech-Based Language Teaching: An Intervention With Recently Migrated Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546337,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"There is growing evidence that singing can have a positive effect on language learning, but few studies have explored its benefit for children who have recently migrated to a new country. In the present study, recently migrated children (N = 35) received three 40-min sessions where all students learnt the lyrics of two songs designed to simulate language learning through alternating teaching modalities (singing and speaking). Children improved their language knowledge significantly including on tasks targeting the transfer of grammatical skills, an area largely neglected in previous studies. This improvement was sustainable over the retention interval. However, the two teaching modalities did not show differential effects on cued recall of song lyrics indicating that singing and speaking are equally effective when used in combination with one another. Taken together, the data suggest that singing may be useful as an additional teaching strategy, irrespective of initial language proficiency, warranting more research on songs as a supplement for grammar instruction.",Domestic Violence Between Childhood Incest and Re-victimization: A Study Among Anti-violence Centers in Italy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546336,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"The study focuses on a specific problem in the area of child sexual abuse (CSA), which is still under-researched: the relationship between incest and adult female re-victimization treatment within the ambit of domestic violence in Italian centers. About 112 anti-violence centers were contacted, but only 13 participated and only 16 psychologists were interviewed to reconstruct the biographies of 32 victims. The study aimed to examine if and how the service centers recognized and dealt with the problem of re-victimization among survivors based on psychologists' narrations. Findings showed that the description of perpetrators revealed not only sexual abuse was perpetrated, but also psychological and physical abuse. About half of mothers did not come to their daughters' aid and those who cooperated with the abusers had mostly suffered from CSA at a time in their life. Only three mothers did help their daughters in contacting the anti-violence centers. However, most of the service centers were not concerned with the relationship between incest and domestic re-victimization, while those who considered the problem, dealt with it only on the practitioner-patient level. In addition, despite the psychologists used professional and empathetic language, they disclosed their high emotional involvement and a genuine bewilderment. A discussion on the need to standardize the psychotherapeutic support given to these re-victimized women was presented, with a critique to the un-discriminated de-pathologization approach adopted by almost all anti-violence centers. In particular, we wanted to underline the fact that, although, this approach is useful in treating victims who were not abused during infancy, it could be insufficient for women who suffered from incest.",Work and Organizational Psychology Looks at the Fourth Industrial Revolution: How to Support Workers and Organizations?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546335,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"With rapid advances in technology in several fields of human life, we are entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR), which is changing the way businesses create value, people do their work and individuals interact and communicate with each other. In this framework, many questions have arisen about how these transformations affect workers, organizations and societies, and Work and Organizational Psychology (WOP) has been called upon to address some of these open issues. In particular, this article focuses on two aspects of the FIR. The first considers the expansion of automation in the workplace and raises questions such as: how is the relationship between workers and technology changing? How is it affecting people's well-being? How can we expect it to affect employment and equality in the future? The second is related to how job transformation will influence requirements for knowledge and skills; the main question is: which competence profile, considering hard and soft skills, is required and expected in the work of the future? The aim of the present paper is to improve the understanding of some of the major issues that workers and organizations are, or will be, asked to face, by providing information that will be useful to facilitate debate, research and interventions. In the conclusion section, research, and practical implications at organizational, political and institutional levels are discussed.",Effects of Reading Proficiency and of Base and Whole-Word Frequency on Reading Noun- and Verb-Derived Words: An Eye-Tracking Study in Italian Primary School Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546334,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 17,"The aim of this study is to assess the role of readers' proficiency and of the base-word distributional properties on eye-movement behavior. Sixty-two typically developing children, attending 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, were asked to read derived words in a sentence context. Target words were nouns derived from noun bases (e.g., umorista, 'humorist'), which in Italian are shared by few derived words, and nouns derived from verb bases (e.g., punizione, 'punishment'), which are shared by about 50 different inflected forms and several derived words. Data shows that base and word frequency affected first-fixation duration for nouns derived from noun bases, but in an opposite way: base frequency had a facilitative effect on first fixation, whereas word frequency exerted an inhibitory effect. These results were interpreted as a competition between early accessed base words (e.g., camino, chimney) and target words (e.g., caminetto, fireplace). For nouns derived from verb bases, an inhibitory base frequency effect but no word frequency effect was observed. These results suggest that syntactic context, calling for a noun in the target position, lead to an inhibitory effect when a verb base was detected, and made it difficult for readers to access the corresponding base+suffix combination (whole word) in the very early processing phases. Gaze duration was mainly affected by word frequency and length: for nouns derived from noun bases, this interaction was modulated by proficiency, as length effect was stronger for less proficient readers, while they were processing low-frequency words. For nouns derived from verb bases, though, all children, irrespective of their reading ability, showed sensitivity to the interaction within frequency of base+suffix combination (word frequency) and target length. Results of this study are consistent with those of other Italian studies that contrasted noun and verb processing, and confirm that distributional properties of morphemic constituents have a significant impact on the strategies used for processing morphologically complex words."

The PA was assessed by the ""Physical Activity Questionnaire - Children"" and CRF was assessed by the Maximal multistage a 20 m shuttle run test. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumferences (WC), and waist to height ratio (WHtR) were considered as obesity indices. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to explore correlates of CRF. The results obtained showed the prevalence of general overweight and obesity was 25.5% in our sample which was lower than that in the regional estimate (e.g., ∼28%) for Eastern Europe. Among all participants, CRF was associated with male sex, older age, a lower WC percentile, higher WHtR, and higher level of PA. The model accounted for 24% of the variance. CRF was associated with older age and higher level of PA among girls and boys. Lower WC percentile was a significant determinant of CRF among boys. In conclusion, general overweight/obesity was not independently associated with CRF. Those with better CRF were more likely to be male and older, had a higher level of PA and lower central adiposity. These findings emphasize the importance of supporting school age children to take a part in programmed physical activity regardless of their body composition.",Interlimb Asymmetries Identified Using the Rate of Torque Development in Ballistic Contraction Targeting Submaximal Torques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546321,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Evaluating the rate of torque development (RTD) in isometric ballistic contraction targeting submaximal torques is usually overlooked in the literature. In a series of isometric ballistic contractions targeting a range of submaximal torque values, there is a linear relationship between the peak torque and the peak RTD obtained in each contraction. RTD scaling factor (RTD-SF) represents the slope of this relationship. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of interlimb asymmetry in the RTD-SF and in the RTD calculated across submaximal torques. Furthermore, we compared these asymmetry indices with those calculated adopting more classical approaches, such as ballistic contraction targeting maximal torque and isokinetic concentric conditions. Quadriceps and hamstrings strength was evaluated in both limbs of elite under 17 and under 19 soccer players (20 males, 17 ± 1 years). Participants performed three concentric isokinetic contractions at 240°/s and a series of isometric ballistic contractions targeting from 20 to 100% of maximal isometric torque. The interlimb difference was calculated for each parameter and players presenting an interlimb difference >15% were identified. A total of 40% (for quadriceps) and 60% (for hamstring) of players showed an interlimb asymmetry in isometric RTD for at least 50% of submaximal torque range. The RTD-SF was able to identify more players with asymmetry than the classical isokinetic tests. However, isokinetic and isometric indices of asymmetry were in general poorly or not correlated with each other. Most players presented an interlimb asymmetry in RTD for a wide part of the torque range and the adopted protocol was able to highlight important interindividual differences. Furthermore, players showed a large prevalence of RTD-SF asymmetry in both quadriceps and hamstrings. It is still to be determined if these asymmetries are functionally relevant. Nevertheless, the adopted protocol provided meaningful information for identifying interlimb asymmetries that could not be gathered when adopting the classical method of ballistic contractions targeting only maximal torques.",Left Ventricular Structure and Function in Elite Swimmers and Runners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546320,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Sport-specific differences in the left ventricle (LV) of land-based athletes have been observed; however, comparisons to water-based athletes are sparse. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in LV structure and function in elite swimmers and runners. Sixteen elite swimmers [23 (2) years, 81% male, 69% white] and 16 age, sex, and race matched elite runners participated in the study. All athletes underwent resting echocardiography and indices of LV dimension, global LV systolic and diastolic function, and LV mechanics were determined. All results are presented as swimmers vs. runners. Early diastolic function was lower in swimmers including peak early transmitral filling velocity [76 (13) vs. 87 (11) cm ⋅ s-1, p = 0.02], mean mitral annular peak early velocity [16 (2) vs. 18 (2) cm ⋅ s-1, p = 0.01], and the ratio of peak early to late transmitral filling velocity [2.68 (0.59) vs. 3.29 (0.72), p = 0.005]. The diastolic mechanics index of time to peak untwisting rate also occurred later in diastole in swimmers [12 (10)% diastole vs. 5 (4)% diastole, p = 0.01]. Cardiac output was larger in swimmers [5.8 (1.5) vs. 4.7 (1.2) L ⋅ min-1, p = 0.04], which was attributed to their higher heart rates [56 (6) vs. 49 (6) bpm, p < 0.001] given stroke volumes were similar between groups. All other indices of LV systolic function and dimensions were similar between groups. Our findings suggest enhanced early diastolic function in elite runners relative to swimmers, which may be attributed to faster LV untwisting.",Neurovascular Coupling Remains Intact During Incremental Ascent to High Altitude (4240 m) in Acclimatized Healthy Volunteers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546319,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the temporal link between neuronal metabolic activity and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), supporting adequate delivery of nutrients. Exposure to high altitude (HA) imposes several stressors, including hypoxia and hypocapnia, which modulate cerebrovascular tone in an antagonistic fashion. Whether these contrasting stressors and subsequent adaptations affect NVC during incremental ascent to HA is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether incremental ascent to HA influences the NVC response. Given that CBF is sensitive to changes in arterial blood gasses, in particular PaCO2, we hypothesized that the vasoconstrictive effect of hypocapnia during ascent would decrease the NVC response. 10 healthy study participants (21.7 ± 1.3 years, 23.57 ± 2.00 kg/m2, mean ± SD) were recruited as part of a research expedition to HA in the Nepal Himalaya. Resting posterior cerebral artery velocity (PCAv), arterial blood gasses (PaO2, SaO2, PaCO2, [HCO3-], base excess and arterial blood pH) and NVC response of the PCA were measured at four pre-determined locations: Calgary/Kathmandu (1045/1400 m, control), Namche (3440 m), Deboche (3820 m) and Pheriche (4240 m). PCAv was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Arterial blood draws were taken from the radial artery and analyzed using a portable blood gas/electrolyte analyzer. NVC was determined in response to visual stimulation (VS; Strobe light; 6 Hz; 30 s on/off × 3 trials). The NVC response was averaged across three VS trials at each location. PaO2, SaO2, and PaCO2 were each significantly decreased at 3440, 3820, and 4240 m. No significant differences were found for pH at HA (P > 0.05) due to significant reductions in [HCO3-] (P < 0.043). As expected, incremental ascent to HA induced a state of hypoxic hypocapnia, whereas normal arterial pH was maintained due to renal compensation. NVC was quantified as the delta (Δ) PCAv from baseline for mean PCAv, peak PCAv and total area under the curve (ΔPCAv tAUC) during VS. No significant differences were found for Δmean, Δpeak or ΔPCAv tAUC between locations (P > 0.05). NVC remains remarkably intact during incremental ascent to HA in healthy acclimatized individuals. Despite the array of superimposed stressors associated with ascent to HA, CBF and NVC regulation may be preserved coincident with arterial pH maintenance during acclimatization.",The Possible Effects of High Vessel Traffic on the Physiological Parameters of the Critically Endangered Yangtze Finless Porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis ssp. asiaeorientalis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546317,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Background: Poyang is the largest freshwater lake in China, where the acoustic environment and space for the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoises (YFPs) has been altered by heavy vessel traffic and dredging activities. The density of vessel and the rate of dredging increases annually, especially in the area with the highest density of YFPs. The heavy vessel traffic can cause an increase in the physical activities and direct physical injuries to the YFPs. Furthermore, noise is a potent stressor to all cetaceans irrespective of age and can compromise all their physiological functions. The objective of this study was to examine the possible effects of heavy vessel traffic and dredging on the biochemistry, hematology, adrenal, thyroid, and reproductive hormones of two different YFP populations. One population was living in Poyang Lake and the second living in the Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow which is a semi-natural resserve. Results: The results showed statistically significantly higher levels of serum cortisol, fT3, fT4, and lowered testosterone in both adult and juvenile YFPs living in Poyang Lake vs. adult YFPs living in the Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow. The serum biochemical parameters (Aspartate Amino Transferase, Alkaline Phosphatase, High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, Globulin, Uric acid, Glucose, K+, and Amylase) and the hematology parameters (Red Blood Cells, Hematocrit, Mean Corpuscular Volume, White Blood Cells, and Eosinophils) were statistically significantly higher in the adult Poyang Lake YFPs vs. adult Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow YFPs. On the other hand, adult males of the Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow also showed significantly higher levels of the serum biochemical parameters (Total Cholesterol, Light Density Lipoprotein cholesterol, Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, Lactate Dehydrogenase, CO2, and Na+) and the blood parameters (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration). In Poyang Lake YFPs, various parameters showed significantly positive (fT4, amylase, neutrophil, Ca+2) or negative (total protein, lymphocyte) correlations with cortisol levels. Conclusions: The hyperactivity of adrenal glands in response to heavy vessel traffic and dredging resulted in significantly elevated cortisol levels in Poyang Lake YFPs. The higher cortisol level could possibly have affected various hormonal, hematological, and biochemical parameters, and ultimately the YFPs physiology.",Gene Regulatory Network Modeling of Macrophage Differentiation Corroborates the Continuum Hypothesis of Polarization States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546316,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 23,"Macrophages derived from monocyte precursors undergo specific polarization processes which are influenced by the local tissue environment: classically activated (M1) macrophages, with a pro-inflammatory activity and a role of effector cells in Th1 cellular immune responses, and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, with anti-inflammatory functions and involved in immunosuppression and tissue repair. At least three different subsets of M2 macrophages, namely, M2a, M2b, and M2c, are characterized in the literature based on their eliciting signals. The activation and polarization of macrophages is achieved through many, often intertwined, signaling pathways. To describe the logical relationships among the genes involved in macrophage polarization, we used a computational modeling methodology, namely, logical (Boolean) modeling of gene regulation. We integrated experimental data and knowledge available in the literature to construct a logical network model for the gene regulation driving macrophage polarization to the M1, M2a, M2b, and M2c phenotypes. Using the software GINsim and BoolNet, we analyzed the network dynamics under different conditions and perturbations to understand how they affect cell polarization. Dynamic simulations of the network model, enacting the most relevant biological conditions, showed coherence with the observed behavior of in vivo macrophages. The model could correctly reproduce the polarization toward the four main phenotypes as well as to several hybrid phenotypes, which are known to be experimentally associated to physiological and pathological conditions. We surmise that shifts among different phenotypes in the model mimic the hypothetical continuum of macrophage polarization, with M1 and M2 being the extremes of an uninterrupted sequence of states. Furthermore, model simulations suggest that anti-inflammatory macrophages are resilient to shift back to the pro-inflammatory phenotype.","Changes of Intracellular Porphyrin, Reactive Oxygen Species, and Fatty Acids Profiles During Inactivation of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus by Antimicrobial Blue Light.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546315,Frontiers in physiology,2019 01 09,"Antimicrobial blue light (aBL) has attracted increasing interest for its antimicrobial properties. However, the underlying bactericidal mechanism has not yet been verified. One hypothesis is that aBL causes the excitation of intracellular chromophores; leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the resultant oxidization of various biomolecules. Thus, monitoring the levels of redox-sensitive intracellular biomolecules such as coproporphyrins, as well as singlet oxygen and various ROS may help to uncover the physiological changes induced by aBL and aid in establishing the underlying mechanism of action. Furthermore, the identification of novel targets of ROS, such as fatty acids, is of potential significance from a therapeutic perspective. In this study, we sought to investigate the molecular impact of aBL treatment on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The results showed that aBL (5-80 J/cm2) exhibited a bactericidal effect on MRSA, and almost no bacteria survived when 80 J/cm2 had been delivered. Further studies revealed that the concentrations of certain intracellular molecules varied in response to aBL irradiation. Coproporphyrin levels were found to decrease gradually, while ROS levels increased rapidly. Moreover, imaging revealed the emergence and increase of singlet oxygen molecules. Concomitantly, the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) increased in abundance and intracellular K+ leakage was observed, indicating permeability of the cell membrane. Atomic force microscopy showed that the cell surface exhibited a coarse appearance. Finally, fatty acid profiles at different illumination levels were monitored by GC-MS. The relative amounts of three unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C20:1, and C20:4) were decreased in response to aBL irradiation, which likely played a key role in the aforementioned membrane injuries. Collectively, these data suggest that the cell membrane is a major target of ROS during aBL irradiation, causing alterations to membrane lipid profiles, and in particular to the unsaturated fatty acid component.","Indoxyl Sulfate Promotes Arterial Thrombosis in Rat Model via Increased Levels of Complex TF/VII, PAI-1, Platelet Activation as Well as Decreased Contents of SIRT1 and SIRT3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546314,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a 20-fold higher risk of dying due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), primarily thrombosis following vascular injury. CKD is connected with retention of uremic toxins, especially indoxyl sulfate (IS), which are currently considered as a non-classical CKD-specific risk factor for CVDs. The present study aimed to examine the effect of chronic exposure to IS on the hemostatic system and arterial thrombosis in a model without greater interferences from the uremic milieu consisting of additional uremic toxins. Forty-eight male Wistar Crl:WI (cmdb) rats were divided into three groups: one control group and two experimental groups, which were exposed to 100 or 200 mg/kg of b.w./day of IS in drinking water for a period of 28 days. The control group received water without IS. At the end of the experiment, the induction of arterial thrombosis was performed. We investigated the impact of IS on thrombosis incidence, kinetics and strength of clot formation, platelet activity, aortic contents of sirtuin (SIRT) 1 and sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), hemostatic system, cardiorespiratory parameters, biochemistry of plasma and urine as well as histology of the thrombus, kidney, and liver. Obtained data revealed that chronic exposure to IS promotes arterial thrombosis via increased levels of complex tissue factor/factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), platelet activation, as well as decreased aortic levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3. Therefore, we hypothesize that IS enhances primary hemostasis leading to augmented formation of platelet plug with increased amounts of fibrin and affects secondary hemostasis through the influence on plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis factors, which results in the increased kinetics and strength of clot formation. The findings described may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to increased thrombotic events in patients with CKD with elevated levels of IS.",The Female Heart: Sex Differences in the Dynamics of ECG in Response to Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546313,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 17,"Sex differences in the study of the human physiological response to mental stress are often erroneously ignored. To this end, we set out to show that our understanding of the stress response is fundamentally altered once sex differences are taken into account. This is achieved by comparing the heart rate variability (HRV) signals acquired during mental maths tests from ten females and ten males of similar maths ability; all females were in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. For rigor, the HRV signals from this pilot study were analyzed using temporal, spectral and nonlinear signal processing techniques, which all revealed significant statistical differences between the sexes, with the stress-induced increases in the heart rates from the males being significantly larger than those from the females (p-value = 4.4 × 10-4). In addition, mental stress produced an overall increase in the power of the low frequency component of HRV in the males, but caused an overall decrease in the females. The stress-induced changes in the power of the high frequency component were even more profound; it greatly decreased in the males, but increased in the females. We also show that mental stress was followed by the expected decrease in sample entropy, a nonlinear measure of signal regularity, computed from the males' HRV signals, while overall, stress manifested in an increase in the sample entropy computed from the females' HRV signals. This finding is significant, since mental stress is commonly understood to be manifested in the decreased entropy of HRV signals. The significant difference (p-value = 2.1 × 10-9) between the changes in the entropies from the males and females highlights the pitfalls in ignoring sex in the formation of a physiological hypothesis. Furthermore, it has been argued that estrogen attenuates the effect of catecholamine stress hormones; the findings from this investigation suggest for the first time that the conventionally cited cardiac changes, attributed to the fight-or-flight stress response, are not universally applicable to females. Instead, this pilot study provides an alternative interpretation of cardiac responses to stress in females, which indicates a closer alignment to the evolutionary tend-and-befriend response.",Topiramate and Metformin Are Effective Add-On Treatments in Controlling Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546312,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018 12 17,"Background: Antipsychotic drugs may lead to side effects such as obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. The current systematic review and network meta-analysis analyzes and provides an update on the clinical performance of these add-ons in comparison to placebo on body weight and body mass index (BMI) reductions. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on electronic databases: PubMed (1946-), Embase (1974-), Cochrane library (1992-), and OpenGrey (2000-) until 31 July 2018. Network meta-analyses, comparing the body weight change, BMI change and withdrawn due to adverse events of different pharmacological add-ons, was performed using a multivariate meta-regression model with random-effects, adopting a frequentist approach. To rank the prognosis for all add-ons, we used surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values. Outcomes: From 614 potential studies identified, 27 eligible studies (n = 1,349 subjects) were included. All the studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias. For the analysis of body weight change, all add-ons except Ranitidine showed significant weight reductions comparing to placebo. The effectiveness rank based on SUCRA results from highest to lowest was Sibutramine, Topiramate, Metformin, Reboxetine, Ranitidine, and placebo. A similar pattern was seen for BMI change. The analysis of safety outcome did not detect significantly increased withdrawn number from the add-ons. Current evidence showed relatively good tolerance and safety of using the pharmacological add-ons. Interpretation: Topiramate and Metformin are effective add-on treatments in controlling antipsychotic-induced weight gain, comparing to placebo. They are well tolerated in short-term period. Although Sibutramine has the highest rank of the effectiveness, its license has been withdrawn in many countries due to its adverse effects. Hence, Sibutramine should not be adopted to treat antipsychotic-induced weight gain."

In this study (N = 377), we used a modified Cambridge gambling task to test the effect of rs1049353 polymorphism on how much people bet. We found that participants who are homozygous for C allele placed significantly larger bets than C/T carriers [F(1,371) = 7.805, P = 0.005]. We further studied the gene expression map in human brains and found that the CNR1 gene is overexpressed in striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus. These brain structures are known to underpin reward and risk processing. Our findings suggest that, to some extent, high-level social decision-making even like bet-placing could be influenced by a single genetic locus variation in healthy volunteers. In addition, such effects were likely to be mediated by key brain regions in the reward- and risk-processing networks.",Sugar Intake Elicits Intelligent Searching Behavior in Flies and Honey Bees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546299,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 17,"We present a comparison of the sugar-elicited search behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. In both species, intake of sugar-water elicits a complex of searching responses. The most obvious response was an increase in turning frequency. However, we also found that flies and honey bees returned to the location of the sugar drop. They even returned to the food location when we prevented them from using visual and chemosensory cues. Analyses of the recorded trajectories indicated that flies and bees use two mechanisms, a locomotor pattern involving an increased turning frequency and path integration to increase the probability to stay close or even return to the sugar drop location. However, evidence for the use of path integration in honey bees was less clear. In general, walking trajectories of honey bees showed a higher degree of curvature and were more spacious; two characters which likely masked evidence for the use of path integration in our experiments. Visual cues, i.e., a black dot, presented underneath the sugar drop made flies and honey bees stay closer to the starting point of the search. In honey bees, vertical black columns close to the sugar drop increased the probability to visit similar cues in the vicinity. An additional one trial learning experiment suggested that the intake of sugar-water likely has the potential to initiate an associative learning process. Together, our experiments indicate that the sugar-elicited local search is more complex than previously assumed. Most importantly, this local search behavior appeared to exhibit major behavioral capabilities of large-scale navigation. Thus, we propose that sugar-elicited search behavior has the potential to become a fruitful behavioral paradigm to identify neural and molecular mechanisms involved in general mechanisms of navigation.",Neuronal Constituents and Putative Interactions Within the Drosophila Ellipsoid Body Neuropil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546298,Frontiers in neural circuits,2019 05 08,"The central complex (CX) is a midline-situated collection of neuropil compartments in the arthropod central brain, implicated in higher-order processes such as goal-directed navigation. Here, we provide a systematic genetic-neuroanatomical analysis of the ellipsoid body (EB), a compartment which represents a major afferent portal of the Drosophila CX. The neuropil volume of the EB, along with its prominent input compartment, called the bulb, is subdivided into precisely tessellated domains, distinguishable based on intensity of the global marker DN-cadherin. EB tangential elements (so-called ring neurons), most of which are derived from the DALv2 neuroblast lineage, predominantly interconnect the bulb and EB domains in a topographically organized fashion. Using the DN-cadherin domains as a framework, we first characterized this connectivity by Gal4 driver lines expressed in different DALv2 ring neuron (R-neuron) subclasses. We identified 11 subclasses, 6 of which correspond to previously described projection patterns, and 5 novel patterns. These subclasses both spatially (based on EB innervation pattern) and numerically (cell counts) summate to the total EB volume and R-neuron cell number, suggesting that our compilation of R-neuron subclasses approaches completion. EB columnar elements, as well as non-DALv2 derived extrinsic ring neurons (ExR-neurons), were also incorporated into this anatomical framework. Finally, we addressed the connectivity between R-neurons and their targets, using the anterograde trans-synaptic labeling method, trans-Tango. This study demonstrates putative interactions of R-neuron subclasses and reveals general principles of information flow within the EB network. Our work will facilitate the generation and testing of hypotheses regarding circuit interactions within the EB and the rest of the CX.",Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Role in Cannabinoid-Mediated Neurogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546297,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2018 12 17,"The adult mammalian brain can produce new neurons in a process called adult neurogenesis, which occurs mainly in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and cannabinoid type 1 and 2 receptors (CB1R and CB2R) have been shown to independently modulate neurogenesis, but how they may interact is unknown. We now used SVZ and DG neurosphere cultures from early (P1-3) postnatal rats to study the CB1R and CB2R crosstalk with BDNF in modulating neurogenesis. BDNF promoted an increase in SVZ and DG stemness and cell proliferation, an effect blocked by a CB2R selective antagonist. CB2R selective activation promoted an increase in DG multipotency, which was inhibited by the presence of a BDNF scavenger. CB1R activation induced an increase in SVZ and DG cell proliferation, being both effects dependent on BDNF. Furthermore, SVZ and DG neuronal differentiation was facilitated by CB1R and/or CB2R activation and this effect was blocked by sequestering endogenous BDNF. Conversely, BDNF promoted neuronal differentiation, an effect abrogated in SVZ cells by CB1R or CB2R blockade while in DG cells was inhibited by CB2R blockade. We conclude that endogenous BDNF is crucial for the cannabinoid-mediated effects on SVZ and DG neurogenesis. On the other hand, cannabinoid receptor signaling is also determinant for BDNF actions upon neurogenesis. These findings provide support for an interaction between BDNF and endocannabinoid signaling to control neurogenesis at distinct levels, further contributing to highlight novel mechanisms in the emerging field of brain repair.",Ca2+-Sensor Neurocalcin δ and Hormone ANF Modulate ANF-RGC Activity by Diverse Pathways: Role of the Signaling Helix Domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546296,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Prototype member of the membrane guanylate cyclase family, ANF-RGC (Atrial Natriuretic Factor Receptor Guanylate Cyclase), is the physiological signal transducer of two most hypotensive hormones ANF and BNP, and of the intracellular free Ca2+. Both the hormonal and the Ca2+-modulated signals operate through a common second messenger, cyclic GMP; yet, their operational modes are divergent. The hormonal pathways originate at the extracellular domain of the guanylate cyclase; and through a cascade of structural changes in its successive domains activate the C-terminal catalytic domain (CCD). In contrast, the Ca2+ signal operating via its sensor, myristoylated neurocalcin δ both originates and is translated directly at the CCD. Through a detailed sequential deletion and expression analyses, the present study examines the role of the signaling helix domain (SHD) in these two transduction pathways. SHD is a conserved 35-amino acid helical region of the guanylate cyclase, composed of five heptads, each meant to tune and transmit the hormonal signals to the CCD for their translation and generation of cyclic GMP. Its structure is homo-dimeric and the molecular docking analyses point out to the possibility of antiparallel arrangement of the helices. Contrary to the hormonal signaling, SHD has no role in regulation of the Ca2+- modulated pathway. The findings establish and define in molecular terms the presence of two distinct non-overlapping transduction modes of ANF-RGC, and for the first time demonstrate how differently they operate, and, yet generate cyclic GMP utilizing common CCD machinery.",Downregulation of Neuronal and Dendritic Connexin36-Made Electrical Synapses Without Glutamatergic Axon Terminals in Spinal Anterior Horn Cells From the Early Stage of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546295,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Connexin36 (Cx36) forms gap junctions between neurons, which are called electrical synapses, enabling adjacent neurons to communicate directly. The participation of chemical synapses in neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has long been indicated, but it remains unclear whether electrical synapses are involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. We performed extensive immunopathological analyses using mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice and their littermates to investigate whether Cx36-made electrical synapses are affected in motor neuron diseases. We found that in the lamina IX of the lumbar spinal cord from wild type mice, about half of the Cx36 puncta existed independently of chemical synapse markers, while the rest coexisted with chemical synapse markers, such as vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is a glutamatergic axon terminal marker, and/or glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), which is a GABAergic axon terminal marker. Cx36 single or Cx36/GAD65 double positive puncta, but not VGLUT1-containing puncta, were preferentially decreased on neuronal and dendritic surfaces of the anterior horn cells in the early stage of SOD1G93A ALS mice. Moreover, in five human autopsied sporadic ALS cases with bulbar or upper limb onset, Cx36 immunoreactivity was diminished in the proximal dendrites and neuropils of well-preserved large motor neurons in the lumbar anterior horns. These findings suggest that downregulation of neuronal and dendritic Cx36 in the spinal anterior horns commonly occurs from the early stage of hereditary and sporadic ALS. Cx36-made electrical synapses without glutamatergic signaling appear to be more vulnerable than other chemical synapses and electrical synapses with glutamatergic signaling in the early stage of motor neuron degeneration, suggesting involvement of Cx36-made electrical synapses in the pathogenesis of human ALS.",Decreased Intrinsic Functional Connectivity of the Salience Network in Drug-Naïve Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546294,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have difficulty in switching between obsessive thought and compulsive behavior, which may be related to the dysfunction of the salience network (SN). However, little is known about the changes in intra- and inter- intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the SN in patients with OCD. In this study, we parceled the SN into 19 subregions and investigated iFC changes for each of these subregions in 40 drug-naïve patients with OCD and 40 healthy controls (HCs) using seed-based functional connectivity resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We found that patients with OCD exhibited decreased iFC strength between subregions of the SN, as well as decreased inter-network connectivity between SN and DMN, and ECN. These findings highlight a specific alteration in iFC patterns associated with SN in patients with OCD and provide new insights into the dysfunctional brain organization of the SN in patients with OCD.","Bidirectional Cause-Effect Relationship Between Urinary Interleukin-6 and Mood, Irritation, and Mental Activity in a Breast Cancer Survivor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546293,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 17,"This ""integrative single-case study"" investigated the bidirectional cause and effect relations between various emotional states (i.e., mood, irritation, mental activity) and urinary IL-6 levels in a 49-year-old female breast cancer survivor (woman) under conditions of ""life as it is lived."" During a period of 28 days, the patient collected her entire urine in 12-h intervals for IL-6 measurement and completed each morning and evening a list of adjectives regarding mood, irritation, and mental activity (55 measurements in total). Autoregressive integrated moving average modeling revealed a 4-day (circasemiseptan) cycle in the IL-6 time series. Furthermore, cross-correlational analyses after controlling for serial dependencies (significance level: p < 0.05) showed that worsening in mood and increases in irritation were followed by increases in urinary IL-6 levels with temporal delays between 12 and 36 h. In the opposite direction of effect, increases in urinary IL-6 levels were followed by elevations in mood and mental activity as well as decreases in irritation with temporal delays between 48 and 72 h. These results from cross-correlational analyses suggest that IL-6 may have a regulatory function in psychoneuroimmunological interplay and that, under certain conditions, IL-6 may be involved in health rather than sickness behavior. Moreover, the findings of this study are indicators of real-life negative feedback loops and are in line with psychoneuroimmunological research postulating complex brain-to-body-to-brain network-like structures.",Heritability and genetic architecture of reproduction-related traits in a temperate oak species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546292,Tree genetics & genomes,2018 12 17,"Reproduction, one of the main components of plant fitness, is highly variable in response to environmental cues, but little is known about the genetic determinism underlying reproduction-related traits in forest tree species. There is therefore an urgent need to characterize the genetic architecture of those traits if we are to predict the evolutionary trajectories of forest populations facing rapidly changing environment and mitigate their impacts. Using a full-sib family of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), we investigated the within population variability of seed production and mean seed mass during four consecutive years. Reproductive traits were highly variable between trees and between years. The high narrow sense heritability and evolvability estimated underline the important genetic effect on the variability in seed production and mean seed mass. Despite a large variability over years, reproductive traits show significant genetic correlation between years. Furthermore, for the first time in forest tree species, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed production and mean mass of a seed have been identified. While it is commonly assumed and observed that fitness-traits have low narrow sense heritabilities, our findings show that reproduction-related traits may undergo evolutionary changes under selective pressure and may be determinant for tree adaptation.",InteractiveXRDFit: a new tool to simulate and fit X-ray diffractograms of oxide thin films and heterostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546291,Journal of applied crystallography,2018 12 17,InteractiveXRDFit is a custom-made MATLAB program that calculates the X-ray diffracted intensity for oxide thin films and heterostructures based on a library of inorganic materials.

As it may cause rapid progression to end-stage liver disease even in early infancy, a high index of suspicion is required to prevent fatal outcomes. We describe the case of a 3-month-old boy with progressive cholestatic hepatitis and severe hepatic fibrosis. After excluding other etiologies for his early liver failure, we found that he had profuse urinary excretion of 3β-monohydroxy-Δ5-bile acid derivatives by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis with dried urine spots on filter paper. He was confirmed to have a compound heterozygous mutation (p.Arg388Ter and p.Tyr469IlefsX5) of the CYP7B1 gene. After undergoing liver transplantation (LT) from his mother at 4 months of age, his deteriorated liver function completely normalized, and he had normal growth and development until the current follow-up at 33 months of age.

It starts with an overview of regulatory science and briefly summarizes principles of BARS and key pillars of MERSC. Subsequently, the BARS/MERSC system is used to evaluate the linear nonthreshold (LNT) process used in cancer assessments and the similar process used for evaluating in particulate matter (PM) exposure. The study identifies 3 parts in dose-response curves, where the first part is reproducible science and the second part includes uncertainties and often requires the application of precautionary principle. The primary reason for disagreements on LNT and PM is a lack of recognition that the third part is based on desire of regulators to be protective, a policy decision process. Two PM epidemiological examples are included in this study to demonstrate the point. The regulatory process would benefit from recognizing the distinction between science and policy and excluding policy from regulatory science. Furthermore, the society would greatly benefit from increased transparency in the regulatory process and compliance with the Jeffersonian communication principle.",Rethinking Causation in Cancer with Evolutionary Developmental Biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546273,Biological theory,2018 12 17,"Despite the productivity of basic cancer research, cancer continues to be a health burden to society because this research has not yielded corresponding clinical applications. Many proposed solutions to this dilemma have revolved around implementing organizational and policy changes related to cancer research. Here I argue for a different solution: a new conceptualization of causation in cancer. Neither the standard molecular biomarker approaches nor evolutionary biology approaches to cancer fully capture its complex causal dynamics, even when considered jointly. These approaches map on to Ernst Mayr's proximate-ultimate distinction, which is an inadequate conceptualization of causation in biological systems and makes it difficult to connect developmental and evolutionary viewpoints. I propose looking to evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) to overcome the distinction and integrate the proximate and ultimate causal frameworks. I use the concepts of modularity and evolvability to show how an EvoDevo perspective can be manifested in cancer translational research. This perspective on causation in cancer is better suited for integrating the complexity of current empirical results and can facilitate novel developments in the investigation and clinical treatment of cancer.",Psychometric Properties of a Modified Moral Injury Questionnaire in a Military Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546271,Traumatology,2018 12 17,"Moral injury (MI) results from perpetration of or exposure to distressing events, known as morally injurious events (MIEs), that challenge moral beliefs and values. Due to the type of involvement in recent military conflicts, many veterans report MIEs that may cause dissonance and, in turn, MI. Although two existing measures assess MIEs, neither currently assesses the defining characteristics of MI (i.e., guilt, shame, difficulty forgiving self and others, and withdrawal). The present study reports the initial psychometric test of a modified version (Robbins, Kelley, Hamrick, Bravo, & White, 2017) of the Moral Injury Questionnaire - Military version (MIQ-M; Currier, Holland, Drescher, & Foy, 2015) in a sample of 328 military personnel (e.g., veterans, National Guard/reservists, active duty members). The MIQ-M was modified to assess both MIEs and the defining characteristics of MI. Exploratory factor analyses suggested a three-factor model of MIEs consisting of Atrocities of war, Psychological consequences of war, and Leadership failure or betrayal. The modified MIQ-M factors were correlated with defining characteristics of MI. In addition, each MIE factor and associated defining characteristics of MI were positively correlated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety, as well as substance use. The modified MIQ-M is a reliable measure of MI that is comprised of three subscales that are associated with, but distinct from, mental health outcomes. Although findings are promising, further research evaluating the applicability of the modified MIQ-M in clinical settings is required to establish construct validity of the defining characteristics and secondary manifestations of MI.",The Origin of Carbonate Veins Within the Sedimentary Cover and Igneous Rocks of the Cocos Ridge: Results From IODP Hole U1414A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546270,"Geochemistry, geophysics, geosystems : G(3)",2018 12 17,"Carbonate veins in the igneous basement and in the lithified sedimentary cover of the Cocos Ridge at International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Hole 344-U1414A reveal the hydrologic system and fluid-rock interactions. IODP Hole 344-U1414A was drilled on the northern flank of the Cocos Ridge and is situated 1 km seaward from the Middle America Trench offshore Costa Rica. Isotopic and elemental compositions were analyzed to constrain the fluid source of the carbonate veins and to reveal the thermal history of Hole 344-U1414A. The formation temperatures (oxygen isotope thermometer) of the carbonate veins in the lithified sedimentary rocks range from 70 to 92 °C and in the basalt from 32 to 82 °C. 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the veins in the altered Cocos Ridge basalt range between 0.707307 and 0.708729. The higher ratios are similar to seawater strontium ratios in the Neogene. 87Sr/86Sr ratios lower 0.7084 indicate exchange of Sr with the igneous host rock. The calcite veins hosted by the sedimentary rocks are showing more primitive 87Sr/86Sr ratios <0.706396. The isotopic compositions indicate seawater, modified into a hydrothermal fluid by subsequent heating, as the main fluid source. Low-temperature alteration and the presence of a high-temperature fluid resulted in different carbonate precipitates forming up to several cm thick veins.

In the combined framework, intrinsic mortality results from replicative senescence of the hematopoietic stem cells and extrinsic mortality results from environmental challenges. Because the model expresses the intrinsic and extrinsic rates with different powers of body mass, across the spectrum of mammals, survivorship changes from Type I to Type II curve shapes with decreasing body mass. Fitting the model to body mass and maximum lifespan data of 494 nonvolant mammals yields allometric relationships of body mass to the vitality parameters, from which full survivorship profiles were generated from body mass alone. Because maximum lifespan data is predominantly derived from captive populations, the generated survivorship curves were dominated by intrinsic mortality. Comparison of the mass-derived and observed survivorship curves provides insights into how specific populations deviate from the aggregate of populations observed under captivity.","""Floating"" cathode for efficient H2O2 electrogeneration applied to degradation of ibuprofen as a model pollutant.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546268,Electrochemistry communications,2018 12 17,"The performance of the Electro-Fenton (EF) process for contaminant degradation depends on the rate of H2O2 production at the cathode via 2-electron dissolved O2 reduction. However, the low solubility of O2 (≈1×10-3 mol dm-3) limits H2O2 production. Herein, a novel and practical strategy that enables the synergistic utilization of O2 from the bulk electrolyte and ambient air for efficient H2O2 production is proposed. Compared with a conventional ""submerged"" cathode, the H2O2 concentration obtained using the ""floating"" cathode is 4.3 and 1.5 times higher using porous graphite felt (GF) and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam electrodes, respectively. This surprising enhancement results from the formation of a three-phase interface inside the porous cathode, where the O2 from ambient air is also utilized for H2O2 production. The contribution of O2 from ambient air varies depending on the cathode material and is calculated to be 76.7% for the GF cathode and 35.6% for the RVC foam cathode. The effects of pH, current, and mixing on H2O2 production are evaluated. Finally, the EF process enhanced by the ""floating"" cathode degraded 78.3% of the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen after 120 min compared to only 25.4% using a conventional ""submerged"" electrode, without any increase in the cost.",Estimating PM2.5 speciation concentrations using prototype 4.4 km-resolution MISR aerosol properties over Southern California.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546266,"Atmospheric environment (Oxford, England : 1994)",2018 12 17,"Research efforts to better characterize the differential toxicity of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than or equal to 2.5 μm) speciation are often hindered by the sparse or non-existent coverage of ground monitors. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard NASA's Terra satellite is one of few satellite aerosol sensors providing information of aerosol shape, size and extinction globally for a long and continuous period that can be used to estimate PM2.5 speciation concentrations since year 2000. Currently, MISR only provides a 17.6 km product for its entire mission with global coverage every 9 days, a bit too coarse for air pollution health effects research and to capture local spatial variability of PM2.5 speciation. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed using MISR prototype 4.4 km-resolution aerosol data with meteorological variables and geographical indicators, to predict ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in Southern California between 2001 and 2015 at the daily level. The GAMs are able to explain 66%, 62%, 55% and 58% of the daily variability in PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC concentrations during the whole study period, respectively. Predicted concentrations capture large regional patterns as well as fine gradients of the four PM2.5 species in urban areas of Los Angeles and other counties, as well as in the Central Valley. This study is the first attempt to use MISR prototype 4.4 km-resolution AOD (aerosol optical depth) components data to predict PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC concentrations at the sub-regional scale. In spite of its low temporal sampling frequency, our analysis suggests that the MISR 4.4 km fractional AODs provide a promising way to capture the spatial hotspots and long-term temporal trends of PM2.5 speciation, understand the effectiveness of air quality controls, and allow our estimated PM2.5 speciation data to be linked with common spatial units such as census tract or zip code in epidemiological studies.

Disruptions in dendritic spine development have been implicated in many neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Although the development of dendritic spines is vital for cognitive function, understanding the mechanisms driving their outgrowth and stabilization in vivo remains a challenge. Our recent work identifies the presence of dendritic spine-like structures in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and provides initial insights into mechanisms promoting spine outgrowth in this system. Specifically, we show that neurexin/nrx-1 is a critical molecular component in directing the development of synaptic connections and promoting spine outgrowth. Our investigation provides important insights into the molecular machinery that sculpt synaptic connectivity, and continuing efforts in this system offer the potential for identifying new mechanisms governing both synaptic partner selection and dendritic spine outgrowth."

By taking a longitudinal approach and analysing the PMs' accounts of the ""refugee crisis"" from 1-year period, we focused on the ways rhetorical devices related to ethos, logos, and pathos were used to manage the issues of stake and accountability, as well as on the ways in which categories were worked up to serve particular functions. Our comparative analysis demonstrated significant similarities in the Finnish and Swedish PMs' talk, especially with regard to the transfer from a discourse of pathos and ethos, describing refugees in terms of individualism and humaneness, to a discourse of logos, emphasizing rationality, justifying sharpened immigration policies, and homogenizing refugees. However, the different historical paths of the two countries' immigration policies and the specific political situation had implications for the PMs' discourse. The Swedish PM could feasibly scapegoat the Sweden Democrats and the political right in opposition, whereas the Finnish PM, with the populist radical right as a government partner, engaged more heavily in distinctions between ""real, needing"" and ""false, undeserving"" refugees. We argue for the longitudinal approach in the analysis of political discourse, as such an approach allows to identify the changes and continuities in the discourse, as well as to grasp the dialogical interplay between the discourse and its context.",What Works for Adolescent Black Males at Risk of Suicide: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546246,Research on social work practice,2018 12 17,"We reviewed the controlled studies that report outcome findings for Black adolescent males 24 years of age and younger at risk of suicide.

We sought to understand what works for Black males experiencing suicide ideation or engaging in suicidal behaviors (e.g., attempts). We identified crossover effects for multisystemic therapy for reducing the risk for suicide ideation and attempts. Attachment-based family therapy was salient for use as a component of clinical practice for Black males being treated for suicide ideation.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) seeking to ameliorate depressive symptomology in Black males ages 12-29 were eligible for inclusion. After review of 627 abstracts and 212 full-text articles, 12 studies were selected. These RCTs were organized into five categories based on the intervention method. We isolated only one study that targeted YBM exclusively. Additionally, only two treatment effect sizes for YBM were available from the data. While remaining RCTs did involve Black youth, disaggregated data based on race and gender were not reported. Overall, the lack of research specific to YBM prevented any strong conclusions about the treatment effects on depression for this population. Small sample size along with poor representation of YBM were trends in the selected studies that also posed an issue. Therefore, our review produced qualitative findings but failed to isolate any true effect size for YBM being treated for depression. Until more conclusive evidence exists, alternative strategies may need to be employed in order to find appropriate interventions for depressed YBM seeking mental health treatment.",The predictivity of mandibular third molar position as a risk indicator for pericoronitis: A prospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546238,National journal of maxillofacial surgery,2018 12 17,The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of the mandibular third molar at highest risk for acute pericoronitis using clinical and radiographic analysis.,Comparison of stability with two-time use of platelet-rich growth factor versus one-time use of platelet-rich growth factor in immediate placement of dental implant in infected socket.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546237,National journal of maxillofacial surgery,2018 12 17,The aim is to evaluate the outcome and compare the stability with two-time use of platelet-rich growth factor (PRGF) versus one-time use of PRGF in immediate placement of dental implant in infected socket.

To compare the outcomes of various implant placement techniques, an electronic database of various journals from January 1990 to March 2017 were analyzed and only human clinical trials with 6 months follow-up and at least five implants in each group were reviewed. The present literature review focuses on the comparative aspects of flapped versus flapless implants in terms of their survival, marginal bone loss, soft-tissue parameters, and patient-centered outcomes. When the proper protocol is followed by experienced surgeons, no significant difference was observed in survival rate, marginal bone loss, and keratinized mucosal width between flapless and conventional flap technique. Although transgingival approach for implant placement is reported to significantly reduce the surgical time, increased patient comfort and acceptance, i.e. the patient centered outcomes such as postoperative pain, swelling, and visual analog score, are minimized. Hence, it is concluded that transgingival (flapless) implant placement technique is well accepted by the patient with potential outcomes as compared to the conventional implant placement approach.",Evaluation of remineralization potential and mechanical properties of pit and fissure sealants fortified with nano-hydroxyapatite and nano-amorphous calcium phosphate fillers: An in vitro study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546219,Journal of conservative dentistry : JCD,2018 12 17,"The aim of this study was: (i) to formulate pit and fissure sealants (PFS) containing nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) filler; nHAP filler and silica co-filler; nHAP and nano-Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (nACP) co-filler, (ii) to evaluate physical properties; degree of conversion (DOC), curing depth (CD) and mechanical properties; microshear bond strength (MBS) of fortified PFS, and (iii) to assess remineralization potential and release of Ca2= and PO4 ions from newly synthesized sealants.",A comparative evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy and flow characteristics of two epoxy resin-based sealers-AH plus and Perma Evolution: An in vitro study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546218,Journal of conservative dentistry : JCD,2018 12 17,"Bacteria that persist at the time of obturation increase the possibility of persistent apical periodontitis.

In the present study, we compare the cold tolerance of different life-history stages (nondiapausing and diapausing females, as well as males and juveniles) of a major agricultural pest: the two-spot spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acarina: Tetranychidae). Diapausing females from European populations of this species are shown to be freeze avoiding, supercooling to -23.6 ± 0.37  °C and with an LTemp50 of -23.2 °C. However, nondiapausing females [supercooling point (SCP) -19.1 ± 0.49 °C, LTemp50 -14.32 °C], males (SCP -21.27 ± 0.52  °C, LTemp50 -16 °C) and juveniles (SCP -25.34 ± 0.29 °C, LTemp50 -18.3 °C) are subclassified as strongly chill tolerant juveniles. LTime50 is 148.3 days for non-acclimated diapausing females, whereas nondiapausing females, males and juveniles reach 50% mortality by 21.7 days. When individuals are acclimated at 10 °C for a period of 7 days, no effect is found. Cold tolerance is suggested to be a major contributor to the successful spread of T. urticae across temperate countries, although it is dependent on a diapause trait, suggesting a potential target for control. Winter field trial data from diapausing females indicate that LTime50 is a reliable indicator of winter survival even within diapause, supporting the use of these indices as a valuable component within environmental niche models for the prediction of future pest invasions.",Robust Covariance Estimation for Approximate Factor Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546195,Journal of econometrics,2019 03 01,"In this paper, we study robust covariance estimation under the approximate factor model with observed factors. We propose a novel framework to first estimate the initial joint covariance matrix of the observed data and the factors, and then use it to recover the covariance matrix of the observed data. We prove that once the initial matrix estimator is good enough to maintain the element-wise optimal rate, the whole procedure will generate an estimated covariance with desired properties. For data with only bounded fourth moment, we propose to use adaptive Huber loss minimization to give the initial joint covariance estimation. This approach is applicable to a much wider class of distributions, beyond sub-Gaussian and elliptical distributions. We also present an asymptotic result for adaptive Huber's M-estimator with a diverging parameter. The conclusions are demonstrated by extensive simulations and real data analysis.",First Balanced Cross Section Across the Taurides Fold-Thrust Belt: Geological Constraints on the Subduction History of the Antalya Slab in Southern Anatolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546194,Tectonics,2018 12 14,"Eastern Mediterranean subduction accommodated Africa-Eurasia convergence since Mesozoic time and produced multiple subducted slab fragments in the mantle below Anatolia. These included the north dipping Cyprus and ENE-dipping Antalya slabs, which are currently separated by an upper mantle slab gap. Segmentation of these slabs, and associated mantle flow, may have contributed to <8 Ma uplift of the Central Anatolian Plateau. The western Central Taurides fold-thrust belt in southern Turkey is in the upper plate above the Antalya slab and contains a geological record of its subduction. We present the first orogen-scale balanced cross section of the Taurides and find that it formed in two stages: (1) Cretaceous to middle Eocene thrusting resulted in a minimum of 73-km shortening, and (2) Mio-Pliocene thrusting resulted in a minimum of 17.5-km shortening. Eocene shortening accounts for only ~5 Myr of Africa-Eurasia plate convergence. It is unlikely that >400 km of post to middle Eocene plate convergence was accommodated between the Taurides and its Beydağları platform foreland and instead must have been accommodated south of Beydağları. The associated southward plate boundary jump separated the Antalya slab from the African plate and the Cyprus slab. The isolated Antalya slab was left in an intraplate setting and is probably still attached to Beydağları today. We suggest the continental composition of the Antalya slab may have prevented its detachment. Finally, the gap between the Antalya and Cyprus slabs existed since at least Eocene time; their decoupling likely did not contribute to late Neogene Central Anatolian Plateau uplift.",The use of columns of the zeolite clinoptilolite in the remediation of aqueous nuclear waste streams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546191,Journal of radioanalytical and nuclear chemistry,2018 12 17,"Mud Hills clinoptilolite has been used in an effluent treatment plant (SIXEP) at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site.

One assumption is that differentials are comparatively small in Nordic welfare states. Our study examines how children's experiences of family structures and family dynamics vary by their mother's educational attainment in Finland. Based on register data on the childbearing and union histories of women in Finland born from 1969 onwards, we provide life-table estimates of children's (N = 64,162) experiences of family dissolution, family formation, and family structure from ages 0-15 years, stratified by mother's education level at the child's birth. We find huge socioeconomic disparities in children's experiences of family structures and transitions. Compared to children of highly educated mothers, children of mothers with low levels of education are almost twice as likely to be born in cohabitation and four times as likely to be born to a lone mother. They are also much more likely to experience further changes in family structure-particularly parental separation. On average, children of low-educated mothers spend just half of their childhood years living with both their parents, whereas those of high-educated mothers spend four-fifths of their childhood with both parents. The sociodemographic inequalities among children in Nordic welfare states clearly deserve more scholarly attention.",Do Marriage and Cohabitation Provide Benefits to Health in Mid-Life? The Role of Childhood Selection Mechanisms and Partnership Characteristics Across Countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546176,Population research and policy review,2018 12 18,"Extensive research has found that marriage provides health benefits to individuals, particularly in the U.S. The rise of cohabitation, however, raises questions about whether simply being in an intimate co-residential partnership conveys the same health benefits as marriage. Here, we use OLS regression to compare differences between partnered and unpartnered, and cohabiting and married individuals with respect to self-rated health in mid-life, an understudied part of the lifecourse. We pay particular attention to selection mechanisms arising in childhood and characteristics of the partnership. We compare results in five countries with different social, economic, and policy contexts: the U.S. (NLSY), U.K. (UKHLS), Australia (HILDA), Germany (SOEP), and Norway (GGS). Results show that living with a partner is positively associated with self-rated health in mid-life in all countries, but that controlling for children, prior separation, and current socio-economic status eliminates differences in Germany and Norway. Significant differences between cohabitation and marriage are only evident in the U.S. and the U.K., but controlling for childhood background, union duration, and prior union dissolution eliminates partnership differentials. The findings suggest that cohabitation in the U.S. and U.K., both liberal welfare regimes, seems to be very different than in the other countries.

A natural experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546171,Scientometrics,2018 12 17,"Editors of scientific journals meet increasing challenges to find peer reviewers. Rewarding reviewers has been proposed as a solution to incentives peer review, and journals have already started to offer different kinds of rewards, particularly non-monetary ones. However, research so far has mainly explored the efficacy of monetary rewards, while research on non-monetary rewards is barely absent. The goal of this article is to fill this gap by exploring whether and under what conditions a rather common non-monetary reward employed by journals, i.e., to recognize reviewers work by publishing their names on a yearly issue, is effective in increasing the willingness of scientists to become peer reviewers. We test the efficacy of three different reward settings identified in the literature: (1) engagement contingent, (2) task-completion contingent, and (3) performance contingent, through a natural experiment involving 1865 scientists in faculties of business and economics of Romanian universities. We explore whether reward efficacy varies across scientists depending on their gender, academic rank, research productivity, and type of institution to which they are affiliated. The results show that the performance contingency strongly reduces the number of respondents willing to become reviewers (- 60 % compared to a no-reward setting), particularly males and research productive scientists. Scientists affiliated with private universities are strongly discouraged by the reward. In sum, the results suggest that non-monetary rewards are not necessarily effective, as in some cases they may actually discourage the most intrinsically motivated and competent reviewers.",Towards understanding the relation between citations and research quality in software engineering studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546170,Scientometrics,2018 12 17,"The importance of achieving high quality in research practice has been highlighted in different disciplines. At the same time, citations are utilized to measure the impact of academic researchers and institutions. One open question is whether the quality in the reporting of research is related to scientific impact, which would be desired. In this exploratory study we aim to: (1) Investigate how consistently a scoring rubric for rigor and relevance has been used to assess research quality of software engineering studies; (2) Explore the relationship between rigor, relevance and citation count. Through backward snowball sampling we identified 718 primary studies assessed through the scoring rubric. We utilized cluster analysis and conditional inference tree to explore the relationship between quality in the reporting of research (represented by rigor and relevance) and scientiometrics (represented by normalized citations). The results show that only rigor is related to studies' normalized citations. Besides that, confounding factors are likely to influence the number of citations. The results also suggest that the scoring rubric is not applied the same way by all studies, and one of the likely reasons is because it was found to be too abstract and in need to be further refined. Our findings could be used as a basis to further understand the relation between the quality in the reporting of research and scientific impact, and foster new discussions on how to fairly acknowledge studies for performing well with respect to the emphasized research quality. Furthermore, we highlighted the need to further improve the scoring rubric.",A bibliometric method for assessing technological maturity: the case of additive manufacturing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546169,Scientometrics,2018 12 17,"While novel technologies have tremendous competitive potential, they also involve certain risks. Maturity assessment analyzes how well a technological development can fulfill an expected task. The technology readiness level (TRL) has been considered to be one of the most promising approaches for addressing technological maturity. Nonetheless, its assessment requires opinions of the experts, which is costly and implies the risk of personal bias. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Bibliometric Method for Assessing Technological Maturity (BIMATEM). It is a repeatable framework that assesses maturity quantitatively. Our method is based on the assumption that each technology life cycle stage can be matched to technology records contained in scientific literature, patents, and news databases. The scientific papers and patent records of mature technologies display a logistic growth behavior, while news records follow a hype-type behavior. BIMATEM determines the maturity level by curve fitting technology records to these behaviors. To test our approach, BIMATEM was applied to additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Our results revealed that material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are the most mature AM technologies with TRL between 6 and 7, followed by directed energy deposition with TRL between 4 and 5, and binder jetting and sheet lamination, the least mature, with TRL between 1 and 2. BIMATEM can be used by competitive technology intelligence professionals, policymakers, and further decision makers whose main interests include assessing the risk of implementing new technologies. Future research can focus on testing the method with regard to altmetrics.",Examiner trust in applicants to the European Patent Office: country specificities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546168,Scientometrics,2018 12 17,"Indicators based on the probability of applicant citations in patents have been used to emphasize the importance of distinguishing applicant and examiner citations. However, the interpretation of these indicators and of the presence of applicant citations in European Patent Office (EPO) examiner reports is still uncertain. Based on interviews with patent examiners and patent applicants, we develop the idea that applicant citations in EPO examiner reports indicate examiner trust in applicants, and that this trust varies according to national patterns. Using EPO data for over 3,500,000 citations during 1997-2007, we verify that examiner trust in applicants is higher in granted patents. Examiners trust applicants from scientifically or economically strong countries, from member states of the European Patent Organization, and from the same country of the examiners.",Optimal Design of Energy Systems Using Constrained Grey-Box Multi-Objective Optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546167,Computers & chemical engineering,2018 12 15,"The (global) optimization of energy systems, commonly characterized by high-fidelity and large-scale complex models, poses a formidable challenge partially due to the high noise and/or computational expense associated with the calculation of derivatives. This complexity is further amplified in the presence of multiple conflicting objectives, for which the goal is to generate trade-off compromise solutions, commonly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. We have previously introduced the p-ARGONAUT system, parallel AlgoRithms for Global Optimization of coNstrAined grey-box compUTational problems, which is designed to optimize general constrained single objective grey-box problems by postulating accurate and tractable surrogate formulations for all unknown equations in a computationally efficient manner. In this work, we extend p-ARGONAUT towards multi-objective optimization problems and test the performance of the framework, both in terms of accuracy and consistency, under many equality constraints. Computational results are reported for a number of benchmark multi-objective problems and a case study of an energy market design problem for a commercial building, while the performance of the framework is compared with other derivative-free optimization solvers."

The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular Aβ in these relatively young individuals with treatment-induced (iatrogenic) CJD (iCJD), in contrast to other prion-disease patients and population controls, allied with the ability of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates to seed Aβ deposition in laboratory animals, led us to argue that the implicated c-hGH batches might have been contaminated with Aβ seeds as well as with prions. However, this was necessarily an association, and not an experimental, study in humans and causality could not be concluded. Given the public health importance of our hypothesis, we proceeded to identify and biochemically analyse archived vials of c-hGH. Here we show that certain c-hGH batches to which patients with iCJD and Aβ pathology were exposed have substantial levels of Aβ40, Aβ42 and tau proteins, and that this material can seed the formation of Aβ plaques and cerebral Aβ-amyloid angiopathy in intracerebrally inoculated mice expressing a mutant, humanized amyloid precursor protein. These results confirm the presence of Aβ seeds in archived c-hGH vials and are consistent with the hypothesized iatrogenic human transmission of Aβ pathology. This experimental confirmation has implications for both the prevention and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and should prompt a review of the risk of iatrogenic transmission of Aβ seeds by medical and surgical procedures long recognized to pose a risk of accidental prion transmission2,3.",Retinal burns from laser pointers: a risk in children with behavioural problems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546136,"Eye (London, England)",2019 04 09,To explore self-inflicted retinal burns from laser pointers in children.,Exploring the use of adjusted body mass index thresholds based on equivalent insulin resistance for defining overweight and obesity in UK South Asian children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546135,International journal of obesity (2005),2019 06 13,"Body mass index (BMI) overweight/obesity thresholds in South Asian (SA) adults, at equivalent type-2 diabetes risk are lower than for white Europeans (WE).

Recent work identified the orphan receptor GPR158 as a molecular link between chronic stress and depression. Here we reveal a non-canonical mechanism by which GPR158 exerts its effects on stress-induced depression by the complex formation with Regulator of G protein Signaling 7 (RGS7). Chronic stress promotes membrane recruitment of RGS7 via GPR158 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The resultant complex suppresses homeostatic regulation of cAMP by inhibitory GPCRs in the region. Accordingly, RGS7 loss in mice induces an antidepressant-like phenotype and resiliency to stress, whereas its restoration within the mPFC is sufficient to rescue this phenotype in a GPR158-dependent way. These findings mechanistically link the unusual orphan receptor-RGS complex to a major stress mediator, the cAMP system and suggest new avenues for pharmacological interventions in affective disorders.",Photodetection probability in quantum systems with arbitrarily strong light-matter interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546126,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Cavity-QED systems have recently reached a regime where the light-matter interaction strength amounts to a non-negligible fraction of the resonance frequencies of the bare subsystems. In this regime, it is known that the usual normal-order correlation functions for the cavity-photon operators fail to describe both the rate and the statistics of emitted photons. Following Glauber's original approach, we derive a simple and general quantum theory of photodetection, valid for arbitrary light-matter interaction strengths. Our derivation uses Fermi's golden rule, together with an expansion of system operators in the eigenbasis of the interacting light-matter system, to arrive at the correct photodetection probabilities. We consider both narrow- and wide-band photodetectors. Our description is also valid for point-like detectors placed inside the optical cavity. As an application, we propose a gedanken experiment confirming the virtual nature of the bare excitations that enrich the ground state of the quantum Rabi model."

It is a pertinent question if this variability is purely random or to some extent predictable. Here we show, by employing machine learning techniques such as regression neural networks and support vector machines that deformation predictability evolves with strain and crystal size. Using data from discrete dislocations dynamics simulations, the machine learning models are trained to infer the mapping from features of the pre-existing dislocation configuration to the stress-strain curves. The predictability vs strain relation is non-monotonic and exhibits a system size effect: larger systems are more predictable. Stochastic deformation avalanches give rise to fundamental limits of deformation predictability for intermediate strains. However, the large-strain deformation dynamics of the samples can be predicted surprisingly well.",A public health framework for the regulation of marketing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546111,Journal of public health policy,2019 05 28,"Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies have found a link between youth exposure to cigarette marketing and youth initiation of smoking.

Similar products that may cause more harm than benefits include alcohol, electronic cigarettes, and opioids. We review the evidence linking problematic use of these products with exposure to marketing and discuss standards for assessing the potential harmfulness of marketing. We next address how public health agencies might apply regulatory principles to these harmful products similar to those applied to cigarette advertising, in the advancement of public health.",Intron-containing RNA from the HIV-1 provirus activates type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546110,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"HIV-1-infected people who take drugs that suppress viremia to undetectable levels are protected from developing AIDS. Nonetheless, HIV-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived CD4+ memory T cells, and perhaps other cell types, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy. Here we show that the HIV-1 provirus activates innate immune signaling in isolated dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells. Immune activation requires transcription from the HIV-1 provirus and expression of CRM1-dependent, Rev-dependent, RRE-containing, unspliced HIV-1 RNA. If rev is provided in trans, all HIV-1 coding sequences are dispensable for activation except those cis-acting sequences required for replication or splicing. Our results indicate that the complex, post-transcriptional regulation intrinsic to HIV-1 RNA is detected by the innate immune system as a danger signal, and that drugs which disrupt HIV-1 transcription or HIV-1 RNA metabolism would add qualitative benefit to current antiviral drug regimens.",Deciphering bacterial epigenomes using modern sequencing technologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546107,Nature reviews.

Indeed, as the number of mapped bacterial methylomes approaches 2,000, increasing evidence supports roles for methylation in regulation of gene expression, virulence and pathogen-host interactions.",Normotensive non-dipping blood pressure profile does not predict the risk of chronic kidney disease progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546105,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2019 02 14,"The lack of a decrease in nocturnal blood pressure is a risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, it currently remains unknown whether it is a risk factor in normotensive CKD patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study and enrolled 676 CKD patients who underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). According to their nocturnal blood pressure dipping pattern (>10%: dipper or <10%: non-dipper) and average 24-h systolic blood pressure (>130/80 mmHg: hypertension or <130/80 mmHg: normotension), patients were divided into four groups. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 2 years and relevant clinical parameters were analyzed among groups. Among all participants, 82.7% were non-dippers and half of them were normotensive. The eGFR decline was the most rapid in hypertensive non-dipper patients (4.73 ± 0.45 ml/min/1.73 m2/2 years), and was not significantly different between normotensive non-dipper (1.31 ± 0.49 ml/min/1.73 m2/2 years) and dipper patients (1.69 ± 0.80 ml/min/1.73 m2/2 years). A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the amount of urinary protein (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51-2.63), 24-h systolic blood pressure (95% CI 1.13-1.45), and eGFR (95% CI 1.02-1.44) were associated with a rapid eGFR decline. We conclude that, according to the ABPM-based analysis, a non-dipping blood pressure pattern in normotensive CKD patients does not predict the risk of a rapid decline in eGFR. This suggests that the control of blood pressure, rather than its circadian rhythm, is essential for the preservation of eGFR.",The neurobiological basis of narcolepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546103,Nature reviews.

Here, we review the current understanding of how orexin neurons regulate sleep-wake behaviour and the consequences of the loss of orexin neurons. We also summarize the developing evidence that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder that may be caused by a T cell-mediated attack on the orexin neurons and explain how these new perspectives can inform better therapeutic approaches.",Impact of CFTR modulation with Ivacaftor on Gut Microbiota and Intestinal Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546102,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Next to progressive airway disease, CF is also associated with intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has improved pulmonary and nutritional status but its effects on the intestinal microbiota and inflammation are unclear. Hence, we assessed the changes on the intestinal microbial communities (16S rRNA variable 3 gene region) and inflammatory markers (calprotectin and M2-pyruvate kinase [M2-PK]) in 16 CF individuals (8 children and 8 adults) before and after (median 6.1 months) ivacaftor. Stool calprotectin significantly decreased following ivacaftor (median [IQR]: 154.4 [102.1-284.2] vs. 87.5 [19.5-190.2] mg/kg, P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in Akkermansia with ivacaftor. Increased abundance of Akkermansia was associated with normal stool M2-PK concentrations, and decreased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with decreased stool calprotectin concentrations. In summary, changes in the gut microbiome and decrease in intestinal inflammation was associated with Ivacaftor treatment among individuals with CF carrying at least one gating CFTR mutation. Thus, CFTR-modifying therapy may adequately improve the aberrant pathophysiology and milieu of the CF gut to favor a more healthy microbiota, which in turn reduces intestinal inflammation.",Pneumococcal quorum sensing drives an asymmetric owner-intruder competitive strategy during carriage via the competence regulon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546100,Nature microbiology,2019 04 30,"Competition among microorganisms is a key determinant of successful host colonization and persistence. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, lower than predicted rates of co-colonizing strains suggest a competitive advantage for resident bacteria over newcomers. In light of evolutionary theory, we hypothesized that S. pneumoniae use owner-intruder asymmetries to settle contests, leading to the disproportionate success of the initial resident 'owner', regardless of the genetic identity of the 'intruder'. We investigated the determinants of within-host competitive success utilizing S. pneumoniae colonization of the upper respiratory tract of infant mice. Within 6 h, colonization by the resident inhibited colonization by an isogenic challenger. The competitive advantage of the resident was dependent on quorum sensing via the competence (Com) regulon and downstream choline binding protein D (CbpD) and on the competence-induced bacteriocins A and B (CibAB) implicated in fratricide. CbpD and CibAB are highly conserved across pneumococcal lineages, indicating evolutionary advantages for asymmetric competitive strategies within the species. Mathematical modelling supported a significant role for quorum sensing via the Com regulon in competition, even for strains with different competitive advantages. Our study suggests that asymmetric owner-intruder competitive strategies do not require complex cognition and are used by a major human pathogen to determine 'ownership' of human hosts.",Tracking virus outbreaks in the twenty-first century.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546099,Nature microbiology,2019 04 30,"Emerging viruses have the potential to impose substantial mortality, morbidity and economic burdens on human populations.

Their expression is therefore under tight epigenetic control. We previously reported in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) that a member of the THE1B class of LTR elements acted as a promoter for the proto-oncogene and growth factor receptor gene CSF1R and that expression of this gene is required for cHL tumour survival. However, to which extent and how such elements participate in globally shaping the unique cHL gene expression programme is unknown. To address this question we mapped the genome-wide activation of THE1-LTRs in cHL cells using a targeted next generation sequencing approach (RACE-Seq). Integration of these data with global gene expression data from cHL and control B cell lines showed a unique pattern of LTR activation impacting on gene expression, including genes associated with the cHL phenotype. We also show that global LTR activation is induced by strong inflammatory stimuli. Together these results demonstrate that LTR activation provides an additional layer of gene deregulation in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and highlight the potential impact of genome-wide LTR activation in other inflammatory diseases.",Genomic and transcriptomic landscapes of Epstein-Barr virus in extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546078,Leukemia,2019 06 06,"Extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (nasal type; NKTCL) is an aggressive malignancy strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, the role of EBV in NKTCL development is unclear, largely due to the lack of information about EBV genome and transcriptome in NKTCL. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we obtained whole genome (n = 27) and transcriptome datasets (n = 18) of EBV derived from NKTCL tumor biopsies. We assembled 27 EBV genomes and detected an average of 1,152 single nucleotide variants and 44.8 indels (<50 bp) of EBV per sample. We also identified frequent focal EBV genome deletions and integrated EBV fragments in the host genome. Moreover, Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NKTCL-derived EBVs are closely clustered; transcriptome analysis revealed less activation of both latent and lytic genes and larger amount of T-cell epitope alterations in NKTCL, as compared with other EBV-associated cancers. Furthermore, we observed transcriptional defects of the BARTs miRNA by deletion, and the disruption of host NHEJ1 by integrated EBV fragment, implying novel pathogenic mechanisms of EBV. Taken together, we reported for the first time global mutational and transcriptional profiles of EBV in NKTCL clinical samples, revealing important somatic events of EBV and providing insights to better understanding of EBV's contribution in tumorigenesis.",An automated bacterial concentration and recovery system for pre-enrichment required in rapid Escherichia coli detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546076,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"One of the biggest challenges in rapid low concentration bacterial detection is the pre-concentration or pre-enrichment, which aims to increase bacteria concentration and reduce sample volume for easy bacterial detection. In practical bacterial detection, large-volume water samples with a pathogenic bacterial concentration of less than 1 CFU/mL have to be tested rapidly. The reported biosensors either have insufficient detection limit or have limited capability of handling a sufficiently large water sample. Therefore, a high-performance automated pre-enrichment process is strongly demanded in rapid practical bacterial detection. In this paper, a practical high performance automated bacterial concentration and recovery system (ABCRS) based on the combination of a ceramic membrane and tangential flow filtration technique was presented with short processing time (less than one hour), low pre-enrichment limit (≤0.005 CFU/mL), high concentration ratio (≥ 500), high recovery efficiency (~ 90%), and small final retentate volume (≤ 5 mL).",Post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 provide multiple strategies for autophagy regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546075,Cell death and differentiation,2019 03 29,"Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway essential for protein homeostasis, survival and development. Defects in autophagic pathways have been connected to a variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. In the process of macroautophagy, cytoplasmic cargo is enclosed in a double-membrane structure and fused to the lysosome to allow for digestion and recycling of material. Autophagosome formation is primed by the ULK complex, which enables the downstream production of PI(3)P, a key lipid signalling molecule, on the phagophore membrane. The PI(3)P is generated by the PI3 kinase (PI3K) complex, consisting of the core components VPS34, VPS15 and Beclin 1. Beclin 1 is a central player in autophagy and constitutes a molecular platform for the regulation of autophagosome formation and maturation. Post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 affect its stability, interactions and ability to regulate PI3K activity, providing the cell with a plethora of strategies to fine-tune the levels of autophagy. Being such an important regulator, Beclin 1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention and interfering with the post-translational regulation of Beclin 1 could be one way of manipulating the levels of autophagy. In this review, we provide an overview of the known post-translational modifications of Beclin 1 that govern its role in autophagy and how these modifications are maintained by input from several upstream signalling pathways. ▓.",Sphingolipid-mediated inflammatory signaling leading to autophagy inhibition converts erythropoiesis to myelopoiesis in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546074,Cell death and differentiation,2018 12 14,"Elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) inhibit erythropoiesis and cause anemia in patients with cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. TNFα is also a potent activator of the sphingomyelinase (SMase)/ceramide pathway leading to ceramide synthesis and regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy. Here we evaluated the implication of the TNFα/SMase/ceramide pathway on inhibition of erythropoiesis in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (CD34/HSPCs) from healthy donors. Exogenous synthetic C2- and C6-ceramide as well as bacterial SMase inhibited erythroid differentiation in erythropoietin-induced (Epo)CD34/HSPCs shown by the analysis of various erythroid markers. The neutral SMase inhibitor GW4869 as well as the genetic inhibition of nSMase with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3) prevented the inhibition by TNFα, but not the acid SMase inhibitor desipramine. Moreover, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide metabolite, restored erythroid differentiation, whereas TNFα inhibited sphingosine kinase-1, required for S1P synthesis. Analysis of cell morphology and colony formation demonstrated that erythropoiesis impairment was concomitant with a granulomonocytic differentiation in TNFα- and ceramide-treated EpoCD34/HSPCs. Inhibition of erythropoiesis and induction of granulomonocytic differentiation were correlated to modulation of hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) GATA-1, GATA-2, and PU.1. Moreover, the expression of microRNAs (miR)-144/451, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 was also modulated by TNFα and ceramide treatments, in line with cellular observations. Autophagy plays an essential role during erythropoiesis and our results demonstrate that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits autophagy in EpoCD34/HSPCs. TNFα- and ceramide-induced phosphorylation of mTORS2448 and ULK1S758, inhibited Atg13S355 phosphorylation, and blocked autophagosome formation as shown by transmission electron microscopy and GFP-LC3 punctae formation. Moreover, rapamycin prevented the inhibitory effect of TNFα and ceramides on erythropoiesis while inhibiting induction of myelopoiesis. In contrast, bafilomycin A1, but not siRNA against Atg5, induced myeloid differentiation, while both impaired erythropoiesis. We demonstrate here that the TNFα/neutral SMase/ceramide pathway inhibits erythropoiesis to induce myelopoiesis via modulation of a hematopoietic TF/miR network and inhibition of late steps of autophagy. Altogether, our results reveal an essential role of autophagy in erythroid vs. myeloid differentiation.",A survey on incidence and management of adenovirus infection after allogeneic HSCT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546071,Bone marrow transplantation,2018 12 14,"To determine the current practices on the management of Adenovirus (ADV) infection after allogenic stem cell transplantation, a survey was undertook among EBMT centres. The response rate was 20% (91/446): 46% were adult, 44% were paediatric and 10% were mixed centres, respectively. The overall incidence of ADV infection was 7.1%: 4.1% in adult, 15.4% in paediatric, and 3.6% in mixed population. The determination of ADV-DNA in biological samples was used in 96% of centres; 58% of them monitored asymptomatic patients with a frequency of twice a week in 9%, once a week in 45%, every two weeks in 4% of centres. The treatment of ADV infection was mainly based on the administration of cidofovir (87%), being the schedule of 5 mg/kg/week with probenecid the most used, and the reduction of immunosuppression (84%). The threshold of ADV-DNAemia to start cidofovir in high-risk patients was most frequently >1000 copies/ml. Innovative treatments, such as brincidofovir and adoptive ADV-cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes, were used in 27% and 20% of centres, respectively. Almost all responding centres consider ADV infection serious enough to deserve testing asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Cidofovir and reduction of immunosuppression represent the main therapeutic options but one fourth of responding centres experimented novel therapies.","Bacterial blood stream infections (BSIs), particularly post-engraftment BSIs, are associated with increased mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546070,Bone marrow transplantation,2019 06 15,"We analyzed CIBMTR data to evaluate the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and association with overall survival (OS) for bacterial blood stream infections (BSIs) occurring within 100 days of alloHCT in 2 different phases: pre-/peri-engraftment (BSI very early phase, BSI-VEP) and BSI post-engraftment (BSI occurring between 2 weeks after engraftment and day 100, late early phase, BSI-LEP). Of the 7128 alloHCT patients, 2656 (37%) had ≥1 BSI by day 100. BSI-VEP, BSI-LEP, and BSI-Both constituted 56% (n = 1492), 31% (n = 824), and 13% (n = 340) of total BSI, respectively. Starting in 2009, we observed a gradual decline in BSI incidence through 2012 (61-48%). Patients with BSI-VEP were more likely to receive a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen with total body irradiation (TBI). NRM was significantly higher in patients with any BSI (RR 1.82 95% CI 1.63-2.04 for BSI-VEP, RR 2.46, 95% CI 2.05-2.96 for BSI-LEP, and RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.87-2.81 for BSI-Both) compared with those without BSI. OS was significantly lower in patients with any BSI compared with patients without BSI (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.26-1.47 for BSI-VEP; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.58-2.12 for BSI-LEP: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.43-1.94 for BSI-Both).

When used in conjunction with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, allo-HCT from an HLA haplo-identical donor yields promising outcomes for many diseases other than ATL. However, appropriate comparisons with other donor sources, especially cord blood and conventional HLA haplo-identical donors, are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of this modality. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of allo-HCT without PTCY in patients with ATL registered in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation TRUMP database between 1985 and 2015. During that period, 46 patients received allo-HCT without PTCY and survivors were followed for a median of 2316.5 days (range: 220-3884 days). Although the estimated 1- and 5-year overall survival rates of the entire cohort were 34.5% and 17.7%, respectively, the cumulative 1- and 5-year non-ATL mortality rates of 41.3% and 55.8%, respectively, were high. The results of our study will serve as a platform for discussions of the safety and efficacy of haplo-HCT for future clinical trials in patients with ATL.",Use of the Normalized Difference Road Landside Index (NDRLI)-based method for the quick delineation of road-induced landslides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546067,Scientific reports,2018 12 22,"Recognition and classification of road-related landslides are a critical requirement in pre- and post-disaster hazard analysis. They are primarily done through field mapping or manual image interpretation from commercial satellites images. This paper developed a Normalized Difference Road Landside Index (NDRLI)-based method to delineate road-induced landslides and enhance their presence in remotely sensed digital imagery based on free Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) sources. The NDRLI-based method includes NDRLI, Shape Index of Spectral Curve (SISC), and other optimizing steps such as deleting shadow and slope <20° area to recognise landslides. The test results show that the NDRLI-based method is effective in extracting road-induced landslide information, although the Kappa coefficient should be further improved."

Liver regeneration is a compensatory response overcoming disturbances of whole-body homeostasis provoked by organ defects. Here we show that a vagus-macrophage-hepatocyte link regulates acute liver regeneration after liver injury and that this system is critical for promoting survival. Hepatic Foxm1 is rapidly upregulated after partial hepatectomy (PHx). Hepatic branch vagotomy (HV) suppresses this upregulation and hepatocyte proliferation, thereby increasing mortality. In addition, hepatic FoxM1 supplementation in vagotomized mice reverses the suppression of liver regeneration and blocks the increase in post-PHx mortality. Hepatic macrophage depletion suppresses both post-PHx Foxm1 upregulation and remnant liver regeneration, and increases mortality. Hepatic Il-6 rises rapidly after PHx and this is suppressed by HV, muscarinic blockade or resident macrophage depletion. Furthermore, IL-6 neutralization suppresses post-PHx Foxm1 upregulation and remnant liver regeneration. Collectively, vagal signal-mediated IL-6 production in hepatic macrophages upregulates hepatocyte FoxM1, leading to liver regeneration and assures survival.",Somatic and germline genomics in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546053,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,2019 03 21,"Advances in genomic research and risk-directed therapy have led to improvements in the long-term survival and quality of life outcomes of patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The application of next-generation sequencing technologies, especially transcriptome sequencing, has resulted in the identification of novel molecular subtypes of ALL with prognostic and therapeutic implications, as well as cooperative mutations that account for much of the heterogeneity in clinical responses observed among patients with specific ALL subtypes. In addition, germline genetic variants have been shown to influence the risk of developing ALL and/or the responses of non-malignant and leukaemia cells to therapy; shared pathways for drug activation and metabolism are implicated in treatment-related toxicity and drug sensitivity or resistance, depending on whether the genetic changes are germline, somatic or both. Indeed, although once considered a non-hereditary disease, genomic investigations of familial and sporadic ALL have revealed a growing number of genetic alterations or conditions that predispose individuals to the development of ALL and treatment-related second cancers. The identification of these genetic alterations holds the potential to direct genetic counselling, testing and possibly monitoring for the early detection of ALL and other cancers. Herein, we review these advances in our understanding of the genomic landscape of childhood ALL and their clinical implications.",Physician-pharmacist collaborative practice and telehealth may transform hypertension management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546052,Journal of human hypertension,2019 03 10,"Community pharmacists play a crucial role in hypertension management and their intervention, mainly including education, medication monitoring, and reviewing, blood pressure (BP) measurement and cardiovascular risk factors tracking, have proved to enhance BP control and adherence to antihypertensive treatment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach with the referring physician and a patient-centered model of care have been proved to be particularly effective for improving control of hypertension and promoting patients' health. The inclusion of telehealth in such model (the so-called telepharmacy) may expand the reach of the pharmacist's intervention and provide pharmacy operations and patient care at a distance with further benefits for hypertensive patients and their managing physicians. Very few randomized controlled studies have evaluated the clinical efficacy of the implementation of telepharmacy services in the management of hypertension, with the strongest evidence limited to physician-pharmacist collaborative interventions based on home BP telemonitoring plus patient education on lifestyle, drug therapy, and cardiovascular risk factors control. The results of these trials documented a benefit of telehealth mainly in terms of improvement of BP control consequent to antihypertensive medication intensification and optimization. Although promising, these results need to be corroborated through larger, prospective, and long-term studies, which should also evaluate additional long-term benefits of telepharmacy services in hypertension management.",Closed-loop functional optogenetic stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546051,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"Optogenetics has been used to orchestrate temporal- and tissue-specific control of neural tissues and offers a wealth of unique advantages for neuromuscular control. Here, we establish a closed-loop functional optogenetic stimulation (CL-FOS) system to control ankle joint position in murine models. Using the measurement of either joint angle or fascicle length as a feedback signal, we compare the controllability of CL-FOS to closed-loop functional electrical stimulation (CL-FES) and demonstrate significantly greater accuracy, lower rise times and lower overshoot percentages. We demonstrate orderly recruitment of motor units and reduced fatigue when performing cyclical movements with CL-FOS compared with CL-FES. We develop and investigate a 3-phase, photo-kinetic model to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for temporal variations in optogenetically activated neuromusculature during closed-loop control experiments. Methods and insights from this study lay the groundwork for the development of closed-loop optogenetic neuromuscular stimulation therapies and devices for peripheral limb control.",The formation of chromatin domains involves a primary step based on the 3-D structure of DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546050,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"The general model presented here for the formation of chromatin domains, LADs and TADs, is primarily based on the 3-D structures of the corresponding DNA sequences, the GC-poor and GC-rich isochores. Indeed, the low-heterogeneity GC-poor isochores locally are intrinsically stiff and curved because of the presence of interspersed oligo-Adenines. In contrast, the high-heterogeneity GC-rich isochores are in the shape of peaks characterized by increasing levels of GC and of interspersed oligo-Guanines. In LADs, oligo-Adenines induce local nucleosome depletions leading to structures that are well suited for the attachment to (and embedding in) the lamina. In TADs, the gradients of GC and of oligo-Guanines are responsible for a decreasing nucleosome density, decreasing supercoiling and increasing accessibility. This ""moulding step"" shapes the ""primary TADs"" into loops that lack self-interactions, being CTCF/cohesin-free structures. The cohesin complex then binds to the tips of ""primary TADs"" and slides down the loops, thanks to Nipbl, an essential factor for loading cohesin and for stimulating its ATPase activity and its translocation. This ""extruding step"" leads to closer contacts and to self-interactions in the loops and stops at the CTCF binding sites located at the base of the loops that are thus closed and insulated.",Two-frame apparent motion presented with an inter-stimulus interval reverses optokinetic responses in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546049,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Two successive image frames presented with a blank inter-stimulus interval (ISI) induce reversals of perceived motion in humans. This illusory effect is a manifestation of the temporal properties of image filters embedded in the visual processing pathway. In the present study, ISI experiments were performed to identify the temporal characteristics of vision underlying optokinetic responses (OKRs) in mice. These responses are thought to be mediated by subcortical visual processing. OKRs of C57BL/6 J mice, induced by a 1/4-wavelength shift of a square-wave grating presented with and without an ISI were recorded. When a 1/4-wavelength shift was presented without, or with shorter ISIs (≤106.7 ms), OKRs were induced in the direction of the shift, with progressively decreasing amplitude as the ISI increased. However, when ISIs were 213.3 ms or longer, OKR direction reversed. Similar dependence on ISIs was also obtained using a sinusoidal grating. We subsequently quantitatively estimated temporal filters based on the ISI effects. We found that filters with biphasic impulse response functions could reproduce the ISI and temporal frequency dependence of the mouse OKR. Comparison with human psychophysics and behaviors suggests that mouse vision has more sluggish response dynamics to light signals than that of humans.",Bone marrow-derived epithelial cells and hair follicle stem cells contribute to development of chronic cutaneous neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546048,Nature communications,2019 01 22,"We used allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and a mouse multistage cutaneous carcinogenesis model to probe recruitment of bone marrow-derived epithelial cells (BMDECs) in skin tumors initiated with the carcinogen, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and promoted with 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). BMDECs clustered in the lesional epithelium, expressed cytokeratins, proliferated, and stratified. We detected cytokeratin induction in plastic-adherent bone marrow cells (BMCs) cultured in the presence of filter-separated keratinocytes (KCs) and bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP5). Lineage-depleted BMCs migrated towards High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) protein and epidermal KCs in ex vivo invasion assays. Naive female mice receiving BMTs from DMBA-treated donors developed benign and malignant lesions after TPA promotion alone. We conclude that BMDECs contribute to the development of papillomas and dysplasia, demonstrating a systemic contribution to these lesions. Furthermore, carcinogen-exposed BMCs can initiate benign and malignant lesions upon tumor promotion. Ultimately, these findings may suggest targets for treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers.",Psychoradiological investigations of gray matter alterations in patients with anorexia nervosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546047,Translational psychiatry,2019 05 06,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with high mortality. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood, and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance brain imaging studies have given inconsistent results. Here we aimed to psychoradiologically define the most prominent and replicable abnormalities of gray matter volume (GMV) in AN patients, and to examine their relationship to demographics and clinical characteristics, by means of a new coordinate-based meta-analytic technique called seed-based d mapping (SDM). In a pooled analysis of all AN patients we identified decreased GMV in the bilateral median cingulate cortices and posterior cingulate cortices extending to the bilateral precuneus, and the supplementary motor area. In subgroup analysis we found an additional decreased GMV in the right fusiform in adult AN, and a decreased GMV in the left amygdala and left anterior cingulate cortex in AN patients without comorbidity (pure AN). Thus, the most consistent GMV alterations in AN patients are in the default mode network and the sensorimotor network. These psychoradiological findings of the brain abnormalities might underpin the neuropathophysiology in AN.",Associating H2O2-and NO-related changes in the proteome of Mycobacterium smegmatis with enhanced survival in macrophage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546046,Emerging microbes & infections,2019 04 22,"Mycobacterium manages to evade the host cell immune system, partially owing to its ability to survive redox stress after macrophage engulfment. Exposure to redox stress has been linked to later replication, persistence, and latent infection. In this work, mass spectrometry was used to elucidate the cell-wide changes that occur in response to sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide over time, with Mycobacterium smegmatis being used as a model organism. A total of 3135 proteins were confidently assigned, of which 1713, 1674, and 1713 were identified under NO, H2O2, and control conditions, respectively. Both treatment conditions resulted in changes of protein expression from the DosR regulon as well as those related to lipid metabolism. Complementary to the changes in the proteome, sublethal exposure to NO and H2O2 improved the survival of the bacteria after macrophage infection. Our data indicate that pre-exposure to sublethal doses of these redox stressors causes an alteration in the expression of proteins related to lipid metabolism, suggesting a link between altered lipid metabolism and enhanced survival in macrophages.",Quantitative Model for Ion Transport and Cytoplasm Conductivity of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546044,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"In mammalian cells cytoplasm ion concentrations and hence cytoplasm conductivity is an important indicator of their physiological state. Changes in the cytoplasm conductivity has been associated with physiological changes such as progression of cancer and apoptosis. In this work, a model that predicts the effects of physiological changes in ion transport on the cytoplasm conductivity of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is demonstrated. We determined CHO-specific model parameters, Na+/K+ ATPase pumps and ion channels densities, using a flux assay approach. The obtained sodium (PNa), potassium (PK) and chloride (PCl) permeability and Na+/K+ ATPase pump density were estimated to be 5.6 × 10-8 cm/s, 5.6 × 10-8 cm/s, 3.2 × 10-7 cm/s and 2.56 × 10-11 mol/cm2, respectively. The model was tested by comparing the model predictions with the experimentally determined temporal changes in the cytoplasm conductivity of Na+/K+ ATPase pump inhibited CHO cells. Cells' Na+/K+ ATPase pumps were inhibited using 5 mM Ouabain and the temporal behavior of their cytoplasm conductivity was measured using dielectrophoresis cytometry. The measured results are in close agreement with the model-calculated values. This model will provide insight on the effects of processes such as apoptosis or external media ion concentration on the cytoplasm conductivity of mammalian cells."

To deconvolve the effects of age and obesity in an experimental model of prediabetes, we fed young and aged mice either chow or a short-term high-fat/high-sucrose Western diet (WD) and examined how weight, glucose tolerance, and β-cell function were affected. Although WD induced a similar degree of weight gain in young and aged mice, a high degree of heterogeneity was found exclusively in aged mice. Weight gain in WD-fed aged mice was well-correlated with glucose intolerance, fasting insulin, and in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, relationships that were not observed in young animals. Although β-cell mass expansion in the WD-fed aged mice was only three-quarters of that observed in young mice, the islets from aged mice were resistant to the sharp WD-induced decline in ex vivo insulin secretion observed in young mice. Our findings demonstrate that age is associated with the protection of islet function in diet-induced obese mice, and furthermore, that WD challenge exposes variability in the resilience of the insulin secretory pathway in aged mice.",Analysis of expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and its prognostic impact in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546030,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"The immune checkpoint based therapy targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its PD-L1 ligand has recently been approved for the therapy of different malignant conditions, but not yet for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). In this context, we evaluated the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in GEP-NETs and its potential correlations with clinical outcomes. Expression of PD-1/PD-L1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 116 GEP-NETs and 48 samples of peritumoral tissue. In addition, the expression of these molecules was assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with GEP-NETs (n = 32) and healthy controls (n = 32) and in intratumoral mononuclear cells (TMCs) (n = 3). Expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 6% and 1% of tumor tissue samples, respectively, and in 8% of peritumoral tissue samples, for both markers. We also observed that PD-1 expression by TMCs was associated with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and the levels of circulating PD-1+ PBMCs were associated with progressive disease upon follow-ups. In addition, circulating PD-1+ PBMCs were significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression by tumor cells. Our data suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 is expressed in 1 to 8% of GEP-NETs, and that this feature is significantly associated with disease evolution (p < 0.01).",The short-sequence design of DNA and its involvement in the 3-D structure of the genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546029,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Recent investigations have shown that isochores are characterized by a 3-D structure which is primarily responsible for the topology of chromatin domains. More precisely, an analysis of human chromosome 21 demonstrated that low-heterogeneity, GC-poor isochores are characterized by the presence of oligo-Adenines that are intrinsically stiff, curved and unfavorable for nucleosome binding. This leads to a structure of the corresponding chromatin domains, the Lamina Associated Domains, or LADs, which is well suited for interaction with the lamina. In contrast, the high-heterogeneity GC-rich isochores are in the form of compositional peaks and valleys characterized by increasing gradients of oligo-Guanines in the peaks and oligo-Adenines in the valleys that lead to increasing nucleosome depletions in the corresponding chromatin domains, the Topological Associating Domains, or TADs. These results encouraged us to investigate in detail the di- and tri-nucleotide profiles of 100 Kb segments of chromosome 21, as well as those of the di- to octa-Adenines and di- to octa-Guanines in some representative regions of the chromosome. The results obtained show that the 3-D structures of isochores and chromatin domains depend not only upon oligo-Adenines and oligo-Guanines but also, to a lower but definite extent, upon the majority of di- and tri-nucleotides. This conclusion has strong implications for the biological role of non-coding sequences.",Experimental Metabolic Syndrome Model Associated with Mechanical and Structural Degenerative Changes of the Aortic Valve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546028,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that an experimental high fat (HF) animal with metabolic syndrome results in structural degeneration of the aortic valve. Domestic pigs were divided (n = 12) and administered either a normal or HF diet. After 16-weeks, the HF diet group had increased weight (p ≤ 0.05), total cholesterol (p ≤ 0.05), and systolic and diastolic pressure (p ≤ 0.05). The aortic valve extracellular matrix showed loss of elastin fibers and increased collagen deposition in the HF diet group. Collagen was quantified with ELISA, which showed an increased concentration of collagen types 1 and 3 (p ≤ 0.05). In the HF diet group, the initial stages of microcalcification were observed. Uniaxial mechanical testing of aortic cusps revealed that the HF diet group expressed a decrease in ultimate tensile strength and elastic modulus compared to the control diet group (p ≤ 0.05). Western blot and immunohistochemistry indicated the presence of proteins: lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, osteopontin, and osteocalcin with an increased expression in the HF diet group. The current study demonstrates that experimental metabolic syndrome induced by a 16-week HF diet was associated with a statistically significant alteration to the physical architecture of the aortic valve.",Immobilization of cadmium and lead in contaminated paddy field using inorganic and organic additives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546027,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils has posed a risk to environment and human health. The present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of soil amendments for reducing cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L) in a contaminated field. The soil amendments used include lime, DaSan Yuan (DASY), DiKang No.1 (DEK1), biochar, Fe-biochar, Yirang, phosphorus fertilizer, (Green Stabilizing Agent) GSA-1, GSA-2, GSA-3, and GSA-4, applied at 1% rate in a field experiment. The results exposed that GSA-4 treatment showed best effects on reducing Cd and Pb phytoavailability in soil and uptake by early rice. Linear increase in pH (i.e. 5.69 to 6.75) was recorded in GSA-4 amended soil from sowing to the 3rd month of growth season. GSA-4 decreased DTPA extractable contents of cadmium (Cd) from 0.324 to 0.136 mg kg-1 soil and lead (Pb) from 53.21 to 24.68 mg kg-1 soil at 90 days of amendment. Treatment with GSA-4 improved rice growth (56%) and grains yield (42%). The enhancement effects on grain yield may be result from the positive effects of GSA-4 application on increasing photosynthesis (116%) and transpiration rate (152%) as compared to the control. Significant reduction in Cd and Pb uptake in shoot (42% and 44%) and in grains (77 and 88%), was observed, respectively in GSA-4 treatment as compared with the control. Moreover, negative correlation was recorded between DTPA extractable Cd/Pb and soil pH that directly depended on applied amendments. In short, use of combined amendment (GSA-4) was more effective for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated paddy field, and secures rice safe production, as compared other tested amendment products.","Convergent evolution of an extreme dietary specialisation, the olfactory system of worm-eating rodents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546026,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Turbinal bones are key components of the mammalian rostrum that contribute to three critical functions: (1) homeothermy, (2) water conservation and (3) olfaction. With over 700 extant species, murine rodents (Murinae) are the most species-rich mammalian subfamily, with most of that diversity residing in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Their evolutionary history includes several cases of putative, but untested ecomorphological convergence, especially with traits related to diet. Among the most spectacular rodent ecomorphs are the vermivores which independently evolved in several island systems. We used 3D CT-scans (N = 87) of murine turbinal bones to quantify olfactory capacities as well as heat or water conservation adaptations. We obtained similar results from an existing 2D complexity method and two new 3D methodologies that quantify bone complexity. Using comparative phylogenetic methods, we identified a significant convergent signal in the rostral morphology within the highly specialised vermivores. Vermivorous species have significantly larger and more complex olfactory turbinals than do carnivores and omnivores. Increased olfactory capacities may be a major adaptive feature facilitating rats' capacity to prey on elusive earthworms. The narrow snout that characterises vermivores exhibits significantly reduced respiratory turbinals, which may reduce their heat and water conservation capacities.",MicroRNAs derived from the insect virus HzNV-1 promote lytic infection by suppressing histone methylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546025,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Heliothis zea nudivirus-1 (HzNV-1) is an insect virus that can induce both lytic and latent infections in various insect cell lines. During latent infection, several microRNAs (miRNAs) are produced from persistency-associated gene 1 (pag1) as the only detectable HzNV-1 transcript. Previous studies have shown that the pag1 gene suppresses the immediate-early gene hhi1 and promotes host switching into a latent infection via miRNAs derived from pag1. Although other functions of the miRNAs derived from pag1 have not yet been elucidated, several studies have suggested that miRNAs encoded from latency-associated genes can regulate histone-associated enzymes. Because pag1 is a noncoding transcript, it potentially regulates host chromatin structure through miRNAs upon infection. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which pag1 alters viral infections remains unknown. In this study, we found that the pag1-encoded miRNA miR-420 suppresses expression of the histone modification-associated enzyme su(var)3-9. Therefore, this miRNA causes histone modification to promote HzNV-1 infection. These results suggest that HzNV-1 may directly influence epigenetic regulation in host cells through interactions with pag1 miRNAs to promote lytic infection. This study provides us with a better understanding of both the HzNV-1 infection pathway and the relationship between viral miRNAs and epigenetic regulation.",Epidemiological Characteristics of Atrial Fibrillation in Southern China: Results from the Guangzhou Heart Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546024,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Precise prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the associated risk factors in southern China are rarely reported. This large population-based follow-up study, the Guangzhou Heart Study, was conducted from 2015 to 2017 to fill up this gap. Permanent residents aged 35 years and above in Guangzhou city were enrolled and demographic factors of participants were collected by a structured questionnaire. Examinations of physical, electrocardiographic and biochemical indicators were performed following a standard operation procedure designed prior to the field investigation. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate basic characteristics of the study participants, and multivariate logistic regression model was performed to assess the AF prevalence-related factors. The detailed study design, the baseline characteristics and the prevalence of AF were reported here. In total, 12,013 residents were enrolled, and the percentage of participants from rural and urban areas was 53.92% and 46.08%, respectively. In total, 90.57% participants aged 40-79 years old and the proportion of women was more than men (64.98% vs. 35.02%). Overall, the prevalence of AF among the participants was 1.46%. Increasing age, male sex and widowed marital status were associated with higher AF prevalence (P-value < 0.05). The prevalence of AF increased with age and climbed to approximately 5% in residents aged 80 years and over. Residents with abnormal higher blood level of total cholesterol tended to have a lower AF prevalence but a higher prevalence of AF was observed in female participants with lower level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol land higher level uric acid (all P-value < 0.05). Personal illness such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and transient ischemic were significantly linked to the attack of AF (all P-value < 0.05). This study will be rich resource for investigating environmental exposure and individual genetic diathesis of AF and other common cardiovascular diseases in Chinese population.",Fresh-blood-free diet for rearing malaria mosquito vectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546023,Scientific reports,2018 12 23,"Mosquito breeding depends on the supply of fresh vertebrate blood, a major bottleneck for large-scale production of Anopheles spp. Feeding alternatives to fresh blood are thus a priority for research, outdoor large-cage trials and control interventions. Several artificial meal compositions were tested and Anopheles oogenesis, egg laying and development into the next generation of adult mosquitoes were followed. We identified blood-substitute-diets that supported ovarian development, egg maturation and fertility as well as, low progeny larval mortality, and normal development of offspring into adult mosquitoes. The formulated diet is an effective artificial meal, free of fresh blood that mimics a vertebrate blood meal and represents an important advance for the sustainability of Anopheles mosquito rearing in captivity.",Dopamine perturbation of gene co-expression networks reveals differential response in schizophrenia for translational machinery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546022,Translational psychiatry,2019 05 06,"The dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia (SZ) postulates that positive symptoms of SZ, in particular psychosis, are due to disturbed neurotransmission via the dopamine (DA) receptor D2 (DRD2). However, DA is a reactive molecule that yields various oxidative species, and thus has important non-receptor-mediated effects, with empirical evidence of cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration. Here we examine non-receptor-mediated effects of DA on gene co-expression networks and its potential role in SZ pathology. Transcriptomic profiles were measured by RNA-seq in B-cell transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from 514 SZ cases and 690 controls, both before and after exposure to DA ex vivo (100 μM). Gene co-expression modules were identified using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis for both baseline and DA-stimulated conditions, with each module characterized for biological function and tested for association with SZ status and SNPs from a genome-wide panel. We identified seven co-expression modules under baseline, of which six were preserved in DA-stimulated data. One module shows significantly increased association with SZ after DA perturbation (baseline: P = 0.023; DA-stimulated: P = 7.8 × 10-5; ΔAIC = -10.5) and is highly enriched for genes related to ribosomal proteins and translation (FDR = 4 × 10-141), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and neurodegeneration. SNP association testing revealed tentative QTLs underlying module co-expression, notably at FASTKD2 (top P = 2.8 × 10-6), a gene involved in mitochondrial translation. These results substantiate the role of translational machinery in SZ pathogenesis, providing insights into a possible dopaminergic mechanism disrupting mitochondrial function, and demonstrates the utility of disease-relevant functional perturbation in the study of complex genetic etiologies."

Here we show that the number of Treg cells is negatively regulated by the kinase Lkb1 in dendritic cells (DCs). Conditional knockout of the Lkb1 gene in DCs leads to excessive Treg cell expansion in multiple organs and dampens antigen-specific T cell immunity. Lkb1-deficient DCs are capable of enhancing, compared with wild-type DCs, Treg cell proliferation via cell-cell contact involving the IKK/IKBα-independent activation of the NF-κB/OX40L pathway. Intriguingly, treating wild-type mice with lipopolysaccharide selectively depletes Lkb1 protein in DCs, resulting in Treg cell expansion and suppressed inflammatory injury upon subsequent challenge. Loss of Lkb1 does not obviously upregulate proinflammatory molecules expression on DCs. We thus identify Lkb1 as a regulatory switch in DCs for controlling Treg cell homeostasis, immune response and tolerance.",Assessing the nature of the charge-transfer electronic states in organic solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546009,Nature communications,2018 12 19,"The charge-transfer electronic states appearing at the donor-acceptor interfaces in organic solar cells mediate exciton dissociation, charge generation, and charge recombination. To date, the characterization of their nature has been carried out on the basis of models that only involve the charge-transfer state and the ground state. Here, we demonstrate that it is essential to go beyond such a two-state model and to consider explicitly as well the electronic and vibrational couplings with the local absorbing state on the donor and/or acceptor. We have thus developed a three-state vibronic model that allows us: to provide a reliable description of the optical absorption features related to the charge-transfer states; to underline the erroneous interpretations stemming from the application of the semi-classical two-state model; and to rationalize how the hybridization between the local-excitation state and charge-transfer state can lead to lower non-radiative voltage losses and higher power conversion efficiencies.",Immune checkpoint inhibitors: recent progress and potential biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546008,Experimental & molecular medicine,2019 03 18,"Cancer growth and progression are associated with immune suppression. Cancer cells have the ability to activate different immune checkpoint pathways that harbor immunosuppressive functions. Monoclonal antibodies that target immune checkpoints provided an immense breakthrough in cancer therapeutics. Among the immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors showed promising therapeutic outcomes, and some have been approved for certain cancer treatments, while others are under clinical trials. Recent reports have shown that patients with various malignancies benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, mainstream initiation of immune checkpoint therapy to treat cancers is obstructed by the low response rate and immune-related adverse events in some cancer patients. This has given rise to the need for developing sets of biomarkers that predict the response to immune checkpoint blockade and immune-related adverse events. In this review, we discuss different predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, including immune cells, PD-L1 overexpression, neoantigens, and genetic and epigenetic signatures. Potential approaches for further developing highly reliable predictive biomarkers should facilitate patient selection for and decision-making related to immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies.",Integrative system biology analyses of CRISPR-edited iPSC-derived neurons and human brains reveal deficiencies of presynaptic signaling in FTLD and PSP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546007,Translational psychiatry,2019 05 08,"Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause autosomal dominant frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). MAPT p.R406W carriers present clinically with progressive memory loss and neuropathologically with neuronal and glial tauopathy. However, the pathogenic events triggered by the expression of the mutant tau protein remain poorly understood. To identify the genes and pathways that are dysregulated in FTLD-tau, we performed transcriptomic analyses in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying MAPT p.R406W and CRISPR/Cas9-corrected isogenic controls. We found that the expression of the MAPT p.R406W mutation was sufficient to create a significantly different transcriptomic profile compared with that of the isogeneic controls and to cause the differential expression of 328 genes. Sixty-one of these genes were also differentially expressed in the same direction between MAPT p.R406W carriers and pathology-free human control brains. We found that genes differentially expressed in the stem cell models and human brains were enriched for pathways involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and pre-synaptic function. The expression of GABA receptor genes, including GABRB2 and GABRG2, were consistently reduced in iPSC-derived neurons and brains from MAPT p.R406W carriers. Interestingly, we found that GABA receptor genes, including GABRB2 and GABRG2, are significantly lower in symptomatic mouse models of tauopathy, as well as in brains with progressive supranuclear palsy. Genome wide association analyses reveal that common variants within GABRB2 are associated with increased risk for frontotemporal dementia (P < 1 × 10-3). Thus, our systems biology approach, which leverages molecular data from stem cells, animal models, and human brain tissue can reveal novel disease mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that MAPT p.R406W is sufficient to induce changes in GABA-mediated signaling and synaptic function, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of FTLD-tau and other primary tauopathies.",Efficacy of arginine depletion by ADI-PEG20 in an intracranial model of GBM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546006,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a cancer with a poor prognosis and few effective therapeutic options. Successful medical management of GBM is limited by the restricted access of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the blood brain barrier (BBB). We previously showed that a subset of GBM are arginine auxotrophic because of transcriptional silencing of ASS1 and/or ASL and are sensitive to pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20). However, it is unknown whether depletion of arginine in peripheral blood in vivo has therapeutic activity against intracranial disease. In the present work, we describe the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 in an intracranial model of human GBM in which tumour growth and regression are assessed in real time by measurement of luciferase activity. Animals bearing intracranial human GBM tumours of varying ASS status were treated with ADI-PEG20 alone or in combination with temozolomide and monitored for tumour growth and regression. Monotherapy ADI-PEG20 significantly reduces the intracranial growth of ASS1 negative GBM and extends survival of mice carrying ASS1 negative GBM without obvious toxicity. The combination of ADI-PEG20 with temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrates enhanced effects in both ASS1 negative and ASS1 positive backgrounds.Our data provide proof of principle for a therapeutic strategy for GBM using peripheral blood arginine depletion that does not require BBB passage of drug and is well tolerated. The ability of ADI-PEG20 to cytoreduce GBM and enhance the effects of temozolomide argues strongly for its early clinical evaluation in the treatment of GBM.",Internal Hernia Associated with Colostomy After Laparoscopic Surgery for Rectal Malignancy: A Report of 3 Thought-Provoking Cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546005,The American journal of case reports,2019 03 26,"BACKGROUND Colostomy creation via intraperitoneal route is often performed during laparoscopic Hartmann's operation or abdominoperineal resection (APR). Herein, we report 3 rare cases of internal hernia associated with colostomy (IHAC). CASE REPORT The first case involved a 70-year-old man with IHAC after laparoscopic APR. Laparoscopy revealed the small intestine passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral abdominal wall in a cranial-to-caudal direction. The dislocated bowel with ischemic change was restored to its normal position and the lateral defect was covered with lateral peritoneum and greater omentum. The second case involved a 75-year-old man with IHAC after laparoscopic APR. Intraperitoneal findings were similar to those in the first case, except for the size of the lateral defect. This defect was too large for primary closure or patching; therefore, no surgical repair was performed. Unfortunately, this led to IHAC recurrence and creation of a new colostomy via extraperitoneal route. The third case involved an 85-year-old man with acute peritonitis resulting from IHAC after laparoscopic Hartmann's operation. Surgery revealed incarcerated bowels forming a closed loop and a perforation in the lifted sigmoid colon. The perforated colon was compressed by the dilated herniated bowel. The resected sigmoid colon showed perforation at the ulcer, which was shown on pathology to be caused by ischemia. CONCLUSIONS IHAC can lead not only to ischemia of strangulated bowel, but also to secondary damage to the lifted colon. During laparoscopic Hartmann's operation or APR, the colostomy should be created via extraperitoneal route to avoid IHAC.",Breast Cancer Cell Line Phenotype Affects Sonoporation Efficiency Under Optimal Ultrasound Microbubble Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546004,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 02 15,"BACKGROUND Ultrasound/microbubble (USMB)-mediated sonoporation is a new strategy with minimal procedural invasiveness for targeted and site-specific drug delivery to tumors. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of different breast cancer cell lines on sonoporation efficiency, and then to identify an optimal combination of USMB parameters to maximize the sonoporation efficiency for each tumor cell line. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three drug-sensitive breast cell lines - MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 - and 1 multidrug resistance (MDR) cell line - MCF-7/ADR - were chosen. An orthogonal array experimental design approach based on 3 levels of 3 parameters (A: microbubble concentration, 10%, 20%, and 30%, B: sound intensity, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 W/cm², C: irradiation time, 30, 60, and 90 s) was employed to optimize the sonoporation efficiency. RESULTS The optimal USMB parameter combinations for different cell lines were diverse. Under optimal parameter combinations, the maximum sonoporation efficiency differences between different breast tumor cell lines were statistically significant (MDA-MB-231: 46.70±5.79%, MDA-MB-468: 53.44±5.69%, MCF-7: 59.88±5.53%, MCF-7/ADR: 65.39±4.01%, P<0.05), so were between drug-sensitive cell line and MDR cell line (MCF-7: 59.88±5.53%, MCF-7/ADR: 65.39±4.01%, p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS Different breast tumor cell lines have their own optimal sonoporation. Drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells had higher sonoporation efficiency than drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells. The molecular subtype of tumors should be considered when sonoporation is applied, and optimal parameter combination may have the potential to improve drug-delivery efficiency by increasing the sonoporation efficiency.","Healthcare Resource Use, Cost, and Sick Leave Following Kidney Transplantation in Sweden: A Population-Based, 5-Year, Retrospective Study of Outcomes: COIN.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30546003,Annals of transplantation,2019 04 03,"BACKGROUND Improved understanding of the impact of kidney transplantation on healthcare resource use/costs and loss of productivity could aid decision making about funding allocation and resources needed for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in stage 5. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study utilizing data from Swedish national health registers of patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Primary outcomes were renal disease-related healthcare resource utilization and costs during the 5 years after transplantation. Secondary outcomes included total costs and loss of productivity. Regression analysis identified factors that influenced resource use, costs, and loss of productivity. RESULTS During the first year after transplantation, patients (N=3120) spent a mean of 25.7 days in hospital and made 21.6 outpatient visits; mean renal disease-related total cost was €66,014. During the next 4 years, resource use was approximately 70% (outpatient) to 80% (inpatient) lower, and costs were 75% lower. Before transplantation, 62.8% were on long-term sick leave, compared with 47.4% 2 years later. Higher resource use and costs were associated with age <10 years, female sex, graft from a deceased donor, prior hemodialysis, receipt of a previous transplant, and presence of comorbidities. Higher levels of sick leave were associated with female sex, history of hemodialysis, and type 1 diabetes. Overall 5-year graft survival was 86.7% (95% CI 85.3-88.2%). CONCLUSIONS After the first year following transplantation, resource use and related costs decreased, remaining stable for the next 4 years.

Dam1p, a subunit of the Dam1 complex, binds to microtubules and is regulated by Aurora B/Ipl1p phosphorylation. We find that overexpression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunits (i.e., TPK1, TPK2, TPK3) is lethal in DAM1 mutants and increases the rate of chromosome loss in wild-type cells. Replacing an evolutionarily conserved PKA site (S31) in Dam1p with a nonphosphorylatable alanine suppressed the high-copy PKA dosage lethality in dam1-1 Consistent with Dam1p as a target of PKA, we find that in vitro PKA can directly phosphorylate S31 in Dam1p and we observed phosphorylation of S31 in Dam1p purified from asynchronously growing yeast cells. Cells carrying high-copy TPK2 or a Dam1p phospho-mimetic S31D mutant displayed a reduction in Dam1p localization at the kinetochore, suggesting that PKA phosphorylation plays a role in assembly and/or stability of the Dam1 complex. Furthermore, we observed spindle defects associated with S31 phosphorylation. Finally, we find that phosphorylation of Dam1p on S31 is reduced when glucose is limiting as well as during α-factor arrest, conditions that inhibit PKA activity. These observations suggest that the PKA site of Dam1p participates in regulating kinetochore activity. While PKA is a well-established effector of glucose signaling, our work shows for the first time that glucose-dependent PKA activity has an important function in chromosome segregation.",Do All Patients With Polycythemia Vera or Essential Thrombocythemia Need Cytoreduction?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545998,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 06 03,"Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), characterized by expansion of normal blood counts, bleeding, thrombosis, and the potential for transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary goals of treatment for MPNs are to reduce the risk of thrombosis, alleviate systemic symptom burden (eg, fatigue, pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly), and to prevent transformation to MF/AML. Preventing transformation is clearly important, but not expected with current therapies. Currently, cytoreduction is advised based on vascular risk assessments, which include age and thrombosis history, as well as molecular profile in ET. Traditionally, cytoreduction has been advised only in patients with high vascular risk. Recently, a large prospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cytoreduction in patients with ET with less-than-high-risk vascular profiles. A larger question in the MPN field is whether cytoreduction is advisable for all patients with ET and PV, regardless of risk. This article reviews existing data on cytoreduction, evaluating hydroxyurea, interferons, and ruxolitinib in ET and PV. This review evaluates whether evidence supports a more liberal strategy of cytoreduction for all patients with ET and PV."

On a larger scale, we call for the development, expansion and promotion of patient associations to support patients and carers, lobby for access to best care and treatments, and provide input into the development of clinical trials and registries, focusing on the patients' perspective.",Pathophysiology of the right ventricle and of the pulmonary circulation in pulmonary hypertension: an update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545976,The European respiratory journal,2019 02 08,"The function of the right ventricle determines the fate of patients with pulmonary hypertension. Since right heart failure is the consequence of increased afterload, a full physiological description of the cardiopulmonary unit consisting of both the right ventricle and pulmonary vascular system is required to interpret clinical data correctly. Here, we provide such a description of the unit and its components, including the functional interactions between the right ventricle and its load. This physiological description is used to provide a framework for the interpretation of right heart catheterisation data as well as imaging data of the right ventricle obtained by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, an update is provided on the latest insights in the pathobiology of right ventricular failure, including key pathways of molecular adaptation of the pressure overloaded right ventricle. Based on these outcomes, future directions for research are proposed.",Clinical trial design and new therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545975,The European respiratory journal,2019 04 03,"Until 20 years ago the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was based on case reports and small series, and was largely ineffectual. As a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PAH evolved over the subsequent two decades, coupled with epidemiological studies defining the clinical and demographic characteristics of the condition, a renewed interest in treatment development emerged through collaborations between international experts, industry and regulatory agencies. These efforts led to the performance of robust, high-quality clinical trials of novel therapies that targeted putative pathogenic pathways, leading to the approval of more than 10 novel therapies that have beneficially impacted both the quality and duration of life. However, our understanding of PAH remains incomplete and there is no cure. Accordingly, efforts are now focused on identifying novel pathogenic pathways that may be targeted, and applying more rigorous clinical trial designs to better define the efficacy of these new potential treatments and their role in the management scheme. This article, prepared by a Task Force comprised of expert clinicians, trialists and regulators, summarises the current state of the art, and provides insight into the opportunities and challenges for identifying and assessing the efficacy and safety of new treatments for this challenging condition.",Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545974,The European respiratory journal,2019 02 07,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is frequent in left heart disease (LHD), as a consequence of the underlying condition. Significant advances have occurred over the past 5 years since the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in 2013, leading to a better understanding of PH-LHD, challenges and gaps in evidence. PH in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction represents the most complex situation, as it may be misdiagnosed with group 1 PH. Based on the latest evidence, we propose a new haemodynamic definition for PH due to LHD and a three-step pragmatic approach to differential diagnosis. This includes the identification of a specific ""left heart"" phenotype and a non-invasive probability of PH-LHD. Invasive confirmation of PH-LHD is based on the accurate measurement of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and, in patients with high probability, provocative testing to clarify the diagnosis. Finally, recent clinical trials did not demonstrate a benefit in treating PH due to LHD with pulmonary arterial hypertension-approved therapies.",Genetics and genomics of pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545973,The European respiratory journal,2019 06 10,"Since 2000 there have been major advances in our understanding of the genetic and genomics of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), although there remains much to discover. Based on existing knowledge, around 25-30% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic PAH have an underlying Mendelian genetic cause for their condition and should be classified as heritable PAH (HPAH). Here, we summarise the known genetic and genomic drivers of PAH, the insights these provide into pathobiology, and the opportunities afforded for development of novel therapeutic approaches. In addition, factors determining the incomplete penetrance observed in HPAH are discussed. The currently available approaches to genetic testing and counselling, and the impact of a genetic diagnosis on clinical management of the patient with PAH, are presented. Advances in DNA sequencing technology are rapidly expanding our ability to undertake genomic studies at scale in large cohorts. In the future, such studies will provide a more complete picture of the genetic contribution to PAH and, potentially, a molecular classification of this disease.",Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545972,The European respiratory journal,2019 02 07,"A revised diagnostic algorithm provides guidelines for the diagnosis of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension, both prior to and following referral to expert centres, and includes recommendations for expedited referral of high-risk or complicated patients and patients with confounding comorbidities.

The recent progress observed in medical therapy of PAH is not, therefore, related to the discovery of new pathways, but to the development of new strategies for combination therapy and on escalation of treatments based on systematic assessment of clinical response. The current treatment strategy is based on the severity of the newly diagnosed PAH patient as assessed by a multiparametric risk stratification approach. Clinical, exercise, right ventricular function and haemodynamic parameters are combined to define a low-, intermediate- or high-risk status according to the expected 1-year mortality. The current treatment algorithm provides the most appropriate initial strategy, including monotherapy, or double or triple combination therapy. Further treatment escalation is required in case low-risk status is not achieved in planned follow-up assessments.

However, PH remains an incurable condition with a high mortality rate, underscoring the need for a better transfer of novel scientific knowledge into healthcare interventions. Herein, we review recent findings in pathology (with the questioning of the strict morphological categorisation of various forms of PH into pre- or post-capillary involvement of pulmonary vessels) and cellular mechanisms contributing to the onset and progression of pulmonary vascular remodelling associated with various forms of PH.

In the case of an abnormal perfusion scan, a high-quality pulmonary angiogram is necessary to confirm and define the pulmonary vascular involvement and prior to making a treatment decision. PH is confirmed with right heart catheterisation, which is also necessary for treatment determination. In addition to chronic anticoagulation therapy, each patient with CTEPH should receive treatment assessment starting with evaluation for pulmonary endarterectomy, which is the guideline recommended treatment. For technically inoperable cases, PH-targeted medical therapy is recommended (currently riociguat based on the CHEST studies), and balloon pulmonary angioplasty should be considered at a centre experienced with this challenging but potentially effective and complementary intervention."

We found that TRPM8 is a pharmacological target of tacrolimus (FK506), a macrolide immunosuppressant with several clinical uses, including the treatment of organ rejection following transplants, treatment of atopic dermatitis, and dry eye disease. Tacrolimus is an inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, an action shared with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus activates TRPM8 channels in different species, including humans, and sensitizes their response to cold temperature by inducing a leftward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve. The effects of tacrolimus on purified TRPM8 in lipid bilayers demonstrates conclusively that it has a direct gating effect. Moreover, the lack of effect of cyclosporine rules out the canonical signaling pathway involving the phosphatase calcineurin. Menthol (TRPM8-Y745H)- and icilin (TRPM8-N799A)-insensitive mutants were also activated by tacrolimus, suggesting a different binding site. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, tacrolimus evokes an increase in intracellular calcium almost exclusively in cold-sensitive neurons, and these responses were drastically blunted in Trpm8 KO mice or after the application of TRPM8 antagonists. Cutaneous and corneal cold thermoreceptor endings are also activated by tacrolimus, and tacrolimus solutions trigger blinking and cold-evoked behaviors. Together, our results identify TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons as molecular targets of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. The actions of tacrolimus on TRPM8 resemble those of menthol but likely involve interactions with other channel residues.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT TRPM8 is a polymodal TRP channel involved in cold temperature sensing, thermoregulation, and cold pain. TRPM8 is also involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, and TRPM8 activation has antiallodynic and antipruritic effects, making it a prime therapeutic target in several cutaneous and neural diseases. We report the direct agonist effect of tacrolimus, a potent natural immunosuppressant with multiple clinical applications, on TRPM8 activity. This interaction represents a novel neuroimmune interface. The identification of a clinically approved drug with agonist activity on TRPM8 channels could be used experimentally to probe the function of TRPM8 in humans. Our findings may explain some of the sensory and anti-inflammatory effects described for this drug in the skin and the eye surface.",Amino acid substitutions in the human homomeric β3 GABAA receptor that enable activation by GABA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545943,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate synaptic inhibition throughout the central nervous system. The α1β2γ2 receptor is the major subtype in the brain; GABA binds at the β2(+)α1(-) interface. The structure of the homomeric β3 GABAAR, which is not activated by GABA, has been solved. Recently, four additional heteromeric structures were reported, highlighting key residues required for agonist binding. Here, we used a protein engineering method, taking advantage of knowledge of the key binding residues, to create a β3(+)α1(-) heteromeric interface in the homomeric human β3 GABAAR that enables GABA-mediated activation. Substitutions were made in the complementary side of the orthosteric binding site in loop D (Y87F and Q89R), loop E (G152T), and loop G (N66D and A70T). The Q89R and G152T combination enabled low-potency activation by GABA and potentiation by propofol but impaired direct activation by higher propofol concentrations. At higher concentrations, GABA inhibited gating of β3 GABAAR variants containing Y87F, Q89R, and G152T. Reversion of Phe87 to tyrosine abolished GABA's inhibitory effect and partially recovered direct activation by propofol. This tyrosine is conserved in homomeric GABAARs and in the Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel and may be essential for the absence of an inhibitory effect of GABA on homomeric channels. This work demonstrated that only two substitutions, Q89R and G152T, in β3 GABAAR are sufficient to reconstitute GABA-mediated activation and suggests that Tyr87 prevents inhibitory effects of GABA.",The trans-Golgi network is a major site for α-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein in primary neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545942,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed along the amyloidogenic pathway by the β-secretase, BACE1, generating β-amyloid (Aβ), or along the nonamyloidogenic pathway by α-secretase, precluding Aβ production. The plasma membrane is considered the major site for α-secretase-mediated APP cleavage, but other cellular locations have not been rigorously investigated. Here, we report that APP is processed by endogenous α-secretase at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of both transfected HeLa cells and mouse primary neurons. We have previously shown the adaptor protein complex, AP-4, and small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 5b (Arl5b) are required for efficient post-Golgi transport of APP to endosomes. We found here that AP-4 or Arl5b depletion results in Golgi accumulation of APP and increased secretion of the soluble α-secretase cleavage product sAPPα. Moreover, inhibition of γ-secretase following APP accumulation in the TGN increases the levels of the membrane-bound C-terminal fragments of APP from both α-secretase cleavage (α-CTF, named C83 according to its band size) and BACE1 cleavage (β-CTF/C99). The level of C83 was ∼4 times higher than that of C99, indicating that α-secretase processing is the major pathway and that BACE1 processing is the minor pathway in the TGN. AP-4 silencing in mouse primary neurons also resulted in the accumulation of endogenous APP in the TGN and enhanced α-secretase processing. These findings identify the TGN as a major site for α-secretase processing in HeLa cells and primary neurons and indicate that both APP processing pathways can occur within the TGN compartment along the secretory pathway.",Deuterium induces a distinctive Escherichia coli proteome that correlates with the reduction in growth rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545941,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"Substitution of protium (H) for deuterium (D) strongly affects biological systems. Whereas higher eukaryotes such as plants and mammals hardly survive a deuterium content of >30%, many microorganisms can grow on fully deuterated media, albeit at reduced rates. Very little is known about how the H/D replacement influences life at the systems level. Here, we used MS-based analysis to follow the adaptation of a large part of the Escherichia coli proteome from growth on a protonated full medium, over a protonated minimal medium, to a completely deuterated minimal medium. We could quantify >1800 proteins under all conditions, several 100 of which exhibited strong regulation during both adaptation processes. The adaptation to minimal medium strongly up-regulated amino acid synthesis and sugar metabolism and down-regulated translational proteins on average by 9%, concomitant with a reduction in growth rate from 1.8 to 0.67 h-1 In contrast, deuteration caused a very wide proteomic response over many cell functional categories, together with an additional down-regulation of the translational proteins by 5%. The latter coincided with a further reduction in growth rate to 0.37 h-1, revealing a clear linear correlation between growth rate and abundance of translational proteins. No significant morphological effects are observed under light and electron microscopies. Across all protein categories, about 80% of the proteins up-regulated under deuteration are enzymes with hydrogen transfer functions. Thus, the H/D kinetic isotope effect appears as the major limiting factor of cellular functions under deuteration.",An EmrB multidrug efflux pump in Burkholderia thailandensis with unexpected roles in antibiotic resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545940,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 13,"The antibiotic trimethoprim is frequently used to manage Burkholderia infections, and members of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family of efflux pumps have been implicated in multidrug resistance of this species complex. We show here that a member of the distinct Escherichia coli multidrug resistance B (EmrB) family is a primary exporter of trimethoprim in Burkholderia thailandensis, as evidenced by increased trimethoprim sensitivity after inactivation of emrB, the gene that encodes EmrB. We also found that the emrB gene is up-regulated following the addition of gentamicin and that this up-regulation is due to repression of the gene encoding OstR, a member of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family. The addition of the oxidants H2O2 and CuCl2 to B. thailandensis cultures resulted in OstR-dependent differential emrB expression, as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Specifically, OstR functions as a rheostat that optimizes emrB expression under oxidizing conditions, and it senses oxidants by a unique mechanism involving two vicinal cysteines and one distant cysteine (Cys3, Cys4, and Cys169) per monomer. Paradoxically, emrB inactivation increased resistance of B. thailandensis to tetracycline, a phenomenon that correlated with up-regulation of an RND efflux pump. These observations highlight the intricate mechanisms by which expression of genes that encode efflux pumps is optimized depending on cellular concentrations of antibiotics and oxidants.",Crystal structure of the m4-1BB/4-1BBL complex reveals an unusual dimeric ligand that undergoes structural changes upon 4-1BB receptor binding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545939,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 22,"The interaction between the receptor 4-1BB and its ligand 4-1BBL provides co-stimulatory signals for T-cell activation and proliferation. However, differences in the mouse and human molecules might result in differential engagement of this pathway. Here, we report the crystal structure of mouse 4-1BBL and of the mouse 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex, which together provided insights into the molecular mechanism by which m4-1BBL and its cognate receptor recognize each other. Unlike all human or mouse tumor necrosis factor ligands that form noncovalent and mostly trimeric assemblies, the m4-1BBL structure formed a disulfide-linked dimeric assembly. The structure disclosed that certain differences in the amino acid composition along the intramolecular interface, together with two specific residues (Cys-246 and Ser-256) present exclusively in m4-1BBL, are responsible for this unique dimerization. Unexpectedly, upon m4-1BB binding, m4-1BBL undergoes structural changes within each protomer; moreover, the individual m4-1BBL protomers rotate relative to each other, yielding a dimerization interface with more inter-subunit interactions. We also observed that in the m4-1BB/4-1BBL complex, each receptor monomer binds exclusively to a single ligand subunit with contributions of cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1), CRD2, and CRD3. Furthermore, structure-guided mutagenesis of the binding interface revealed that novel binding interactions with the GH loop, rather than the DE loop, are energetically critical and define the m4-1BB receptor selectivity for m4-1BBL. A comparison with the human 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex highlighted several differences between the ligand- and receptor-binding interfaces, providing an explanation for the absence of inter-species cross-reactivity between human and mouse 4-1BB and 4-1BBL molecules.",Allosteres to regulate neurotransmitter sulfonation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545938,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"Catecholamine neurotransmitter levels in the synapses of the brain shape human disposition-cognitive flexibility, aggression, depression, and reward seeking-and manipulating these levels is a major objective of the pharmaceutical industry. Certain neurotransmitters are extensively sulfonated and inactivated by human sulfotransferase 1A3 (SULT1A3). To our knowledge, sulfonation as a therapeutic means of regulating transmitter activity has not been explored. Here, we describe the discovery of a SULT1A3 allosteric site that can be used to inhibit the enzyme. The structure of the new site is determined using spin-label-triangulation NMR. The site forms a cleft at the edge of a conserved ∼30-residue active-site cap that must open and close during the catalytic cycle. Allosteres anchor into the site via π-stacking interactions with two residues that sandwich the planar core of the allostere and inhibit the enzyme through cap-stabilizing interactions with substituents attached to the core. Changes in cap free energy were calculated ab initio as a function of core substituents and used to design and synthesize a series of inhibitors intended to progressively stabilize the cap and slow turnover. The inhibitors bound tightly (34 nm to 7.4 μm) and exhibited progressive inhibition. The cap-stabilizing effects of the inhibitors were experimentally determined and agreed remarkably well with the theoretical predictions. These studies establish a reliable heuristic for the design of SULT1A3 allosteric inhibitors and demonstrate that the free-energy changes of a small, dynamic loop that is critical for SULT substrate selection and turnover can be calculated accurately.",Cholesterol increases protein levels of the E3 ligase MARCH6 and thereby stimulates protein degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545937,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"The E3 ligase membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 6 (MARCH6) is a polytopic enzyme bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. It controls levels of several known protein substrates, including a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, squalene monooxygenase. However, beyond its own autodegradation, little is known about how MARCH6 itself is regulated. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, MARCH6 overexpression, and immunoblotting, we found here that cholesterol stabilizes MARCH6 protein endogenously and in HEK293 cells that stably express MARCH6. Conversely, MARCH6-deficient HEK293 and HeLa cells lost their ability to degrade squalene monooxygenase in a cholesterol-dependent manner. The ability of cholesterol to boost MARCH6 did not seem to involve a putative sterol-sensing domain in this E3 ligase, but was abolished when either membrane extraction by valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) or proteasomal degradation was inhibited. Furthermore, cholesterol-mediated stabilization was absent in two MARCH6 mutants that are unable to degrade themselves, indicating that cholesterol stabilizes MARCH6 protein by preventing its autodegradation. Experiments with chemical chaperones suggested that this likely occurs through a conformational change in MARCH6 upon cholesterol addition. Moreover, cholesterol reduced the levels of at least three known MARCH6 substrates, indicating that cholesterol-mediated MARCH6 stabilization increases its activity. Our findings highlight an important new role for cholesterol in controlling levels of proteins, extending the known repertoire of cholesterol homeostasis players.","Structure, activation and dysregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor kinases: perspectives for clinical targeting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545934,Biochemical Society transactions,2019 03 18,"The receptor tyrosine kinase family of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) play crucial roles in embryonic development, metabolism, tissue homeostasis and wound repair via stimulation of intracellular signalling cascades. As a consequence of FGFRs' influence on cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, FGFR signalling is frequently dysregulated in a host of human cancers, variously by means of overexpression, somatic point mutations and gene fusion events. Dysregulation of FGFRs is also the underlying cause of many developmental dysplasias such as hypochondroplasia and achondroplasia. Accordingly, FGFRs are attractive pharmaceutical targets, and multiple clinical trials are in progress for the treatment of various FGFR aberrations. To effectively target dysregulated receptors, a structural and mechanistic understanding of FGFR activation and regulation is required. Here, we review some of the key research findings from the last couple of decades and summarise the strategies being explored for therapeutic intervention.",Ginsenosides Act As Positive Modulators of P2X4 Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545933,Molecular pharmacology,2019 06 14,"We investigated the selectivity of protopanaxadiol ginsenosides from Panax ginseng acting as positive allosteric modulators on P2X receptors. ATP-induced responses were measured in stable cell lines overexpressing human P2X4 using a YOPRO-1 dye uptake assay, intracellular calcium measurements, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Ginsenosides CK and Rd were demonstrated to enhance ATP responses at P2X4 by ∼twofold, similar to potentiation by the known positive modulator ivermectin. Investigations into the role of P2X4 in mediating a cytotoxic effect showed that only P2X7 expression in HEK-293 cells induces cell death in response to high concentrations of ATP, and that ginsenosides can enhance this process. Generation of a P2X7-deficient clone of BV-2 microglial cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing enabled an investigation of endogenous P2X4 in a microglial cell line. Compared with parental BV-2 cells, P2X7-deficient BV-2 cells showed minor potentiation of ATP responses by ginsenosides, and insensitivity to ATP- or ATP+ ginsenoside-induced cell death, indicating a primary role for P2X7 receptors in both of these effects. Computational docking to a homology model of human P2X4, based on the open state of zfP2X4, yielded evidence of a putative ginsenoside binding site in P2X4 in the central vestibule region of the large ectodomain."

Current subtractive manufacturing-based reconfigurable systems offer limited flexibility (limited finite number of discrete reconfiguration states) and have high fabrication cost and time requirements. Thus, this paper introduces an approach to solve the problem by combining additive manufacturing and origami principles to realize tunable electrical components that can be reconfigured over continuous-state ranges from folded (compact) to unfolded (large surface) configurations. Special ""bridge-like"" structures are introduced along the traces that increase their flexibility, thereby avoiding breakage during folding. These techniques allow creating truly flexible conductive traces that can maintain high conductivity even for large bending angles, further enhancing the states of reconfigurability. To demonstrate the idea, a Miura-Ori pattern is used to fabricate spatial filters-frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) with dipole resonant elements placed along the fold lines. The electrical length of the dipole elements in these structures changes when the Miura-Ori is folded, which facilitates tunable frequency response for the proposed shape-reconfigurable FSS structure. Higher-order spatial filters are realized by creating multilayer Miura-FSS configurations, which further increase the overall bandwidth of the structure. Such multilayer Miura-FSS structures feature the unprecedented capability of on-the-fly reconfigurability to different specifications (multiple bands, broadband/narrowband bandwidth, wide angle of incidence rejection), requiring neither specialized substrates nor highly complex electronics, holding frames, or fabrication processes.",Turbulent mixing: A perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545916,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2018 12 14,"Mixing of initially distinct substances plays an important role in our daily lives as well as in ecological and technological worlds. From the continuum point of view, which we adopt here, mixing is complete when the substances come together across smallest flow scales determined in part by molecular mechanisms, but important stages of the process occur via the advection of substances by an underlying flow. We know how smooth flows enable mixing but less well the manner in which a turbulent flow influences it; but the latter is the more common occurrence on Earth and in the universe. We focus here on turbulent mixing, with more attention paid to the postmixing state than to the transient process of initiation. In particular, we examine turbulent mixing when the substance is a scalar (i.e., characterized only by the scalar property of its concentration), and the mixing process does not influence the flow itself (i.e., the scalar is ""passive""). This is the simplest paradigm of turbulent mixing. Within this paradigm, we discuss how a turbulently mixed state depends on the flow Reynolds number and the Schmidt number of the scalar (the ratio of fluid viscosity to the scalar diffusivity), point out some fundamental aspects of turbulent mixing that render it difficult to be addressed quantitatively, and summarize a set of ideas that help us appreciate its physics in diverse circumstances. We consider the so-called universal and anomalous features and summarize a few model studies that help us understand them both.",Blocking IL-1β reverses the immunosuppression in mouse breast cancer and synergizes with anti-PD-1 for tumor abrogation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545915,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 25,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is abundant in the tumor microenvironment, where this cytokine can promote tumor growth, but also antitumor activities. We studied IL-1β during early tumor progression using a model of orthotopically introduced 4T1 breast cancer cells. Whereas there is tumor progression and spontaneous metastasis in wild-type (WT) mice, in IL-1β-deficient mice, tumors begin to grow but subsequently regress. This change is due to recruitment and differentiation of inflammatory monocytes in the tumor microenvironment. In WT mice, macrophages heavily infiltrate tumors, but in IL-1β-deficient mice, low levels of the chemokine CCL2 hamper recruitment of monocytes and, together with low levels of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), inhibit their differentiation into macrophages. The low levels of macrophages in IL-1β-deficient mice result in a relatively high percentage of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumors. In WT mice, IL-10 secretion from macrophages is dominant and induces immunosuppression and tumor progression; in contrast, in IL-1β-deficient mice, IL-12 secretion by CD11b+ DCs prevails and supports antitumor immunity. The antitumor immunity in IL-1β-deficient mice includes activated CD8+ lymphocytes expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, and granzyme B; these cells infiltrate tumors and induce regression. WT mice with 4T1 tumors were treated with either anti-IL-1β or anti-PD-1 Abs, each of which resulted in partial growth inhibition. However, treating mice first with anti-IL-1β Abs followed by anti-PD-1 Abs completely abrogated tumor progression. These data define microenvironmental IL-1β as a master cytokine in tumor progression. In addition to reducing tumor progression, blocking IL-1β facilitates checkpoint inhibition.",Effective design principles for leakless strand displacement systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545914,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 22,"Artificially designed molecular systems with programmable behaviors have become a valuable tool in chemistry, biology, material science, and medicine. Although information processing in biological regulatory pathways is remarkably robust to error, it remains a challenge to design molecular systems that are similarly robust. With functionality determined entirely by secondary structure of DNA, strand displacement has emerged as a uniquely versatile building block for cell-free biochemical networks. Here, we experimentally investigate a design principle to reduce undesired triggering in the absence of input (leak), a side reaction that critically reduces sensitivity and disrupts the behavior of strand displacement cascades. Inspired by error correction methods exploiting redundancy in electrical engineering, we ensure a higher-energy penalty to leak via logical redundancy. Our design strategy is, in principle, capable of reducing leak to arbitrarily low levels, and we experimentally test two levels of leak reduction for a core ""translator"" component that converts a signal of one sequence into that of another. We show that the leak was not measurable in the high-redundancy scheme, even for concentrations that are up to 100 times larger than typical. Beyond a single translator, we constructed a fast and low-leak translator cascade of nine strand displacement steps and a logic OR gate circuit consisting of 10 translators, showing that our design principle can be used to effectively reduce leak in more complex chemical systems.",Repeat variants for the SbMATE transporter protect sorghum roots from aluminum toxicity by transcriptional interplay in cis and trans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545913,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 18,"Acidic soils, where aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major agricultural constraint, are globally widespread and are prevalent in developing countries. In sorghum, the root citrate transporter SbMATE confers Al tolerance by protecting root apices from toxic Al3+, but can exhibit reduced expression when introgressed into different lines. We show that allele-specific SbMATE transactivation occurs and is caused by factors located away from SbMATE Using expression-QTL mapping and expression genome-wide association mapping, we establish that SbMATE transcription is controlled in a bipartite fashion, primarily in cis but also in trans Multiallelic promoter transactivation and ChIP analyses demonstrated that intermolecular effects on SbMATE expression arise from a WRKY and a zinc finger-DHHC transcription factor (TF) that bind to and trans-activate the SbMATE promoter. A haplotype analysis in sorghum RILs indicates that the TFs influence SbMATE expression and Al tolerance. Variation in SbMATE expression likely results from changes in tandemly repeated cis sequences flanking a transposable element (a miniature inverted repeat transposable element) insertion in the SbMATE promoter, which are recognized by the Al3+-responsive TFs. According to our model, repeat expansion in Al-tolerant genotypes increases TF recruitment and, hence, SbMATE expression, which is, in turn, lower in Al-sensitive genetic backgrounds as a result of lower TF expression and fewer binding sites. We thus show that even dominant cis regulation of an agronomically important gene can be subjected to precise intermolecular fine-tuning. These concerted cis/trans interactions, which allow the plant to sense and respond to environmental cues, such as Al3+ toxicity, can now be used to increase yields and food security on acidic soils.","HflXr, a homolog of a ribosome-splitting factor, mediates antibiotic resistance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545912,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 22,"To overcome the action of antibiotics, bacteria have evolved a variety of different strategies, such as drug modification, target mutation, and efflux pumps. Recently, we performed a genome-wide analysis of Listeria monocytogenes gene expression after growth in the presence of antibiotics, identifying genes that are up-regulated upon antibiotic treatment. One of them, lmo0762, is a homolog of hflX, which encodes a heat shock protein that rescues stalled ribosomes by separating their two subunits. To our knowledge, ribosome splitting has never been described as an antibiotic resistance mechanism. We thus investigated the role of lmo0762 in antibiotic resistance. First, we demonstrated that lmo0762 is an antibiotic resistance gene that confers protection against lincomycin and erythromycin, and that we renamed hflXr (hflX resistance). We show that hflXr expression is regulated by a transcription attenuation mechanism relying on the presence of alternative RNA structures and a small ORF encoding a 14 amino acid peptide containing the RLR motif, characteristic of macrolide resistance genes. We also provide evidence that HflXr is involved in ribosome recycling in presence of antibiotics. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes possesses another copy of hflX, lmo1296, that is not involved in antibiotic resistance. Phylogenetic analysis shows several events of hflXr duplication in prokaryotes and widespread presence of hflXr in Firmicutes. Overall, this study reveals the Listeria hflXr as the founding member of a family of antibiotic resistance genes. The resistance conferred by this gene is probably of importance in the environment and within microbial communities.",Ventral striatum's role in learning from gains and losses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545910,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 22,"Adaptive behavior requires animals to learn from experience. Ideally, learning should both promote choices that lead to rewards and reduce choices that lead to losses. Because the ventral striatum (VS) contains neurons that respond to aversive stimuli and aversive stimuli can drive dopamine release in the VS, it is possible that the VS contributes to learning about aversive outcomes, including losses. However, other work suggests that the VS may play a specific role in learning to choose among rewards, with other systems mediating learning from aversive outcomes. To examine the role of the VS in learning from gains and losses, we compared the performance of macaque monkeys with VS lesions and unoperated controls on a reinforcement learning task. In the task, the monkeys gained or lost tokens, which were periodically cashed out for juice, as outcomes for choices. They learned over trials to choose cues associated with gains, and not choose cues associated with losses. We found that monkeys with VS lesions had a deficit in learning to choose between cues that differed in reward magnitude. By contrast, monkeys with VS lesions performed as well as controls when choices involved a potential loss. We also fit reinforcement learning models to the behavior and compared learning rates between groups. Relative to controls, the monkeys with VS lesions had reduced learning rates for gain cues. Therefore, in this task, the VS plays a specific role in learning to choose between rewarding options.",RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545904,Plant physiology,2019 03 29,"Root hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root hairs and has a conserved role in root hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. In root hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that Os07g39940 plays a major role in root hair formation, based on observations of a short root hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using Os07g39940-OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root hairs were increased in Os07g39940-OX plants but were drastically reduced in the os07g39940 and rhl1 mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root hair development in rice.",VEGF expands erythropoiesis via hypoxia-independent induction of erythropoietin in noncanonical perivascular stromal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545903,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 01 08,"Insufficient erythropoiesis due to increased demand is usually met by hypoxia-driven up-regulation of erythropoietin (Epo). Here, we uncovered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a novel inducer of Epo capable of increasing circulating Epo under normoxic, nonanemic conditions in a previously unrecognized reservoir of Epo-producing cells (EPCs), leading to expansion of the erythroid progenitor pool and robust splenic erythropoiesis. Epo induction by VEGF occurs in kidney, liver, and spleen in a population of Gli1+SMA+PDGFRβ+ cells, a signature shared with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from mesenchymal stem cell-like progenitors. Surprisingly, inhibition of PDGFRβ signaling, but not VEGF signaling, abrogated VEGF-induced Epo synthesis. We thus introduce VEGF as a new player in Epo induction and perivascular Gli1+SMA+PDGFRβ+ cells as a previously unrecognized EPC reservoir that could be harnessed for augmenting Epo synthesis in circumstances such as chronic kidney disease where production by canonical EPCs is compromised.",Hierarchical assembly and disassembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545902,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 01 09,"Expression of Rag1 and Rag2 is tightly regulated in developing T cells to mediate TCR gene assembly. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and disassembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus chromatin hub in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Rag1 and Rag2 gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Rag1 and Rag2 promoter activation by a distant antisilencer element (ASE). We identify GATA3 and E2A as critical regulators of the ASE, and Runx1 and E2A as critical regulators of the Rag1 promoter. We reveal hierarchical assembly of a transcriptionally active chromatin hub containing the ASE and RAG promoters, with Rag2 recruitment and expression dependent on assembly of a functional ASE-Rag1 framework. Finally, we show that signal-dependent down-regulation of RAG gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Ikaros and occurs with disassembly of the RAG locus chromatin hub. Our results provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate RAG gene expression in developing T cells."

We then optically patterned these scaffolds in three dimensions, attached one or more functional materials, and then shrank and dehydrated them in a controlled way to achieve nanoscale feature sizes in a solid substrate. We demonstrate that our process, Implosion Fabrication (ImpFab), can directly write highly conductive, 3D silver nanostructures within an acrylic scaffold via volumetric silver deposition. Using ImpFab, we achieve resolutions in the tens of nanometers and complex, non-self-supporting 3D geometries of interest for optical metamaterials.",Revealing hidden spin-momentum locking in a high-temperature cuprate superconductor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545882,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 03 18,"Cuprate superconductors have long been thought of as having strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that one of the most studied cuprate superconductors, Bi2212, has a nontrivial spin texture with a spin-momentum locking that circles the Brillouin zone center and a spin-layer locking that allows states of opposite spin to be localized in different parts of the unit cell. Our findings pose challenges for the vast majority of models of cuprates, such as the Hubbard model and its variants, where spin-orbit interaction has been mostly neglected, and open the intriguing question of how the high-temperature superconducting state emerges in the presence of this nontrivial spin texture.",Comprehensive functional genomic resource and integrative model for the human brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545857,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 23,"Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains ~79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with >88% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by ~6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.","Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545856,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 10,"Most genetic risk for psychiatric disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing.

More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression.

Prenatal neocortical transcriptomic patterns revealed transient topographic gradients, whereas postnatal patterns largely reflected functional hierarchy.

In contrast to coding mutations, no noncoding functional annotation category, analyzed in isolation, was significantly associated with ASD. Casting noncoding variation in the context of a de novo risk score across multiple annotation categories, however, did demonstrate association with mutations localized to promoter regions. We found that the strongest driver of this promoter signal emanates from evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites distal to the transcription start site.

Transgenic-based CRISPRa targeting of the Sim1 promoter or its distant hypothalamic enhancer up-regulated its expression from the endogenous functional allele in a tissue-specific manner, rescuing the obesity phenotype in Sim1 heterozygous mice. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of CRISPRa, we injected CRISPRa-recombinant adeno-associated virus into the hypothalamus, which led to reversal of the obesity phenotype in Sim1 and Mc4r haploinsufficient mice.

Microvascular lesions caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes/red blood cells are hallmarks of severe pathogenesis contributing to high mortality, particularly in children from sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we used a phage display complementary DNA library screening strategy to identify P falciparum glutamic acid-rich protein (PfGARP) as a secreted ligand that recognizes an ectodomain of human erythrocyte anion-exchanger, band 3/AE1, as a host receptor. Domain mapping of PfGARP revealed distinct nonoverlapping repeats encoding the immune response epitopes and core erythrocyte-binding activity. Synthetic peptides derived from the erythrocyte-binding repeats of PfGARP induced erythrocyte aggregation reminiscent of the rosetting phenomenon. Using peptides derived from the immunogenic repeats, a quantitative immunoassay was developed to detect a selective immune response against PfGARP in human plasma samples obtained from patients in rural Mali, suggesting the feasibility of PfGARP as a potential biomarker of disease progression. Collectively, our results suggest that PfGARP may play a functional role in enhancing the adhesive properties of human erythrocytes by engaging band 3 as a host receptor.

Response to these agents occurs in ∼50% of treated patients, and duration of response, although variable, is transient. Prediction of response to HMAs is possible with clinical and molecular parameters, but alternative approved treatments are not available, and in the case of HMA failure, there are no standard therapeutic opportunities. It is important to develop a reasoned choice of therapy after HMA failure. This choice should be based on evaluation of type of resistance (primary vs secondary, progression of disease [acute leukemia or higher risk MDS] vs absence of hematological improvement) as well as on molecular and cytogenetic characteristics reassessed at the moment of HMA failure. Rescue strategies may include stem-cell transplantation, which remains the only curative option, and chemotherapy, both of which are feasible in only a minority of cases, and experimental agents. Patients experiencing HMA failure should be recruited to clinical experimental trials as often as possible. Several novel agents with different mechanisms of action are currently being tested in this setting. Drugs targeting molecular alterations (IDH2 mutations, spliceosome gene mutations) or altered signaling pathways (BCL2 inhibitors) seem to be the most promising.","Affimer proteins as a tool to modulate fibrinolysis, stabilize the blood clot, and reduce bleeding complications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545831,Blood,2019 06 10,"Bleeding complications secondary to surgery, trauma, or coagulation disorders are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Although fibrin sealants are considered to minimize blood loss, this is not widely adopted because of its high cost and/or risk for infection. We present a novel methodology employing nonantibody fibrinogen-binding proteins, termed Affimers, to stabilize fibrin networks with the potential to control excessive bleeding. Two fibrinogen-specific Affimer proteins, F5 and G2, were identified and characterized for their effects on clot structure/fibrinolysis, using turbidimetric and permeation analyses and confocal and electron microscopy. Binding studies and molecular modeling identified interaction sites, whereas plasmin generation assays determined effects on plasminogen activation. In human plasma, F5 and G2 prolonged clot lysis time from 9.8 ± 1.1 minutes in the absence of Affimers to 172.6 ± 7.4 and more than 180 minutes (P < .0001), respectively, and from 7.6 ± 0.2 to 28.7 ± 5.8 (P < .05) and 149.3 ± 9.7 (P < .0001) minutes in clots made from purified fibrinogen. Prolongation in fibrinolysis was consistent across plasma samples from healthy control patients and individuals at high bleeding risk. F5 and G2 had a differential effect on clot structure and G2 profoundly altered fibrin fiber arrangement, whereas F5 maintained physiological clot structure. Affimer F5 reduced fibrin-dependent plasmin generation and was predicted to bind fibrinogen D fragment close to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; residues γ312-324) and plasminogen (α148-160) binding sites, thus interfering with tPA-plasminogen interaction and representing 1 potential mechanism for modulation of fibrinolysis.

Switchings can be classified into two categories depending on their dwell time, which are the switching without divergence time and the switching with divergence time. Based on this, stability conditions under the bounded maximum average dwell time (BMADT) switching are established. In addition, by jointly considering the dynamic characteristics of the subsystems before and after switching instants, we also give the stability result via the dwell time with the floating lower and upper bounds. Finally, some simulation results are given to illustrate the advantages of the obtained theoretical results.",Robust observer based Fault Tolerant Tracking Control for T-S uncertain systems subject to sensor and actuator faults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545772,ISA transactions,2019 04 29,"This paper investigates the sensor and actuator fault (SAF) estimations and the fault tolerant tracking control (FTTC) problem for uncertain systems represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model affected by Unknown Bounded Disturbance (UBD). A robust descriptor adaptive observer based FTTC is firstly designed to simultaneously estimate the unmeasurable system states and SAF vectors and then to track reference trajectories. Sufficient design conditions are developed in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The gains of both observer and fault tolerant controller are computed by solving a set of LMI constraints in single step. Robustness against external disturbances is analysed using the H∞ performance index to attenuate its effect on the tracking error for bounded reference inputs. Finally, simulation results are illustrated by considering three types of actuator faults.

This control strategy uses a generalized predictive controller, whose main method is to minimize a multistage cost function defined over a prediction horizon. Furthermore, to implement this controller in the framework of the sensorless control from the only measurement of the liquid level in the bottom tank, an adaptive interconnected high gain observer is developed for estimating the liquid level in the upper tank and the two constant parameters of the system. Two design features are worth to be emphasized. Firstly, the control calibration is achieved through the tuning of only two scalar design parameters. Secondly, the exponential convergence to zero of the state observation and parameter estimation errors is established under a well defined condition. Finally, the theoretical results are corroborated through simulation and experimental results which highlight the efficiency and applicability of the proposed observer-controller scheme.",Adaptive sliding mode current control with sliding mode disturbance observer for PMSM drives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545769,ISA transactions,2019 04 29,"This paper focuses on the current control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for electric drives with model uncertainties and external disturbances. To improve the performance of the PMSM current loop in terms of the speed of response, tracking accuracy, and robustness, a hybrid control strategy is proposed by combining the adaptive sliding mode control and sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO). An adaptive law is introduced in the sliding mode current controller to improve the dynamic response speed of the current loop and robustness of the PMSM drive system to the existing parameter variations. The SMDO is used as a compensator to restrain the external disturbances and reduce the sliding mode control gains. Experiments results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can guarantee strong anti-disturbance capability of the PMSM drive system with improved current and speed-tracking performance.",A combined mono- and multi-turbine approach for fault indicator synthesis and wind turbine monitoring using SCADA data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545768,ISA transactions,2019 04 05,"The monitoring of wind turbines using SCADA data has received lately a growing interest from the fault diagnosis community because of the very low cost of these data, which are available in number without the need for any additional sensor. Yet, these data are highly variable due to the turbine constantly changing its operating conditions and to the rapid fluctuations of the environmental conditions (wind speed and direction, air density, turbulence, …). This makes the occurrence of a fault difficult to detect. To address this problem, we propose a multi-level (turbine and farm level) strategy combining a mono- and a multi-turbine approach to create fault indicators insensitive to both operating and environmental conditions. At the turbine level, mono-turbine residuals (i.e. a difference between an actual monitored value and the predicted one) obtained with a normal behavior model expressing the causal relations between variables from the same single turbine and learnt during a normal condition period are calculated for each turbine, so as to get rid of the influence of the operating conditions. At the farm level, the residuals are then compared to a wind farm reference in a multi-turbine approach to obtain fault indicators insensitive to environmental conditions. Indicators for the objective performance evaluation are also proposed to compare wind turbine fault detection methods, which aim at evaluating the cost/benefit of the methods from a production manager's point of view. The performance of the proposed combined mono- and multi-turbine method is evaluated and compared to more classical methods proposed in the literature on a large real data set made of SCADA data recorded on a French wind farm during four years : it is shown than it can improve the fault detection performance when compared to a residual analysis limited at the turbine level only.",Resilient guaranteed cost control for uncertain T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delays and Markov jump parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545767,ISA transactions,2019 04 29,"This paper aims to investigate the problem of resilient guaranteed cost control for uncertain Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with Markov jump parameters and time-varying delay. A resilient mode-dependent fuzzy controller is designed and a weak sufficient condition is developed to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is robust almost surely asymptotically stable with guaranteed cost index not exceeding the specified upper bound. Subsequently, the controller gain and upper bound of the guaranteed cost index can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical and practical examples of the single-link robot arm system are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",Fitting of experimental data using a fractional Kalman-like observer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545766,ISA transactions,2019 04 29,"In this paper, a fractional order Kalman filter (FOKF) is presented, this is based on a system expressed by fractional differential equations according to the Riemann-Liouville definition.

The purpose of using the CS algorithm is to optimize the order of the observer, the fractional Riccati equation and the FOKF tuning parameters. The Grünwald-Letnikov approximation was used to compute the numerical solution of the FOKF. To show the effectiveness of the proposed FOKF, four examples are presented, the brain activity, the cutaneous potential recordings of a pregnant woman, the earthquake acceleration, and the Chua's circuit response.","Abdominal obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome in U.S. adolescents: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545765,Annals of epidemiology,2019 04 13,"The objectives were to use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to (1) estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors (elevated blood pressure, triglycerides, blood glucose, and low HDL cholesterol); (2) estimate the prevalence of MetS using three common definitions; and (3) compare the odds of MetS risk factors/MetS when using different measures of abdominal obesity (sagittal abdominal diameter [SAD] versus waist circumference [WC]) among U.S. adolescents.",Does diabetes decrease the risk of glioma?

The influence of extracellular polymeric substances in the electricity generation has also been studied. In a double-chambered setup, maximum open circuit voltages were measured as 0.602 and 0.488 V with mediator and without mediator cell, respectively, whereas maximum power densities were measured as 1.23 μWcm-2 and 0.407 μWcm-2, respectively. In addition, maximum open circuit voltages were observed as 0.40 and 0.397 V in a single-chambered fuel cell with and without mediator, respectively. The maximum power density was recorded 1.64 μWcm-2 in the presence of a mediator, whereas the same was found as 0.643 μWcm-2 in the absence of mediator.

The control of ND relies on proper vaccination strategies. The vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) mainly belong to genotype I, II or III, which cannot fully prohibit virus shedding against the prevalent genotype VII virulent strain attack. To develop a safe, genotype matched vaccine candidate, we employed a bac-to-bac expression system and constructed a genotype VII NDV strain based virus-like particles (NDV VLPs). It was constructed with NDV M protein as the skeleton, and protective antigen F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The NDV VLPs exhibited a similar appearance to the live NDV particles, but with denser F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The immunization assay indicated that NDV VLPs stimulated a longer protection period, less tissue virus loading and shorter virus shedding period than the commercialized LaSota-formulated vaccine when challenged with genotype VII NDV strain. These results proposed the potential role of NDV VLPs as an alternative to current live genotype unmatched vaccine for the control and eliminate NDV in the avian flocks.",Strengthening national vaccine decision-making: Assessing the impact of SIVAC Initiative support on national immunisation technical advisory group (NITAG) functionality in 77 low and middle-income countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545715,Vaccine,2019 01 23,"National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) are multi-disciplinary expert groups that provide policy-makers with independent, evidence-based advice on vaccination.

The amygdala is a key region for social functioning and alterations in amygdala structure and connectivity are thought to underlie social functioning deficits in many disorders, including preterm birth. However, functional connectivity of the amygdala and its association with social impairments is not well-studied in preterm participants (PTs). In a group of late adolescents born very PT (600-1250 g birth weight), measures of social and emotional development were examined using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) administered at age 16 (66 term and 161 preterm participants), the Youth Self Report (YSR) administered at age 16 (56 term and 45 preterm participants), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) administered at age 18 (71 term and 190 preterm participants). Amygdala functional connectivity was also examined using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at age 20 (17 term and 19 preterm participants). By parent report, preterm-born adolescents demonstrate increased social impairment compared to their term-born peers. Amygdala connectivity is altered for those prematurely-born, and markers of social functioning correlate with altered amygdala-PCC connectivity. These findings add to knowledge regarding the developmental trajectory of amygdala connectivity in PT and suggest a possible neural underpinning for the well-characterized social impairment experienced by prematurely-born individuals.",Exploring individual multiple sclerosis lesion volume change over time: Development of an algorithm for the analyses of longitudinal quantitative MRI measures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545687,NeuroImage.

We present a study on an aquatic ecosystem of the Revelva catchment (Spitsbergen), based on samples collected from the lake, river and their tributaries, in the summer of 2016. The landscape variety of the study site and the seasonal change in the hydrological regime modify the availability of nutrients. In general, the upper part of the catchment consists of the mountain rocky slopes which are especially abundant in iron minerals, sulphides and phosphorus minerals. The lower part of the catchment is covered by plants - lichens, saxifrages and bryophytes, which are a different source of nutrients. In the analysed water samples, the maximum concentrations of nutrients such as iron, boron and phosphorus were 0.28 μg L-1, 4.52 μg L-1 and 1.91 μg L-1, respectively, in June, while in September, Fe and B reached the concentrations of 1.32 μg L-1 and 2.71 μg L-1, respectively. The concentration of P in September was below the detection limit of 1.00 μg L-1, which may be explained by the necessity of bacteria to consume it immediately on current needs. We noted also an increase in TOC concentration between the June and September samples, which could originate both from the biomass accumulation in the catchment and the permafrost melting contributing to the hydrological regime of the river. The bacterial community developed in this environment consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum, while the presence of Acidobacteria was less pronounced than in other tundra-related environments. The described catchment shows that despite the relatively small amount of bioavailable nutrients, the Revelva system is biodiverse and one of the most significant biogeochemical changes occurs there in response to seasonally switching water sources.",Role of hyperglycaemia in the relationship between serum osteocalcin levels and relative skeletal muscle index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545664,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2018 12 14,Studies have shown that osteocalcin is involved in energy metabolism and is sufficient to prevent age-related muscle loss.

Recent studies using Asxl1 knockout mice revealed that Asxl1 is important for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and the development of organs. Although we previously reported Asxl1 as a Sox2 target gene, its function in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains largely unknown. For this purpose, we isolated ESCs from the blastocyst inner cell mass of Asxl1-/- mice. Asxl1 deficiency in ESCs exhibited no effect on cell proliferation, expression of core pluripotent transcription factors, or alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting dispensability of Asxl1 for self-renewal of ESCs. By contrast, the differentiation of Asxl1-/- ESCs was significantly affected as shown by size reductions of embryoid bodies accompanied with apoptosis, aberrant expression of differentiation genes, downregulation of bivalent neurogenesis genes, and abnormal axon formation in neurons. Overall, our findings indicated that Asxl1 played a critical role in regulating genes associated with neural differentiation without affecting self-renewal of mouse ESCs.",Lipid storage and lipophagy regulates ferroptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545638,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 02,"The synthesis, storage, and degradation of lipids are highly regulated processes. Impaired lipid metabolism is implicated in inflammation and cell death. Although ferroptosis is a recently described form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, the impact of lipid droplets on ferroptosis remains unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that lipophagy, the autophagic degradation of intracellular lipid droplets, promotes RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death in hepatocytes. Lipid droplet accumulation is increased at the early stage but decreased at the late stage of ferroptosis in mouse or human hepatocytes. Importantly, either genetically enhancing TPD52-dependent lipid storage or blocking ATG5-and RAB7A-dependent lipid degradation prevents RSL3-induced lipid peroxidation and subsequent ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. These studies support an antioxidant role for lipid droplets in cell death and suggest novel strategies for the inhibition of ferroptosis by targeting the lipophagy pathway.",Identification of putative odorant binding proteins in the peach fruit borer Carposina sasakii Matsumura (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) by transcriptome analysis and their expression profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545637,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 02,"The peach fruit borers Carposina sasakii Matsumura (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) are serious fruit borers in East Asia. Odorants have been reported to elicit their olfactory responses, including sex pheromone and host plant volatiles. However, little is known about their molecular aspects of olfactory perception to these odorants. Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) are believed to play an important role in insect olfaction, which recognize and bind odorants, and transport them to odorant receptors located on olfactory neurons. We identified 12 putative OBPs (CsasOBP1-12) expressed in intact heads (with antennae and mouthparts) of C. sasakii adult males and females by transcriptome analysis, including 4 putative pheromone binding proteins (PBPs) (CsasOBP1-2, 7, 11) and 4 putative general odorant binding proteins (GOBPs) (CsasOBP6, 9-10, 12). A phylogenetic tree was constructed to characterize these OBPs. An analysis using fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that CsasOBP3, 5, 7, 9-12 have the highest expression level in the intact heads, suggesting that among them there may be the OBPs playing key roles in C. sasakii olfaction. In the 7 OBPs, CsasOBP5, 7, 11-12 have higher level of expressions in intact heads of C. sasakii adult males than females, while CsasOBP3, 9-10 are expressed equally in the two sexes. Moreover, CsasOBP2 is expressed dominantly in the intact heads and wings, with an equal level between them. CsasOBP8 expression is highest in the wings, while CsasOBP1, 4, 6 are expressed dominantly in the abdomens.

However, it is not very clear whether brain-derived 5-HT is involved in the regulation of colonic motility. In this study, we used central 5-HT knockout (KO) mice to investigate whether brain-derived 5-HT mediates colonic motility, and if so, whether it involves oxytocin (OT) production in the hypothalamus and OT receptor in the colon. Colon transit time was prolonged in KO mice. The OT levels in the hypothalamus and serum were decreased significantly in the KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. OT increased colonic smooth muscle contraction in both KO and WT mice, and the effects were blocked by OT receptor antagonist and tetrodotoxin but not by hexamethonium or atropine. Importantly, the OT-induced colonic smooth muscle contraction was decreased significantly in the KO mice relative to WT. The OT receptor expression of colon was detected in colonic myenteric plexus of mice. Central 5-HT is involved in the modulation of colonic motility which may modulate through its regulation of OT synthesis in the hypothalamus. Our results reveal a central 5-HT - hypothalamus OT - colonic OT receptor axis, providing a new target for the treatment of brain-gut dysfunction.",NtPR1a regulates resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum in Nicotiana tabacum via activating the defense-related genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545635,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"Pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) are associated with the development of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against further infection enforced by fungi, bacteria and viruses. PR1a is the first PR-1 member that could be purified and characterized. Previous studies have reported its role in plants' resistance system against oomycete pathogens. However, the role of PR1a in Solanaceae plants against the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum remains unclear. To assess roles of NtPR1a in tobacco responding to R. solanacearum, we performed overexpression experiments in Yunyan 87 plants (a susceptible tobacco cultivar). The results illuminated that overexpression of NtPR1a contributed to improving resistance to R. solanacearum in tobacco Yunyan 87. Specifically speaking, NtPR1a gene could be induced by exogenous hormones like salicylic acid (SA) and pathogenic bacteria R. Solanacearum. Moreover, NtPR1a-overexpressing tobacco significantly reduced multiple of R. solanacearum and inhibited the development of disease symptoms compared with wild-type plants. Importantly, overexpression of NtPR1a activated a series of defense-related genes expression, including the hypersensitive response (HR)-associated genes NtHSR201 and NtHIN1, SA-, JA- and ET-associated genes NtPR2, NtCHN50, NtPR1b, NtEFE26, and Ntacc oxidase, and detoxification-associated gene NtGST1. In summary, our results suggested that NtPR1a-enhanced tobacco resistance to R. solanacearum may be mainly dependent on activation of the defense-related genes.",Effect of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication on TGF-β induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545634,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process in which epithelial cells lose cell polarity and cell adhesion with surrounding cells to obtain migratory and invasive abilities. On the other hand, the expression of connexin is decreased or lacked in the many types of tumor cells. This study examined the effect of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) on EMT induced by the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). To investigate the effect of GJIC on EMT in U2OS cells, smooth muscle 22-α (sm22α) promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene was introduced into Cx43-expressing cells (U2OS-Luc Cx43) and into the control parental cell line (U2OS-Luc). TGF-β1 induced the expression of EMT markers and the sm22α promoter activity of U2OS-Luc cells. Sm22α promoter activity of U2OS cells was neither dependent on the expression of Cx43 nor on the establishment of GJIC among U2OS cells. Furthermore, we found that the homocellular communication among tumor cells did not affected the tumor cell growth and migration. However, we revealed that tumor cell density was an important factor for tumor cells to acquire metastatic phenotype. Interestingly, the co-culture of U2OS cells with osteoblasts revealed that sm22α promoter activity was inhibited only by the GJIC established between these two cell types. These results suggest that normal osteoblast cells negatively regulate the EMT of tumor cells, at least in part. Thus, Cx43-mediated GJIC may have anti-metastatic activity in tumor cells. Our findings provide a new insight into the role of GJIC in cancer progression and metastasis and identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer.",Loss of μ-crystallin causes PPARγ activation and obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545633,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"The thyroid hormone-binding protein μ-crystallin (CRYM) mediates thyroid hormone action by sequestering triiodothyronine in the cytoplasm and regulating the intracellular concentration of thyroid hormone. As thyroid hormone action is closely associated with glycolipid metabolism, it has been proposed that CRYM may contribute to this process by reserving or releasing triiodothyronine in the cytoplasm. We aimed to clarify the relationship between CRYM and glycolipid metabolism by comparing wild-type and CRYM knockout mice fed a high-fat diet. Each group was provided a high-fat diet for 10 weeks, and then their body weight and fasting blood glucose levels were measured. Although no difference in body weight was observed between the two groups with normal diet, the treatment with a high-fat diet was found to induce obesity in the knockout mice. The knockout group displayed increased dietary intake, white adipose tissue, fat cell hypertrophy, and hyperglycemia in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. In CRYM knockout mice, liver fat deposits were more pronounced than in the control group. Enhanced levels of PPARγ, which is known to cause fatty liver, and ACC1, which is a target gene for thyroid hormone and is involved in the fat synthesis, were also detected in the livers of CRYM knockout mice. These observations suggest that CRYM deficiency leads to obesity and lipogenesis, possibly in part through increasing the food intake of mice fed a high-fat diet.",Autophagy in FOXD1 stroma-derived cells regulates renal fibrosis through TGF-β and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545632,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"Renal fibrosis is the final common pathway of various renal injuries and it leads to chronic kidney disease. Recent studies reported that FOXD1-lineage pericyte plays a critical role in tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). However the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear.

To investigate the role of autophagy in FOXD1-lineage pericytes on renal TIF, we generated the FOXD1-lineage stromal cell-specific Atg7 deletion (Atg7△FOXD1) mice. FOXD1-lineage stromal cell-specific Atg7 deletion enhanced renal TIF through Smad-dependent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). FOXD1-lineage stromal cell-specific Atg7 deletion increased the accumulation of interstitial myofibroblasts and enhanced the differentiation of pericytes into myofibroblasts after UUO. Peritubular capillary rarefaction was accelerated in Atg7△FOXD1 mice after UUO. Atg7△FOXD1 mice increased the accumulation of SQSTM1/p62-positive aggregates in the obstructed kidney and resulted in increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome, interleukin (IL) 1-β and caspase-1 signaling pathway, which enhanced apoptosis of interstitial cells after UUO. In summary, our data showed that autophagy in FOXD1-lineage stromal cells plays a protective role in renal TIF through regulating the Smad4 dependent TGF-β an NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway.",Genome-wide identification of protein binding sites on RNAs in mammalian cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545631,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are proteins that bind to the RNA and participate in forming ribonucleoprotein complexes. They have crucial roles in various biological processes such as RNA splicing, editing, transport, maintenance, degradation, intracellular localization and translation. The RBPs bind RNA with different RNA-sequence specificities and affinities, thus, identification of protein binding sites on RNAs (R-PBSs) will deeper our understanding of RNA-protein interactions. Currently, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP, also known as CLIP-Seq) is one of the most powerful methods to map RNA-protein binding sites or RNA modification sites. However, this method is only used for identification of single known RBPs and antibodies for RBPs are required. Here we developed a novel method, called capture of protein binding sites on RNAs (RPBS-Cap) to identify genome-wide protein binding sites on RNAs without using antibodies. Double click strategy is used for the RPBS-Cap assay. Proteins and RNAs are UV-crosslinked in vivo first, then the proteins are crosslinked to the magnetic beads. The RNA elements associated with proteins are captured, reverse transcribed and sequenced. Our approach has potential applications for studying genome-wide RNA-protein interactions.",Disruption of protein neddylation with MLN4924 attenuates paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and microtubule polymerization in ovarian cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545630,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,"Surgery and chemotherapy are the gold-standard treatments for ovarian cancer. The major cause of treatment failure in patients with ovarian cancer is tumoral heterogeneity and drug resistance. Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most commonly used first-line drugs for ovarian cancer chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of post-translational neddylation on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) to PTX-induced apoptosis. Disruption of protein neddylation with the first-in-class inhibitor MLN4924 dramatically neutralized PTX-mediated antiproliferative, antimigration, and apoptotic effects in human OCCs. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment interrupted PTX-induced microtubule polymerization. Importantly, two neddylation conjugating E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, were found to play essential roles in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and tubulin polymerization in OCCs. In summary, our findings demonstrated that disruption of protein neddylation by MLN4924 conferred resistance to PTX and provided insights into the potential mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance in ovarian cancer."

One of the most important discoveries in the field of cardiovascular medicine allowed to break the paradigm identifying the heart with mere mechanical pump and to characterize its intriguing endocrine properties. Indeed, the discovery of hormones produced by the cardiac chambers, the natriuretic peptides, represents one of the milestones of the current conception of complexity of integrated human physiology. In the last four decades, the role of these hormones in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, in physiology and diseases, has been defined piece after piece. From diagnostic and prognostic markers, natriuretic peptides have become one of the most relevant clinical biomarker and a reliable target for establishing the efficacy of therapies. Recently and successfully, natriuretic peptide-based strategies are proposed as therapeutic weapons to improve outcome in heart failure.

Nymphal and larval stages, and the pathogens transmitted by I. scapularis are maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving rodent reservoir hosts, predominantly Peromyscus leucopus. Humans are not reservoir hosts, however, accidental encounters of infected ticks with humans, results in pathogen transmission to the human host. Laboratory models of non-reservoir hosts such as guinea pigs develop a strong immune response to tick salivary proteins and reject ticks upon repeated tick infestations. Anecdotal and scientific evidence suggests that humans that get frequent tick bites might also develop resistance to ticks. Mus musculus, the laboratory model of natural host, does not develop resistance to I. scapularis upon repeated tick infestations. Addressing this dichotomy in vector-host interaction, we present data that suggest that the salivary transcriptome and proteome composition is different in mouse and guinea pig-fed I. scapularis, and that these differences might contribute to differences in host immune responses. These findings reveal a new insight into vector-host interactions and offer a functional paradigm to better understand the phenomenon of acquired tick-resistance.","The proportion, conditions, and predictors of emergency department visits that can be potentially managed by pharmacists with expanded scope of practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545614,Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,2018 12 14,"Pharmacists have been shown to be beneficial for inclusion in emergency department (ED) services; however, little has been done to assess these benefits with pharmacists having even wider scopes of practice, including limited prescribing authority.",Biomimetic regulation of dentine remineralization by amino acid in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545612,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 01 22,The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of conditioning solutions containing DL-aspartic amino (Asp) on dentine remineralization induced by bioactive glass 45S5 (BAG) in a simulated oral environment.,Integrating the PILP-mineralization process into a restorative dental treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545611,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 03 22,"The addition of charged polymers, like poly-aspartic acid (pAsp), to mineralizing solutions allows for transport of calcium and phosphate ions into the lumen of collagen fibrils and subsequent crystallization of oriented apatite crystals by the so-called Polymer-Induced Liquid Precursor (PILP) mineralization process, leading to the functional recovery of artificial dentin lesions by intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen.",Subacromial Spacer Implantation for the Treatment of Massive Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545609,Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,2019 02 04,To synthesize and report the early clinical and radiographic outcomes associated with subacromial spacer use in patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears.,Deconstructing the Pharmacovigilance Hype Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545608,Clinical therapeutics,2018 12 14,"Data science is making increasing contributions to pharmacovigilance.

Musculoskeletal models used to investigate mobility deficits for children with CP often lack subject-specific characteristics such as altered muscle strength, despite a high prevalence of muscle weakness in this population. We hypothesized that incorporating subject-specific strength scaling within musculoskeletal models of children with CP would improve accuracy of muscle excitation predictions in walking simulations. Ten children (13.5 ± 3.3 years; GMFCS level II) with spastic CP participated in a gait analysis session where lower-limb kinematics, ground reaction forces, and bilateral electromyography (EMG) of five lower-limb muscles were collected. Isometric strength was measured for each child using handheld dynamometry. Three musculoskeletal models were generated for each child including a 'Default' model with the generic musculoskeletal model's muscle strength, a 'Uniform' model with muscle strength scaled allometrically, and a 'Custom' model with muscle strength scaled based on handheld dynamometry strength measures. Muscle-driven gait simulations were generated using each model for each child. Simulation accuracy was evaluated by comparing predicted muscle excitations and measured EMG signals, both in the duration of muscle activity and the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between signals. Improved agreement with EMG were found in both the 'Custom' and 'Uniform' models compared to the 'Default' model indicated by improvement in RMSD summed across all muscles, as well as RMSD and duration of activity for individual muscles.

Agreement violations involving Number morphology (e.g., *one apples) are well known to elicit specific ERP components such as the Left Anterior Negativity (LAN); yet, the relationship between a morphological Number value (e.g., singular vs plural) and its referential numerosity has rarely been considered in the literature. Moreover, even if agreement violations have been proven to be very useful, they do not typically characterise everyday language usage, thus narrowing the scope of the results. In this study we investigated Number morphology from a different perspective, by focusing on the ERP correlates of congruence and incongruence between a depicted numerosity and noun phrases. To this aim we designed a picture-phrase matching paradigm in Italian. In each trial, a picture depicting one or four objects was followed by a grammatically well-formed phrase made up of a quantifier and a content noun inflected either in the singular or in the plural. When analysing ERP time-locked to the content noun, plural phrases after pictures presenting one object elicited a larger negativity, similar to a LAN effect. No significant congruence effect was found in the case of the phrases whose morphological Number value conveyed a numerosity of one. Our results suggest that: 1) incongruence elicits a LAN-like negativity independently from the grammaticality of the utterances and irrespectively of the P600 component; 2) the reference to a numerosity can be partially encoded in an incremental way when processing Number morphology; and, most importantly, 3) the processing of the morphological Number value of plural is different from that of singular as the former shows a narrower interpretability than the latter."

However, HSCT is limited by the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with current therapies restricted to general immunosuppression.

Short-term pharmacological blockade of P2X7 has been shown to reduce clinical disease and/or reduce inflammatory markers in allogeneic and humanized mouse models of GVHD. The current study demonstrates that long-term P2X7 blockade by intra-peritoneal injection of Brilliant Blue G (BBG) thrice weekly for up to 10 weeks did not impact human (h) peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) engraftment, predominantly T cells, in blood at 3 weeks post-hPBMC injection or in spleens at end-point in humanized mice.

Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that BBG treatment reduced liver apoptosis. Long-term BBG treatment did not alter clinical disease, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory markers in tissues or serum human interferon (IFN)-γ concentrations.

Moreover, an advantage of using Technegas as the ventilation agent and radiolabelled macro-aggregated albumin microspheres as the perfusion agent is that the deposition pattern is fixed upon administration and thus different patient postures can be studied and the effect of gravity and position determined, even though the scans must be acquired with the subject supine using conventional gamma camera SPECT/CT systems. In this paper we report on normal ranges for functional contribution of the individual lobes of the lung to overall function studied in the supine and erect positions in a small cohort of normal subjects. Differences are seen between the anatomical volumes as determined by segmentation of the CT scans and the ventilation and perfusion contributions in the different positions. As pulmonary function testing in the respiratory laboratory is usually performed in the upright position we perform all of our clinical imaging lung function studies in this position (for radiotracer administration) also. The methodology for measuring lobar function is minimally invasive, readily available, and would be hard to imagine being acquired as readily with any other technique.",Lung Scintigraphy in the Assessment of Aerosol Deposition and Clearance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545517,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 02 25,"Environmental and occupational exposure to particulate aerosols is known to have negative health effects. However little is known about how these aerosols trigger the development of pathophysiological mechanisms in the body or the fate of ultrafine particles in the lungs after inhalation. The development of aerosols of different origin that can be labeled to a large variety with radionuclides compatible with clinical gamma camera systems opens the possibility of using lung scintigraphy imaging to study these causalities in detail. Lung scintigraphy (planar or SPECT) allows regional mapping of the deposition of the aerosol in the lungs and the dynamic assessment of particle clearance and translocation from the healthy and affected human lungs. In this paper, we will review the unique features of lung scintigraphy applied to aerosol clearance studies in humans.",Ventilation/Perfusion SPECT Imaging-Diagnosing Other Cardiopulmonary Diseases Beyond Pulmonary Embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545516,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 02 25,"Ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (V/P SPECT) is the scintigraphic technique recommended primarily for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and is golden standard for the diagnosis of chronic PE. Furthermore, interpreting ventilation and corresponding perfusion images enables pattern recognition of many other cardiopulmonary disorders that affect lung function and also allows quantification of their extent. Using Technegas for the ventilation imaging, grading of small airway disease in COPD is possible and the method is recommended for PE diagnosis in patients with severe COPD that is not possible with radiolabelled liquid aerosols. An optimal combination of nuclide activities, acquisition times for ventilation and perfusion, collimators, and imaging matrix yields an adequate V/P SPECT study in approximately 20 minutes of imaging time. The holistic interpretation strategy of V/P SPECT uses all relevant information about the patient and ventilation/perfusion patterns. PE is diagnosed when there is more than one subsegment showing a V/P mismatch representing an anatomic lung unit. Apart from PE, other pathologies should be identified and reported, such as obstructive lung disease, heart failure, and pneumonia according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine guidelines.",Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in Infants and Children with Nonembolic Chronic Pulmonary Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545515,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 02 25,"Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides high contrast three dimensional images of the regional distribution of a radiotracer. SPECT is a widely used technique in pulmonary investigations of the ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) in the adult patient, mainly in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, safety concerns among practitioners due to radiation exposure and the use of macroaggregate albumin for the perfusion scan have historically precluded the use of SPECT in pediatric patients with nonembolic pulmonary disorders. Additionally, patient cooperation at ventilation tracer administration and image artifacts from patient movements due the long acquisition times, have further limited the application of SPECT in pediatric patients. With the introduction of technegas aerosol for ventilation studies and the use of high sensitive multihead gamma cameras, both the total amount of administered activity and acquisition time have drastically been reduced allowing the application of SPECT in pediatric patients. Modern hybrid gamma camera/computed tomography systems (SPECT/CT) also brings the possibility of adding a fully diagnostic CT to the SPECT images, incrementing the clinical value of the investigation. Besides pulmonary embolism, there is now some clinical evidence that lung SPECT has diagnostic value in several pulmonary pathologies causing V/Q mismatching, which are specific to the pediatric age group. In this work, we will exemplify and briefly discuss some of these applications based on the literature and our routine clinical experience. Consideration to the risks and safety aspects associated to performing pediatric V/Q SPECT are also discussed.",SPECT V/Q in Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Planning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545514,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 02 25,"Curative-intent lung cancer radiation therapy either alone (RT) or combined with immuno-chemotherapy is associated with potential risk of serious radiation-induced lung injury. This review provides a summary of the role of SPECT ventilation perfusion (V/Q) imaging as an emerging adjunct to lung cancer RT planning and treatment dosimetry. Denoted ""functional lung avoidance RT"" it is hypothesized that preferential dosimetric avoidance of physiologically functional lung may reduce the frequency of radiation-induced lung injury. SPECT V/Q imaging datasets available during the planning process allows the prioritization (or ""personalization') of RT dose to minimize the volume of functional lung probabilistically exposed to injurious radiation dose. Selective escalation of target dose and adaptive planning and replanning is also enabled. The emergent importance of the tumor-lung microenvironment and its biologic relationship to local immune effectors in lung cancer provides further incentive to individualize RT planning and delivery. This review examines important normal tissue dosimetric constraints that are part of current standards-of-care and the new dosimetric parameters associated with functional lung avoidance RT. SPECT V/Q has been a valuable tool in investigating the feasibility and efficacy of functional lung avoidance RT but is yet to become main stream due to the lack of large clinical trials. It is encouraging however that functional lung avoidance is feasible in RT dose-target delineation and some of the more promising studies are discussed.",Pre-surgical Evaluation of Lung Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545513,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 02 25,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease affects 400 million individuals worldwide and is predicted to be the third leading cause of death by 2020 with a projected economic cost of 4.8 trillion US dollars by 2030. Lung volume reduction surgery is an established means of targeting hyperinflation in patients with severe emphysema, optimizing ventilator mechanics, and reducing the work of breathing. Preoperative evaluation of regional lung function is essential to planning and predicting the outcomes of surgery. The traditional planar approach is inaccurate for lobar contribution since it is not based on anatomy. We developed a novel approach combining single photon emission tomography (SPECT) with CT, offering accurate quantitative characterization of ventilation and perfusion at a lobar level.

Ventilation heterogeneity has been known to predict airway hyperresponsiveness (the ability of the airways to constrict too easily and by too much) in asthma, which is a core physiological characteristic of this disease. SPECT ventilation imaging allows topographical analysis of changes in ventilation distribution. Technegas as a SPECT ventilation agent has a key advantage as it remains fixed after inhalation, which allows imaging of upright ventilation distribution, analogous of pulmonary function tests. Recent studies using Technegas ventilation SPECT have shown spatial imaging markers also relate to airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma, and are predicted by a MBNW index of peripheral ventilation heterogeneity. It has also been shown that low-ventilation regions induced by bronchoconstriction were also related to peripheral ventilation heterogeneity. Furthermore, this suggests that the function of peripheral airways may determine the topographical pattern of airway narrowing with a more widespread distribution of narrowing.

We will show how pilots spend a significant amount of time on planning and early recognition of impending challenges, utilize the concept of crew resource management routinely, and stay much focused during each specific mission. More importantly, they are very open and committed to discussing every event or near event to improve the system, and are supported in this by their superiors without fear of punishment or retribution.

The new coefficient, called connection coefficient, and the detected network motifs are capable of characterizing the EEG tracing segments with PSWCs. Furthermore, network motifs are able to detect what are the most active and/or connected brain areas in the tracing segments with PSWCs.

Currently, 30 states have approved its use under a variety of different regulations and for a number of conditions. Its use is bolstered by a growing number of Americans who support legalization of cannabis. Though oral synthetic cannabinoid compounds are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and appetite stimulation associated with AIDS, synthetic products differ from plant-derived products in several ways. In addition, use of these substances has created a regulatory and legal quagmire that differs considerably depending on the state in which the pharmacist practices. In long-term care, pharmacists face an entirely different set of challenges than pharmacists who practice in other settings: Increasingly, long-term care residents and their attending physicians are asking to use medical marijuana. This manuscript discusses how some long-term care facilities are accommodating this substance that federally and in many states is considered illegal. It also discusses some of the challenges faced by pharmacists who work in dispensaries.","Effects of Azithromycin on Behavior, Pathologic Signs, and Changes in Cytokines, Chemokines, and Neutrophil Migration in C57BL/6 Mice Exposed to Dextran Sulfate Sodium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545428,Comparative medicine,2019 03 05,"Here we characterized the murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of acute colitis. Specifically, we evaluated azithromycin and metronidazole treatment regimens to assess their effects on animal wellbeing, pathologic changes, barrier function, cytokine and chemokine profiles, and neutrophil migration in colon tissue. Azithromycin treatment significantly reduced the severity of colitis, as assessed through body weight change, water consumption, macroscopic lesions, and animal behaviors (activity level, climbing, and grooming), but did not alter food consumption or feeding behavior. Mucosal barrier function (evaluated by using FITC-labeled dextran) was decreased after DSS exposure; azithromycin did not significantly alter barrier function in mice with colitis, whereas metronidazole exacerbated the colitis-related deficit in barrier function. In addition, metronidazole appeared to exacerbate disease as assessed through water consumption and animal behaviors (overall activity, climbing, grooming, and drinking) but had no effect on weight loss, macroscopic lesions, or eating behavior. Pathologic changes were typical for DSS treatment. Antibiotic treatment resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and decreased neutrophil adhesion and emigration in DSS-exposed mice. The results highlight the importance of clinical and behavioral assessments in addition to laboratory evaluation as tools to evaluate animal welfare and therapeutic efficacy in disease models. Data from this study suggest that azithromycin may convey some benefits in the mouse DSS colitis model through modulation of the immune response, including neutrophil migration into tissues, whereas metronidazole may exacerbate colitis.",Correction to: Mobile Link - a theory-based messaging intervention for improving sexual and reproductive health of female entertainment workers in Cambodia: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545427,Trials,2019 02 19,After publication of our article [1] we became aware that several sections of text in our Methods section were copied from a previously published article [2].,"Morphology, performance and attachment function in Corynosoma spp. (Acanthocephala).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545426,Parasites & vectors,2019 05 24,"Functional inference on the attachment of acanthocephalans has generally been drawn directly from morphology.

In recent years, introduction of the new drug class of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) has changed the treatment landscape as GLP-1RAs have become well-established therapies in T2DM. The benefits of GLP-1RAs are derived from their pleiotropic effects, which include appetite control, glucose-dependent secretion of insulin and inhibition of glucagon secretion. Importantly, their beneficial effects extend to the cardiovascular system. Large clinical trials have evaluated the cardiovascular effects of GLP-1RAs in patients with T2DM and elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and the results are very promising. However, important aspects still require elucidation, such as the specific mechanisms involved in the cardioprotective effects of these drugs. Careful interpretation is necessary because of the heterogeneity across the trials concerning the definition of cardiovascular risk or cardiovascular disease, baseline characteristics, routine care and event rates. The aim of this review is to describe the main clinical aspects of the GLP-1RAs, compare them using data from both the mechanistic and randomized controlled trials and discuss potential reasons for improved cardiovascular outcomes observed in these trials. This review may help clinicians to decide which treatment is most appropriate in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM.","Consequences of community water fluoridation cessation for Medicaid-eligible children and adolescents in Juneau, Alaska.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545358,BMC oral health,2019 05 20,"The general aim of this research was to determine whether cessation of community water fluoridation (CWF) increased oral health disparities, as measured by dental caries procedures and restoration costs for children and adolescents."

Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung. Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 05 15," Carotenoids are C-30, C-40 or C-50 terpenoids produced by a number of bacteria, fungi, and plants. In addition to acting as vitamin A precursors such as β-carotene, their dietary intake and blood plasma/serum and tissue levels have been associated in several epidemiological studies to the reduced incidence of chronic diseases, including the reduction of type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases, as well as some types of cancer. Lutein and zeaxanthin also appear to play a role in the amelioration of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the main cause of blindness in the elderly, and may be regarded as conditionally essential nutrients for the elderly. Furthermore, some studies have proposed that carotenoids may improve cognitive functions. Though the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, it is perceived that direct antioxidant effects and protection from UV-light, as well as rather indirect effects, acting on transcription factors such as NF-κB, Nrf-2, and nuclear receptors such as RAR/RXR (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor), altering gene expression, all can play a role. Despite individual intervention trials suggesting negative effects of high doses of β-carotene on smokers, perhaps due to effects related to cytochrome enzyme activation, there is accumulating evidence that these colourful pigments indeed contribute to a healthy life and well-being. However, further research is warranted to better understand factors influencing variable inter-individual responses following carotenoid consumption and to establish more detailed recommendations regarding their dietary intake and toward establishing health claims.",Supplementation with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate impacts glucose homeostasis and increases liver size in trained mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545278,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung. Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 04 08,"β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate (HMB) is a bioactive metabolite derived from the amino acid leucine, usually applied for muscle mass increase during physical training, as well as for muscle mass maintenance in debilitating chronic diseases. The hypothesis of the present study is that HMB is a safe supplement for muscle mass gain by strength training. Based on this, the objective was to measure changes in body composition, glucose homeostasis and hepatic metabolism of HMB supplemented mice during strength training. Two of four groups of male mice (n = 6/group) underwent an 8-week training period session (climbing stairs) with or without HMB supplementation (190 mg/kgBW per day). We observed lower body mass gain (4.9 ± 0.43% versus 1.2 ± 0.43, p < 0.001) and increased liver mass (40.9 ± 0.9 mg/gBW versus 44.8 ± 1.3, p < 0.001) in the supplemented trained group compared with the non-supplemented groups. The supplemented trained group had an increase in relative adipose tissue mass (12.4 ± 0.63 mg/gBW versus 16.1 ± 0.88, P < 0.01) compared to the non-supplemented untrained group, and an increase in fasting blood glucose (111 ± 4.58 mg/dL versus 122 ± 3.70, P < 0.05) and insulin resistance (3.79 ± 0.19 % glucose decay/min versus 2.45 ± 0.28, P < 0.05) comparing with non-supplemented trained group. Adaptive heart hypertrophy was observed only in the non-supplemented trained group (4.82 ± 0.05 mg/gBW versus 5.12 ± 0.13, P < 0.05). There was a higher hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1 expression (P = 0.002) in supplemented untrained comparing with non-supplemented untrained group.

It is puzzling why such a condition has not been reduced in frequency, if not eliminated, in the course of evolution. Maternal mortality is a complex phenomenon caused by several physiological and physical factors. Among the physical factors, maternal mortality due to fetopelvic disproportion remains controversial. Several explanations including evolution of bipedal locomotion, rapid brain growth, and nutritional changes and life style changes in settler communities have been proposed. The influences of human reproductive biology and sexual selection have rarely been considered to explain why maternal mortality persisted through human evolution. We entertain the hypothesis that irrespective of the causes, the risks of all factors causing maternal mortality would be aggravated by disassortative mating, specifically male preference for younger females who are generally small statured and at higher risk of obstetric complications. Maternal mortality arising due to sexual selection and mate choice would have the long-term effect of driving widowers toward younger women, often resulting in ""child marriage,"" which still remains a significant cause of maternal mortality globally. Evolutionarily, such a male driven mating system in polygamous human populations would have prolonged the persistence of maternal mortality despite selection acting against it. The effects may extend beyond maternal mortality because male-mate choice driven maternal mortality would reduce average reproductive life spans of women, thus influencing the evolution of menopause.",Comprehensive analysis of Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T in younger acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients: A single-center experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545275,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,2019 05 13,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms, mainly the C677T, have been implicated as risk factors for several cancers as the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, a potential effect of such variant on the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) has been reported.",Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Finnish Version of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545274,Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,2018 12 14,Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire is a widely used patient-reported outcome measure in hand surgery. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire into Finnish for Finnish patients with hand problems following international standards and guidelines.,Toxicity and genotoxicity induced by abacavir antiretroviral medication alone or in combination with zidovudine and/or lamivudine in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545272,Human & experimental toxicology,2019 03 22,"Abacavir (ABC), zidovudine (AZT), and lamivudine (3TC) are nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) widely used as combination-based antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus. Despite effective viral suppression using NRTI combinations, genotoxic potential of NRTIs can be increased when administered in combination. This study investigated the toxic and genotoxic potential of ABC when administered alone or in combination with AZT and/or 3TC using the somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster. This test simultaneously evaluated two events related to carcinogenic potential: mutation and somatic recombination. The results indicated that ABC was responsible for toxicity when administered alone or in combination with AZT and/or 3TC. In addition, all treatment combinations increased frequencies of mutation and somatic recombination. The combination of AZT/3TC showed the lowest genotoxic activity compared to all combinations with ABC. Therefore, our results indicated that ABC was responsible for a significant portion of genotoxic activity of these combinations. Somatic recombination was the main genetic event observed, ranging from 83.7% to 97.7%.",Reduced vision-related quality of life in people living with dystonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545271,Disability and rehabilitation,2018 12 14,Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder with negative impact on function and quality of life. It is currently unclear whether vision-related quality of life is affected. The aim of this study was to determine whether vision-related quality of life is reduced by dystonia.,Cochrane corner: platinum-induced hearing loss after treatment for childhood cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30545270,International journal of audiology,2019 03 22,"This Cochrane Corner features the review entitled ""Platinum-induced hearing loss after treatment for childhood cancer"" published in 2016. In their review, van As et al. identified 13 cohort studies including 2837 participants with a hearing test after treatment with a platinum-based therapy for different types of childhood cancers. All studies had problems related to quality of the evidence. The reported frequency of hearing loss varied between 1.7% and 90.1% for studies that included a definition of hearing loss; none of the studies provided data on tinnitus. Only two studies evaluated possible risk factors. One study found a higher risk of hearing loss in people treated with the combination of cisplatin plus carboplatin compared to treatment with cisplatin only and for exposure to aminoglycosides. The other found that age at treatment (lower risk in older children) and single maximum cisplatin dose (higher risk with an increasing dose) were significant predictors for hearing loss, while gender was not. This systematic review shows that children treated with platinum analogues are at risk of developing hearing loss, but the exact prevalence and risk factors remain unclear."
