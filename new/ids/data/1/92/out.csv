The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of intensive BP treatment (systolic BP target, <120 mm Hg) versus standard BP treatment (systolic BP target, <140 mm Hg) in patients with resistant hypertension. This is a secondary analysis using data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial). This study included 1397 patients with resistant hypertension and 7698 without resistant hypertension. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we compared time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) between the intensive and standard BP treatment groups. Mean follow-up was 3.1 years; major adverse cardiovascular events was confirmed in 381 patients. Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was significantly lower in the intensive treatment group than in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.96; P=0.03). Risks of all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with resistant hypertension were also significantly lower in the intensive treatment group than in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio for all-cause death: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.97; P=0.03; hazard ratio for cardiovascular death: 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.81; P=0.01). Similar associations were observed in various subgroups. Intensive BP treatment was significantly associated with a decreased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with resistant hypertension.",Arachidonic acid causes lysis of blood cells and ADP-dependent platelet activation responses in platelet function tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580677,Platelets,2019 02 04,"The use of arachidonic acid (AA) to stimulate platelets is considered as a specific approach to study aspirin treatment efficacy. However, very high concentrations of AA are used, and it has been previously reported that AA can induce cell lysis in other settings. Several clinical studies have reported decreased responses to AA in whole blood tests in the presence of clopidogrel. Our aim was to investigate whether unspecific effects contribute to AA-induced aggregation and platelet activation in light transmission aggregometry (LTA) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and in assays using whole blood, multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA, Multiplate®), and flow cytometry. We report that cell lysis, especially of red blood cells, does occur at concentrations of AA used in the clinical tests and that ADP is very important for the AA-induced platelet activation responses. In flow cytometry, very limited platelet activation was detected before reaching AA concentrations in the millimolar range, where cell lysis also occurred, making it problematic to develop a reliable flow cytometry assay using AA as reagent. We conclude that cell lysis and ADP release contribute to AA-induced platelet responses, most markedly in whole blood assays. This finding could potentially explain some differences between studies comparing methods using whole blood and PRP and also how clopidogrel treatment could influence AA-induced aggregation results in previously published studies. Our findings highlight some issues with AA as reagent for platelet activation, which also have an impact on how platelet activation assays using AA should be interpreted.",Long non-coding RNA LINC01133 silencing exerts antioncogenic effect in pancreatic cancer through the methylation of DKK1 promoter and the activation of Wnt signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580676,Cancer biology & therapy,2019 02 22,"Recent studies have acknowledged the critical roles played by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying on how LINC01133 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. A microarray-based gene expression analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer. In addition, ectopic expression assays, knockdown experiments and gene reporter assays were conducted to clarify the role of LINC01133 in pancreatic cancer and to understand the interaction between LINC01133 and the methylation of DKK1 promoter. The expression of LINC01133, DKK1, and other genes related to the Wnt signaling pathway was also measured. EDU staining, scratch test and Transwell assay were employed to measure the proliferation, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, respectively. GSE32676 and GSE16515 revealed that LINC01133 was upregulated in pancreatic cancer, which was also associated with increased DKK1 methylation and higher expression of genes related to the Wnt signaling pathway, although the expression of DKK1 decreased in pancreatic cancer. In addition, LINC01133 bound to the promoter region of DKK1, resulting in the trimethylation of H3K27 and decreased DKK1 expression, while the expression of Wnt-5a, MMP-7, and β-catenin increased upon LINC01133 binding. Finally, over-expressed LINC01133 enhanced the growth, proliferation, migration, metastasis, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. The present study clarified the distinct effect of LINC01133 on pancreatic cancer. In summary, by inducing the methylation of DKK1 promoter, LINC01133 silencing suppresses the development of pancreatic cancer cells through the Wnt signaling pathway.",A randomized pilot trial of a couple-based intervention addressing sexual concerns for breast cancer survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580675,Journal of psychosocial oncology,2019 04 24,"The purpose was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-session couple-based Intimacy Enhancement (IE) intervention addressing breast cancer survivors' sexual concerns delivered via telephone. Twenty-nine post-treatment breast cancer survivors reporting sexual concerns and their intimate partners were randomized (2:1) to the IE intervention or to an educational control condition, both of which were delivered by trained psychosocial providers. Feasibility and acceptability were measured through recruitment, retention, session completion, and post-intervention program evaluations. Couples completed validated sexual, relationship, and psychosocial outcome measures at pre- and post-intervention. Between-group effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Hedges g. Data supported intervention feasibility and acceptability. For survivors, the IE intervention had medium to large positive effects on all sexual outcomes and most psychosocial outcomes. Effects were less visible for relationship outcomes and were similar but somewhat smaller for partners. The IE intervention demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and promise in addressing breast cancer survivors' sexual concerns and enhancing their and their partners' intimate relationships and psychosocial well-being. Implications for Psychosocial Oncology Practice The IE intervention demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, suggesting it could be well-received by breast cancer survivors with sexual concerns and their partners. Effects of the IE intervention on breast cancer survivors' sexual concerns and on their and their partners' intimate relationships and psychosocial well-being could not be attributed to therapist time and attention. Interventions that psychosocial providers can use to address breast cancer survivors' sexual concerns are important to the growing number of breast cancer survivors living for many years after their diagnosis.","Converging Cultures: Partnering in Affirmative and Inclusive Health Care for Members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580674,Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,2018 12 24,"Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community suffer from disproportionate rates of physical and mental illness.

Gut microbiota plays a central role in the pathogenesis of these diseases as it mediates environmental changes to the intestinal immune system. Various environmental factors including diet, food additives and medication also trigger the compositional and functional alterations of microbiota, that is, dysbiosis, and this dysbiosis is closely associated with many chronic inflammatory diseases. However, the causal relationship remains unclear for the majority of these diseases. In this review, we discuss essential epidemiological data, known pathogenetic factors including those of genetic and environmental nature, while mainly focusing on the role of gut microbiota in the development of selected intestinal and liver diseases. Using specific examples, we also briefly describe some of the most widely-used animal models including gnotobiotic models and their contribution to the research of pathogenetic mechanisms of the host-microbiota relationship.",Predictive models for designing potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia for understanding its molecular mechanism of resistance by molecular docking and dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580670,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 02 22,"BCR-ABL fusion protein drives chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which constitutively activates tyrosine kinase involved in the initiation and maintenance of CML phenotype. Ponatinib, an oral drug, was discovered as an efficient BCR-ABL inhibitor by addressing imatinib drug resistance arising due to the point mutations at its active sites. In this study, 44 BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, which are derivatives of ponatinib, were used to develop a robust two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) and 3D-Pharmacophore models by dividing dataset into 32 training sets and 12 test set molecules. 2D-QSAR model was developed using Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm consisting of four types of information-rich molecular descriptors, electrotopological (ES_Count_aasN and ES_Sum_aaaC), electronic (Dipole_X), spatial (PMI_Y) and thermodynamic (LogD), primarily contributing to BCR-ABL kinase inhibitory activity. For the best 2D-QSAR model, the statistics were R2 = 0.8707, R2pred = 0.8142 and N = 32 for the training set molecules. Phase module of Schrödinger suit was employed for 3D-Pharmacophore model development showing five different pharmacophoric features - ADHHPRR with good R2 of 0.9629, F of 175.3, Q2 of 0.645 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.214 that are essential for an effective BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. These two models were further validated by cross-validation, test set predictions, enrichment factor calculations and predictions based on the external dataset. The molecular mechanism of resistance arising due to gate keeper mutation T315I of ABL kinase in complex with its inhibitors was also studied using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed models predicted key chemical features for designing potent inhibitors against BCR-ABL kinase activity and its resistance mechanism to CML disease therapy. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

If maintaining bindings in VWM does not require more attention than maintaining features, is it related to the stability of binding representations? In this study, we explored whether maintaining bindings requires more attention than maintaining features for similar and dissimilar objects by inserting a feature report task into the maintenance phase of VWM in Experiments 1 and 2. We also investigated whether the effect of similarity on the attentional requirement for maintaining bindings and features is due to the stability of VWM representations by inserting a suffix during the maintenance phase of VWM in Experiment 3. The results showed that when object-based attention was consumed, bindings were more impaired than features for dissimilar objects but not for similar objects. We also found that the bindings of similar objects were less interfered by the suffix than those of dissimilar objects. Our findings suggest that maintaining bindings does not require more attention than maintaining features when the binding representations are stable in VWM and similarity improves the stability of binding representations.",Carfilzomib-induced tumor lysis syndrome in relapsed multiple myeloma: a report of two cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580656,Tumori,2018 12 24,"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially fatal complication of cancer therapy characterized by severe electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities such as hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcaemia.

The existentialist school of thought offers a complementary focus, which enhances existing philosophical foundations of the profession and supports two major tenets: (1) humans as self-making beings always in the process of becoming and (2) emotions and feelings as foundations for being-in-the-world. This article explores these two themes both in the context of existentialism and occupational therapy, and then provides an examination of existentialist utility in occupational therapy practice, research, and education.",Category-bounded emotional enhancement: spillover effects in the valuation of public goods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580654,Cognition & emotion,2018 12 24,"We examined whether enhancing (vs. not enhancing) the emotionality of a referent public good influences the subsequent valuation of a target public good. We predicted that it would and that the directionality of its impact would depend on a fundamental cognitive process - categorisation. If the target and referent goods belong to the same domain, we expected that the effect on the target would be in the same direction as the emotional enhancement of the referent (assimilation effect). However, if the target and referent goods belong to different domains, we expected that the effect on the target would be either negligible or in the opposite direction to that of the emotional enhancement of the referent (null or contrast effect). In Experiment 1 we examined the impact of emotionally enhancing a referent public good on feelings towards a target public good, whereas in Experiment 2 on the willingness to contribute towards a target public good. The results support the predicted interaction, which was driven by an assimilation effect for same-domain goods and a null effect for different-domain goods. In doing so, the present findings highlight the interplay between cognition and emotion in the valuation of public goods. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.",The Non-Aromatic Δ5-Androstenediol Derivative of Dehydroepiandrosterone Acts as an Estrogen Agonist in Neonatal Rat Osteoblasts through an Estrogen Receptor α-related Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580653,Endocrine research,2018 12 24,"It has been proposed that DHEA influences bone formation through, bioconversion to 17β-estradiol; however, DHEA is converted to Δ5-androstenediol (Δ5-Adiol), a metabolite with estrogenic potential involved in diverse biological process.

The combination of mental and physical stress (i.e., dual stress challenges [DSCs]) results in significant oxidative stress (OS), which may contribute to cardiometabolic dysfunction. Curcumin (CUR) is an exogenous antioxidant that may attenuate such OS. Fourteen trained men participated in a randomized, cross-over design to investigate the impact of CUR on markers of OS resulting from DSC. CUR or placebo was ingested three days prior to, and the morning of, testing. The DSC involved 20 min of mental stress challenges during 35 min of cycling at 60% V̇O2 peak. Blood was sampled before, as well as immediately, 30 min, and 60 min after, exercise and analyzed for glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). There was no treatment effect for any variable. However, the DSC resulted in significant reductions in SOD, H2O2, and AOPP at 30 and 60 min after exercise. Previous studies have shown that DSC results in significant OS compared to exercise alone. However, these data suggest the DSC was associated with reductions in postexercise markers of OS.

Several paper-based track and trigger warning scores have been developed to allow clinical evaluation of a patient and guidance on escalation protocols and frequency of monitoring. However, evidence suggests that patient deterioration on hospital wards is still missed, and that patients are still falling through the safety net. Wearable sensor technology is currently undergoing huge growth, and the development of new light-weight wireless wearable sensors has enabled multiple vital signs monitoring of ward patients continuously and in real time. Areas covered: In this paper, we aim to closely examine the benefits of wearable monitoring applications that measure multiple vital signs; in the context of improving healthcare and delivery. A review of the literature was performed.

However, it remains unclear whether an enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis has an acceptable safety profile when given early after CS compared to delayed administration, especially in the presence of an epidural catheter. This study aimed to survey cases in which enoxaparin administration was performed within 24 hours of CS and to evaluate patient outcomes with or without epidural anaesthesia. The number of eligible cases were 578: 328 patients received an epidural anaesthesia (epidural group), and 250 did not (non-epidural group). In both groups, no patient developed a spinal epidural haematoma. A wound or a subcutaneous bleeding occurred in 22 (6.7%) and 20 (8.0%) cases in the epidural and non-epidural groups, respectively. One patient developed a mild pulmonary embolism, and one case of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis was detected. An enoxaparin administration within 24 hours of CS appears to be reasonable, regardless of an epidural anaesthesia. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? A venous thromboembolism (VTE) after a caesarean section (CS) remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thromboprophylaxis using enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, has been widely recommended and accepted. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal timing to initiate an enoxaparin administration after CS in the presence of an epidural catheter. What do the results of this study add? This is the largest study that has collected cases receiving enoxaparin within 24 hours of a CS. Irrespective of the presence of an epidural catheter, no patient developed a spinal epidural haematoma after an early administration of enoxaparin. Furthermore, the incidence of haemorrhagic complications did not increase. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Given the significant incidence of VTE after CS and the extremely low frequency of spinal epidural haematomas, it can be justified to initiate thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin soon after CS. However, appropriately designed, large clinical trials are necessary to examine the safety and efficacy of an early enoxaparin administration after CS. Based on such studies, the starting time of thromboprophylaxis after a CS should be decided.",Proliferative Funiculitis-Like Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma With Mesothelial Glandular Structures: A Diagnostic Pitfall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580648,International journal of surgical pathology,2019 04 03,Dedifferentiated liposarcoma shows a wide morphological spectrum.

Despite the emergence of new and targeted therapies for other types of breast cancer, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy are the only common therapies for TNBC. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), with selective apoptotic properties in tumour cells has been considered as a promising neoadjuvant therapy in some cancers including TNBC. The application of TRAIL in clinic has been prevented due to its short half-life and TRAIL resistance. More importantly, the monotherapy of TRAIL could not acquire optimal efficacy in most cases. In this study, placental-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDMSCs) have been genetically engineered to deliver a soluble form of TRAIL at the tumour site. Curcumin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were also fabricated to augment the apoptotic effect of TRAIL. The antitumour effects of this combination therapy were studied in vitro and in mouse models of TNBC. Results indicated that simultaneous delivery of curcumin nanoparticles and TRAIL expressing PDMSCs effectively induces apoptosis in tumour cells and significantly inhibits tumour growth in vivo.

Interestingly, through an adept utilisation of the formal strengths of the medium of comics, many graphic medical anorexia narratives offer insightful elucidations on the question of how the female body is not merely a biological construction, but a biocultural construction too. In this context, by drawing theoretical postulates from Susan Bordo, David Morris and other theoreticians of varying importance, and by close reading Lesley Fairfield's Tyranny and Katie Green's Lighter than My Shadow, this article considers anorexia as the bodily manifestation of a cultural malady by analysing how cultural attitudes regarding body can be potential triggers of eating disorders in girls.

Gastric ulcer is still the most prevalent irritant illness among the gastrointestinal diseases. The present study explored the protective effect of paeonol at two dose levels in indomethacin (IND)-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Forty-eight male Wistar rats were arranged into six groups: control, paeonol-treated, IND-treated, IND/paeonol (low and high doses)-treated, and ranitidine-treated groups. The oxidative status was evaluated by determining malondialdehyde level, superoxide dismutase activity, reduced glutathione content as well as hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expressions, and the antioxidant protein; NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) immunostaining. The pro-inflammatory genes nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were estimated together with the proapoptotic gene of caspase 3. IND caused multiple gastric ulcers with evident oxidative damage and elevated pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic markers. Paeonol protected significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, the gastric mucosa from ulcerative lesion of IND similar to the reference drug ranitidine. Paeonol pretreatment diminished gastric oxidative stress and restored the gastric antioxidant capacity by elevating gastric gene expression of HO-1 and protein expression of NQO1. Paeonol also reduced NF-κB, IL-1β, and caspase 3 gene expressions. In conclusion, paeonol offered a gastroprotection dependent on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects.","A new [7.7]paracyclophane from Vietnamese marine snail Planaxis sulcatus (Born, 1780).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580613,Natural product research,2018 12 24,"A new [7.7]paracyclophane (1), together with eight known compounds (2-9), were isolated from a MeOH extract of the sea snail Planaxis sulcatus (Born, 1780).

Such deposits of aggregated LDL (agLDL) can be recognized by macrophages, which attempt to digest and clear them. AgLDL catabolism promotes internalization of cholesterol and foam cell formation, which leads to the progression of atherosclerosis. Therapeutic blockade of this process may delay disease progression. When macrophages interact with agLDL in vitro, they form a novel extracellular, hydrolytic compartment-the lysosomal synapse (LS)-aided by local actin polymerization to digest agLDL. Here, we investigated the specific regulators involved in actin polymerization during the formation of the LS. Approach and Results- We demonstrate in vivo that atherosclerotic plaque macrophages contacting agLDL deposits polymerize actin and form a compartment strikingly similar to those made in vitro. Live cell imaging revealed that macrophage cortical F-actin depolymerization is required for actin polymerization to support the formation of the LS. This depolymerization is cofilin-1 dependent. Using siRNA-mediated silencing, pharmacological inhibition, genetic knockout, and stable overexpression, we elucidate key roles for Cdc42 Rho GTPase and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) Vav in promoting actin polymerization during the formation of the LS and exclude a role for Rac1. Conclusions- These results highlight critical roles for dynamic macrophage F-actin rearrangement and polymerization via cofilin-1, Vav, and Cdc42 in LS formation, catabolism of agLDL, and foam cell formation. These proteins might represent therapeutic targets to treat atherosclerotic disease.",Admission Levels of DKK1 (Dickkopf-1) Are Associated With Future Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580572,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 23,"Objective- The Wnt/wingless signaling antagonist DKK1 (dickkopf-1) regulates platelet-mediated inflammation and may contribute to plaque destabilization. We hypothesized that DKK1 would be associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Approach and Results- We determined DKK1 levels in serum samples obtained before randomization, at discharge, and 1 and 6 months in a subset of 5165 patients with acute coronary syndromes in the PLATO trial (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes; NCT00391872). The median (interquartile range) DKK1 concentrations were 0.61 (0.20-1.27) ng/mL at baseline and increased during follow-up. The hazard ratio (95% CIs) for the composite end point (cardiovascular death, nonprocedural spontaneous myocardial infarction, or stroke) during 1 year of follow-up, per 50% increase in baseline DKK1 concentration, was 1.06 (1.02-1.10), P=0.0011, and remained significant in fully adjusted analysis with 14 conventional clinical and demographic and 6 biochemical variables, including NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), hs-TnT (high-sensitivity troponin T), and GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor 15; 1.05 [1.00-1.09]; P=0.028). This association was mainly driven by the association with cardiovascular death, where a gradual increase in event rates was observed with increasing quartiles of DKK1 (2.7%, 3.0%, 4.3%, and 5.0%) and remained significant and unmodified in fully adjusted analysis (hazard ratio, 1.10 [1.04-1.17]; P=0.002). Change in DKK1 and levels at 1 month were unrelated to outcomes. A modifying effect of ticagrelor on DKK1 discharge levels was observed but not associated with prognosis. Conclusions- In patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with dual antiplatelet treatment, admission DKK1 levels were independently associated with a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke and with cardiovascular death alone.",Redox Activation of Nox1 (NADPH Oxidase 1) Involves an Intermolecular Disulfide Bond Between Protein Disulfide Isomerase and p47phox in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580571,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 26,"Objective- PDI (protein disulfide isomerase A1) was reported to support Nox1 (NADPH oxidase) activation mediated by growth factors in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our aim was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which PDI activates Nox1 and the functional implications of PDI in Nox1 activation in vascular disease. Approach and Results- Using recombinant proteins, we identified a redox interaction between PDI and the cytosolic subunit p47phox in vitro. Mass spectrometry of crosslinked peptides confirmed redox-dependent disulfide bonds between cysteines of p47phox and PDI and an intramolecular bond between Cys 196 and 378 in p47phox. PDI catalytic Cys 400 and p47phox Cys 196 were essential for the activation of Nox1 by PDI in vascular smooth muscle cells. Transfection of PDI resulted in the rapid oxidation of a redox-sensitive protein linked to p47phox, whereas PDI mutant did not promote this effect. Mutation of p47phox Cys 196, or the redox active cysteines of PDI, prevented Nox1 complex assembly and vascular smooth muscle cell migration. Proximity ligation assay confirmed the interaction of PDI and p47phox in murine carotid arteries after wire injury. Moreover, in human atheroma plaques, a positive correlation between the expression of PDI and p47phox occurred only in PDI family members with the a' redox active site. Conclusions- PDI redox cysteines facilitate Nox1 complex assembly, thus identifying a new mechanism through which PDI regulates Nox activity in vascular disease.",Deficiency of IL12p40 (Interleukin 12 p40) Promotes Ang II (Angiotensin II)-Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580570,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 02 02,"Objective- Abdominal aortic aneurysm is caused by the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the aortic wall. Our recent studies demonstrated that inhibition of Notch signaling attenuates abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by shifting the macrophage balance towards anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. Using IL12p40-/- (interleukin 12 p40) mice, we investigated the effects of M2-predominant macrophages on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Approach and Results- Male (8-10 week-old) wild-type and IL12p40-/- mice (n=15) on C57BL/6 background were infused with Ang II (angiotensin II, 1000 ng/kg per minute) by implanting osmotic pumps subcutaneously for 28 days. In the IL12p40-/- mice, Ang II significantly increased the maximal intraluminal diameter (9/15) as determined by transabdominal ultrasound imaging. In addition, IL12p40-deletion significantly increased aortic stiffness in response to Ang II as measured by pulse wave velocity and atomic force microscopy. Histologically, IL12p40-/- mice exhibited increased maximal external diameter of aorta and aortic lesions associated with collagen deposition and increased elastin fragmentation compared with wild-type mice infused with Ang II. Mechanistically, IL12p40 deficiency by siRNA (small interfering RNA) augmented the Tgfβ2-mediated Mmp2 expression in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages without affecting the expression of Mmp9. No such effects of IL12p40 deficiency on MMP2/MMP9 was observed in human aortic smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. Depletion of macrophages in IL12p40-/- mice by clodronate liposomes significantly decreased the maximal external diameter of aorta and aortic stiffness in response to Ang II as determined by imaging and atomic force microscopy. Conclusions- IL12p40 depletion promotes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm, in part, by facilitating recruitment of M2-like macrophages and potentiating aortic stiffness and fibrosis mediated by Tgfβ2.",Aqp-1 Gene Knockout Attenuates Hypoxic Pulmonary Hypertension of Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580569,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2018 12 26,"Objective- Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is characterized by proliferative vascular remodeling. Abnormal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferation and endothelial dysfunction are the primary cellular bases of vascular remodeling. AQP1 (aquaporin-1) is regulated by oxygen level and has been observed to play a role in the proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. The role of AQP1 in HPH pathogenesis has not been directly determined to date. To determine the possible roles of AQP1 in the pathogenesis of HPH and explore its possible mechanisms. Approach and Results- Aqp1 knockout mice were used, and HPH model was established in this study. Primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, primary mouse lung endothelial cells, and lung tissue sections from HPH model were used. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot, cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration analysis were performed in this study. AQP1 expression was upregulated by chronic hypoxia exposure, both in pulmonary artery endothelia and medial smooth muscle layer of mice. Aqp1 deficiency attenuated the elevation of right ventricular systolic pressures and mitigated pulmonary vascular structure remodeling. AQP1 deletion reduced abnormal cell proliferation in pulmonary artery and accompanied with accumulation of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor). In vitro, Aqp1 deletion reduced hypoxia-induced proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and migration ability of primary cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and repressed HIF-1α protein stability. Furthermore, Aqp1 deficiency protected lung endothelial cells from apoptosis in response to hypoxic injury. Conclusions- Our data showed that Aqp1 deficiency could attenuate hypoxia-induced vascular remodeling in the development of HPH. AQP1 may be a potential target for pulmonary hypertension treatment.",Human Monocyte Heterogeneity as Revealed by High-Dimensional Mass Cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580568,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 06 10,"Objective- Three distinct human monocyte subsets have been identified based on the surface marker expression of CD14 and CD16. We hypothesized that monocytes were likely more heterogeneous in composition. Approach and Results- We used the high dimensionality of mass cytometry together with the FlowSOM clustering algorithm to accurately identify and define monocyte subsets in blood of healthy human subjects and those with coronary artery disease (CAD). To study the behavior and functionality of the newly defined monocyte subsets, we performed RNA sequencing, transwell migration, and efferocytosis assays. Here, we identify 8 human monocyte subsets based on their surface marker phenotype. We found that 3 of these subsets fall within the CD16+ nonclassical monocyte population and 4 subsets belong to the CD14+ classical monocytes, illustrating significant monocyte heterogeneity in humans. As nonclassical monocytes are important in modulating atherosclerosis in mice, we studied the functions of our 3 newly identified nonclassical monocytes in subjects with CAD. We found a marked expansion of a Slan+CXCR6+ nonclassical monocyte subset in CAD subjects, which was positively correlated with CAD severity. This nonclassical subset can migrate towards CXCL16 and shows an increased efferocytosis capacity, indicating it may play an atheroprotective role. Conclusions- Our data demonstrate that human nonclassical monocytes are a heterogeneous population, existing of several subsets with functional differences. These subsets have changed frequencies in the setting of severe CAD. Understanding how these newly identified subsets modulate CAD will be important for CAD-based therapies that target myeloid cells.",ZFP148 (Zinc-Finger Protein 148) Binds Cooperatively With NF-1 (Neurofibromin 1) to Inhibit Smooth Muscle Marker Gene Expression During Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580567,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 03 29,"Objective- The goal of this study was to determine the role of ZFP148 (zinc-finger protein 148) in aneurysm formation. Approach and Results- ZFP148 mRNA expression increased at day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after during abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in C57BL/6 mice. Loss of ZFP148 conferred abdominal aortic aneurysm protection using ERTCre+ ZFP148 flx/flx mice. In a third set of experiments, smooth muscle-specific loss of ZFP148 alleles resulted in progressively greater protection using novel transgenic mice (MYH [myosin heavy chain 11] Cre+ flx/flx, flx/wt, and wt/wt). Elastin degradation, LGAL3, and neutrophil staining were significantly attenuated, while α-actin staining was increased in ZFP148 knockout mice. Results were verified in total cell ZFP148 and smooth muscle-specific knockout mice using an angiotensin II model. ZFP148 smooth muscle-specific conditional mice demonstrated increased proliferation and ZFP148 was shown to bind to the p21 promoter during abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. ZFP148 smooth muscle-specific conditional knockout mice also demonstrated decreased apoptosis as measured by decreased cleaved caspase-3 staining. ZFP148 bound smooth muscle marker genes via chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis mediated by NF-1 (neurofibromin 1) promote histone H3K4 deacetylation via histone deacetylase 5. Transient transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that NF-1 was required for ZFP148 protein binding to smooth muscle marker genes promoters during aneurysm formation. Elimination of NF-1 using shRNA approaches demonstrated that NF-1 is required for binding and elimination of NF-1 increased BRG1 recruitment, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SWF complex, and increased histone acetylation. Conclusions- ZFP148 plays a critical role in multiple murine models of aneurysm formation. These results suggest that ZFP148 is important in the regulation of proliferation, smooth muscle gene downregulation, and apoptosis in aneurysm development.",Proteins Altered by Surgical Weight Loss Highlight Biomarkers of Insulin Resistance in the Community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580566,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 08,"Objective- Mechanisms of early and late improvements in cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery and applicability to larger, at-risk populations remain unclear. We aimed to identify proteins altered after bariatric surgery and their relations to metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. Approach and Results- We identified 19 proteins altered in 32 nonfasting plasma samples from a study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery who were evaluated preoperatively (visit 1) versus both early (visit 2; ≈3 months) and late (visit 3; ≈12 months) postoperative follow-up using predefined protein panels (Olink). Using in silico methods and publicly available gene expression repositories, we found that genes encoding 8 out of 19 proteins had highest expression in liver relative to other assayed tissues, with the top biological and disease processes, including major obesity-related vascular diseases. Of 19 candidate proteins in the surgical cohort, 6 were previously measured in >3000 FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants (IGFBP [insulin-like growth factor binding protein]-1, IGFBP-2, P-selectin, CD163, LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-receptor, and PAI [plasminogen activator inhibitor]-1). A higher concentration of IGFBP-2 at baseline was associated with a lower risk of incident metabolic syndrome (odds ratio per log-normal unit, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.64; P=7.7×10-6) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.79; P=0.0001) after multivariable adjustment. Conclusions- Using a directed protein quantification platform (Olink), we identified known and novel proteins altered after surgical weight loss, including IGFBP-2. Future efforts in well-defined obesity intervention settings may further define and validate novel targets for the prevention of vascular disease in obesity.",Expansive Vascular Remodeling and Increased Vascular Calcification Response to Cholecalciferol in a Murine Model of Obesity and Insulin Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580565,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 23,"Objective- We hypothesized that ob/ob mice develop expansive vascular remodeling associated with calcification. Approach and Results- We quantified and investigated mechanisms of vascular remodeling and vascular calcification in ob/ob mice after vitamin D3(VD) stimulation or PBS (control), compared with C57BL/6 mice. Both ob/ob (OBVD [VD-treated ob/ob mice]) and C57BL/6 (C57VD [VD-treated C57BL/6 mice]) received 8×103 IU/day of intraperitoneal VD for 14 days. Control ob/ob (OBCT [PBS-treated ob/ob mice]) and C57BL/6 (C57CT [PBS-treated C57BL/6 mice]) received intraperitoneal PBS for 14 days. Hypervitaminosis D increased the external and internal elastic length in aortae from OBVD, resulting in increased total vascular area and lumen vascular area, respectively, which characterizes expansive vascular remodeling. OBVD decreased the aortic wall thickness, resulting in hypotrophic vascular remodeling. We demonstrated increased collagen deposition, elastolysis, and calcification in aortae from OBVD. Our results showed a positive correlation between expansive vascular remodeling and vascular calcification in OBVD. We demonstrated increased serum calcium levels, augmented Bmp (bone morphogenetic protein)-2 and osteochondrogenic proteins expression in OBVD aortae. Furthermore, aortae from OBVD increased oxidative stress, coincidently with augmented in situ MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) activity and exhibited no VDR (VD receptor) inhibition after VD. Conclusions- Our data provide evidence that obese and insulin-resistant mice (ob/ob) developed expansive hypotrophic vascular remodeling correlated directly with increased vascular calcification after chronic VD stimulation. Positive hypotrophic vascular remodeling and vascular calcification in this mouse model is possibly mediated by the convergence of absence VDR downregulation after VD stimulation, increased reactive oxygen species generation, and MMP activation.",Effects of APOC3 Heterozygous Deficiency on Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580564,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 01 08,"Objective- Apo (apolipoprotein) CIII inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-mediated lipolysis of VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) triglyceride (TG) and decreases hepatic uptake of VLDL remnants. The discovery that 5% of Lancaster Old Order Amish are heterozygous for the APOC3 R19X null mutation provided the opportunity to determine the effects of a naturally occurring reduction in apo CIII levels on the metabolism of atherogenic containing lipoproteins. Approach and Results- We conducted stable isotope studies of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in 5 individuals heterozygous for the null mutation APOC3 R19X (CT) and their unaffected (CC) siblings. Fractional clearance rates and production rates of VLDL-TG and apoB100 in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL, apo CIII, and apo CII were determined. Affected (CT) individuals had 49% reduction in plasma apo CIII levels compared with CCs ( P<0.01) and reduced plasma levels of TG (35%, P<0.02), VLDL-TG (45%, P<0.02), and VLDL-apoB100 (36%, P<0.05). These changes were because of higher fractional clearance rates of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB100 with no differences in production rates. CTs had higher rates of the conversion of VLDL remnants to LDL compared with CCs. In contrast, rates of direct removal of VLDL remnants did not differ between the groups. As a result, the flux of apoB100 from VLDL to LDL was not reduced, and the plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and LDL-apoB100 were not lower in the CT group. Apo CIII production rate was lower in CTs compared with CCs, whereas apo CII production rate was not different between the 2 groups. The fractional clearance rates of both apo CIII and apo CII were higher in CTs than CCs. Conclusions- These studies demonstrate that 50% reductions in plasma apo CIII, in otherwise healthy subjects, results in a significantly higher rate of conversion of VLDL to LDL, with little effect on direct hepatic uptake of VLDL. When put in the context of studies demonstrating significant protection from cardiovascular events in individuals with loss of function variants in the APOC3 gene, our results provide strong evidence that therapies which increase the efficiency of conversion of VLDL to LDL, thereby reducing remnant concentrations, should reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Since more and more pharmaceutics are used for the treatment of patients, this topic is increasingly relevant. As such interactions - depending on the duration of treatment and the status of micronutrients - impact the health of the patient and the action of the drugs, physicians and pharmacists should pay more attention to such interactions in the future. This review aims to sensitize physicians and pharmacists on drug micronutrient interactions with selected examples of widely pescribed drugs that can precipitate micronutrient deficiencies. In this context, the pharmacist, as a drug expert, assumes a particular role. Like no other professional in the health care sector, he is particularly predestined and called up to respond to this task. The following article intends to point out the relevance of mutual interactions between micronutrients and various examples of widely used drugs, without claiming to be exhaustive.",Profiles of Psychological Flexibility: A Latent Class Analysis of the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580551,Behavior modification,2018 12 24,"There exists uncertainty for clinicians over how the separate subcomponent processes of psychological flexibility, a core construct of the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy model, interact and influence distress experienced. The present study ( N = 567) employed latent class analysis to (a) identify potential classes (i.e., subgroups) of psychological flexibility based on responses on measures of key subcomponent process and (b) examine whether such classes could reliably differentiate levels of self-reported psychological distress and positive and negative emotionality. We found three distinct classes: (a) High Psychological Flexibility, (b) Moderate Psychological Flexibility, and (c) Low Psychological Flexibility. Those in the Low Psychology Flexibility class reported highest levels of psychological distress, whereas those in the High Psychological Flexibility class reported lowest levels of psychological distress. This study provides a clearer view to clinicians of the profile of the broader spectrum of the psychological flexibility model to facilitate change in clients.",Early Postpartum Venous Thromboembolism: Risk Factors and Predictive Index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580550,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,2019 03 13,"The aim of our study was to quantify risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the puerperal period. The case-control study was conducted in Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University, China, from January 2006 to December 2016; cases of hospitalized VTE within 1 week after delivery were identified according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Control postpartum women without VTE were randomly selected, matched on birth day, age, delivery mode, and number of fetus with 4:1 ratio. Clinical risk factors for postpartum VTE and coagulation parameters were analyzed. We found independent variables that were significantly related to postpartum VTE (all P < .05) in a binary logistic regression analysis included preeclampsia/eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-5.37) and postpartum hemorrhage (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.71-12.40). D-dimer was the only biomarker that statistically significant associated with postpartum VTE in 3 days after delivery (all P < .05). These findings showed preeclampsia/eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage were important risk factors for early VTE during puerperal period. A higher level of D-dimer was more meaningful than other coagulation parameters to suspect early thrombotic disease after delivery.","A review on coffee leaves: Phytochemicals, bioactivities and applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580549,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 05 09,"Coffee leaves have a long history for use as ethnomedicine and tea beverage by locals from countries where coffee plants grow. Recently, attentions have been paid to their health benefits to human beings because of abundant bioactive components in coffee leaves. However, the researches related to the bioactivities, applications, and the impacts of processing methods on the phytochemical composition and activities of coffee leaves are scarce. The reviews specific to coffee leaves in these aspects are rare too. Due to the growing interests to coffee leaves, in this review, the chemical compositions in coffee leaves and the influence of environmental conditions and processing methods on them were summarized. Furthermore, various applications of coffee leaves, including ethnomedicine, coffee leaf tea, therapeutic agent, packaging material, tobacco substitute, organic fungicide, personal hygienic products, and animal feed et al. were presented. The future prospects of coffee leaves are also discussed. In conclusion, coffee leaf is a very promising resource in the areas of food and industry, especially, in the beverage industry.

Moreover, citrus flavonoids possess multiple health-promoting effects in humans, and they are important ingredients for nutraceuticals and functional foods. The biosynthesis of flavonoids in citrus plants is of special significance because it determines the chemical structures and bioaccumulation of these bioactive compounds in the plants, which consequently influences their physiological functions in both citrus plants and human body. This review systematically summarizes: 1) the biosynthesis pathway of citrus-derived flavonoids, 2) the biosynthesis location and distribution of flavonoids in citrus plants, 3) the factors affecting flavonoid biosynthesis, 4) the biological significance of flavonoid biosynthesis in citrus plants, and 5) the health-promoting properties of citrus-derived flavonoids.

Theory and research suggest that executive function deficits accompany internalizing and externalizing problems, although more evidence is required to understand these relationships. This study employed a commonly used rating scale of executive function, the Brief Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and examined relationships with self- and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems among a community sample of 299 adolescents. The sample was 56.2% female, with a mean age of 16.22 years ( SD = 2.36 years). Analyses revealed strong associations between poorer self- and parent-reported executive function skills and the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Problems with executive function were also associated with externalizing symptoms. These results indicate that subjective ratings of executive function capture important aspects of cognitive problems that are highly relevant to adolescent psychopathology in a transdiagnostic fashion.",Suicidal ideation and history of suicide attempts in treatment-seeking patients with gambling disorder: The role of emotion dysregulation and high trait impulsivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580545,Journal of behavioral addictions,2019 02 28,"Gambling disorder (GD) presents high rates of suicidality.

The IL of BmimOAc was prepared in the MIL-101-NH2 nanocages primordially, in which the condensation product of MIL-101-NH2's amine group with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) reacted with 1-bromo butane, and then the intermediate exchanged with potassium acetate. The structure and physicochemical properties of IL(OAc-)-MIL-101-NH2 were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, DRS UV-vis, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and elemental analysis. The results indicated that BmimOAc was anchored in the MIL-101-NH2 skeleton via the acylamino group and confined in the nanocages in the form of a single molecule. The composite material of IL(OAc-)-MIL-101-NH2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity and catalytically synthesized 3-aryl-2-oxazolone in an excellent yield of 92%. It can be reused up to six times without noteworthy loss of its activity and demonstrated distinct size-selective property for substrates.

In this work, we analyzed the interfacial activity of the amphiphilic α-helical phasin PhaF from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 at different hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfacial environments. The binding of PhaF to surfaces containing PHA or phospholipids, postulated as structural components of PHA granules, was confirmed in vitro using supported lipid bilayers and confocal microscopy, with polyhydroxyoctanoate- co-hexanoate P(HO- co-HHx) and Escherichia coli lipid extract as model systems. The surfactant-like capabilities of PhaF were determined by measuring changes in surface pressure in Langmuir devices. PhaF spontaneously adsorbed at the air-water interface, reducing the surface tension from 72 mN/m (water surface tension at 25 °C) to 50 mN/m. The differences in the adsorption of the protein in the presence of different phospholipid films showed a marked preference for phosphatidylglycerol species, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol. The PHA-binding domain of PhaF (BioF) conserved a similar surface activity to PhaF, suggesting that it is responsible for the surfactant properties of the whole protein. These new findings not only increase our knowledge about the role of phasins in the PHA machinery but also open new outlooks for the application of these proteins as biosurfactants.",Quantitative Criterion to Predict Cell Adhesion by Identifying Dominant Interaction between Microorganisms and Abiotic Surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580526,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 05,"Cell adhesion is ubiquitous and plays an important role in various scientific and engineering problems. Herein, a quantitative criterion to predict cell adhesion was proposed by identifying the dominant interaction between microorganisms and abiotic surfaces. According to the criterion, the dominant interaction in cell adhesion could be identified as a Lewis acid-base (AB) interaction or electrostatic (EL) interaction via comparison of two expressions containing the electron-donor characteristics of the microorganism (γmv-) and abiotic surface (γsv-) and their ζ potentials (ζm, ζs). The results revealed that when dominated by the AB interaction, adhesion would decrease with increasing [Formula: see text]. However, when the EL interaction was dominant, adhesion would decrease with increasing (ζm + ζs)2. We have verified the criterion based on the adhesion of microalgae, bacteria, and fungi onto various surfaces obtained via our experiments and available in literature studies. The results demonstrated that the criterion had important implications in the prediction of cell adhesion in various applications.",Formation and Characteristics of Lipid-Blended Block Copolymer Bilayers on a Solid Support Investigated by Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Atomic Force Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580525,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 15,"Liposomes grafted with polymer have long been used in drug delivery applications, and block copolymersomes have emerged as attractive and more robust alternatives for both drug delivery and artificial organelle applications. Hybrid membranes that could combine the respective advantages of fluid lipid and robust polymer bilayers are an attractive and enticing alternative. The properties of membranes in amphiphile vesicles are challenging to study and many applications benefit from surface-based access to the membrane. We therefore explore the self-assembly and mechanical properties of supported hybrid bilayers (SHBs) composed of polybutadiene- block-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymers and zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine lipids on SiO2 supports. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) measurements show that formation of SHB on SiO2 by vesicle fusion depends on the mass fractions of lipids and block copolymers. Atomic force microscopy was used to study the microscopic mixing of lipids in the SHB to reveal that lipid-phase separation is not observed in SHBs. Force spectroscopy was performed to extract information about thickness and mechanical properties of the hybrid membranes. SHBs are shown to combine the properties of lipid membranes and polymer brushes, and the tip force required to rupture the membrane decreases and the bilayer thickness increases as the block copolymer fraction is increased.",Development of a Correlative Strategy To Discover Colorectal Tumor Tissue Derived Metabolite Biomarkers in Plasma Using Untargeted Metabolomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580524,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"The metabolic profiling of biofluids using untargeted metabolomics provides a promising choice to discover metabolite biomarkers for clinical cancer diagnosis. However, metabolite biomarkers discovered in biofluids may not necessarily reflect the pathological status of tumor tissue, which makes these biomarkers difficult to reproduce. In this study, we developed a new analysis strategy by integrating the univariate and multivariate correlation analysis approach to discover tumor tissue derived (TTD) metabolites in plasma samples. Specifically, untargeted metabolomics was first used to profile a set of paired tissue and plasma samples from 34 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Next, univariate correlation analysis was used to select correlative metabolite pairs between tissue and plasma, and a random forest regression model was utilized to define 243 TTD metabolites in plasma samples. The TTD metabolites in CRC plasma were demonstrated to accurately reflect the pathological status of tumor tissue and have great potential for metabolite biomarker discovery. Accordingly, we conducted a clinical study using a set of 146 plasma samples from CRC patients and gender-matched polyp controls to discover metabolite biomarkers from TTD metabolites. As a result, eight metabolites were selected as potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. For CRC patients after surgery, the survival risk score defined by metabolite biomarkers also performed well in predicting overall survival time ( p = 0.022) and progression-free survival time ( p = 0.002). In conclusion, we developed a new analysis strategy which effectively discovers tumor tissue related metabolite biomarkers in plasma for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",Design and Application of Cisplatin-Loaded Magnetic Nanoparticle Clusters for Smart Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580523,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 08,"One of the major challenges of drug delivery is the development of suitable carriers for therapeutic molecules. In this work, a novel nanoformulation based on superparamagnetic nanoclusters [magnetic nanocrystal clusters (MNCs)] is presented. In order to control the size of the nanoclusters and the density of magnetic cores, several parameters were evaluated and tuned. Then, MNCs were functionalized with a polydopamine layer (MNC@PDO) to improve their stability in aqueous solution, to increase density of functional groups and to obtain a nanosystem suitable for drug-controlled release. Finally, cisplatin was grafted on the surface of MNC@PDO to exploit the system as a magnetic field-guided anticancer delivery system. The biocompatibility of MNC@PDO and the cytotoxic effects of MNC@PDO-cisplatin complex were determined against human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells. In vitro studies demonstrated that the MNC@PDO-cisplatin complexes inhibited the cellular proliferation by a dose-dependent effect. Therefore, by applying an external magnetic field, the released drug exerted its effect on a specific target area. In summary, the MNC@PDO nanosystem has a great potential to be used in targeted nanomedicine for the delivery of other drugs or biofunctional molecules.",Generic Classification Scheme for Second-Order Dipolar Nonlinear Optical Organometallic Complexes That Exhibit Second Harmonic Generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580522,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 15,"The molecular design rules of organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are well established, especially those pertaining to the first-order molecular hyperpolarizability, β, which governs second-harmonic generation (SHG): a phenomenon that is responsible for the frequency doubling processes in many optical applications. The availability of these rational guidelines has propelled the development of new organic SHG chromophores. Conversely, the development of organometallic SHG-active complexes has not been steered so clearly. Many reports on individual series of complexes suggest a singular correlation between their structure and SHG properties. Several reviews have catalogued such results, but these have only distinguished compounds by chemical type, while their SHG properties are described one-by-one for each chemical. We herein propose a generic classification scheme that can systematically rationalize dipolar SHG properties for all organometallic complexes. This classification method stands to provide the holistic information that is needed to generate a rational set of guidelines for the systematic molecular design of dipolar SHG-active organometallic chromophores. Our scheme shows that only a simple set of molecular design rules is required to relate the chemical structure of an organometallic complex to its second-order dipolar SHG properties. This is despite the fact that these molecular design rules are rooted in a complicated panoply of ligand- and crystal-field theory, resonance structures, intramolecular charge transfer considerations, metal oxidation states, and metal coordination attributes. While the roots of these rules can be derived at the individual chemical level, their derivation via our workflow of simple decision-making processes which connect these rules within a simple classification scheme, stands to facilitate a rational molecular design approach toward the materials discovery of organometallic complexes for SHG applications.",Stepwise Expansion of Layered Metal-Organic Frameworks for Nonstochastic Exfoliation into Porous Nanosheets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580521,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 20,"A layered metal-organic framework (MOF) with a porous kagomé lattice, kgmSMe, was synthesized by complexation of 5-methylthioisophthalate (SMe-ip) with Cu2+ in MeOH. As observed by powder XRD, kgmSMe (state I), when immersed in aprotic polar solvents such as THF, underwent stepwise interlayer expansion into a monolayer-expanded state (state III) through a bilayer-expanded state (state II). We successfully obtained the single-crystal structures of states I-III. Of interest, when further immersed in appropriate solvents, state II and III crystals preferentially exfoliated into bilayer and monolayer MOF nanosheets, respectively. The stepwise expansion followed by exfoliation, thus developed, may enable a nonstochastic approach to the selective synthesis of ultrathin porous nanosheets from layered MOF crystals."

The Mn(IV)-oxo complexes were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. In reactivity studies, we observed contrasting effects of M n+ on the reactivity of 1-M n+ in redox reactions such as electron-transfer (ET), oxygen atom transfer (OAT), and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions. In the OAT and ET reactions, the reactivity order of 1-M n+, such as 1-Sc3+ ≈ 1-Al3+ > 1-Y3+ > 1-Lu3+ > 1-Zn2+ > 1-Mg2+ > 1-Ca2+, follows the Lewis acidity of M n+ bound to the Mn-O moiety; that is, the stronger the Lewis acidity of M n+, the higher the reactivity of 1-M n+ becomes. In sharp contrast, the reactivity of 1-M n+ in the HAT reaction was reversed, giving the reactivity order 1-Ca2+ > 1-Mg2+ > 1-Zn2+ > 1-Lu3+> 1-Y3+> 1-Al3+ ≈ 1-Sc3+; that is, the higher is Lewis acidity of M n+, the lower the reactivity of 1-M n+ in the HAT reaction. The latter result implies that the Lewis acidity of M n+ bound to the Mn-O moiety can modulate the basicity of the metal-oxo moiety, thus influencing the HAT reactivity of 1-M n+; cytochrome P450 utilizes the axial thiolate ligand to increase the basicity of the iron-oxo moiety, which enhances the reactivity of compound I in C-H bond activation reactions.",Quality Control of a Functionalized Polymer Catalyst by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDX or EDS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580509,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX or EDS) is a technique often implemented on scanning electron microscopes and a regularly used method for qualitative characterization of solid catalysts. This Technical Note reports a method for the determination of the metal content in a sulfonated polyether ether ketone in the form of an indium(III) salt. The possibility of quantitative determination of the sulfur/indium ratio by EDX was assessed by calibration with two indium salts (sulfide and sulfate) readily available in good purity. The accuracy of the uncorrected instrument response was better than 1% under our conditions. A protocol for investigating the metal content of the solid catalyst is proposed, also providing information about the homogeneity of the metal distribution. Because of the simplicity of the sample preparation, the small quantity of material needed, and the rapidity of the EDX measurements, the method appears to be promising for quantitative characterization of solid catalysts.",Ultrasensitive SERS Substrate for Label-Free Therapeutic-Drug Monitoring of Paclitaxel and Cyclophosphamide in Blood Serum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580508,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has recently emerged as an innovative tool for therapeutic-drug monitoring (TDM), making it an ideal candidate for personalized treatment. Herein, we report a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach for the fabrication of a highly reproducible hybrid SERS substrate based on graphene oxide (GO)-supported l-cysteine-functionalized starlike gold nanoparticles (SAuNPs). These designed substrates were utilized for TDM of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide in blood serum. The SAuNPs' efficient binding at the edges of GO creates a better SERS hotspot with enhanced Raman sensitivity because of the spacing of ∼2.28 nm between the SAuNPs. In addition, the hierarchically modified substrate with a self-assembled monolayer of zwitterionic amino acid l-cysteines acts like a brush layer to prevent SERS-hotspot blockages and fouling by blood-serum proteins. The antifouling nature of the substrate was determined quantitatively by a bichinchonic acid assay using bovine-serum albumin (BSA) as a protein model on the l-cysteine SAuNPs@GO hybrid substrate (the test) and a cysteamine SAuNPs@GO substrate (the control). The l-cysteine SAuNPs@GO hybrid exhibited 80.57% lower BSA fouling compared with that of the cysteamine SAuNPs@GO substrate. The SERS spectra were acquired within 20 s, with detection limits of 1.5 × 10-8 M for paclitaxel and 5 × 10-9 M for cyclophosphamide in blood serum. Such sensitivities are 4 times and 1 order of magnitude higher than the currently available sophisticated analytical techniques, which involve high costs with each analysis.",Effects of Ganoderma lucidum and ‘Essence of Chicken’ on Physical Fatigue Recovery and Exercise Performance Improvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580507,The Chinese journal of physiology,2019 04 15,"A fast-paced lifestyle, pressure from the environment and a heavy work load often cause
extreme tiredness in modern life. Different kinds of nutritional supplements in the form of functional
foods or traditional Chinese medicine, such as ‘essence of chicken’ and Ganoderma lucidum have
been claimed to benefit physical performance and promote health. Previous studies have revealed
that ‘essence of chicken’ or G. lucidum have a wide spectrum of biological activities. In this study, we
combined these two ingredients together (designated as CEG) to evaluate their synergistic effects on
physiological adaption on exercise fatigue and physical activities. The ICR strain mice were allocated
as 0, 833, 1666, and 4165 mg/kg dose groups and administrated by oral gavage consecutively for 4
weeks. Physical activities including grip strength and aerobic endurance were evaluated. Various
fatigue-associated biochemical variables such as lactate, BUN or CK were also evaluated. The levels
of liver and muscle glycogen were measured as an indicator of energy storage at the end of the experiment.
Safety assessments for supplementation were also evaluated. CEG supplementation significantly
increased the endurance and grip strength and demonstrated beneficial effects on lactate production
and clearance rate after an acute exercise challenge. The CEG supplementation significantly
mitigated the BUN and CK indexes after extended exercise and elevated the glycogen content in the
liver and muscle tissues. According to body composition, biochemical and histopathological data,
daily administration of CEG for over 28 days (subacute toxicity) also demonstrated reasonable safety
results for supplementation. Combined G. lucidum and ‘essence of chicken’ can significantly increase
the exercise performance and improve fatigue recovery. It may also provide a viable alternative
nutritional supplement for health promotion.",Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Healthy Donors Reduced Alcohol-induced Anxiety and Depression in an Animal Model of Chronic Alcohol Exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580506,The Chinese journal of physiology,2019 04 15,"Alcohol addiction can cause brain dysfunction and threatens both individuals and society.
Recently, emerging studies have suggested the dysbiosis of gut microbiota induced by alcohol
exposure contributed to the reward-seeking behaviors as well as anxiety, depression. In the current
study, animal model of chronic alcohol exposure was established by providing mice with gradient
concentrations of alcohol from 2%, 4%, and 6% to 8% for 21 days. Moreover, three fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) plans were innovatively designed to explore the potential effects of FMT from
3 healthy donors on alcohol-induced neuropsychic behaviors. To our knowledge, for the first time,
we found that anxiety and depression after alcohol intake were gradually relieved with the extension
of transplantation. Although the two-week FMT starting at the end of alcohol treatment had few
effects, the transplantation started at 8% ethanol exposure alleviated alcohol-induced depression in
tail suspension test. More importantly, accompanied by three-week exposure, the five-week FMT
significantly decreased anxiety-like behaviors in open field test and depression in tail suspension test.
These data validated the role of gut microbiota in alcohol addiction and indicated the modulation of
healthy donor FMT on alcohol-related anxiety and depression, providing a new target for treating
alcohol addiction by targeting microbiota.",Xueshuantong for Injection Ameliorates Diabetic Nephropathy in a Rat Model of Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580505,The Chinese journal of physiology,2019 04 15,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes and becomes the chief cause
of end-stage renal disease. Our study was undertaken to investigate the ameliorative effect and
underlying mechanism of Xueshuantong for Injection (XST) on DN in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced
rats. Effect of XST treatment (XST, 50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) lasting 60 days after STZ-induced (60 mg/kg,
i.p.) diabetes was investigated. Blood sugar levels and body weight were recorded every week of the
experiment. At the 28th and 56th days after injection urine glucose and 24 h urine protein excretion
were determined. Apoptosis related factors such as cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax and inflammation
related factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were detected by PCR
or western blot. The expression levels of fibronectin, Collagen Ⅰ, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)
and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling pathway, and receptor for
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was investigated. Our results showed that XST treatment
did not affect levels of body weight, blood glucose and urine glucose levels. Our analysis revealed that XST
inhibited cell apoptosis and suppressed the properties of RAGE in the kidney. XST treatment could
also significantly suppress the overexpression of pro-inflammatory mediators in kidney and prevent
renal fibrosis by blocking the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings
suggested that XST could provide protection against DN through reduction of RAGE accumulation,
decreasing inflammation, inhibition of renal fibrosis, and blocking the TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling
pathway.",Exploration of Niflumic Acid’s Action on Ca²⁺ Movement and Cell Viability in Human Osteosarcoma Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580504,The Chinese journal of physiology,2019 04 15,"Niflumic acid, a drug used for joint and muscular pain, affected Ca²⁺ signaling in different
models. However, the effect of niflumic acid on Ca²⁺ homeostasis and Ca²⁺-related physiology
in human osteosarcoma cells is unknown. This study examined the effect of niflumic acid on
cytosolic free Ca²⁺ concentrations ([Ca²⁺]i) in MG63 human osteosarcoma cells. Intracellular Ca²⁺
concentrations in suspended cells were monitored by using the fluorescent Ca²⁺-sensitive dye fura-
2. Cell viability was examined by using 4-[3-[4-lodophenyl]-2-4(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio-
1,3-benzene disulfonate] water soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1). In MG63 cells, niflumic acid at
concentrations of 250-750 μM evoked [Ca²⁺]i rises concentration-dependently. Niflumic acid-evoked
Ca²⁺ entry was confirmed by Mn²⁺-induced quenching of fura-2 fluorescence. This entry
was inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, SKF96365, the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol
12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), but was not affected by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. In Ca²⁺-
free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG)
inhibited niflumic acid-evoked [Ca²⁺]i rises. Conversely, treatment with niflumic acid abolished TG-evoked
[Ca²⁺]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 also partly reduced niflumic
acid-evoked [Ca²⁺]i rises. Niflumic acid killed cells at 200-500 μM in a concentration-dependent
fashion. Chelating cytosolic Ca²⁺ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid/
AM (BAPTA/AM) did not reverse niflumic acid-induced cytotoxicity. Collectively, our data suggest
that in MG63 cells, niflumic acid induced [Ca²⁺]i rises by evoking PLC-dependent Ca²⁺ release from
the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca²⁺ entry via PKC-sensitive store-operated Ca²⁺ entry. Niflumic
acid also induced Ca²⁺-independent cell death.",Effects of Intraperitoneal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Administration on Nociceptive/Repetitive Behaviors in Juvenile Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580503,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2019 03 29,"Dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Pharmacological inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is widely used to model neurobehavioral pathologies and underlying mechanisms. There is ample evidence that overstimulation of NMDA-dependent neurotransmission may induce neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as repetitive behaviors and hypersensitization to nociception and cognitive disruption, pharmacological modeling using NMDA has been limited due to the induction of neurotoxicity and blood brain barrier breakdown, especially in young animals. In this study, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal NMDA-administration on nociceptive and repetitive behaviors in ICR mice. Intraperitoneal injection of NMDA induced repetitive grooming and tail biting/licking behaviors in a dose- and age-dependent manner. Nociceptive and repetitive behaviors were more prominent in juvenile mice than adult mice. We did not observe extensive blood brain barrier breakdown or neuronal cell death after peritoneal injection of NMDA, indicating limited neurotoxic effects despite a significant increase in NMDA concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest that the observed behavioral changes were not mediated by general NMDA toxicity. In the hot plate test, we found that the latency of paw licking and jumping decreased in the NMDA-exposed mice especially in the 75 mg/kg group, suggesting increased nociceptive sensitivity in NMDA-treated animals. Repetitive behaviors and increased pain sensitivity are often comorbid in psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). Therefore, the behavioral characteristics of intraperitoneal NMDA-administered mice described herein may be valuable for studying the mechanisms underlying relevant disorders and screening candidate therapeutic molecules.",Host-Microbiota Interaction and Intestinal Epithelial Functions under Circadian Control: Implications in Colitis and Metabolic Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580502,The Chinese journal of physiology,2019 04 15,"Commensal microbes are involved in intestinal homeostasis, and the dysregulation of host-microbe
interactions may lead to the development of local and systemic disorders. Recent evidence
indicated that microbiota dysbiosis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease and metabolism-related disorders. The circadian clock system originally identified in the
brain was later found in the gastrointestinal tract. Although the light-controlled central clock in
the brain is responsible for the synchronization of peripheral clocks, the timing of meal consumption
serves as another cue for the rhythmic setting of gastrointestinal digestion, absorption, and epithelial
renewal and barrier functions. Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that in addition to daylight
and food intake, microbiota (as an environmental factor) are involved in the circadian control of
gut homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrated that microbial metabolites and innate signaling

regulatory role of microbiota in intestinal physiology and systemic metabolism. In this review, we
discuss the host-microbe interplay that contributes to the regulation of intestinal clock signals and
physiological functions and explore how microbiota dysbiosis may cause misalignment of circadian

Here we report an evaluation of the published consensus method for the culture of B. pseudomallei from Lao soil in comparison with our conventional culture method and with PCR with or without prior broth enrichment. Methods: One hundred soil samples were collected from a field known to contain B. pseudomallei and processed by: (i) the conventional method, (ii-iii) the consensus method using media prepared in either Laos or Thailand, and (iv) the consensus method performed in Thailand, as well as by (v) PCR following direct extraction of DNA from soil and (vi) PCR following broth pre-enrichment. Results: The numbers of samples in which B. pseudomallei was detected were 42, 10, 7, 6, 6 and 84, respectively. However, two samples were positive by the consensus method but negative by conventional culture, and one sample was negative by PCR following enrichment although B. pseudomallei was isolated by the conventional culture method. Conclusions/Discussion: The results show that no single method will detect all environmental samples that contain B. pseudomallei. People conducting environmental surveys for this organism should be aware of the possibility of false-negative results using the consensus culture method. An approach that entails screening using PCR after enrichment, followed by the evaluation of a range of different culture methods on PCR-positive samples to determine which works best in each setting, is recommended."

Part C, Seminars in medical genetics",2018 12 23,"Nablus syndrome was first described by the late Ahmad Teebi in 2000, and 13 individuals have been reported to date. Nablus syndrome can be clinically diagnosed based on striking facial features, including tight glistening skin with reduced facial expression, blepharophimosis, telecanthus, bulky nasal tip, abnormal external ear architecture, upswept frontal hairline, and sparse eyebrows. However, the precise genetic etiology for this rare condition remains elusive. Comparative microarray analyses of individuals with Nablus syndrome (including two mother-son pairs) reveal an overlapping 8q22.1 microdeletion, with a minimal critical region of 1.84 Mb (94.43-96.27 Mb). Whereas this deletion is present in all affected individuals, 13 individuals without Nablus syndrome (including two mother-child pairs) also have the 8q22.1 microdeletion that partially or fully overlaps the minimal critical region. Thus, the 8q22.1 microdeletion is necessary but not sufficient to cause the clinical features characteristic of Nablus syndrome. We discuss possible explanations for Nablus syndrome, including one-locus, two-locus, epigenetic, and environmental mechanisms. We performed exome sequencing for five individuals with Nablus syndrome. Although we failed to identify any deleterious rare coding variants in the critical region that were shared between individuals, we did identify one common SNP in an intronic region that was shared. Clearly, unraveling the genetic mechanism(s) of Nablus syndrome will require additional investigation, including genomic and RNA sequencing of a larger cohort of affected individuals. If successful, it will provide important insights into fundamental concepts such as variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance, and complex disease relevant to both Mendelian and non-Mendelian disorders.",Unsolved recognizable patterns of human malformation: Challenges and opportunities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580485,"American journal of medical genetics. Part C, Seminars in medical genetics",2018 12 23,"Due to the efforts of the clinical and scientific communities and boosted by recent advances in genetic technologies, we now understand the molecular mechanisms underlying most of the frequent and recognizable human malformation syndromes. However, some well-established human malformation syndromes remain without a molecular diagnosis despite intensive investigation. This issue of Seminars mines the phenotypic entries in OMIM and estimates that of the documented 2,034 unsolved entries likely to represent a rare genetic disease, only 160 are well-established and possibly amenable to investigation. This issue also reviews well-characterized and extensively investigated human malformation syndromes and associations that remain unsolved, including the following: Dubowitz syndrome (MIM 223370%), Hallermann-Streiff syndrome (MIM 234100%), PHACE syndrome (MIM 606519), Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome (MIM 164180), Aicardi syndrome (MIM 304050%), Gomez-Lopez-Hernandez syndrome and Rhombencephalosynapsis (MIM 601853%), VACTERL (MIM 192350%), and Nablus syndrome (MIM #608156). Possible explanations for their intractability to molecular diagnosis are explored, including genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, mosaicism, epigenetics, gene-environment interactions, and other non-Mendelian contributions. Finally, this issue of Seminars presents a path forward for these unsolved rare conditions and suggests a renewed focus on solving amendable OMIM disorders. It is clear that the way forward will require new technologies, global cooperation, and data sharing; these will also be necessary to help reach the vision of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC), that is to enable all people living with a rare disease to receive an accurate diagnosis, care and available therapy within 1 year of coming to medical attention.","Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in Dubowitz syndrome: Implications for diagnosis, management and further research.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580484,"American journal of medical genetics. Part C, Seminars in medical genetics",2018 12 23,"Dubowitz syndrome was described in 1965 as a recognizable syndrome characterized by microcephaly, short stature, eczema, mild developmental delays, and an increased risk of malignancy. Since its original description, there have been over 200 reported cases though no single gene has been identified to explain a significant proportion of affected individuals. Since the last definitive review of Dubowitz syndrome in 1996, there have been 63 individuals with a clinical, or suspected, diagnosis of Dubowitz syndrome reported in 51 publications. These individuals show a markedly wide spectrum with respect to growth, facial gestalt, psychomotor development, and risk of malignancy; genetic causes were identified in 33% (21/63). Seven individuals had deleterious copy number variants, in particular deletions at 14q32 and 17q24 were reported and showed overlap with the Dubowitz phenotype. Several cases were shown to have single gene disorders that included de novo or biallelic pathogenic variants in several genes including NSUN2 and LIG4 frequently identified by next-generation sequencing methods. It appears that the inability to identify a single gene responsible for Dubowitz syndrome reflects its extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity. However, detailed phenotyping combined with careful grouping of subsets of unsolved cases and in conjunction with data-sharing will identify novel disease genes responsible for additional cases. In the interim, for those clinically diagnosed with a Dubowitz phenotype, we recommend assessment by a Medical Geneticist, a microarray and, if available, clinical or research based genome-wide sequencing.

An analysis of the unexplained phenotypic descriptions in OMIM®.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580481,"American journal of medical genetics. Part C, Seminars in medical genetics",2018 12 23,"For years, the genetics community has estimated the number of individual rare genetic diseases to be approximately 6,000-8,000. A commonly quoted derivation of this estimate is based on the simple addition of the number of phenotypic entries with and without confirmed molecular etiologies in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®). Here, we examine the validity of this estimation by mining the phenotypic entries in OMIM that are of likely or suspected Mendelian inheritance without a molecular cause (MIM number prefix ""%"" or ""null""). Of the 3,204 unsolved phenotypic entries in OMIM, only two-thirds (2,034 entries) represented rare diseases. Of these, 8% were considered ""well-established"" based on their description in commonly used reference textbooks. We hypothesize based on the large proportion of entries that represent single families reported prior to 2011, that a number of the unsolved entries represent pathogenic variants in known genes. The novel gene discovery potential of these entries is therefore likely lower than originally thought. Given that the majority of the ~300 new disease-gene associations curated each year by OMIM were never associated with a ""%"" or ""null"" sign, the true scope of the rare disease atlas is likely much larger than previously anticipated.",An update on oculocerebrocutaneous (Delleman-Oorthuys) syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580480,"American journal of medical genetics.

Based on a review of 40 patients with OCCS, existing clinical criteria have been revised. Because of the asymmetric and patchy distribution of features, lack of recurrence in families, male preponderance and completely skewed X-inactivation in one female, OCCS is hypothesized to result from postzygotic mosaic variants in an X-linked gene. Whole exome and genome sequencing on blood DNA in two patients failed to identify pathogenic variants so far. In view of the overlapping features, in particular of the brain, of OCCS and Aicardi syndrome, both may be pathogenetically related or even result from different variants in the same gene. For the elucidation of the cause of OCCS, exome or genome sequencing on multiple lesional tissues is the primary goal."

Our systematic review identified variables predicting venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this group. Age and injury type were commonly reported to increase the odds of VTE (odds ratio 1.5-3.48). We found limited evidence to support the use of other risk factors within prediction models. SUMMARY: Background Patients immobilized after lower limb injury are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). There is international variation in the use of thromboprophylaxis for such patients. Risk-based strategies have been adopted to aid decision making in many settings. The accuracy of these strategies is unclear. Objectives A systematic review was undertaken to identify all individual patient-identifiable risk factors linked to any VTE outcome following lower limb immobilization. Methods Several electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2017. Any studies that included a measurement of VTE as a patient outcome in adults requiring temporary immobilization (e.g. leg cast or brace in an ambulatory setting) for an isolated lower limb injury and reported risk factor variables were included. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to synthesize the evidence. Results Our database search returned 4771 citations, of which 15 studies reporting outcome data on 80 678 patients were eligible for analysis. Risk-factor associations were reported through regression analyses, non-parametric tests and descriptive statistics. All studies were assessed as at moderate or serious risk of bias using the ROBINS-I risk of bias tool. Advancing age and injury type were the only individual risk factors demonstrating a reproducible association with increased symptomatic and/or asymptomatic VTE rates. Several risk factors currently used in scoring tools did not appear to be robustly evaluated for subsequent association with VTE within these studies. Conclusions Clinicians should be aware of the limited evidence to support individual risk factors in guiding thromboprophylaxis use for this patient cohort.",Indoor air quality in schools of a highly polluted south Mediterranean area.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580463,Indoor air,2019 02 25,"This study aimed at surveying lower secondary schools in southern Italy, in a highly polluted area. A community close to an industrial area and three villages in rural areas was investigated. Indoor temperature, relative humidity (RH), gaseous pollutants (CO2 and NO2 ), selected biological pollutants in indoor dust, and the indoor/outdoor mass concentration and elemental composition of PM2.5 were ascertained. Temperature and RH were within, or close to, the comfort range, while CO2 frequently exceeded the threshold of 1000 ppm, indicating inadequate air exchange rate. In all the classrooms, median NO2 levels were above the WHO threshold value. Dermatophagoides p. allergen concentration was below the sensitizing threshold, while high endotoxin levels were detected in the classrooms, suggesting schools may produce significant risks of endotoxin exposure. Concentration and solubility of PM2.5 elements were used to identify the sources of indoor particles. Indoor concentration of most elements was higher than outdoors. Resuspension was responsible for the indoor increase in soil components. For elements from industrial emission (Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, V), the indoor concentration depended on penetration from the outside. For these elements, differences in rural vs industrial concentrations were found, suggesting industrial sources may influence indoor air quality nearby schools.",What is the optimal site and biopsy technique for the diagnosis of oral mucosal autoimmune blistering disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580462,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,2019 03 05,The aim of this study was to determine which biopsy method produces the best diagnostic yield in patients presenting with autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBDs) of the oral mucosa.,"Dysphagia: Interprofessional Management, Impact, and Patient-Centered Care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580461,Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2019 03 20,"Dysphagia affects a multitude of people worldwide with tremendous impact on the affected individual, families, and caregivers.

It has been hypothesized that timely and adequate nutrition support may optimize the host response and thereby minimize nutritionally related complications while improving overall outcome. Any illness in due course can lead to a malnourished state-critical illness can worsen this state as patients may become immunocompromised and unable to mount an adequate inflammatory response and therefore susceptible to poor outcomes. Data indicate that prevalence of malnutrition in the ICU ranges from 38% to 78% and is independently associated with poor outcomes. Hence, exploring the role of nutrition as a way to mitigate critical illness is important. In this review, the basic pathophysiology of critical illness and how it alters carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of malnutrition and how it affects patient and hospital outcomes. Finally, a summary of the available evidence regarding nutrition support and its impact on outcomes are provided.

Progress in the translation of the science into a viable diagnostic tool is impeded by inadequate sensitivity of data acquisition systems in detection of fast DNA translocations through the pore. To combat this, slowing the transport of DNA through the nanopore by use of various media or by altering experimental parameters is common. Applying a concentration gradient of KCl in the experimental ionic solution has been shown to effectively prolong dwell times as well as increase the capture rate of DNA by the nanopore. Our previous work has corroborated the ability of LiCl ionic solution to slow down the transport of dsDNA through the nanopore by up to 10-fold through cation-DNA interactions. However, this drastically reduced the event occurrence frequency, thus hindering the efficacy of this system as a reliable biosensor downstream. Here, we present the use of a concentration gradient of lithium chloride ionic solution to increase the event frequency of single molecule dsDNA translocation through a solid state nanopore. By using 0.5 M/3 M LiCl on the cis/trans chambers respectively, average dwell times experienced up to a 3-fold increase when compared to experiments run in symmetric 1 M LiCl.

The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) is involved in the regulation of cardiac lipid metabolism. Here, we describe a novel PPARδ-dependent molecular cascade involving microRNA-29a (miR-29a) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which is reactivated in cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we identify a novel role of miR-29a, in which it has a cardioprotective function in isoproterenol hydrochloride-induced cardiac hypertrophy by targeting PPARδ and downregulating ANF. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-29a reduces the isoproterenol hydrochloride-induced cardiac hypertrophy response, thereby underlining the potential clinical relevance of miR-29a in which it may serve as a potent therapeutic target for heart hypertrophy treatment.","Urinary Cell-Free DNA: Isolation, Quantification, and Quality Assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580434,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 03 04,"Urine cell-free DNA is an important source of diagnostic markers for different diseases (e.g., cancer and prenatal diagnosis).

The time-frame of the overall process, from sample preparation (i.e., food rinse or homogenate preparation, microbial enrichment, and filtration steps) to detection is 8 h or less. While microfiltration has been practiced for 70 years, the complex interactions between food substances and filter membrane surfaces have shown that food pretreatment methods need to be developed on a case by case basis for the recovery of bacteria from food homogenates and/or rinses. We have also demonstrated that addition of protease to treat homogenates of different poultry products prior to microfiltration avoids the rapid decrease in flux that otherwise occurs during microfiltration.

Four years after its launch, we evaluated the contextual effect of user fee removal intervention on the probability of an illness occurring and the likelihood of using health services among children under 5. We also explored the potential effect on the inequality in healthcare access. Methods We used a comparative cross-sectional design based upon household survey data collected years after the intervention onset in one intervention and one comparison district. Propensity scores weighting was used to achieve balance on covariates between the two districts, which was followed by logistic multilevel modelling to estimate average marginal effects (AME). Results We estimated that there was not a significant difference in the reduced probability of an illness occurring in the intervention district compared to the non-intervention district [AME 4.4; 95% CI  1.0-9.8)]. However, the probability of using health services was 17.2% (95% CI 15.0-26.6) higher among children living in the intervention district relative to the comparison district, which rose to 20.7% (95% CI 9.9-31.5) for severe illness episodes. We detected no significant differences in the probability of health services use according to socio-economic status [χ2 (5) = 12.90, p = 0.61]. Conclusions for Practice In our study, we found that user fee removal led to a significant increase in the use of health services in the longer term, but it is not adequate by itself to reduce the risk of illness occurrence and socioeconomic inequities in the use of health services.",Gaze following in an asocial reptile (Eublepharis macularius).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580392,Animal cognition,2019 05 15,"Gaze following is the ability to utilise information from another's gaze. It is most often seen in a social context or as a reflexive response to interesting external stimuli. Social species can potentially reveal utilisable knowledge about another's future intentions by attending to the target of their gaze. However, in even more fundamental situations, being sensitive to another's gaze can also be useful such as when it can facilitate greater foraging efficiency or lead to earlier predator detection. While gaze sensitivity has been shown to be prevalent in a number of social species, little is currently known about the potential for gaze following in asocial species. The current study investigated whether an asocial reptile, the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius), could reliably use the visual indicators of attention to follow the gaze of a conspecific around a barrier. We operated three trial conditions and found subjects (N = 6) responded significantly more to the conspecific demonstrator looking up at a laser stimulus projected onto an occluder during the experimental condition compared to either of two control conditions. The study's findings point toward growing evidence for gaze-following ability in reptiles, who are typically categorised as asocial. Furthermore, our findings support developing comparative social cognition research showing the origins of gaze following and other cognitive behaviours that may be more widely distributed across taxonomic groups than hitherto thought.",Differences in the imaging of Crohn's disease patients between North America and Europe: are we ready to bridge the divide?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580391,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 05 12,"The emphasis of treatment in Crohn's disease has evolved from a reactive model to ""treat-to-target"" approaches.

The evolution of molecular profiling and tissue-of-origin classifiers have the potential to transform the diagnosis, classification and therapeutic management of patients with CUP but robust evidence to support widespread use is lacking. Precision medicine has transformed treatment strategy in known tumour types; in CUP, however, there remains a clinical need for a better understanding of molecular characteristics to establish the potential role of novel or existing therapeutics.

Targeting lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an H3K4 demethylase, is therefore a promising approach to treat these disorders. However, LSD1 forms complexes with cofactors including growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B), a critical regulator of hematopoietic differentiation. Known tranylcypromine-based irreversible LSD1 inhibitors bind to coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and disrupt the LSD1-GFI1B complex, which is associated with hematotoxicity such as thrombocytopenia, representing a major hurdle in the development of LSD1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents. To discover LSD1 inhibitors with potent epigenetic modulation and lower risk of hematotoxicity, we screened small molecules that enhance H3K4 methylation by the inhibition of LSD1 enzyme activity in primary cultured rat neurons but have little impact on LSD1-GFI1B complex in human TF-1a erythroblasts. Here we report the discovery of a specific inhibitor of LSD1 enzyme activity, T-448 (3-((1S,2R)-2-(cyclobutylamino)cyclopropyl)-N-(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzamide fumarate). T-448 has minimal impact on the LSD1-GFI1B complex and a superior hematological safety profile in mice via the generation of a compact formyl-FAD adduct.

The Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox proportional hazard regression model were used for the prognostic analysis. RESULTS A total of 162 patients were included with a mean age of 53 years. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates of the entire group were 43.7% and 47.9%, respectively. The sex, location, tumor size, and radiation treatment had no effect on survival outcomes on univariate analysis. Tumor stage, surgery, and chemotherapy were significant indicators of both OS and CSS on multivariable analysis.

Short-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), changes in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) level, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow after PCI were studied as clinical outcomes. RESULTS Seventeen RCTs including 10 072 patients were retrieved. High-dose atorvastatin showed greater benefits in reducing the incidence of short-term MACEs (OR 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.94; P=0.01) and hs-CRP level (SMD -1.59; 95% CI: -2.38 to -0.80; P<0.0001) among ACS patients after PCI. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in terms of peak CK-MB (SMD -0.34; 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.10; P=0.13) or final TIMI flow grade 3 (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.73 to 2.36; P=0.36) after PCI. High-dose atorvastatin therapy also was not associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (OR 1.95; 95% CI: 0.95 to 4.03; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS The results of this meta-analysis suggest that high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment reduces the incidence of short-term MACEs and hs-CRP level without increasing drug-induced hepatotoxicity in ACS patients after PCI.",Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase/Oncogene or C-Ros Oncogene 1 (ALK/ROS1) Fusions Inflict Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Female Patients Older Than 60 Years of Age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580372,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 03 04,"BACKGROUND Lung cancer has become a leading disease for the tumor-induced mortality.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Among 1449 NSCLC patients, 457 patients who were diagnosed as consecutive EGFR mutations or ALK/ROS1 fusions between November 2016 and February 2018 were involved in the present study. EGFR genes or ALK/ROS1 mutations were detected by using DNA sequencing technique and amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS). The mRNAs of ROS1 and ALK fusion were examined by using polymerase chain reaction technique and fusion gene detection kit. RESULTS Females were more often inflicted by the EGFR mutations, especially for the exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation. There were significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in females compared to males (P<0.05) and significantly more ALK/ROS1 fusions in <60 years of age patients compared to patients older than 60 years of age (P<0.05). Exon 21 L858R and L861Q dominantly occurred in patients ≥60 years of age and exon 19 deletion in patients <60 years of age. EML-ALK-1 mainly existed in the female NSCLC patients.

Previous studies have detected separate effects of BPA and HFD; however, none have assessed possible interactive effects. Here, pregnant dams consumed 0, 40, or 400 µg BPA/kg/day and were fed either a control (CON; 15.8% kcal fat) or HFD (45% kcal fat) from gestational day 2 through parturition. The pups were individually dosed with BPA from postnatal days (P) 1-10, while the dams continued to consume one of the two diets. Maternal behavior increased with the HFD while the offspring's periadolescent social play decreased with BPA, but no interactive effects were observed. Neither HFD nor BPA exposure changed performance on a social recognition task, and only BPA had an effect on the elevated plus maze. BPA increased several cytokines in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P10 males but not females. Expression of several genes related to hormone synthesis and receptors, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the mPFC on P10 and P90 were altered due to BPA and/or HFD exposure with rare interactive effects. BPA resulted in an increase in the gene expression of Esr1 in the mPFC of females on both P10 and P90.

Cognitive and memory deficits are common in older adults and especially in those with diabetes. This is mainly because of hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and vascular abnormalities. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) can decrease oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and inflammatory markers, and improve vascular function. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects of CoQ10 on cognitive function, learning, and memory in middle-aged healthy and diabetic rats. Adult middle-aged male Wistar rats (390-460 g, 12-13 months old) were divided into 6 experimental groups. Diabetes was induced by a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). CoQ10 (20 or 120 mg/kg, orally by gavage) was administered for 45 days. The cognitive function and learning memory of rats were evaluated using novel object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance tests. The discrimination index of the NOR test in the diabetic groups receiving CoQ10 (20 or 120 mg/kg) and the healthy group receiving CoQ10 (120 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that in the control group. In addition, the step through latency was significantly longer and the time spent in the dark compartment was significantly shorter in the diabetic groups receiving CoQ10 than in the control group. CoQ10 supplementation can improve learning and memory deficits induced by diabetes in older subjects. In addition, CoQ10 at higher doses can improve cognitive performance in older healthy subjects.","Fine-Mapping of Xq25.1-27.2 Shows Association of Early Childhood Caries with Genetic Variants Depending on Dietary Habits, Protecting Children Who Drink Milk before Going to Bed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580329,Caries research,2019 04 17,"Early childhood caries (ECC) is a chronic, infectious disease that affects the primary dentition of young children.

Two hundred and fifty-nine unrelated children with no chronic illnesses from 2 to 5 years of age who had no systemic fluoride consumption were evaluated using a cross-sectional design. Data on oral habits were obtained through a questionnaire, and caries experience data were collected by clinical examination. Twenty-three markers in ten genes were studied. Genotyping of the selected polymorphisms was carried out by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Regression analyses were performed comparing individuals with and without caries experience.

This study explores the expression of FoxM1 in human ICC, its relationships with clinical outcomes, and its role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ICC in vitro and in vivo. The results show that FoxM1 was markedly elevated in tumor tissues versus the paired peritumoral tissues. Overexpression of FoxM1 was correlated with multiple tumor nodules, tumor size > 5 cm, positive lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Cox analysis revealed that overexpression of FoxM1 is an independent prognostic indicator for both the overall survival and disease-free survival of ICC patients after hepatectomy. Furthermore, up/downregulation of FoxM1 markedly promoted/inhibited ICC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that overexpression of FoxM1 resulted in the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways in ICC, and selected components of some key signaling pathways such as c-Myc signaling were confirmed in vitro. In addition, overexpression of FoxM1 enhanced MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein expression in ICC cells. In conclusion, FoxM1 promotes ICC progression and is a reliable predictor of poor prognosis in ICC.",Naringin targets Zeb1 to suppress osteosarcoma cell proliferation and metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580326,Aging,2019 01 18,"Naringin, a citrus bioflavonoid, has anti-inflammatory actions and cardio- and neuroprotective effects. In addition, naringin exhibits multiple antitumor actions in several cancer types, including osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer. Here, we show that naringin inhibits proliferation and invasion and induces apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), a transcriptional repressor of epithelial differentiation involved in tumor metastasis. Our expression analyses confirm that Zeb1 is highly expressed in osteosarcoma specimens and cell lines. The effects of naringin, which included downregulation of Cyclin D1, MMP2, and bcl-2, where reproduced by siRNA-mediated Zeb1 silencing, whereas Zeb1 overexpression increased proliferation, migration, and Cyclin D1, MMP2, and bcl-2 levels. In addition, naringin administration reduced tumor nodule formation and attenuated the expression of the above proteins in the livers of mice injected with MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Our study provides preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic application of naringin in the treatment of osteosarcoma.",Dual screen and confirm rapid test does not reduce overtreatment of syphilis in pregnant women living in a non-venereal treponematoses endemic region: a field evaluation among antenatal care attendees in Burkina Faso.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580325,Sexually transmitted infections,2018 12 23,"In resource-limited settings, screening pregnant women for syphilis using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is a key tool in the prevention of congenital syphilis.

The literature published mainly between 2000 and 2017 was reviewed with an emphasis on approaches emerging after 2000, in particular on oscillatory dynamics, connectivity studies, and deep brain stimulation. Eighty-five articles were reviewed. The main observations were a general slowing of background activity, excessive synchronization of beta activity, and disturbed movement-related gamma oscillations in the BG and in the cortico-subcortical and cortico-cortical motor loops, suppressible by dopaminergic medication as well as by high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS). Non-motor symptoms are related mainly to changes in the alpha frequency range. EEG parameters can be useful in defining the risk of dementia in PD. Further progress was reported recently using advanced analytical technologies and high-performance computing (graph theory).

Among them, the most potent compound E24 exhibited comparable activity against a panel of cancer cells (GI50 ranging 0.05-0.98 μM) and tubulin polymerization inhibition (IC50 = 1.49 μM) with reference drug CA-4(P) (GI50 ranging 0.019-0.32 μM, IC50 = 2.18 μM). The following assays indicated that compound E24 disturbed the dynamics of tubulin catastrophe and rescue, which triggered G2/M arrest, leading to ROS accumulation, cleavage of PARP and apoptosis. Molecular dynamics simulation validated that compound E24 could tightly bind into tubulin heterodimers with β Lys 254 and β Cys 241 of tubulin in the docking pose. Metabolic stability and pharmacokinetics parameters were also determined. The half time (t1/2) displayed species differences in three microsomes. The plasma elimination half-life (t1/2), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), mean retention time (MRT), the area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and distribution volume (Vz) of E24 after intravenous administration were 0.90 ± 0.22 h, 594.50 ± 97.23 ng/mL, 1.09 ± 0.22 h, 413.67 ± 105.64 ng/mL*h and 5.03 ± 1.82 L/kg, respectively.

Selectivity improvement is always popular in modern oncology because of decreased side effects in conventional cancer chemotherapy. The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), a robust strategy for targeted therapy, applies antibodies to selectively deliver a potent cytotoxic compound to tumor cells and thus improve the therapeutic efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents. Three ADC products (trastuzumab emtansine, brentuximab vedotin and inotuzumab ozogamicin) are already on the market, and several compounds are in clinical trials. Compared with ADCs, small molecule-drug conjugates (SMDCs) provide a new, less established perspective for targeted delivery. Nevertheless, SMDCs have several strengths: they have 1) a non-immunogenic nature, 2) much more manageable synthesis, 3) lower molecular weights, which confer a high potential for good cell penetration in solid tumors. SMDCs might therefore be a promising alternative with similar efficacy to ADCs. In this article, we highlight the medicinal chemistry aspects of SMDC design. SMDC targeting ligands, linkers and small-molecule payloads will be discussed. Successful cases of SMDCs used as therapeutic agents and other applications of SMDC will also be included.","Discovery, synthesis and anti-atherosclerotic activities of a novel selective sphingomyelin synthase 2 inhibitor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580239,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 08,"The sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) is a potential target for pharmacological intervention in atherosclerosis. However, so far, few selective SMS2 inhibitors and their pharmacological activities were reported. In this study, a class of 2-benzyloxybenzamides were discovered as novel SMS2 inhibitors through scaffold hopping and structural optimization. Among them, Ly93 as one of the most potent inhibitors exhibited IC50 values of 91 nM and 133.9 μM against purified SMS2 and SMS1 respectively. The selectivity ratio of Ly93 was more than 1400-fold for purified SMS2 over SMS1. The in vitro studies indicated that Ly93 not only dose-dependently diminished apoB secretion from Huh7 cells, but also significantly reduced the SMS activity and increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Meanwhile, Ly93 inhibited the secretion of LPS-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine in macrophages. The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ly93 performed on C57BL/6J mice demonstrated that Ly93 was orally efficacious. As a potent selective SMS2 inhibitor, Ly93 significantly decreased the plasma SM levels of C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, Ly93 was capable of dose-dependently attenuating the atherosclerotic lesions in the root and the entire aorta as well as macrophage content in lesions, in apolipoprotein E gene knockout mice treated with Ly93. In conclusion, we discovered a novel selective SMS2 inhibitor Ly93 and demonstrated its anti-atherosclerotic activities in vivo. The preliminary molecular mechanism-of-action studies revealed its function in lipid homeostasis and inflammation process, which indicated that the selective inhibition of SMS2 would be a promising treatment for atherosclerosis."

This issue lacks high quality evidence, which makes giving medical advice challenging. To aid decision making on this subject we performed an internet mediated survey to determine the expert opinion on this issue. The survey was answered by one hundred and eight obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYN). The questions were aimed at the content of the medical advice given to pregnant patients on Ramadan (for Muslim patients) and Yom Kippur (for Jewish patients) fasts. For both fasts, most physicians recommended against fasting on the second or third trimester, while fasting on the first trimester was controversial. Differences were found between medical advices provided by physicians according to their demographical characteristics. Regarding Ramadan fast, senior specialists were more lenient about fasting than younger specialists (62% and 35%, respectively, p = 0.01). As to Yom Kippur fast, religious and traditional physicians were more likely to permit fasting compared to their secular colleagues (53% and 25%, respectively, p = 0.01). Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was conducted revealing possible adverse maternal and fetal outcomes of fasting; however the risk for long term clinical complications is yet to be defined.","Relationship between sperm DNA damage with sperm parameters, oxidative markers in teratozoospermic men.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580226,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,This study was aimed at determining the extent of sperm nuclear DNA damage in patients with isolated teratozoospermia and examining its relationship with oxidative stress.,Molecular markers for biomass burning associated with the characterization of PM2.5 and component sources during dry season haze episodes in Upper South East Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580223,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Severe air pollution in the form of smoke haze in the northern part of Southeast Asia (SEA) occurs annually in the dry season due to huge open area burning. Molecular markers of biomass burning were investigated by characterization of fine particles (PM2.5) collected in the dry season (23 February-28 April 2016). The average PM2.5, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations were 64.3 ± 17.6 μg m-3, 23.6 ± 8.1 μg m-3 and 2.85 ± 0.98 μg m-3, respectively. SO42- was the dominant species (8.73 ± 2.88 μg m-3) of water-soluble ion, followed by NH4+ (3.32 ± 1.01 μg m-3) and NO3- (2.70 ± 0.51 μg m-3). High concentrations of the biomass burning tracers K+ (1.27 ± 0.38 μg m-3) and levoglucosan (1.22 ± 0.75 μg m-3) were observed. The ratios of levoglucosan/K+ (0.92 ± 0.35) and levoglucosan/mannosan (20.4 ± 4.1) identified forest and agricultural waste burning as major contributors to the aerosol. Strong correlations (r > 0.800) between levoglucosan and OC, K+, anhydrosugar isomer (mannosan and galactosan) and other saccharides (mannose, arabitol and mannitol) verified that combustion of biomass was the major source of organic compounds associated with PM2.5 aerosols. Oxalate was the most abundant (0.75 ± 0.17 μg m-3; 53%) of the carboxylates. The concentration of oxalate was strongly correlated to that of PM2.5 (r = 0.799) and levoglucosan (r = 0.615), indicating that oxalate originates mainly from primary emissions from biomass burning rather than secondary formation from photochemical processes. Backward trajectories indicated that long-range transport air masses influencing air quality in Northern Thailand originated to the west and southwest.","Effect of temperature, pH and total organic carbon variations on microbial turnover of 13C315N-glyphosate in agricultural soil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580222,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Glyphosate is the best-selling and the most-used broad-spectrum herbicide worldwide. Microbial conversion of glyphosate to CO2 and biogenic non-extractable residues (bioNER) leads to its complete degradation. The degradation of glyphosate may vary in different soils and it depends on environmental conditions and soil properties. To date, the influence of temperature, soil pH and total organic carbon (TOC) on microbial conversion of glyphosate to bioNER has not been investigated yet. The pH or TOC of an agricultural original soil (pH 6.6, TOC 2.1%) was modified using sulfuric acid or farmyard manure (FYM), respectively. Each treatment: original (I), 3% TOC (II), 4% TOC (III), pH 6.0 (IV) and pH 5.5 (V) was amended with 13C315N-glyphosate and incubated at 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C for 39 days. The temperature was the main factor controlling the mineralization and the extractable 13C315N-glyphosate, whereas higher TOC content and lower pH resulted in enhanced formation of 13C-bioNER. After 39 days the cumulative mineralization of 13C-glyphosate was in the range of 12-22% (10 °C), 37-47% (20 °C) and 43-54% (30 °C). Extractable residues of 13C-glyphosate were in the range of 10-21% (10 °C) and 4-10% (20 °C and 30 °C); whereas those of 15N-glyphosate were as follows 20-32% (10 °C) and 12-25% (20 °C and 30 °C). The 13C-NER comprised about 53-69% of 13C-mass balance in soils incubated at 10 °C, but 40-50% in soils incubated at 20 °C and 30 °C. The 15N-NER were higher than the 13C-NER and varied between 62% and 74% at 10 °C, between 53% and 81% at 20 °C and 30 °C. A major formation of 13C-bioNER (72-88% of 13C-NER) at 20 °C and 30 °C was noted in soil amended with FYM. An increased formation of 15N-bioNER (14-17% of 15N-NER) was also observed in FYM-amended soil. The xenobiotic 15N-NER had a major share within the 15N-NER and thus need to be considered when assessing the environmental risk of glyphosate-NER.",Monitoring land sensitivity to desertification in Central Asia: Convergence or divergence?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580221,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"In Central Asia, desertification risk is one of the main environmental and socioeconomic issues; thus, monitoring land sensitivity to desertification is an extremely urgent issue. In this study, the combination of convergence patterns and desertification risk is advanced from a technical perspective. Furthermore, the environmentally sensitive area index (ESAI) method was first utilized to monitor the risk of desertification in Central Asia. In the study, the spatial and temporal patterns of desertification risk were illustrated from 1992 to 2015 using fourteen indicators, including vegetation, climate, soil and land management quality. The ESAI spatial convergence across administrative subdivisions was explored for three time intervals: 1992-2000, 2000-2008 and 2008-2015. The results indicated that nearly 13.66% of the study area fell into the critical risk of desertification from 1992 to 2008. However, the risk of desertification has improved since 2008, with critical classifications decreasing by 19.70% in 2015. According to the mutation year detection in the ESAI, 25.89% of the pixels with mutation years from 1992 to 2000 were identified, and this value was higher than that during the other time periods. The convergence analysis revealed that the desertification risk for 1992-2000 tended to diverge with a positive convergence coefficient of 0.13 and converge over the 2000-2008 and 2008-2015 time periods with negative convergence coefficients of -0.534 and -0.268, respectively. According to the spatial convergence analysis, we found that the divergence patterns in northern Central Asia from 1992 to 2000 resulted from the effects of the Soviet Union collapse: cropland abandonment in northern Kazakhstan and rangeland abandonment in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and eastern Kazakhstan. In contrast, most areas from 2000 to 2008 experienced increased sensitivity to desertification with the convergence pattern caused by decreased precipitation, especially in northern Central Asia. However, convergence patterns were found in most regions for 2008-2015 with regard to augmented precipitation, which resulted in decreased sensitivity to desertification. Moreover, the low sensitivity areas were more likely to converge under increased precipitation. In this region, the findings of our study suggested that spatial convergence and divergence acted as related predictors of climate change and human activities, respectively. Thus, the ESAI convergence analysis was considered to provide an early warning of potential desertification.",Evolution of multiple global virtual material flows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580220,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"The world is connected through multiple flows of material, but a comprehensive assessment of their temporal dynamics and interactions is rare. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the evolution and interactions of global flows of virtual water, energy, land, CO2, nitrogen as well as financial capital embodied in international trade from 1995 to 2008. We found that the volumes of all these flows, except for land flow, increased over time. Financial capital flows increased most (188.9%), followed by flows of CO2 (59.3%), energy (58.1%), water (50.7%) and nitrogen (10.5%), while land transfer decreased by 8.8%. Volumes of virtual material flows among distant countries were much higher than those among adjacent countries. The top five countries accounted for a surprisingly large proportion (47% to 80%) of total flow volumes. Different kinds of virtual material flows tended to enhance each other through synergistic effects, and CO2 and nitrogen flows tended to have stronger positive synergetic impacts on the other virtual material flows. Our results suggest that it is important to pay particular attention to such fast-growing material flows, promote cooperation between distant countries, and target countries with the largest flows to achieve global sustainable development goals.",Preconcentration techniques for trace explosive sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580219,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Trace sensing of explosive vapours is a method in humanitarian demining and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection that has received increasing attention recently, since accurate, fast, and reliable chemical detection is highly important for threat identification. However, trace molecule sampling in the field can be extremely difficult due to factors including weather, locale, and very low vapour pressure of the explosive. Preconcentration of target molecules onto a substrate can provide a method to collect higher amounts of analyte for analysis. We used the commercial fluoropolymer Aflas as a preconcentrator material to sorb explosive molecules to the surface, allowing subsequent detection of the explosives via the luminescence quenching response from the organic polymer Super Yellow. The preconcentration effect of Aflas was confirmed and characterised with 2,4-DNT, prior to field sampling being conducted at a test minefield in Croatia by placing preconcentration strips in the entrance of beehives, where honeybees have collected explosive materials during free-flying. In this work we show for the first time a method for confirmation of landmines combining honeybee colonies containing a preconcentration material and subsequent monitoring of luminescence quenching.",EStimating Contaminants tRansfers Over Complex food webs (ESCROC): An innovative Bayesian method for estimating POP's biomagnification in aquatic food webs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580218,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Pollution greatly impacts ecosystems health and associated ecological functions. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are among the most studied contaminants due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity potential. Biomagnification is often described using the estimation of a Trophic Magnification Factor (TMF). This estimate is based on the relationship between contamination levels of the species and their trophic level. However, while the estimation can be significantly biased in relation to multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. species physiology, measurement errors, food web complexity), usual TMF estimation methods typically do not allow accounting for these potential biases. More accurate and reliable assessment tool of TMFs and their associated uncertainty are therefore needed in order to appropriately guide chemical pollution management. The present work proposes a relevant and innovative TMF estimation method accounting for its many variability sources. The ESCROC model (EStimating Contaminants tRansfers Over Complex food webs), which is implemented in a Bayesian framework, allows for a more reliable and rigorous assessment of contaminants trophic magnification, in addition to accurate estimations of isotopes trophic enrichment factors and their associated uncertainties in food webs. Similar to classical mixing models used in food web investigations, ECSROC computes diet composition matrices using isotopic composition data while accounting for contamination data, leading to more robust food web descriptions. As a demonstration of the practical application of the model, ESCROC was implemented to revisit the trophic biomagnification of 5 polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in a complex estuarine food web (the Gironde, SW France). In addition to the TMF estimate and 95% confidence intervals, the model provided biomagnification probabilities associated to the investigated contaminants-for instance, 92% in the case of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)-that can be interpreted in terms of risk assessment in a precautionary approach, which should prove useful to environmental managers.","Changes in morphology, chlorophyll fluorescence performance and Rubisco activity of soybean in response to foliar application of ionic titanium under normal light and shade environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580217,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Titanium (Ti) is considered an essential element for plant growth; however, its role in crop performance through stimulating the activities of certain enzymes, enhancing chlorophyll content and photosynthesis, and improving crop morphology and growth requires more study. We therefore conducted a laboratory experiments to study the effects of ionic Ti application on morphology, growth, biomass distribution, chlorophyll fluorescence performance and Rubisco activity of soybean (Glycine max L.) under normal light (NL) and shade conditions (SC). In this study, we sprayed soybean plants with five different levels of ionic Ti (T1 = 0, T2 = 1.25, T3 = 2.5, T4 = 5 and T5 = 10 mg Ti Plant-1) through foliar application method. Our results show that with increasing moderate (2.5 mg Ti Plant-1) Ti concentration, the chlorophyll pigments (chlorophyll [Chl] a, b, carotenoid [Car]), plant biomass, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and electron transport rate (ETR) of soybean increased, but higher levels (5-10 mg Ti Plant-1), resulted in leaf anatomical and chloroplast structural disruptions under both NL and SC. Soybean plants showed maximum biomass, leaf area, leaf thickness, Chl a, b, Car, Rubisco activity, Fv/Fm and ETR for T3 at 2.5 mg Ti Plant-1; however, declined significantly for T5 at high concentration of 10 mg Plant-1. In NL, the application of 2.5 mg Ti Plant-1 (T3) increased the Chl a, b, and total Chl contents 40, 20, and 27% as compared to control treatment (T1). In SC, the application of 1.25 mg Ti mg Plant-1 (T2) increased the Chl a, b, and total Chl contents 38, 19, and 14% as compared to control treatment. In NL, the Fv/Fm, qP, PSII, and ETR were higher in the T3 treatment over the T1 (control) by 7, 0.3, 16, and 16%, respectively. In SC, the Fv/Fm, qP, PSII, and ETR were higher in the T3 treatment over the T1 (control) by 5, 5, 19, and 19%, respectively. Moreover, Rubisco activity was at peak (55 and 6% increase under NL and SC) at 2.5 mg Ti Plant-1and decreased with increasing Ti concentration, reaching the lowest at 10 mg Ti Plant-1, which indicates that leaf cells were damaged as observed in the leaf anatomy. We concluded that ionic Ti expresses a hormesis effect: at lower concentrations, promoting soybean growth, however, at higher concentrations, suppressing soybean growth both under NL and SC. We therefore suggest that under different light stress conditions, Ti application could serve to mitigate abiotic stresses, especially in intercropping systems.","Identifying heavy metal pollution hot spots in soil-rice systems: A case study in South of Yangtze River Delta, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580216,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"The soil-rice system in China is subjected to increasing concentrations of heavy metals (HMs) which derived from various sources.

Compared with Chinese maximum permissible limits, mean content of all HMs in farmland soil are at safe levels and averaged content of all HMs in rice were also at safe levels except As and Ni. Ni was most polluted HM in soil Most of and showed relatively high content in farmland soil in southeastern part. As and Ni are the most polluted in rice, with highest content distributed in the northwestern and southern area, respectively. The majority of HMs pollution hot spots in soil clustered in the central area. Pollution hot spots of Ni and As in rice are mainly concentrated in the central part and southeastern part, correspondingly. Our results found a weak link between content and spatial pattern of pollution status of HMs in soil and rice. The results are anticipated to contribute to more efficient and accurate control of HMs pollution in soil-rice system, and assist decision-makers achieve a balance between cost and regulation of HM pollution."

A promising way to make TEBVs is to exploit foreign body response (FBR) of polymeric rods used as templates. However, since the FBR predominantly involves bone-marrow (BM) derived cells and ESRD coincides with impaired function of BM, it is important to assess the generation of TEBVs in conditions of renal failure. To this end, we implanted polymer rods in the subcutis of rats after BM-transplantation with GFP-labeled BM cells in a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). At 3 weeks after implantation, rods were encapsulated by tissue capsule (TC) composed of collagen, myofibroblasts and macrophages. On average, 13% of CD68+ macrophages were GFP+, indicating BM origin. Macrophage-to-myofibroblasts differentiation appeared to play an important role in TC formation as 26% of SMA+/GFP+ myofibroblasts co-expressed the macrophage marker CD68. Three weeks after rod implantation, the cellular response changed towards tissue repair, characterized by 40% increase in CD68+/CD163+ repair associated macrophages and 95% increase in TGFβ and IL10 gene expression as compared to TCs harvested at 1 week. These results show that both BM derived and tissue resident cells, contribute to TC formation, whereas macrophages serve as precursors of myofibroblasts in mature TCs. Finally, the presence of CKD did not significantly alter the process of TC formation, which holds the potential to support our approach for future clinical use in ESRD patients.",Mandibular advancement device therapy for obstructive sleep apnea: a prospective study on predictors of treatment success.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580193,Sleep medicine,2019 02 19,"To survey potential predictors of success of mandibular advancement device (MAD) therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and in particular, to examine anatomical narrowings and sleep-related collapse levels in the upper airway."

Numerous studies have been conducted to determine why students drop out of nursing programmes. The limitations of previous studies have included overly small sample sizes, being largely descriptive, and not focusing on attrition as an outcome. The aim of this study is to review the issue of attrition among undergraduate nursing students in relation to curriculum design. Five electronic databases, namely CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Library, British Nursing Index, and PsycINFO, were adopted. Using the Population-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome model, search terms were identified, such as 'student nurse', 'undergraduate programme', 'curriculum design', and 'attrition'. Mixed Method Appraisal Tools were used to evaluate the methodological quality of the identified research papers. A total of 16 publications were reviewed and four themes were identified: pre-enrolment criteria for recruiting nursing students; curriculum content; clinical placement-related policies; and student support services. Institutional-level risk factors that could be reduced were identified, including academic failure, poor clinical performance, stress, and unrealistic expectations of nursing.

Protein-binding displacement often underlies drug-drug interactions. Perampanel is a once-daily oral anti-seizure drug for focal seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Perampanel is also indicated for monotherapy use for focal seizures in the United States. Perampanel is extensively but slowly metabolized via CYP3A4. Its elimination t½ is about 100 h, and it displays substantial plasma protein binding (>95%). Here, we examine perampanel's potential to displace highly bound anti-seizure drugs and the ability of warfarin, a standard highly protein-bound drug, to displace perampanel. Protein binding of perampanel, phenytoin, valproate, and warfarin was assessed using equilibrium dialysis. Plasma samples containing each compound were dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline. For phenytoin, valproate, and warfarin, plasma samples were also dialyzed in the presence of perampanel. After 24 h equilibrium dialysis, amounts of test compounds were analyzed to calculate plasma protein binding. At clinically relevant concentrations, perampanel did not displace other highly bound drugs or vice versa. Protein-binding displacement may confound therapeutic drug monitoring of extensively protein-bound medications. Without empirical data, clinicians might be concerned that addition of perampanel could alter unbound concentrations of other medications, resulting in adverse effects. Our data indicate perampanel has low potential for drug interactions resulting from protein-binding displacement.",Exceptional adsorption of arsenic by zirconium metal-organic frameworks: Engineering exploration and mechanism insight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580178,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"Highly stable zirconium metal-organic frameworks (UiO-66 and UiO-66(NH2)) had been synthesized and investigated to remove arsenic (As) from contaminated water. The As(III, V) removal performance was studied by batch experiments and adsorption kinetics. At the pH of 9.2 ± 0.1, UiO-66 had exceptional removal capacities of 205.0 and 68.21 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively. The As removal processes were exothermic and verified as chemisorption reactions according to the calculation of Gibbs free energy and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model. Fixed-bed reactor removal experiments indicated that the number of effective treatment volumes reached 2270 and 1775 BVs for As(III) and As(V), respectively, until the most stringent As regulation level of 10 μg/L (initial As concentration at 100 μg/L) was reached. FTIR and XPS study indicated that ZrO bonds of zirconium metal-organic frameworks played a vital role in As adsorption. XANES revealed the As adsorption on UiO-66 without the change of oxidation state. More intriguingly, EXAFS spectra demonstrated the main formation of bidentate mononuclear complexes for As(V), and bidentate binuclear complexes for As(III) on the hexanuclear Zr cluster of UiO-66. The advantages of nontoxicity, high stability, high As adsorption capacity, low-cost and easy availability confirm the highly promising application of zirconium metal-organic frameworks in As-contaminated wastewater remediation.",The nature of salt effect in enhancing the extraction of rare earths by non-functional ionic liquids: Synergism of salt anion complexation and Hofmeister bias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580177,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"Separation and recycling of rare-earths using ionic liquids as extractant are becoming a promising approach to replace traditional volatile organic solvents in recent years. Generally, the addition of some special salts could improve the extraction efficiency of rare-earths by numerous non-functional ionic liquids. However, knowledge behind the nature of the salt effect is limited. Here, we found that the enhancement in the extraction of rare-earth ions, Pr3+ ions, using non-functional ionic liquid, [A336][NO3] (Tricaprylmethylammonium nitrate) was driven by the synergism of Hofmeister bias and complexation behaviors of salt anions with Pr3+ ions. Molecular dynamic simulations offered a new insight into the interaction mechanism of the ionic liquid with Pr3+ ions at liquid/liquid interface. It was revealed that salt anions could perform as a bridge to connect Pr3+ ions and the ionic liquid, so that promoted the extraction of Pr3+ ions. Therefore, the strong complexation ability of salt anions with Pr3+ ions and poor hydration of salt anions faciliated the transport of Pr3+ ions across liquid/liquid interface.",Magnetic networks of carbon quantum dots and Ag particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580176,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 03,"Self-assembly exploits a facile non-covalent way to couple structurally different building blocks for creating soft materials with synergetic novel properties and functions. Taking advantage of magneto-properties from magnetic surfactants as well as versatile functional ligand formed by carbon quantum dots with cysteine (cys-CQDs), the magnetic network materials were firstly constructed by using magnetic surfactants and cys-CQDs as self-assembly building blocks. Counterions of Br-, [GdCl3Br]-, [HoCl3Br]- in surfactants could control the morphology of magnetic network structures, and the concentration of magnetic surfactants manoeuvres a versatile scenario of self-assembly behavior. Self-assembly of cys-CQDs and CTAHo brought out a 10-fold increase in magnetic moment of CTAHo. The fluorescent property of carbon quantum dots firstly served as an effective indicator element to dissect the collective effect in self-assembly process. For the sake of capturing the target sequence-specific DNA molecules, in situ growth of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) upon the magnetic network structures was realized by synergetically electrostatic and coordinated interaction of carboxyl groups and Ag ions. The magnetic Ag self-assemblies anchored thiol-containing DNA, serving as a magnetic separation booster for the target sequence-specific DNA molecules under an applied magnetic field, which will bring light on designing magneto-functional self-assembly materials according to practical application requirements.",Preparation of TiO2 microspheres with tunable pore and chamber size for fast gaseous diffusion in photoreduction of CO2 under simulated sunlight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580175,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 01 29,"TiO2 microsphere with tunable pore and chamber size are prepared by a simple solventhermal method and used as catalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Therefore, the hollow microsphere possesses more accessible sites for CO2 adsorption, which finally gives rise to the enhanced CO production rate of 10.9 ± 0.7 μmol g-1 h-1 under simulated sunlight, which is respectively 1.6 and 1.4 times higher than that of solid and yolk/shell microspheres. Electron dynamic study further demonstrates that hollow microsphere shows the highest photocurrent density and the lowest charge recombination among three microspheres structure, which is attributed to the swift CO2 diffusion providing fresh CO2 molecules to rapidly scavenge the photo-generated electrons and finally leading to the excellence catalytic reduction performances. This method could be adopted as a general strategy to prepare high performance TiO2 catalysts with desirable structural qualities for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction under nature sunlight.",Efficient and fast removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+ from an aqueous solution using a chitosan/Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide nanocomposite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580174,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 03,"A new nanocomposite based on chitosan (CS) and Mg-Al-layered double hydroxide (Mg-Al-LDH) was prepared using an emulsion-crosslinking method. CS was immobilized within the Mg-Al-LDH matrix to form the CS-LDH after crosslinking by epichlorohydrin. The characterization of XPS, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and BET analysis showed that the CS-LDH had a high specific surface area and contained many different functional groups. The adsorption capacity of the CS-LDH was evaluated by adsorbing Pb2+ and Cd2+ as representative heavy metals. Batch adsorption method was used to investigate the effects of the amount of adsorbent, pH of the initial solution, and contact time. We also examined the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and mechanisms. The capacity of the CS-LDH for Pb2+ and Cd2+ adsorption was higher than that of CS and the Mg-Al-LDH, and the isothermal data followed the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption equilibrium was quickly achieved and the kinetic data obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption process was almost not affected by solution pH above 3. The CS-LDH and heavy metals interacted via the following mechanisms: precipitation, surface complexation, and isomorphic substitution.",A simple and rapid fluorescent approach for flavonoids sensor based on gold nanoclusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580173,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 03,"The development of simple, easy-to-operate and real-time detection methods for the active ingredients in herbal medicines has aroused growing interest owing to their pivotal health benefits.

A fluorescent gold nanocluster was imbedded into the cavity enclosed in the tertiary structure of BSA, the fluorescence of which can be quenched by the flavonoids with fast response (<5 s). This decrease in fluorescence intensity of BSA-AuNCs as output signal enables the real-time visual inspection of flavonoids. We demonstrated that the present approach was capable of detecting quercetin in serum, plasma, and monitoring the content of flavonoids in proprietary Chinese medicine Rutin Tablets. BSA-AuNCs was the first fluorescent probe for the specific determination of active ingredients in herbal medicines.

The porous nanoplate structure provides increased specific surface area and shortened diffusion pathway for ion/electron transport. Consequently, NVP/C-P cathodes exhibit a high specific capacity (117 mAh g-1, 0.2 C), exceptional rate performance (76.5 mAh g-1, 100 C) and long cyclic stability (10,000 cycles)."

Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to ATR affects hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents, but the exact molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATR on the hippocampus of postnatal day 35 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats administered doses of either 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day of ATR for a period of 30 days. A Morris water maze (MWM) test revealed that ATR treatment impaired memory performance in the spatial probe test, especially amongst the high-dose group. Moreover, analysis by electron microscopy showed that hippocampal neuron ultrastructure in the dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) sub-regions was impaired in the ATR-treated groups. Finally, a downregulation in the mRNA and protein expression levels of members of the MEK/ERK/CREB pathway and downstream factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Zif268 was observed in hippocampal tissue following ATR treatment.

However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. One hypothesis is that less analytic reasoning might maintain persecutory delusions by reducing belief flexibility. An important aspect of belief flexibility is the ability to revise beliefs in response to disconfirmatory evidence. The present study recruited 231 participants from the general population that represented a wide range of paranoid ideation. Participants completed tasks in which they encountered a series of ambiguous scenarios with initially-appealing explanations that were later disconfirmed by statements supporting alternative interpretations. Three types of scenarios were employed: two presented participants with emotionally valenced explanations (i.e., negative or positive) and one presented participants with emotionally neutral explanations. In each type of reasoning scenario, impaired belief revision ability was found to partially mediate the relationship between reduced engagement in analytic reasoning and persecutory ideation. These results are consistent with the notion that reduced engagement in analytic reasoning may help maintain paranoid delusions by interfering with the ability to revise beliefs in the presence of disconfirmatory information.",Bone surrogates provide authentic onlay graft fixation torques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580158,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 02,"Onlay graft bone augmentation is a standard practice to restore the loss of height of the alveolar ridge following loss of a tooth. Cranial grafts, lifted from the parietal bone, are sandwiched and used to bridge the bony defect in the jaw by means of small screws. During the elevation of the covering gum and subsequent screw placement, care has to be taken in order to preserve underlying nerves. Therefore, to avoid harm to the patient, a solid education of surgeons is essential, which requires training and experience. A simulator for cranial graft-lift training was already developed and shall be expanded to train the augmentation of the lifted implants. Therefore, in this study, synthetic bones for onlay block graft screw placement with realistic haptics for the screw application training were evaluated and compared with human specimens. Six different polyurethane based bone surrogate composites, enriched with varying amounts of calcium-based mineral fillers and blowing agents, were developed. The haptical properties of these synthetic bones were validated for screw placement and compared with human parietal bone specimens. For that, bones were pre-drilled, screws were automatically inserted using a customized testbench and the slope of the screw-insertion torques were analyzed. The slope of the screw insertion torques of the human reference bones was 56.5 ± 14.0 * 10-3 Nm/deg, Surrogates with lower amounts of mineral fillers and blowing agents showed lower torques than the human bone. Synthetic bones, validated for drilling, milling and sawing in an earlier study, also achieved significantly lower torques, which were only the half of the human parietal bones. Two intermediate stages of the aforementioned material compositions, consisting of 75% mineral filler with 0.75% blowing agent and 100% mineral filler with 1.00% blowing agent revealed results comparable with human bone (57.4 ± 10.2 *10-3 Nm/deg, p = 0.893 and 54.9 ± 11.1 *10-3 Nm/deg, p = 0.795, respectively).

A key enzymatic source of these reactive species is the purine catabolizing enzyme, xanthine oxidase (XO) as the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequent oxidation of xanthine to uric acid generates superoxide (O2•-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). While XO has been studied for over 120 years, much remains unknown regarding specific mechanistic roles for this enzyme in pathologic processes. This gap in knowledge stems from several interrelated issues including: 1) lethality of global XO deletion and the absence of tissue-specific XO knockout models have coalesced to relegate proof-of-principle experimentation to pharmacology; 2) XO is mobile and thus when upregulated locally can be secreted into the circulation and impact distal vascular beds by high-affinity association to the glycocalyx on the endothelium; and 3) endothelial-bound XO is significantly resistant (> 50%) to inhibition by allopurinol, the principle compound used for XO inhibition in the clinic as well as the laboratory. While it is known that circulating XO is elevated in hemolytic diseases including sickle cell, malaria and sepsis, little is understood regarding its role in these pathologies. As such, the aim of this review is to define our current understanding regarding the effect of hemolysis (free heme) on circulating XO levels as well as the subsequent impact of XO-derived oxidants in hemolytic disease processes.",Role of meprin metalloproteinases in cytokine processing and inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580156,Cytokine,2019 03 29,"Meprin metalloendopeptidases, comprising α and β isoforms, are widely expressed in mammalian cells and organs including kidney, intestines, lungs, skin, and bladder, and in a variety of immune cells and cancer cells. Meprins proteolytically process many inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and other bioactive proteins and peptides that control the function of immune cells. The knowledge of meprin-mediated processing of inflammatory mediators and other target substrates provides a pathophysiologic link for the involvement of meprins in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. Meprins are now known to play important roles in inflammatory diseases including acute kidney injury, sepsis, urinary tract infections, bladder inflammation, and inflammatory bowel disease. The proteolysis of epithelial and endothelial barriers including cell junctional proteins by meprins promotes leukocyte influx into areas of tissue damage to result in inflammation. Meprins degrade extracellular matrix proteins; this ability of meprins is implicated in the cell migration of leukocytes and the invasion of tumor cells that express meprins. Proteolytic processing and maturation of procollagens provides evidence that meprins are involved in collagen maturation and deposition in the fibrotic processes involved in the formation of keloids and hypertrophic scars and lung fibrosis. This review highlights recent progress in understanding the role of meprins in inflammatory disorders in both human and mouse models.",Polymorphisms of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis among Han Taiwanese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580155,Cytokine,2019 03 12,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), particularly SOCS-3, allow discrimination of patients with active tuberculosis (TB) from healthy subjects in a gender- and age-dependent manner. However, no information is available on whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SOCS-3 gene occur in patients with TB. This study was designed to investigate SOCS-3 SNPs in association with susceptibility to TB in the Taiwanese population.",Tumor-Penetrating Peptide Enhances Antitumor Effects of IL-24 Against Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580153,Translational oncology,2019 02 13,"The interleukin-24 (IL-24), a member of the IL-10-related cytokine gene family, is well known for its tumor suppressor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumors without damaging normal cells. However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. iRGD is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating and antitumor effects of IL-24, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of the IL-24 fused to iRGD, which was named IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD induced cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth of PC-3 in vitro, and promoted protein penetration into tumors in vivo, whereas it had no effect on normal cell line RWPE-1. Then, PC-3 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were administered with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD, or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24- and IL-24-iRGD-treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 38.6% and 65.6%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Besides, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone. It may provide an improved strategy for antitumor therapy and the clinical treatment of prostate cancer.",The contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the radiosensitizing effect of gold nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580151,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Plasmid DNA in aerated aqueous solution is used as a probe to determine whose of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated after absorption of ultra-soft X-rays (USX) take part in biomolecule damage in the presence and in absence of Gold Nano-Particles (GNP) and specific scavengers. Citrate-coated GNPs with core sizes of 6, 10 and 25 nm are synthetized and characterized, especially in terms of plasmon band shift, ζ-potential and hydrodynamic radii (respectively 9, 21 and 30 nm). We confirm the radiosensitizing effect of GNP and show that the SSB number per plasmid increases when, for a same mass of gold element, the core size of the gold nanoparticles decreases. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are scavenged using the positively-charged 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol (TRIS) and the neutral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecules. Due to both negatively-charged environments of DNA and GNP, at identical scavenging capacity, TRIS is more effective at quenching OH than DMSO. The strong radiosensitizing effect of hydroxyl radicals is confirmed. Methanoate anions are then used to transform OH into hydrogen peroxide; the latter being known to be non-aggressive regarding DNA in the absence of easily oxidable metallic ions (Fenton reactions). Surprisingly, in the presence of GNP, high DNA damage yields are observed even though hydrogen peroxide might not be hold as responsible. Conversely, the radiosensitizing effect of GNP is not observed anymore when H2O2 is scavenged using pyruvate ions. We demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide constitutes quite unexpectedly a hidden stock of OH which are activated at the surface of the GNP by decomposition of H2O2 molecules.",Synthetic anionic surfaces can replace microparticles in stimulating burst coagulation of blood plasma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580150,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Biomaterials are frequently evaluated for pro-coagulant activity but usually in the presence of microparticles (MPs), cell-derived vesicles in blood plasma whose phospholipid surfaces allow coagulation factors to set up as functional assemblies. We tested the hypothesis that synthetic anionic surfaces can catalyze burst thrombin activation in human blood plasma in the absence of MPs. In a thromboelastography (TEG) assay with plastic sample cups and pins, recalcified human citrated platelet-poor plasma spontaneously burst-coagulated but with an unpredictable clotting time whereas plasma depleted of MPs by ultracentrifugation failed to coagulate. Coagulation of MP-depleted plasma was restored in a dose-dependent manner by glass microbeads, hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HA NPs), and carboxylic acid-containing anionic nanocoatings of TEG cups and pins (coated by glow-discharge plasma-polymerized ethylene containing oxygen, L-PPE:O with 4.4 and 6.8 atomic % [COOH]). Glass beads lost their pro-coagulant activity in MP-depleted plasma after their surfaces were nanocoated with hydrophobic plasma-polymerized hexamethyl disiloxane (PP-HMDSO). In FXII-depleted MP-depleted plasma, glass microbeads failed to induce coagulation, however, FXIa was sufficient to induce coagulation in a dose-dependent manner, with no effect of glass beads. These data suggest that anionic surfaces of crystalline, organic, and amorphous solid synthetic materials catalyze explosive thrombin generation in MP-depleted plasma by activating the FXII-dependent intrinsic contact pathway. The data also show that microparticles are pro-coagulant surfaces whose activity has been largely overlooked in many coagulation studies to-date. These results suggest a possible mechanism by which anionic biomaterial surfaces induce bone healing by contact osteogenesis, through fibrin clot formation in the absence of platelet activation."

On the contrary, MMSNs reacted with phenol and p-cresol only when the pH values were higher than 10. Phenol showed a lower reaction rate than p-cresol toward MMSNs. GCMS analysis suggested that MMSNs might react with the phenolic compounds through step-wise electrophilic chlorination reactions, and the main product was 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

Effect of insecticides on fish has attracted intensive attention. However, no systematic study on heteromeric zebrafish GABAAR expressed in oocytes has been reported to date. In this study, the α1 subunit, the β2S subunit lacking 47 amino acid residues compared with the β2L subunit, and the γ2 subunit having five transmembrane domains were isolated from zebrafish Danio rerio. The responses of homomeric and heteromeric (α1, β2S and γ2) channels to agonists and GABAAR-targeted compounds were detected with two-electrode voltage clamp. Dose-dependent responses were observed in heteromeric α1β2S, β2Sγ2, and α1β2Sγ2 GABAR channels with EC50 values at 21.75, 6291, and 33.69 μM for GABA-induced current and 3.28, 155.5, and 3.79 mM for β-alanine-induced current, respectively.

Dyskinetic motor behavior is also present in individuals who are at high risk of schizophrenia and appears to have prognostic value for the development of psychosis. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether dyskinesia is present in first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and thus associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia (i.e., an endophenotype), or whether the motor abnormality is a biomarker specific to the disease state spectrum. There is also limited information about links between dyskinesia and clinically relevant phenomena such as symptoms and cognition. Because dyskinesia marking genetic liability is likely to be subtle, we used sensitive instrument-based measurement of handwriting fluency to quantify dyskinesia in medicated individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, unaffected first-degree biological relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and control participants. Results indicated that medicated individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder exhibited more dyskinesia than both relatives and controls, with no difference between relatives and controls. Dyskinesia in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was unrelated to current antipsychotic medication dosage, but associated with worse working memory function and greater positive formal thought disorder. These results provide evidence that dyskinesia is not associated with unexpressed genetic liability for schizophrenia.","Delusion, excitement, violence, and suicide history are risk factors for aggressive behavior in general inpatients with serious mental illnesses: A multicenter study in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580136,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"Little is known about the risk factors for aggression in general clinical settings in China. The aim of this study is to explore potential risk factors for inpatients with serious mental illness.

A standardized data collection form was used to collect demographic and clinical characteristics data, including information on current hallucinations, delusions, depression, excitement, aboulia, apathy, and adherence to treatment. Information on lifetime history of violence and suicidality was also collected. The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) was also administered to indicate recent (past week) aggression. A total of 511 inpatients were enrolled. On the basis of a score of five or greater on the MOAS, 245 inpatients were assigned to aggressive group and 266 were assigned to non-aggressive group.

Recent models of cognitive control distinguish between two mechanisms: reactive control, the ability to stop in response to a stop-stimulus, and proactive control, the ability to anticipate and prepare for a stop. Previous studies have primarily focused on reactive modes of control in gambling disorder. The aim of the current study was to assess both reactive and proactive modes of response inhibition in individuals with gambling disorder (n = 27) and community controls (n = 21) using a variant of the stop-signal task. Second, the relationship between trait impulsivity, and reactive and proactive control was examined. No group differences in reactive or proactive control were found. However, premeditation, one domain of trait impulsivity, was associated with worse proactive control in the gambling group. These results suggest that difficulties with response inhibition may not be a core deficit in all forms of gambling disorder. Future research should continue to develop and test tasks that involve cognitive control processes in different presentations of gambling disorder.",Systematic review and critical appraisal of child abuse measurement instruments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580133,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"Child abuse is a major public health concern and a strong predictor of adult psychopathology.

Hydrological alteration by river damming represents one of the most prominent human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. This paper presents a methodological approach to assessing the natural patterns of flow variability and hydrological alterations in Mediterranean rivers. The methodology first defines the admissible range of flow variability under a natural flow regime. Then, the methodology measures the environmental impact of flow regulation according to the inferred hydrological alteration and classifies rivers into homogeneous groups according to the magnitude, frequency, duration and seasonality of the impacts. This paper applies the proposed methodology to thirty-three river segments below large reservoirs located in the three largest Spanish watersheds (Duero, Ebro and Tajo). For each segment, this study evaluates the general impoundment characteristics and geographical contexts and calculates the flow impacts and the divergence between the circulating flows and the reference area of admissible flow variability on a daily basis for the period 2000-2010. This assessment of dam regulation impacts provides a reference to plan measures for mitigating these impacts. The advantages of this flow regulation impact analysis over other analyses are discussed in terms of the implementation of environmental water costs as suggested by the European Water Framework Directive. This approach expands the current understanding of water environmental costs and represents a practical management tool for decreasing the environmental impacts of flow regulation and for increasing water-use efficiency.","Geographical variation of arsenic distribution in paddy soil, rice and rice-based products: A meta-analytic approach and implications to human health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580115,Journal of environmental management,2019 01 26,"Arsenic is considered as ubiquitous toxic element belonging to the highest health hazard category. Wide ranges of natural as well as anthropogenic activities are subject to create global arsenic distribution in the broad sense. Rice is the major staple food consumed by world's population on the maximum scale. Growing environment of rice typically attributed by geographical origin may influence on arsenic bioavailability in rice grain. Over exploitation of arsenic contaminated, groundwater resources have recognised as major concern in agricultural perspective for rice production. On the other hand, biogeochemical weathering of arsenic bearing rocks as the geogenic origin, mining activities and application arsenical pesticides are recognised to be well known factors responsible to increase the soil arsenic level. Transfer of arsenic into rice is rightly acquainted from these possible sources of contamination in different regions around the world. Consequently, such substantial geographical variation reflects bioavailability as well as speciation of arsenic in rice. In this manuscript, we discuss the contribution of different arsenic entering pathways in soil-rice systems from regional variability. Furthermore, we attempted to apply the meta-analysis in order to predict the comparative risk assessment on distribution pattern of total and inorganic arsenic in rice commercialised from various rice producing regions of Asia, Europe and US by considering a selected number of data set an extensive range of market basket and field survey. In addition, we finally focus on health risk assessment associated by the consumption of rice and rice-based infant products as the dietary intake from the different of origin. Furthermore, we must detect and categorize the possible source of contamination, which may critically enhance the bioavailability of arsenic in rice in order to minimize the risk.

Depending upon environmental conditions, radionuclides in soil can be mobilized in aquatic systems. Therefore, the fate and transfer of these radionuclides in the soil water system is very important for radiation protection and dose assessment. In the present study, soil and water samples were collected from contaminated areas around FDNPP. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used for total uranium concentration. Emphasis has been given on isotope ratio measurement of 235U/238U ratio using thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) that gives us the idea about its contamination during accident. For the migration behavior, its distribution coefficient (Kd) has been determined using laboratory batch method. Chemical characterization of soil with respect to different parameters has been carried out. The effect of these soil parameters on distribution coefficient of uranium has been studied in order to explain the radionuclide mobility in this particular area. The distribution coefficient values for uranium are found to vary from 30 to 36000 L/kg. A large variation in the distribution coefficient values shows the retention or mobility of uranium is highly dependent on soil characteristics in the particular area. This variation is explained with respect to soil pH, Fe, Mn, CaCO3 and organic content. There is a very good correlation of uranium Kd obtained with Fe content. There is no enrichment of 235U has been noticed in the studied area.","An open-label, multicentre safety study of vemurafenib in patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma: final analysis and a validated prognostic scoring system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580112,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 01 08,The oncogenic BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib improves outcomes for patients with advanced BRAFV600 mutation-positive melanoma compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

This is commonly achieved by individuals following communally known rules that prescribe how people should behave. From relatively early in development, children swiftly pick up the rules of their culture and even start creating game rules among peers. Thus far, however, little is known about children's abilities create rules to regulate their own interactions in social dilemma situations in which individuals' interests are partially in conflict. Here, we repeatedly selected dyads of children (5- and 8-year-olds, N = 144) at random from a group and presented them with a chicken game - a social dilemma in which individuals have conflicting motives but coordination is required to avoid mutual failure. In game breaks, groups reconvened and had the opportunity to think of additional game rules. Eight- but not five-year-olds readily came up with and agreed upon impartial rules to guide their subsequent game behavior (but only after adult prompting). Moreover, when playing by the self-made rules, children achieved higher payoffs, had fewer conflicts, and coordinated with greater efficiency than when playing without a rule - which mimics the functional consequences of rules on a societal level. These findings suggest that by at least age 8, children are capable of using rules to independently self-regulate potential conflicts of interest with peers.",Driving status of patients with generalized spike-wave on EEG but no clinical seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580109,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 03 29,"Generalized spike-wave discharges (SWDs) are the hallmark of generalized epilepsy on the electroencephalogram (EEG).

However, some generalized SWDs have no obvious behavioral effects. A serious challenge arises when patients with no clinical seizures request driving privileges and licensure, yet their EEG shows generalized SWD. Specialized behavioral testing has demonstrated prolonged reaction times or missed responses during SWD, which may present a driving hazard even when patients or family members do not notice any deficits. On the other hand, some SWDs are truly asymptomatic in which case driving privileges should not be restricted. Clinicians often decide on driving privileges based on SWD duration or other EEG features. However, there are currently no empirically-validated guidelines for distinguishing generalized SWDs that are ""safe"" versus ""unsafe"" for driving. Here, we review the clinical presentation of generalized SWD and recent work investigating mechanisms of behavioral impairment during SWD with implications for driving safety. As a future approach, computational analysis of large sets of EEG data during simulated driving utilizing machine learning could lead to powerful methods to classify generalized SWD as safe vs. unsafe.

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 04 01,"The cattle tick R. microplus is the biggest obstacle to livestock rearing in tropical countries. It is responsible for billions of dollars in losses every year, affecting meat and milk production, beef and dairy cattle, and the leather industry. The lack of knowledge and strategies to combat the tick only increases the losses, it leads to successive and uncontrolled applications of acaricides, favouring the selection of strains resistant to commercially available chemical treatments. In this paper, we tested 3‑bromopyruvate (3‑BrPA), an alkylating agent with a high affinity for cysteine residues, on the R. microplus metabolism. We found that 3-BrPA was able to induce cell death in an assay using BME26 strain cell cultures derived from embryos, it was also able to reduce cellular respiration in developing embryos. 3-BrPA is a nonspecific inhibitor, affecting enzymes of different metabolic pathways in R. microplus. In our experiments, we demonstrated that 3-BrPA was able to affect the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase, reducing its activity by approximately 50%; and it strongly inhibited triose phosphate isomerase, which is an enzyme involved in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Also, the mitochondrial respiratory chain was affected, NADH cytochrome c reductase (complex I-III) and succinate cytochrome c reductase (complex II-III) were strongly inhibited by 3-BrPA. Glutamate dehydrogenase was also affected by 3-BrPA, showing a gradual inhibition of activity in all the 3-BrPA concentrations tested. Altogether, these results show that 3-BrPA is a harmful compound to the tick organism."

To test the hypothesis that a sustained delivery system of diltiazem hydrochloride may be helpful for the treatment of chronic anal fissures, in the present study we evaluated the potential of gels containing diltiazem hydrochloride entrapped in microsponges. Such microsponges were based on Eudragit RS 100 and the effect of some formulation variables was assessed by a 23 full factorial screening design. An optimized formulation of diltiazem hydrochloride microsponges was dispersed in Methylcellulose 2% or Poloxamer 407 20% and the resulting gels (micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride 2%) were subjected to in vitro drug release, ex vivo permeability and drug deposition after application on porcine rectal mucosa. The results showed a prolonged release up to 24 h from micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride at 2% in the gels. The permeation tests revealed up to 18% higher drug retention on the mucosal tissue after 24 h by the micro-l-diltiazem hydrochloride 2% gels compared to conventional diltiazem hydrochloride gels at 2%. These results suggest that diltiazem hydrochloride-loaded microsponges dispersed in rectal gels may be useful to overcome some limitations of conventional local chronic anal fissure therapy.",Generic gas chromatography flame ionization detection method using hydrogen as the carrier gas for the analysis of solvents in pharmaceuticals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580085,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 03,"Within the pharmaceutical industry, the determination of residual solvents by Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID) is a highly utilized analytical test that often employs helium (He) as the carrier gas. However, many do not realize that helium is a non-renewable resource that will eventually become progressively more difficult to source. In recent years, analytical chemists are increasingly adopting hydrogen (H2) in place of helium for routine GC analysis. In this study, a simple and efficient generic/universal GC-FID method using H2 as the carrier gas has been developed with the capability of baseline resolution of over 30 of the most commonly used solvents in development and manufacturing with a method run time of less than eight minutes. The use of this method for the separation and analysis of solvents within a pharmaceutical manufacturing process is demonstrated with additional method validation data presented using five different diluents as a means to increase flexibility for the chromatographer. Furthermore, it is the recommendation of the authors that the current compendia for residual solvent analysis be updated to allow for hydrogen as a carrier gas. The similarity between He and H2 observed within this study supports the use of hydrogen as a suitable replacement for helium, and an update of the EU and USP compendia for residual solvent analysis should be made to reflect this.",Dansyl azide as a selective fluorescence tagging probe for click chemistry reactions and its application to monitor rasagiline in pharmacokinetic studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580084,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 03,"Click chemistry has been widely used for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules for its high efficiency, regioselectivity and biocompatibility.

Rasagiline mesylate (RSM) is an irreversible, selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor. It is used as a model example for drugs with terminal alkyne moiety that could be monitored in biological samples with CuAAC reaction. RSM reacts with DNS-AZ in the presence of copper (II) and sodium ascorbate as catalysts to form stable 1,2,3-triazole derivative determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The developed methodology was optimized for sensitive and selective determination of RSM in rat plasma. Selegiline (SLG) was used as internal standard. The developed method was validated according to US-FDA guidelines in order to confirm method suitability for the intended application. The method allowed accurate and precise determination of RSM in the linearity range 0.50-100 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.16 ng mL-1 for RSM in rat plasma. To confirm method applicability in real sample analysis, the developed method was employed to quantify RSM in a pharmacokinetic study in rats after administration of a single oral dose of RSM tablet."

More recently, the feasibility of resection has gained traction, however, there is a lack of consolidated neurological deficit metrics. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the incidences of neurological deficits following insular glioma resection to better guide selection algorithms and resource allocations. Searches of seven electronic databases from inception to August 2018 were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted and pooled using meta-analysis of proportions. Meta-regression was used to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Nineteen observational studies reported the neurological outcomes of 890 insular glioma patients. The pooled incidences of new temporary and permanent motor deficits were 11% (95% CI, 6-17%) and 4% (95% CI, 2-7%) respectively, and new temporary and permanent language deficits were 11% (95% CI, 6-17%) and 2% (95% CI, 0-4%) respectively. Single-surgeon series reported significantly lower incidences of both permanent motor (2% vs 7%; P < 0.001) and language (1% vs 3%; P = 0.03) deficits. The incidences of motor and language neurological deficits following insular glioma resection have been quantified, and will assist in determining the suitability and appropriateness of pursuing surgical resection for insular glioma. We note that permanent neurological deficits are lowest when reported by series describing outcomes of a single surgeon, indicating most optimal outcomes may be best achieved after intense training and/or greater experience.",Arteriovenous Fistula Inside Cervical Spinal Canal Associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580065,World neurosurgery,2019 04 01,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation on chromosome 17, which affects the skin, vascular system, nervous system, and skeleton system.

Its prediction remains difficult in patients with large tumors, even with the recent advances in preoperative radiologic assessments. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerves combined with maximal tumor removal is particularly challenging in this rare anatomic variant, and surgery may lead to postoperative facial dysfunction, inadequate tumor removal, and/or a high retreatment rate.1 This 3-dimensional video (Video 1) demonstrates a vestibular schwannoma with dorsally displaced facial nerve, which was surgically treated by the retrosigmoid transmeatal approach under continuous facial nerve monitoring. The video was reproduced after informed consent of the patient. A 46-year-old man presented with transient hearing impairment. Neuroimaging displayed a left acoustic tumor extending into the internal acoustic meatus. The retrosigmoid transmeatal approach was performed, and a dorsally displaced facial nerve was predicted by preoperative magnetic resonance images and confirmed during surgery. The facial nerve was accurately dissected under continuous facial nerve monitoring, and gross total removal of the tumor was achieved without postoperative facial dysfunction.2.",Age-related differences in Voice-Onset-Time in Polish language users: An ERP study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580059,Acta psychologica,2019 03 27,"Using the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) paradigm we investigated for the first time cortical responses to consonant - vowel (CV) syllables differing in Voice-Onset-Time (VOT) for Polish, a member of the Slavic group of languages. The study aimed at testing age-related effects on different ERP responses in young (20-30 years of age) and elderly (60-68 years) native Polish speakers. Participants were presented with a sequence of voiced and voiceless stop CV syllables /to/ and /do/ with different VOT values (-100 ms, -70 ms, -30 ms, -20 ms, +20 ms, +50 ms). We analyzed MMN and P1, N1, N1', P2, N2 components. Our results showed an age-related decline in voicing perception in all tested ERP components. This decline could be explained in relation to a general slowing in neural processing with advancing age and may be associated with difficulties in temporal- and spectral-information processing in elderly people. Our findings revealed also that specific features of Slavic languages influence ERP morphology in a different way than reported in the literature for aspirating languages.",Caspase-3-like activity and proteasome degradation in grapevine suspension cell cultures undergoing silver-induced programmed cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580058,Journal of plant physiology,2019 02 15,"Toxic metal contamination is one of the major environmental concerns of the recent decade, due to the large application of metals in industrial, healthcare and commercial products, even in the form of nanostructures and nanomaterials. Nevertheless, the effects of silver (Ag+) on plants have not yet thoroughly elucidated. Therefore, suspension cell cultures of grapevine were used as a model for investigating silver toxicity. To do this, oxidative stress and programmed cell death (PCD), evaluated as reactive oxygen species production, caspase-3-like activity and ubiquitin-proteasome system, were investigated. As a result, the highest concentration (10 μM) of Ag+ caused a rapid (within 24 h) induction of PCD (approx. 80%), accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of caspase-3-like activity. In the presence of specific inhibitor of this enzyme, a partial recovery of cell viability and a strong inhibition of caspase-3-like activity was observed. In addition, silver-induced PCD was accompanied either by increase of poly-ubiquitin conjugated proteins and degradation of subunit PBA1 of the proteasome 20S core, similarly to what found for metal-induced neurotoxicity in animals. The present study shows that silver could induce PCD in grapevine suspension cell cultures, mediated by caspase-3-like activity and oxidative stress. These effects were associated to accumulation of poly-ubiquitin conjugated proteins, suggesting the impairment of ubiquitin-proteasome complex, confirmed by the decrease of the PBA1 subunit. These findings indicate that animal and plant cells could share a common pathway in response to toxic metal, which involves PCD and disassembling of proteasome complex.",Defoliation and gibberellin synergistically induce tree peony flowering with non-structural carbohydrates as intermedia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580057,Journal of plant physiology,2019 02 15,"Although the natural florescence of the tree peony is short, it can be lengthened by forcing culture. In this study, both defoliation or gibberellic acid (GA3) treatment individually induced tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa 'Luo Yang Hong') flowering under forcing culture, and their combination (D + G) accelerated flowering with a GA3-overdose-like phenomenon, indicating that synergism between defoliation and GA3 treatment may occur. Both defoliation and GA3 treatment induced a GA response, including (i) increased GA3 production, (ii) increased PsCPS and PsGA3ox expression, and (iii) decreased PsGA2ox, PsGID1c, and PsGID2 expression; both treatments also positively influenced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) accumulation. According to the expression of five PsSWEETs, PsSWEET2 and PsSWEET17 may redundantly exercise the crosstalk of defoliation and GA3 treatment by NSC distribution, whereas PsSWEET12 may act by GA modulation; no synergism resulting from the D + G treatment was detected. Tissue-specific analysis indicated that, in sepals, PsSWEET2 and PsSWET7 are both induced by defoliation and GA3 treatment, whereas PsSWEET2 expression showed synergism with the D + G treatment. In summary, defoliation and GA3 treatment synergistically induce tree peony flowering under forcing culture, and NSCs are suggested as key intermedia. Moreover, sepals may play key roles in their synergism, although more direct evidence is still needed."

In the United Kingdom it is represented by the rare conservation priority species Orthodontium gracile and the abundant exotic O. lineare, introduced from the Southern Hemisphere around a century ago. Although the two species are superficially very similar and difficult to tell apart in the field, very little is known about how closely they are related or about the phylogeny, biogeography and evolutionary history of the genus Orthodontium as a whole. Phylogenetic inference and divergence time estimation were used to explore relationships within the genus globally, date major lineage splits, detect reticulate evolutionary processes and test monophyly of taxa. It was shown that Orthodontium gracile belongs to a Holarctic and Asian clade that diverged from the exclusively southern temperate lineage of O. lineare approximately 53 Ma and that it is sister to the Himalayan and South Siberian bispecific genus Orthodontopsis, which we now recognise as a single species within Orthodontium, O. lignicola. Orthodontium lignicola is quite distinct from O. gracile morphologically but may have a closely overlapping centre of extant diversity in the Himalaya, in contrast to O. lineare which is morphologically similar but biogeographically dissimilar. The introduced European populations of Orthodontium lineare were shown to share plastid and nuclear haplotypes with four collections from Tasmania and Southern Chile, but to be distinct from other Chilean and South African haplotypes. Finally, well-supported incongruence between nuclear and plastid sequences in some Western North American populations of Orthodontium gracile strongly implies one or more chloroplast capture or horizontal genome transfer events involving this species and the regionally sympatric O. pellucens. An appeal is made for targeting phylogenetic research at the intersection points of practical conservation, taxonomic uncertainty and wider biological questions and for the factoring of historical evolutionary and phylogenetic diversity into conservation assessments.",Molecular characterization of nine suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes from yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco and their changes in mRNA expression to dietary carbohydrate levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580042,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are important molecules that mediates the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Here, we cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA sequences of nine genes of the SOCS family (SOCS1, 2, 3, 3b, 5, 5b, 6, 7 and CISH) from yellow catfish P. fulvidraco, explored their mRNA abundance across the tissues and their mRNA changes to dietary carbohydrate levels. Structural analysis indicated that the nine members shared conserved functional domains to the orthologues of the mammalian SOCS members, such as SRC homology 2 and the SOCS domains. Their mRNAs were constitutively expressed in various tissues but changed among the tissues. Their mRNA expression in response to dietary carbohydrate levels were explored in the liver, muscle, intestine, testis and ovary. Dietary carbohydrate addition showed significant effects on the mRNA levels of the nine SOCS members. Moreover, their mRNA expressions in response to dietary carbohydrate levels were also tissue-dependent. These indicated that SOCS members potentially mediated the utilization of dietary carbohydrate in yellow catfish.",Plasma proteomic analysis of zebrafish following spring viremia of carp virus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580041,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"To better understand spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) pathogenesis in zebrafish proteomic analysis was used to examine the plasma protein profile in SVCV-infected zebrafish. A total of 3062 proteins were identified. Of those 137, 63 and 31 proteins were enriched in blood samples harvested at 1, 2 and 5 days post SVCV infection, respectively. These altered host proteins were classified based on their biological function: 23 proteins under the response to stimulus term were identified. Interestingly, at the top of the up-regulated proteins during SVCV infection were the proteins of the vitellogenin family (Vtg) and the grass carp reovirus-induced gene (Gig) proteins. Real-time RT-PCR evaluation of samples from internal organs verified that SVCV infection induced vtg and gig2 gene expression already at day 1 post-infection. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of Vtg protein only in blood of SVCV-infected fish. This is the first proteomic study to reveal the involvement of Vtg proteins in adult fish response to viral challenge. It also highlights the role of Gig proteins as important factors in antiviral response in fish.

The LA and EPA composition of TAG molecules is mediated in vivo via the functional partitioning between NoDGAT2J and 2K, both of which are localized in the chloroplast envelope. By modulating transcript abundance of the DGAT2s, an N. oceanica strain bank was created, where proportions of LA and EPA in TAG vary by 18.7-fold (between 0.21% and 3.92% dry weight) and 34.7-fold (between 0.09% and 3.12% dry weight), respectively. These findings lay the foundation for producing designer TAG molecules with tailored health benefits or for biofuel applications in industrial microalgae and higher-plant crops.",Zinc Induces Temperature-Dependent Reversible Self-Assembly of Tau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580037,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Tau is an intrinsically disordered microtubule-associated protein that is implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies. In these diseases, Tau is found in the form of intracellular inclusions that consist of aggregated paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurons. Given the importance of this irreversible PHF formation in neurodegenerative disease, Tau aggregation has been extensively studied. Several different factors, such as mutations or post translational modifications, have been shown to influence the formation of late-stage non-reversible Tau aggregates. It was recently shown that zinc ions accelerated heparin-induced oligomerization of Tau constructs. Indeed, in vitro studies of PHFs have usually been performed in the presence of additional co-factors, such as heparin, in order to accelerate their formation. Using turbidimetry, we investigated the impact of zinc ions on Tau in the absence of heparin and found that zinc is able to induce a temperature-dependent reversible oligomerization of Tau. The obtained oligomers were not amyloid-like and dissociated instantly following zinc chelation or a temperature decrease. Finally, a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering experiments showed zinc binding to a high-affinity binding site and three low-affinity sites on Tau, accompanied by a change in Tau folding. Altogether, our findings stress the importance of zinc in Tau oligomerization. This newly identified Zn-induced oligomerization mechanism may be a part of a pathway different of and concurrent to Tau aggregation cascade leading to PHF formation.","Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 12, the Last Enzyme of Proline Catabolism in Plants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580036,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 08,"Heterokonts, Alveolata protists, green algae from Charophyta and Chlorophyta divisions, and all Embryophyta plants possess an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene named ALDH12. Here, we provide a biochemical characterization of two ALDH12 family members from the lower plant Physcomitrella patens and higher plant Zea mays. We show that ALDH12 encodes an NAD+-dependent glutamate γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GSALDH), which irreversibly converts glutamate γ-semialdehyde (GSAL), a mitochondrial intermediate of the proline and arginine catabolism, to glutamate. Sedimentation equilibrium and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that in solution both plant GSALDHs exist as equilibrium between a domain-swapped dimer and the dimer-of-dimers tetramer. Plant GSALDHs share very low-sequence identity with bacterial, fungal, and animal GSALDHs (classified as ALDH4), which are the closest related ALDH superfamily members. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of ZmALDH12 at 2.2-Å resolution  shows that nearly all key residues involved in the recognition of GSAL are identical to those in ALDH4, indicating a close functional relationship with ALDH4. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the transition from ALDH4 to ALDH12 occurred during the evolution of the endosymbiotic plant ancestor, prior to the evolution of green algae and land plants. Finally, ALDH12 expression in maize and moss is downregulated in response to salt and drought stresses, possibly to maintain proline levels. Taken together, these results provide molecular insight into the biological roles of the plant ALDH12 family.",The bacterial aetiology of pleural empyema. A descriptive and comparative metagenomic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580031,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 02 04,"The view of pleural empyema as a complication of bacterial pneumonia is changing because many patients lack evidence of underlying pneumonia.

Boiss. (Asteraceae) led to the isolation of four known guaianolide-type sesquiterpene lactones, 6α-acetoxy-4α-hydroxy-1βH-guaia-9.11(13)-dien-12.8α-olide (1), 6α-acetoxy-4α-hydroxy-9β.10β-epoxy-1βH-guaia-11(13)-en-12.8α-olide (2), 4α,6α-dihydroxy-1β,5α,7αH-guaia-9(10),11(13)-dien-12,8α-olide (3), and (4α,5α,8β,10β)-4,10-dihydroxy-1,11(13)-guaidien-12,8-olide (4), along a steroidal glycoside mixture (5a and 5b). The structures of the compounds were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data. Among them, 2, 4 and a steroidal glycoside mixture were obtained from C. montanum for the first time. All isolates were also first time assayed for in vitro cytotoxicities against four human cancer cell lines, i.e. breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB 231), colon (HT-29), and lung (PC3). Among the isolates, 1-3 showed significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cancer cells with viability ranging from 6.86 to 26.51%, while steroidal glycoside mixture showed no cytotoxicity, except against HT-29 (viability 61.99%). Compound 4 exhibited strong and selective cell growth inhibition against HT-29 with viability 20.99% and was identified as a promising compound with high selectivity between cancer cells and normal human lung cells (BEAS-2B), especially against HT-29 (IC50 = 12.2 μg/mL) compared to that of cisplatin. These results suggested that 4 is worthy of further study to determine its cytotoxicity mechanisms.",Quercetin alleviates ethanol-induced liver steatosis associated with improvement of lipophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580029,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 04 30,"Although emerging evidence demonstrated that quercetin could be explored as a potential candidate for the early intervention of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), the exact mechanisms against ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis haven't been fully elucidated. Herein, we investigated the effect of quercetin on liver steatosis caused by chronic-plus-single-binge ethanol feeding, focusing on lipophagy. Adult male mice were pair-fed with liquid diets containing ethanol (28% of total calories) and treated with quercetin for 12 weeks. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol consumption led to lipid droplets accumulation and liver damage as evidenced by histopathological changes, the increased content of triglyceride in serum and liver, and the elevated of serum ALT and AST level, which were greatly attenuated by quercetin. Moreover, quercetin blocked autophagy suppression by chronic-binge ethanol intake as manifested by the morphological improvement of mitochondrial characteristics, the increased number of autolysosome and restoration of autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, quercetin promoted lipophagy confirmed by the decreased perilipin 2 (PLIN2) level, activated AMPK activity and increased co-localization of liver LC3II and PLIN2 proteins. Collectively, these findings suggest that regular consumption of dietary quercetin has a role in preventing hepatic steatosis induced by chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding, which mechanism may associate with the evident regulatory effect of quercetin on lipophagy.",Addressing concerns over the fate of DNA derived from genetically modified food in the human body: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580028,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 04 18,"Global commercialization of GM food and feed has stimulated much debate over the fate of GM food-derived DNA in the body of the consumer and as to whether it poses any health risks. We reviewed the fate of DNA derived from GM food in the human body. During mechanical/chemical processing, integrity of DNA is compromised. Food-DNA can survive harsh processing and digestive conditions with fragments up to a few hundred bp detectable in the gastrointestinal tract. Compelling evidence supported the presence of food (also GM food) derived DNA in the blood and tissues of human/animal. There is limited evidence of food-born DNA integrating into the genome of the consumer and of horizontal transfer of GM crop DNA into gut-bacteria. We find no evidence that transgenes in GM crop-derived foods have a greater propensity for uptake and integration than the host DNA of the plant-food. We found no evidence of plant-food DNA function/expression following transfer to either the gut-bacteria or somatic cells. Strong evidence suggested that plant-food-miRNAs can survive digestion, enter the body and affect gene expression patterns. We envisage that this multi-dimensional review will address questions regarding the fate of GM food-derived DNA and gene-regulatory-RNA in the human body."

In this study, we explored whether ethanol-induced zinc insufficiency extended to the pup AM and contributed to immunosuppression and exacerbated viral lung infections.","Viral gastroenteritis among children of 0-5 years in Nigeria: Characterization of the first Nigerian aichivirus, recombinant noroviruses and detection of a zoonotic astrovirus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580015,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,2019 01 21,Viruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide.

T cells can play critical roles in inducing B cell mediated immunity. As the mechanism of T cell dependent B cell maturation is not well established, we hypothesized that a specific population of T (follicular helper T, Tfh) cells, are involved in B cell maturation following cholera. We found flowcytometrically that V. cholerae infection induces significant increases in circulating Tfh cells expressing B cell maturation associated protein CD40L early in disease. The increased Tfh cells expressing CD40L recognize cholera toxin most prominently, with lessened responses to V. cholerae membrane preparation (MP) and V. cholerae cytolysin (VCC). We further showed that early induction of Tfh cells and CD40L was associated with later memory B cell responses to same antigens. Lastly, we demonstrated in vitro that Tfh cells isolated after cholera can stimulate class switching of co-cultured, isolated B cells from patients with cholera, leading to production of the more durable IgG antibody isotype colorimetrically. These studies were conducted on circulating Tfh cells; future studies will be directed at examining role of Tfh cells during cholera directly in gut mucosa of biopsied samples, at the single cell level if feasible.",Pertactin-deficient Bordetella pertussis isolates in Poland-a country with whole-cell pertussis primary vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580013,Microbes and infection,2019 01 12,"The introduction of pertussis vaccination in the 1950s resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of disease. However, since the 1990s many highly vaccinated countries have observed the re-emergence of the disease. One of the causes of this phenomenon might be related to the adaptation of Bordetella pertussis to vaccination. The purpose of the presented study was an investigation of the emergence and spread of vaccine antigen-deficient B. pertussis isolates in Poland and genomic characterization of the currently circulating pathogen population using PFGE, MLVA and MAST. The results revealed that all tested isolates expressed Ptx, FHA and ACT antigens but 15.4% (4/26) of isolates from 2010 to 2016 were Prn-deficient. Moreover, one TcfA-deficient isolate was collected in 2015. The genotyping showed a genetic distinction between the isolates circulating in 2010-2016 and isolates from previous periods. The majority of currently circulating isolates belonged to PFGE group IV (96.2%), type MT27 (73.1%), and carried ptxA1-ptxC2-ptxP3-prn2-tcfA2-fim2-1-fim3-1 alleles (61.5%). The unique genetic structure of the B. pertussis population in Poland has changed since 2010 and became similar to that observed in countries with aP vaccination. This could be a result of increasing use of aP vaccines (60% of primary vaccination in 2013) over wP vaccines, which have been broadly used for primary vaccination in Poland for decades.",Cell-type and projection-specific dopaminergic encoding of aversive stimuli in addiction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580012,Brain research,2019 05 10,"Drug addiction is a major public health concern across the world for which there are limited treatment options. In order to develop new therapies to correct the behavioral deficits that result from repeated drug use, we need to understand the neural circuit dysfunction that underlies the pathophysiology of the disorder. Because the initial reinforcing effects of drugs are dependent on increases in dopamine in reward-related brain regions such as the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, a large focus of addiction research has centered on the dysregulation of this system and its control of positive reinforcement and motivation. However, in addition to the processing of positive, rewarding stimuli, there are clear deficits in the encoding and valuation of information about potential negative outcomes and how they control decision making and motivation. Further, aversive stimuli can motivate or suppress behavior depending on the context in which they are encountered. We propose a model where rewarding and aversive information guides the execution of specific motivated actions through mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine acting on D1- and D2- receptor containing neuronal populations. Volitional drug exposure alters the processing of rewarding and aversive stimuli through remodeling of these dopaminergic circuits, causing maladaptive drug seeking, self-administration in the face of negative consequences, and drug craving. Together, this review discusses the dysfunction of the circuits controlling different types of aversive learning as well as how these guide specific discrete behaviors, and provides a conceptual framework for how they should be considered in preclinical addiction models.",Contributions of sex to cerebrovascular function and pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580011,Brain research,2019 03 22,"Sex differences exist in how cerebral blood vessels function under both physiological and pathological conditions, contributing to observed sex differences in risk and outcomes of cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs), such as vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and stroke. Throughout most of the lifespan, women are protected from CBVDs; however, risk increases following menopause, suggesting sex hormones may play a significant role in this protection. The cerebrovasculature is a target for sex hormones, including estrogens, progestins, and androgens, where they can influence numerous vascular functions and pathologies. While there is a plethora of information on estrogen, the effects of progestins and androgens on the cerebrovasculature are less well-defined. Estrogen decreases cerebral tone and increases cerebral blood flow, while androgens increase tone. Both estrogens and androgens enhance angiogenesis/cerebrovascular remodeling. While both estrogens and androgens attenuate cerebrovascular inflammation, pro-inflammatory effects of androgens under physiological conditions have also been demonstrated. Sex hormones exert additional neuroprotective effects by attenuating oxidative stress and maintaining integrity and function of the blood brain barrier. Most animal studies utilize young, healthy, gonadectomized animals, which do not mimic the clinical conditions of aging individuals likely to get CBVDs. This is also concerning, as sex hormones appear to mediate cerebrovascular function differently based on age and disease state (e.g. metabolic syndrome). Through this review, we hope to inspire others to consider sex as a key biological variable in cerebrovascular research, as greater understanding of sex differences in cerebrovascular function will assist in developing personalized approaches to prevent and treat CBVDs.","Effects of microsporidiosis and food availability on the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., and convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580010,Journal of invertebrate pathology,2019 02 15,"Two species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles that are commercially available for biological control: Nosema adaliae from the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., and Tubulinosema hippodamiae from the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville. These pathogens delay larval development under controlled conditions, but little is known regarding the effects that microsporidia cause when their hosts are subjected to stressful conditions that are often experienced in nature. In this study, the combined effects of microsporidiosis (N. adaliae on A. bipunctata and T. hippodamiae on H. convergens) and irregular food availability were observed on host fitness (larval development and mortality, sex ratios, and adult morphometrics). For each beetle species, 24 h-old larvae were provided either an uninfected or microsporidia-infected conspecific egg. After the egg was eaten, some larvae were provided an abundance of aphids daily, whereas others were provided aphids on an irregular basis. Development was delayed significantly for larvae that consumed a microsporidia-infected egg, and for those fed irregularly. For A. bipunctata, a significant interaction was observed between infection status and food availability. This suggests that N. adaliae-infected A. bipunctata larvae that have an irregular supply of aphids undergo further developmental delays than those with a generous food supply. This interaction was not observed for T. hippodamiae-infected H. convergens. For both species, larval mortality and sex ratios did not differ significantly, regardless of infection status or food availability. Adults that were fed daily as larvae were significantly larger than those fed irregularly. However, the elytra of N. adaliae-infected A. bipunctata were significantly larger than the elytra of their uninfected cohorts, and T. hippodamiae-infected H. convergens had wider pronota and head capsules than uninfected H. convergens. Because N. adaliae and T. hippodamiae prolong larval development of their respective hosts under controlled conditions, one would expect these pathogens to cause more profound effects when their hosts experience stressful conditions. The results from this study indicate that this was the case for A. bipunctata, but not for H. convergens.",Cost Effectiveness of the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score for Guiding Treatment Decisions in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580007,Urology,2019 06 13,"To determine the cost-effectiveness of using the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), a 17-gene expression assay that can be used to inform decisions regarding active surveillance (AS) vs immediate treatment.",Management of Recurrent Pelvic Fluid Collections in Adult Male Bladder Exstrophy Patients With Maintenance of Erectile Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580006,Urology,2019 06 06,"""To describe management options for pelvic fluid collections in adult patients with classic bladder exstrophy.""",Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Defined Prostate-Specific Antigen Density Significantly Improves the Risk Prediction for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580005,Urology,2019 06 13,To evaluate the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and MRI interpretation for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa).

Associations between air pollution and gestational or pre-existing diabetes have been hypothesized but are not well established. We examined the association between air pollution exposure in pregnancy and gestational diabetes and whether the association between air pollution and preterm birth is modified by diabetes (gestational or pre-existing) in a highly polluted area of California. Birth certificates and hospital discharge data from all singleton births from 2000 to 2006 to women living in four counties in the San Joaquin Valley of California were linked to criteria air pollution and traffic density measurements at the geocoded maternal residence. Air pollutants were dichotomized at the highest quartile and compared to the lower three quartiles. Logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal race-ethnicity, age, education, payment of birth expenses, and prenatal care. There were consistent inverse associations between exposure to air pollution during the first two trimesters and gestational diabetes (statistically significant odds ratios (OR) less than 1). When stratified by any diabetes (gestational or pre-existing), associations between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and categories of preterm birth (20-27, 28-31, 32-33, 34-36 weeks) were generally similar with few exceptions of exposures to carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5). Those with diabetes and exposure higher levels of CO (in first trimester or entire pregnancy) or PM2.5 (in first trimester) had higher risk of extremely preterm birth (20-27 weeks) compared with those without diabetes. The associations between traffic-related air pollution and gestational diabetes were in the unexpected (""protective"") direction. Among those with any diabetes, associations were stronger between CO and PM2.5 and extremely preterm birth.","Meteorological correlates and AirQ+ health risk assessment of ambient fine particulate matter in Tehran, Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579988,Environmental research,2019 02 03,"There are few studies in the world that have been evaluated the mortality due to exposure to particulate matter smaller than 2.5 µm by AirQ+ software.

In this study, we assessed the influence of various physiological parameters and food material on the oral or inhalation bioaccessibility of PM2.5-bound hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), including halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results showed that physiologically based pepsin and pancreatin have a small influence on the HOC liberation from particles. The bioaccessibility increased dramatically when the bile salt concentrations exceeding the critical micelle concentration, and application of porcine bile salts probably lead to underestimated bioaccessibility. Protein and carbohydrates significantly increased the bioaccessibility of most HOCs, while a significant bioaccessibility reduction was caused by green tea. The bioaccessibility of most HOCs was not promoted by liquor under normal physiological condition, but was significantly promoted under fast condition. Long residence time of PM2.5 in the lung (15 days) would result in higher mobilization of PAHs into the lung fluid than short time (one day). However, the inverse time-dependence for OPFRs suggests degradation in the lung fluid. A mechanism of hydrolysis of organophosphorus ester is hypothesized, and the half lives ranged from 17 to 90 days.","Urinary biomarker of late pregnancy exposure to drinking water disinfection by-products and ultrasound measures of fetal growth in Wuhan, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579986,Environmental research,2019 02 03,"Disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been shown to be reproductive and developmental toxicity.

Standard membrane filtration methods were used for detection of indicator bacteria. Water samples (n = 28) were filtered through cellulose ester membrane filters and bacterial populations were enumerated by placing the filters on selective agar. For detection of pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)), water samples were filtered through Modified Moore swabs and enriched in Universal Pre-enrichment Broth, followed by selective enrichment broth for each pathogen. The enriched broth was streaked onto agar media selective for each pathogen. Presumptive colonies were confirmed by PCR/real-time PCR. Among the 14 reclaimed water samples from two sites, the ranges of recovered populations of E. coli, total coliforms, and enterococci were 0-1.3, 0.5-8.3 × 103, and 0-5.5 CFU/100 mL, respectively.

In the 13 return flow water samples from 3 sites, the ranges of recovered populations of E. coli, total coliforms and enterococci were 1.9-5.3 × 102, 6.5 × 102-9.1 × 104, and 2.9-3.7× 103 CFU/100 mL, respectively. All samples were negative for L. monocytogenes. One (7.1%) of the return flow samples was positive for E. coli O145. Nine (64.3%) of the samples were positive for Salmonella. Both real-time PCR and culture-based methods were used for the detection of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes, and the results from the two methods were comparable. The findings of this study provide evidence that irrigation waters in Arizona, including reclaimed water and return flows, could be potential sources of bacterial contamination of produce. Additional work is needed to evaluate whether bacteria present in irrigation water sources transfer to the edible portion of irrigated plants and are capable of persisting through post-harvest activities.",Micro- and nanotechnology approaches to improve Parkinson's disease therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579984,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 01,"Current therapies for Parkinson's disease are symptomatic and unable to regenerate the brain tissue. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of a wide variety of neuroprotective and neuroregenerative molecules such as neurotrophic factors, antioxidants and RNA-based therapeutics has been explored. However, drug delivery to the brain is still a challenge and the therapeutic efficacy of many drugs is limited. In the last decade, micro- and nanoparticles have proved to be powerful tools for the administration of these molecules to the brain, enabling the development of new strategies against Parkinson's disease. The list of encapsulated drugs and the nature of the particles used is long, and numerous studies have been carried out supporting their efficacy in treating this pathology. This review aims to give an overview of the latest advances and emerging frontiers in micro- and nanomedical approaches for repairing dopaminergic neurons. Special emphasis will be placed on offering a new perspective to link these advances with the most relevant clinical trials and with the real possibility of transferring micro- and nanoformulations to industrial scale-up processes. This review is intended as a contribution towards facing the challenges that still exist in the clinical translation of micro- and nanotechnologies to administer therapeutic agents in Parkinson's disease.","Double emulsions prepared by two-step emulsification: History, state-of-the-art and perspective.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579983,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 01,"Attractive interest on double emulsions comes from their unique morphology, making them general multifunctional carriers able to encapsulate different hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules in the same particle. Over the past century, two different types of methods were followed to prepare double emulsions for pharmaceutics applications, so-called ""one-step"" and ""two-step"" processes. The two-step approach, consisting in two different emulsifications successively performed, allows the optimal and more efficient formulations due to simplicity of principle and controllability of the process. In this review, focused on the formulation of double emulsions by two-step process, we recount the historical development of this approach, along with the state-of-the-art, including a discussion on the role of the formulation parameters, surfactants, amphiphilic polymers, interface stabilization, volume fraction, and so forth, on the final formulation stability, morphology and properties as drug delivery system. Discussion was also extended to polymeric microparticles and nanoparticles made by solvent diffusion, on the basis of double emulsions made by two-step process, along with literature review on the impact of different formulation and processing parameters. In addition, the properties of the polymers used in the microparticles matrix (molecular weight, chemical nature) potentially impacting on the ones of the microparticles formed (drug release kinetics, stability, morphology), were also discussed. Finally, the future trends in double emulsions application were addressed, emphasizing some new advances made in the emulsifications method as potentially able to open the range of applications, for example to nanoscale with spontaneous emulsification or low energy microfluidic emulsification.",Progress in three-dimensional printing with growth factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579982,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 05,"Incorporation of growth factors in biomedical constructs can encourage cellular activities necessary for tissue regeneration within an implant system. Three-dimensional printing offers a capacity for spatial dictation and dosage control of incorporated growth factors which promises to minimize complications from the supraphysiologic doses and burst release involved in current growth factor delivery systems. Successful implementation of three-dimensional printing with growth factors requires preservation of the bioactivity of printed growth factors, spatial localization of growth factors within the construct architecture during printing, and controlled release of growth factors after printing. This review describes demonstrated approaches for addressing each of these goals, including direct inclusion of growth factors with the biomaterial during printing, or intermediary encapsulation of growth factors in delivery vehicles such as microparticles or nanoparticles."

Reactivation of BK virus is its most common cause. The more intense immunosuppressive regimens administered to recipients of grafts from alternative donors have been reported to account for the increased susceptibility to HC in this population. This study compares patients undergoing HCT with either a haploidentical donor or a matched related donor, all of whom received identical immunosuppression with a post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-based regimen. The incidence of HC was significantly higher in the patients receiving a haploidentical graft (P = .01). The higher incidence of HC in haploidentical graft recipients is therefore directly related to the inherent immune deficiency that follows HLA-mismatched transplantation, independent of the intensity of pharmacologic immunosuppression.

The primary study endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Sixty patients were enrolled with a median age of 56 years and an intermediate-2 or high-risk score in 65%, according to the Dynamic International Prognostic Staging System (DIPSS). Donors were HLA-identical sibling (n = 25), matched unrelated (n = 25) or single allele mismatched unrelated (n = 10). With a median follow-up of 22 months (range, 1 to 68 months), outcomes at 2 years after HSCT in the FB arm versus the FT arm were as follows: PFS, 43% versus 55% (P = .28); overall survival (OS), 54% versus 70% (P = .17); relapse/progression, 36% versus 24% (P = .24); nonrelapse mortality (NRM), 21% in both arms (P = .99); and graft failure, 14% versus 10% (P = .96).

Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database we identified MM patients receiving first AHCT within 18 months after diagnosis with available R-ISS stage at diagnosis (n = 628). Relative risks of relapse/progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS were calculated with the R-ISS group as a predictor in multivariate analysis. Among early relapsers, postrelapse survival was tested to identify factors affecting postrelapse OS. The cumulative incidence of early relapse was 23%, 39%, and 50% for R-ISS I, R-ISS II, and R-ISS III, respectively (P < .001). Shorter PFS and OS were seen with higher stage R-ISS. R-ISS was independently predictive for inferior postrelapse OS among early relapsers, as was the presence of ≥3 comorbidities and the use of ≥2 induction chemotherapy lines.

As an important component of the marine ecosystem, sea cucumber is a suitable echinoderm species for researching stress responses. In this study, we have investigated the proteomic response of respiratory trees in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus, challenged with environmental stresses by using the iTRAQ technique. Results showed that 262, 155 and 433 proteins were differentially regulated in response to heat, hypoxia, and heat plus hypoxia, respectively. Expression of key genes and proteins were measured by real-time PCR and western blot to validate the accuracy of the proteome files. Results showed that the interaction between these two stressors has an additive effect at the proteome level. Proteins involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic processes were largely induced by heat while repressed by hypoxia. Exposure to multiple climate change stressors caused several proteins involved in lipid metabolic progress to be down-regulated and lipid catabolic processes were induced. Additionally, hypoxia and the combined stress induced proteins involved in iron homeostasis. ATP synthesis and gluconeogenesis were induced under heat and the combined stress, while ATP and glycogen synthesis were depressed under hypoxia. Proteins related with immune and defense response were largely induced and protein synthesis ability was depressed under all three stresses. Thus, sea cucumber may adopt different strategies to cope with varied environmental stress, and the situation in heat group is more similar with the combined treatment than hypoxia group. These proteomic changes in response to high-temperature and low-oxygen levels may provide insights into the defense strategies of sea cucumber in response to global climate changes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The study focused on comparative quantitative proteomics on Apostichopus japonicus respiratory tree using iTRAQ in responses to multiple climate change stressors: heat, hypoxia and the combined stress. Data showed that A. japonicus can have an acute reaction in diverse biological pathways to both individual and interacting environmental stress, including substance metabolism, signal transduction, protein synthesis, immune response and energy production. Results indicated that sea cucumber adopted different strategies to cope with varied environmental stress, and the interaction between these two stressors has an additive effect at the proteome level. These results offer insight into the molecular regulation of A. japonicus to multiple environmental stress and reveal possible molecular events in sea cucumber under climate changes. The understanding of adaptive variation under global climate changes in aquatic organisms could be improved.","Comparative mechanical, morphological, and microstructural characterization of porcine mitral and tricuspid leaflets and chordae tendineae.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579963,Acta biomaterialia,2019 01 26,"Healthy function of tricuspid valve (TV) structures is essential to avoid tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and may significantly improve disease prognosis.

The following monolayers were employed: dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol mixture in a molar ratio of 7:3 (DPPC/CHOL) and Ceramide [AP]/stearic acid/cholesterol in a molar ratio of 14:14:10 (CER/SA/CHOL). They mimicked a general bilayer structure and an intercellular lipid mixture, respectively. Both lipid mixtures on Milli-Q water were first compressed to the initial surface pressure, Π0 = 30 mN/m and then the subphase was exchanged with the respective (bio)surfactant solution at 1% (w/w). All four synthetic surfactants behaved in a similar way: they increased surface pressure to about 40 mN/m and reduced the storage modulus of surface dilational surface rheology, E', to the values close to zero. The corresponding fluorescence microscopy pictures confirmed that the lipids mimicking the stratum corneum components were almost completely removed by the synthetic surfactants under the present experimental conditions. The components of the Soapwort extract (SAP) increased surface pressure to significantly higher values than the synthetic surfactants, but even more spectacular increase was observed for the storage modulus of the SAP-penetrated lipid monolayers (up to E'= 715 mN/m).",The transmembrane domain of the SNARE protein VAMP2 is highly sensitive to its lipid environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579961,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of publications relating to TEP. Unfortunately, this increased interest in TEP measurement has not been accompanied by significant improvement in the analysis method or TEP monitoring. Currently, the most common method to analyze and quantify TEP only allows offline, and often offsite measurement, causing delays and slow response times. This paper introduces an improved method for TEP monitoring using a membrane-based spectrophotometric technique to quantify TEP in various water bodies. The proposed TEP monitor involves a crossflow filtration unit, reagent injection and a spectrophotometer system. The TEP retained on the membrane surface is stained by Alcian blue and the amount deposited is quantified directly using an optic fibre reflectance probe coupled with a spectrophotometer. The novel method shows a linear relationship with various concentrations of Xanthan gum (a model representing TEP). When tested with various water samples, the proposed method was found to correlate well with the conventional method. Several advantages of this novel method are shorter analysis time, increased accuracy, and the potential to be further developed into an online system.",Antimicrobial activity and safety applications of meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)platinum(II) porphyrin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579946,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 03 19,"Tetra-platinated(II) porphyrin hexafluorophosphate compound (4-PtTPyPor) was synthetized and along 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (4-TPyPor), evaluated about the antimicrobial activity and safety.

Colorectal cancer screening has been a major agenda item for national gastroenterology societies, culminating in a major victory with passage of the Balanced Budget Act that allowed for Medicare coverage of colorectal cancer screening. Colonoscopy as the primary screening modality was solidified in the 1990s after landmark studies demonstrated its superiority over modalities for detecting precancerous polyps. Despite progress, colorectal cancer screening disparities between race and gender continue to exist. Legislative efforts are on-going and include the SCREEN Act and Dent Act that aim to further improve access to screening. The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable has launched colorectal cancer screening initiatives targeting at risk populations. Today, the current goal of these initiatives is to reach colorectal screening rate of 80% of eligible patients by 2018. With these initiatives, efforts to narrow the gaps in screening disparities and lower overall mortality have been prioritized and continued by the medical community. This review article details colorectal cancer screening progress to date and highlights major studies and initiatives that have solidified its success in the United States."

In fish, the growing ball-shaped lens maintains sophisticated optical properties throughout life by maintaining the distribution of refractive index relative to the increasing radius of the lens. During this process, the central fibers must increase refractive index by increasing the cytosolic concentration of crystallin proteins. However, only the youngest, most peripheral lens fiber cells have the ability to synthesize proteins. Unfortunately, the hardness of fish lenses makes investigation of the cellular anatomy impossible with traditional histological methods. We have developed a method for visualizing lens fiber cells across the diameter of the lens in adult fish. The method relies on sectioning embedded lenses with a high-speed power saw and observing the cut surface with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The combination of SEM and image analysis allowed for precise tracking of the positions of individual cell fiber cells. As an application of the method, we present a cell thickness profile, i.e. the distribution of cells thicknesses and their relative positions along the lens's radius. Combined with detailed optical studies, which by mathematical reasons only are possible on ball-shaped lenses, our method can lead to new insights into the mechanism governing the functional and cellular development of vertebrate lenses.",Evaluation of first rapid diagnostic kit for Anti-Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus IgM antibody using clinical samples from Iran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579923,Journal of virological methods,2019 04 15,"Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal tick-borne viral disease, which is in the WHO list for emerging infections likely to cause major epidemics in the near future. Early diagnosis of CCHF is very important for both patient treatment and infection control. An efficient CCHF rapid test therefore is of great significance. This study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the first CCHF rapid diagnostic kit (CCHF Sero K-SeT, CORIS BioConcept, Belgium) for detection of IgM specific antibody in patients' sera or plasma, using 87 clinical serum samples from Iranian patients. Although the assay showed an acceptable specificity of 92.9% (13/14), a low sensitivity rate of 39.7% (29/73) was observed. There was no association between the results of CCHF rapid diagnostic kit and the genotype of CCHF virus. This evaluation revealed that the CCHF Sero K-SeT is not suitable for screening of CCHF suspected cases due to its poor sensitivity.",Production of a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant nucleocapsid protein and its application for the detection of fig mosaic virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579922,Journal of virological methods,2019 04 15,"Mosaic disease (MD), caused by Fig mosaic emaravirus (FMV), is the most important and devastating virus disease of fig trees worldwide. The detection of FMV in infected plants is possible only through the use of molecular techniques, i.e. RT-PCR and LAMP, which both offer high sensitivity of detection, but are also considered laborious when dealing with a large number of samples. To cope with this restriction, a polyclonal antiserum through the immunization of a rabbit by injecting the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) of FMV was raised and evaluated for its efficacy in Western Blot, Dot immuno-binding and DAS-ELISA. The results obtained showed that the raised antiserum was able to identify the nucleocapsid protein of FMV (p3) which was found to have an estimated molecular weight of ca. 35 KDa. In addition, the antiserum, when used in the three serological assays, was able to detect the p3 of FMV in protein extracts of infected plants with different levels of efficacy. Dot immuno-binding, using denatured plant protein extract, proved to be the most efficient serological assay for detecting FMV in samples collected from different fig orchards. This is the first report on an antiserum raised against FMV that could be used for immunological detection of the virus.",Development of an avian avulavirus 1 (AAvV-1) L-gene real-time RT-PCR assay using minor groove binding probes for application as a routine diagnostic tool.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579921,Journal of virological methods,2019 04 15,"Newcastle disease is a devastating disease of poultry caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a virulent form of avian avulavirus 1 (AAvV-1). A rapid, sensitive and specific means for the detection of NDV is fundamental for the control of this notifiable transboundary virus. Although several real-time RT-PCR assays exist for the detection of AAvV-1, diagnostic sensitivity and specificities can be sub-optimal. In this study, we describe a modification to an existing AAvV-1 l-gene RT-PCR screening assay, where the original probe set was replaced with minor groove binding (MGB) probes, to create the MGB l-gene assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this assay was evaluated against a broad panel of both Class I and Class II AAvV-1 viruses of diverse and representative lineages/genotypes in both clinical samples and amplified viruses, and compared with a number of previously published real-time RT-PCR screening assays for AAvV-1. The MGB l-gene assay outperformed all other assays in this assessment, with enhanced sensitivity and specificity, detecting isolates from a broad range of virus lineages/genotypes (including contemporaneously-circulating strains). The assay has also proved its value for screening original clinical samples for the presence of AAvV-1, thus providing an improved screening assay for routine detection of this notifiable disease agent.",Adoption of Health Information Technology Among US Nursing Facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579920,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2019 06 10,Nursing facilities have lagged behind in the adoption of interoperable health information technology (ie technologies that allow the sharing and use of electronic patient information between different information systems).

About 20% of all pharmaceutical small molecule drugs and around 30% of all active compounds in agrochemistry are halogenated. Chemical halogenation procedures usually are characterized by the use of hazardous or even highly toxic chemicals. Recently, a biocatalytic process for l-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale using FAD-dependent halogenase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase enzymes has been described. Many proteinogenic amino acids are produced by fermentation using Corynebacterium glutamicum. The fermentative production of l-glutamate and l-lysine, for example, is operated at the million-ton scale. However, fermentative production of halogenated amino acids has not yet been described. In this study, fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-chloro-l-tryptophan from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was achieved. This required metabolic engineering of an l-tryptophan producing C. glutamicum strain for expression of the genes coding for FAD-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of l-tryptophan to 7-chloro-l-tryptophan by recombinant C. glutamicum was improved by optimizing the RBS of rebH. Metabolic engineering enabled production of 7-chloro-l-tryptophan and l-tryptophan from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose.",Targeted delivery of calreticulin to ED-A fibronectin leads to tumor-growth retardation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579890,Journal of biotechnology,2019 01 22,"We report the design and characterization of novel fusion proteins, consisting of the F8 antibody and of murine calreticulin (Calr). The F8 antibody recognizes the alternatively-spliced ED-A domain of fibronectin, an extracellular matrix component found in most tumor types, while calreticulin has previously been described as an ""eat-me"" signal for dendritic cells and phagocytes. Four fusion proteins, differing in antibody formats and peptide linkers, were produced in mammalian cells, purified to homogeneity and tested in vitro and in vivo. A quantitative biodistribution in F9 tumor-bearing mice revealed that the homobivalent F8-F8-Calr format, featuring a tandem diabody structure, had the best tumor-homing properties and, for this reason, this protein was studied in therapy experiments in CT26 tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of F8-F8-Calr led to a tumor growth retardation, which could be further improved by combination with anti-PD1 antibody treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased density of CD8+ T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells and F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissue. Even though F8-F8-Calr did not lead to cancer cures at the doses tested, the excellent tolerability profile and the ability to favor a leukocyte infiltration into the neoplastic mass suggests that the targeted delivery of calreticulin may be considered for combination therapy approaches.",One-pot synthesis of a 3-thiazolidine through combination of an Asinger-type multi-component-condensation reaction with an enzymatic imine reduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579889,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 11,"Addressing the combination of heterocyclic chemistry and biocatalysis, a one-pot synthesis of a 3-thiazolidine by means of an initial Asinger-type multi-component-condensation reaction under formation of a 3-thiazoline and a subsequent enzymatic reduction of this cyclic imine is reported. The one-pot process is conducted in a sequential mode and without the need for a spatial compartmentalization of the single reaction steps. For the biocatalytic reduction an imine reductase was used in combination with a glucose dehydrogenase and D-glucose for in situ-cofactor recycling. This process has been applied successfully towards the synthesis of (S)-2,2,3-trimethyl-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]nonane on a 4.5 mmol scale leading to moderate conversion and excellent enantioselectivity of 99% enantiomeric excess.",Bacterial cellulose as a support for yeast immobilization - Correlation between carrier properties and process efficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579888,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 11,"The aim of the current study was to analyze physicochemical properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by Komagataeibacter xylinus for various periods of time in stationary conditions with regard to its potential as a carrier for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica) immobilization, and subsequently to correlate the relationship between these properties and the efficiency of the immobilization process. Physicochemical properties of BC, depending on the time of its biosynthesis, were as follows: surface area 7.21-11.04 m2/g, pore volume 3.11-3.96 cm3/g, pore diameter 0.011-0.109 nm, water holding capacity 32-64%, water relies capacity 10600-33400%, swelling ratio 132-389%, polymerization degree 2260-4780 and total crystallinity index 1.22-1.96 (3-30 days, respectively). The linear regression analysis showed that number of immobilized yeasts increased with values of surface area, pore size, pore diameter, swelling ratio, water release capacity and polymerization degree. The opposite trend was observed in case of water holding capacity and total crystallinity index. The analysis of physicochemical properties of BC performed in the current study have significant translational implications for understanding the relationships between BC-based carriers and the efficiency of yeast immobilization.",Nanoscale enrichment of the cytosolic enzyme trichodiene synthase near reorganized endoplasmic reticulum in Fusarium graminearum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579887,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 05 13,"Trichothecene mycotoxin synthesis in the phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum involves primarily endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized enzymes of the mevalonate- and trichothecene biosynthetic pathways.

Using 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D SIM), GFP-tagged Tri5 and Hms1 were tested for preferential localization in the cytosol proximal to the ER. Tri5 protein was significantly enriched in cytosolic regions within 500 nm of the ER, but Hms1 was not. Spatial organization of enzymes in the cytosol has potential relevance for pathway efficiency and metabolic engineering in fungi and other organisms.","Differential roles, crosstalk and response to the Antifungal Protein AfpB in the three Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathways of the citrus postharvest pathogen Penicillium digitatum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579886,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 05 13,"Fungi have three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): Kss1/Fus3 involved in the invasive growth and virulence of pathogens, Hog1 in response to osmotic stress, and Slt2/Mpk1 in response to cell wall (CW) stress. We conducted comparative analyses of these MAPKs in the phytopathogen Penicillium digitatum and studied their role in the mode of action of the novel self-antifungal protein AfpB. The sensitivity to different stresses of Δhog1 and the reduced growth of Δkss1 coincided with previous reports. However, Δslt2 showed a strong reduction of growth and conidiation, abnormal morphology, and sensitivity to CW stress and temperature. The complementation of Δslt2 validated this mutant. Immunodetection of P-Hog1 and P-Slt2 confirmed the loss and gain of MAPKs in the mutant and complemented strains. Mutants Δslt2 and Δkss1 showed a strong reduction in virulence, whereas Δhog1 was the least affected, and none sporulated during infection. We studied the MAPK signalling induction in response to different treatments. Our data revealed a complex crosstalk involving the three MAPKs, the differential responses of Hog1 and Slt2 to various stresses and their induction by AfpB or the fungicide fludioxonil (FD). Δhog1 resistance to FD confirmed that Hog1 mediates the activity of FD, whereas Δkss1 sensitivity is probably due to the basal activation of Hog1 in Δkss1. None of the three MAPK mutants showed increased sensitivity to AfpB, contrary to previous reports of other antifungal proteins, which indicates that the observed AfpB-mediated activation of Hog1 and Slt2 would not have a defensive role.",Nutrient sensing-the key to fungal p53-like transcription factors?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579885,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 05 13,"The mammalian tumour suppressor protein, p53, plays an important role in cell cycle control, DNA repair and apoptotic cell death. Transcription factors belonging to the ""p53-like"" superfamily are found exclusively in the Amorphea branch of eukaryotes, which includes animals, fungi and slime molds. Many members of the p53-like superfamily (proteins containing p53, Rel/Dorsal, T-box, STAT, Runt, Ndt80, and the CSL DNA-binding domains) are involved in development. Two families of p53-like proteins (Ndt80 and CSL) are widespread in fungi as well as animals. The Basidiomycetes and the Ascomycetes have undergone reciprocal loss of the Ndt80 and CSL classes of transcription factors, with the CSL class preserved in only one branch of Ascomycetes and the Ndt80 class found in only one branch of Basidiomycetes. Recent studies have greatly expanded the known functions of fungal Ndt80-like proteins and shown that they play important roles in sexual reproduction, cell death, N-acetylglucosamine sensing and catabolism, secondary metabolism, and production of extracellular hydrolases such as proteases, chitinases and cellulases. In the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans, Ndt80-like proteins are essential for hyphal growth and virulence and also play a role in antifungal resistance. These recent studies have confirmed that nutrient sensing is a common feature of fungal Ndt80-like proteins and is also found in fungal CSL-like transcription factors, which in animals is the mediator of Notch signalling. Thus, nutrient sensing may represent the ancestral role of the p53-like superfamily."

Due to the central role of the liver for body homeostasis, intensive research was conducted to identify factors that might contribute to hepatic growth and regeneration. Using a model of partial hepatectomy several factors including cytokines and growth factors that regulate this process were discovered. Among them, a protein was identified to specifically support liver regeneration and therefore was named ALR (Augmenter of Liver Regeneration). ALR protein is encoded by GFER (growth factor erv1-like) gene and can be regulated by various stimuli. ALR is expressed in different tissues in three isoforms which are associated with multiple functions: The long forms of ALR were found in the inner-mitochondrial space (IMS) and the cytosol. Mitochondrial ALR (23 kDa) was shown to cooperate with Mia40 to insure adequate protein folding during import into IMS. On the other hand short form ALR, located mainly in the cytosol, was attributed with anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties as well as its inflammation and metabolism modulating effects. Although a considerable amount of work has been devoted to summarizing the knowledge on ALR, an investigation of ALR expression in different organs (location, subcellular localization) as well as delineation between the isoforms and function of ALR is still missing. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of ALR structure and expression of different ALR isoforms. Furthermore, we highlight the functional role of endogenously expressed and exogenously applied ALR, as well as an analysis of the clinical importance of ALR, with emphasis on liver disease and in vivo models, as well as the consequences of mutations in the GFER gene.",Abnormal red blood cell indices increase the risk of arterial ischemic stroke in children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579844,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 05 08,"A high red cell distribution width (RDW) and low hemoglobin level increase the risk of arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), mostly in adults. The mechanisms related to AIS remain unknown. A total of 233 subjects (90 patients and 143 healthy controls [HC]) were enrolled. The mean(SD) age in patients and HC was 9.5(3.8) and 11.4(1.8) years, respectively. We found increased odds ratios (ORs) for large vessel and small vessel subtypes in patients without underlying diseases with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) <80 fL (OR: 5.4, 95%CI 1.8-16.3 and 2.8, 95%CI 1.2-7.2), mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels <27 pg (OR: 2.9, 95%CI 1.0-6.7 and 2.6, 95%CI 1.0-6.7), and RDW >15% (OR: 5.5, 95%CI 1.3-24.5 and 2.7, 95%CI 1.0-7.3). RBC indices showed significant correlations with TM levels. Therefore, low MCV and MCH levels, and a high RDW were risk factors for AIS and associated with TM levels in this population.",Blood microRNA-93 as an indicator for diagnosis and prediction of functional recovery of acute stroke patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579843,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 05 08,"The present study evaluated the diagnostic and predictive potential of microRNA-93 in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients within 6 h of stroke onset and its regulation on microglial inflammation in vitro. Our results showed that the miR-93 levels in plasma and neutrophil detected by real-time PCR were evidently reduced in AIS patients, and Pearson's correlation analysis showed that miR-93 levels in plasma and neutrophils had a significant positive linear correlation. Moreover, miR-93 levels in plasma and neutrophils of stroke patients at time of admission were not correlated with infarct volume and NIHSS (National Institute of Health stroke scale) scores at admission, but neutrophil miR-93 levels were positively correlated with the Barthel Index 7 days after stroke. Importantly, miR-93 levels in plasma and neutrophil of AIS patients were negatively correlated with the expression of TNF-α and IL-10. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with miR-93 agomir decreased the OGD (Oxygen and glucose deprivation)-induced proliferation of BV2 microglial cells tested by Flow cytometry. We demonstrated that miR-93 in blood has a potential to facilitate the diagnosis and prediction of neurological outcomes of acute ischemic stroke, and is involved in inflammation possibly through targeting the proliferation of microglia.",Implementation of multiphase computed tomography angiography in management of patients with acute ischemic stroke in clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579842,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 05 08,"Multiphase computed tomography angiography (CTA) provides information on the status of major cranial arteries and extent of brain collateralization. The purpose of the study was to determine whether implementation of multiphase CTA in routine clinical practice was feasible, safe and useful. Patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≥ 6) were included. Multiphase CTA was performed. Duration of performing multiphase CTA, inter-rater correlation and incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) were studied. Infarct volume, incidence of hemorrhagic transformation, the rates of favorable outcome and death were compared between those with poor and intermediate-good collateralization. Multiphase CTA was performed in 108 patients. Mean duration on each multiphase CTA study was 4.8 min. Inter-rater reliability was intermediate-good (weighted kappa 0.7569, p < 0.001). CIN occurred in 3 patients (2.8%). There were no major intracranial/extracranial artery occlusion in 31 patients (29%) and there were severe stenosis or occlusions in 77 patients (71%). In the subgroup of patients with major artery severe stenosis or occlusion, 36 patients (36/77, 47%) had poor collateralization. Despite non-significant difference in acute treatment, the patients with poor collateralization had larger infarct (123 vs 35 cc, p < 0.001) and poorer outcomes (mean modified Rankin scale 3.86 vs 2.73, p = 0.011), while the differences in symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (2.6 vs 7%, p = 0.385) and death rate (14 vs 12%, p = 0.825) were non-significant, as compared to those with intermediate-good collateralization. Multiphase CTA was feasible and safe. Besides the status of major arteries, multiphase CTA provided information on collateralization, which was associated with the size of infarct and clinical outcomes.",Schedule-dependent synergistic effects of 5-fluorouracil and selumetinib in KRAS or BRAF mutant colon cancer models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579838,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 01 26,"Combination of MEK inhibitor and 5-FU had showed limited efficacy in clinical trials. We previously reported that acquired resistance to 5-FU was related with continued activation of salvage pathway. Here we investigated whether combination of 5-FU and a MEK inhibitor had treatment sequence-dependent synergistic effects in KRAS or BRAF mutant colon cancer models. Treatment with 5-FU followed by selumetinib (FS) induced highest cell death and synergy compared with reverse (SF) and concomitant (cFS) treatment in six cell lines. SF or cFS combination induced synergy in 1 or 2 cell lines, respectively, in which the synergy was less than that by FS combination. FS enhanced apoptosis and decreased anchorage-independent growth. Induction of thymidine kinase 1, a rate-limiting enzyme in salvage pathway, by 5-FU was abrogated by subsequent treatment with selumetinib, and ERK reactivation after selumetinib was prohibited by pretreatment with 5-FU. FS altered mRNA expression in groups of genes distinct from SF. Administration of 5-FU (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, followed by selumetinib (10 or 25 mg/kg/day) for another 7 days, in colo205 and HCT8 xenograft models significantly decreased tumor growth compared with a single agent. However, co-administration in the reverse sequence did not show the difference in tumor size compared with the treatment of single agent. Decreased expression of Ki67 was observed in tumors from mice treated with FS. Our results suggest that sequential administration of 5-FU plus selumetinib would be a promising strategy for patients having KRAS or BRAF mutant colon cancers.","Tri-allelic expression of HLA gene in 46,XX/46,XY chimerism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579837,Transplant immunology,2019 03 27,"Chimerism is defined as coexistence of different cell lines in an individual. 46,XX/46,XY chimerism is very rare and exhibits broad range of clinical phenotypes. Most cases are detected at infancy or younger age due to disorders of sex development, while phenotypically normal cases are incidentally discovered through abnormal blood grouping results or multiple genotypes in HLA.",Reduced SNAP25 Protein Fragmentation Contributes to SNARE Complex Dysregulation in Schizophrenia Postmortem Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579835,Neuroscience,2019 04 28,"Recent studies associated schizophrenia with enhanced functionality of the presynaptic SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex. Altered degradation pathways of the three core SNARE proteins: synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), syntaxin-1 and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) could contribute to enhanced complex function. To investigate these pathways, we first identified a 15-kDa SNAP25 fragment (f-S25) in human and rat brains, highly enriched in synaptosomal extractions, and mainly attached to cytosolic membranes with low hydrophobicity. The presence of f-S25 is consistent with reports of calpain-mediated SNAP25 cleavage. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that f-S25 retains the ability to bind syntaxin-1, which might prevent VAMP and/or Munc18-1 assembly into the complex. Quantitative analyses in postmortem human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) revealed that schizophrenia (n = 35), but not major depression (n = 15), is associated with lower amounts of f-S25 (-37%, P = 0.027), and greater SNARE protein-protein interactions (35%, P < 0.001), compared with healthy matched controls (n = 28). Enhanced SNARE complex formation was strongly correlated with lower SNAP25 fragmentation rates (R = 0.563, P < 0.001). Statistical mediation analyses supported the hypothesis that reduced f-S25 density could upregulate SNARE fusion events in schizophrenia. Cortical calpain activity in schizophrenia did not differ from controls. f-S25 levels did not correlate with total calpain activity, indicating that if present, schizophrenia-related calpain dysfunction might occur locally at the presynaptic terminals. Overall, the present findings suggest the existence of an endogenous SNARE complex inhibitor related to SNAP25 proteolysis, associated with enhanced SNARE activity in schizophrenia.",ADAMTS18 Deficiency Affects Neuronal Morphogenesis and Reduces the Levels of Depression-like Behaviors in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579834,Neuroscience,2019 03 11,"The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) enzymes are secreted, multi-domain matrix-associated zinc metalloendopeptidases that modify extracellular matrix components and play crucial roles in development and numerous diseases. ADAMTS18 is a member of the ADAMTS family, and genome-wide association studies made an initial association of ADAMTS18 with white matter integrity in healthy people of 72-74 years old. However, the potential roles of ADAMTS18 in central nervous system remain unclear. In this study, we showed that Adamts18 mRNA is highly abundant in developing brains, especially in the cerebellum granular cell layer and the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) granular cell layer. Adamts18 knockout (KO) mice displayed higher dendritic branching complexity and spine density on hippocampal DG granular cells. Behavioral tests showed that Adamts18 KO mice had reduced levels of depression-like behaviors compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. The increased neurite formation could be attributed in part to reduced phosphorylation levels of the collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) due to activation of the laminin/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway. Our findings revealed a critical role of ADAMTS18 in neuronal morphogenesis and emotional control in mice.",PARP Inhibitor Affects Long-term Heat-stress Response via Changes in DNA Methylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579833,Neuroscience,2019 03 11,"Resilience to stress can be obtained by adjusting the stress-response set point during postnatal sensory development. Recent studies have implemented epigenetic mechanisms to play leading roles in improving resilience. We previously found that better resilience to heat stress in chicks can be achieved by conditioning them to moderate heat stress during their critical developmental period of thermal control establishment, 3 days posthatch. Furthermore, the expression level of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was found to play a direct role in determining future resilience or vulnerability to heat stress by alterations in its DNA-methylation and demethylation pattern. Here we demonstrate how intraperitoneal injection of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi) influences the DNA methylation pattern, thereby affecting the long-term heat-stress response. Single PARPi administration, induced a reduction in both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), without affecting body temperature. The accumulated effect of three PARPi doses brought about a long-term decrease in 5mC% and 5hmC%. These changes coincided with a reduction in body temperature in non-conditioned chicks, similar to that occurring in moderately conditioned heat-stress-resilient chicks. The observed changes in DNA methylation can be explained by decreased activity of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase as a result of the PARPi injection. Furthermore, evaluation of the DNA-methylation pattern along the CRH intron showed a reduction in 5mC% as a result of PARPi treatment, alongside a reduction in CRH mRNA expression. Thus, PARPi treatment can affect DNA methylation, which can alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis anchors such as CRH, thereby potentially enhancing long-term resilience to heat stress.","Acoustic Middle-Ear-Muscle-Reflex Thresholds in Humans with Normal Audiograms: No Relations to Tinnitus, Speech Perception in Noise, or Noise Exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579832,Neuroscience,2019 06 07,"The acoustic middle-ear-muscle reflex (MEMR) has been suggested as a sensitive non-invasive measure of cochlear synaptopathy, the loss of synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. In the present study, clinical MEMR thresholds were measured for 1-, 2-, and 4-kHz tonal elicitors, using a procedure shown to produce thresholds with excellent reliability. MEMR thresholds of 19 participants with tinnitus and normal audiograms were compared to those of 19 age- and sex-matched controls. MEMR thresholds did not differ significantly between the two groups at any frequency. These 38 participants were included in a larger sample of 70 participants with normal audiograms. For this larger group, MEMR thresholds were compared to a measure of spatial speech perception in noise (SPiN) and a detailed self-report estimate of lifetime noise exposure. MEMR thresholds were unrelated to either SPiN or noise exposure, despite a wide range in both measures. It is possible that thresholds measured using a clinical paradigm are less sensitive to synaptopathy than those obtained using more sophisticated measurement techniques; however, we had good sensitivity at the group level, and even trends in the hypothesized direction were not observed. To the extent that MEMR thresholds are sensitive to cochlear synaptopathy, the present results provide no evidence that tinnitus, SPiN, or noise exposure are related to synaptopathy in the population studied."

These conductances allow astrocytes to sense the levels of neuronal activity and environmental changes. Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) removes elevated Ca2+ from the cell but can reverse and bring Ca2+ in. Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane produces local Ca2+ elevations that can be further amplified by Ca2+ induced activation of inositol-3-phosphate (IP3) receptors and subsequent Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. These Ca2+ stores are located in astrocytic processes called branchlets, while perisynaptic astrocytic processes are formed by organelle-free leaflets. Such morphological structure suggests separate synaptic and extrasynaptic mechanisms of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes. Astrocytic leaflets sense synaptic activity, astrocytic branchlets integrate signals arriving from the leaflets and from extrasynaptic inputs. The surface-to-volume ratio (SVR) of the branchlets sets the threshold for generation of spreading Ca2+ events. Therefore, morphological remodeling of the processes is an important regulator of astrocytic Ca2+ activity. Ca2+ events can propagate beyond single astrocytes and form complex spatiotemporal patterns of Ca2+ activity in the astrocytic network. Ca2+ events spread intercellularly through gap-junctions and via extracellular ATP diffusion. Spatially and temporarily organized Ca2+ events in astrocytic network influence variable numbers of synapses and neuronal compartments, gate excitation flow and synaptic plasticity in the neuronal network through the release of gliotransmitters. Thus, multiple patterns of Ca2+ activity in the astrocytic network (guiding templates) determine multiple states of the neuronal network. This phenomenon may be linked to learning, memory and information processing in the brain.",Regulation of Ca2+ signaling by acute hypoxia and acidosis in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579812,Cell calcium,2019 02 19,The effects of acute (100 s) hypoxia and/or acidosis on Ca2+ signaling parameters of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are explored here for the first time.,"Rattlesnakes bites in the Brazilian Amazon: Clinical epidemiology, spatial distribution and ecological determinants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579811,Acta tropica,2019 03 14,"Crotalus bites are considered a public health problem especially in Latin America.

A total of 70,816 snakebites were recorded in the Amazon Region, 3058 (4.3%) cases being classified as crotalid, with a mean incidence rate of 11.1/100,000 inhabitants/year. The highest mean incidence rates were reported in Roraima, Tocantins and Maranhão. Area covered by water bodies, precipitation and soil humidity were negatively associated to rattlesnake encountering. Rattlesnake bites incidence was positively associated to tree canopy loss and altitude. In the Amazon, severe manifestations at admission, delayed medical assistance, lack of antivenom administration and ages ≥61 and 0-15 years were predictors of death in C. durissus snakebites. Spatial distribution of rattlesnake bites across the Brazilian Amazon showed higher incidence in areas of transition from the equatorial forest to the savanna, and in the savanna itself.

The analysis touched upon the prevalence of Brucellosis in cattle and small ruminants (sheep and goats) in 13 regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2012-2016. Aside from that, Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems conducted screening assays that involved 11,889 samples of blood and tissues from said animals.

To accomplish this, we have developed what we are calling the ""weak intercalator"" approach, wherein we attempt to simultaneously bind multiple weak intercalators to critical polymerase nucleic acids. We define weak intercalators as planar sp2 hybridized molecules with only two cycles, that have poor binding affinity individually and can only bind with high affinity if two or more weak intercalation events can take place. Using this approach, we have identified linear and cyclic molecules that present two weak intercalators that can inhibit HIV-1-RT 50 to 100 times more effectively than single weak intercalators. Specifically, a cyclic peptide motif that presents two quinoxaline rings inhibits HIV-1-RT at low µM concentration, shows no inhibition of DNA polymerase and in addition maintains a majority of its inhibitory power in the presence of 90,000 fold excess duplex DNA. These results suggest that the weak intercalator approach may prove effective as a way of targeting increasingly complex nucleic acid structures in a highly specific manner.",Young children's behavioral and neural responses to peer feedback relate to internalizing problems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579790,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Despite the importance of peer experiences during early childhood for socioemotional development, few studies have examined how young children process and respond to peer feedback. The current study used an ecologically valid experimental paradigm to study young children's processing of peer social acceptance or rejection. In this paradigm, 118 children (50% boys; Mage = 72.92 months; SD = 9.30; Rangeage = 53.19-98.86 months) sorted pictures of unknown, similar-aged peers into those with whom they wished or did not wish to play. They were later told how these peers sorted them, such that in half of the cases the presumed peer accepted or rejected the participant. When rejected children reported more distress (sadness), they were slower to rate their affective response, and exhibited increased mid-frontal EEG theta power, compared to when accepted. Moreover, we found that children's affective responses and EEG theta power for rejection predicted internalizing problems, especially if they displayed an attention bias to social threat. Our results further validate and illustrate the utility of this paradigm for studying how young children process and respond to peer feedback.",The development of brain network hubs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579789,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Some brain regions have a central role in supporting integrated brain function, marking them as network hubs. Given the functional importance of hubs, it is natural to ask how they emerge during development and to consider how they shape the function of the maturing brain. Here, we review evidence examining how brain network hubs, both in structural and functional connectivity networks, develop over the prenatal, neonate, childhood, and adolescent periods. The available evidence suggests that structural hubs of the brain arise in the prenatal period and show a consistent spatial topography through development, but undergo a protracted period of consolidation that extends into late adolescence. In contrast, the hubs of brain functional networks show a more variable topography, being predominantly located in primary cortical areas in early development, before moving to association areas by late childhood. These findings suggest that while the basic anatomical infrastructure of hubs may be established early, the functional viability and integrative capacity of these areas undergoes extensive postnatal maturation. Not all findings are consistent with this view however. We consider methodological factors that might drive these inconsistencies, and which should be addressed to promote a more rigorous investigation of brain network development.",Umbrella handle technique for fixation of FDP avulsion fracture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579788,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,2019 05 14,We present the treatment course of a 29-year-old male patient with for a Type 3 FDP avulsion (Jersey's finger) of a fifth finger treated with umbrella handle technique. The patient had a volar base fracture of distal phalanx with dorsal subluxation of DIP joint after a fall. Following open reduction of the FDP avulsion fracture and fixation was achieved with a 0.9 mm one edge hooked Kirschner wire under fluoroscopy control. The straight edge of the wire was driven out in a central position in sterile nail matrix just distal to lunula. The wire was removed at the fifth week when the complete union of the fracture was observed. The patient achieved full flexion in DIP joint without an extension lag.,Current controversies on the role of lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579787,Urologic oncology,2019 02 18,"Lymph node dissection is part of the standard treatment protocol for various cancers, but its role in prostate cancer has been debatable for some time. Pelvic lymphadenectomy has been shown to better help stage prostate cancer patients, but has yet to be definitively proven to be of any benefit for survival. Various templates for lymph node dissections exist, and though some national guidelines have endorsed an extended pelvic node dissection, the choice of template is still controversial. Pelvic lymphadenectomy may lead to a slightly higher rate complications and operative time, and their use must be judiciously applied to patients with a high enough risk of lymph node involvement. We present a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the benefits and harms of lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.",Beam selection for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy using Cyberknife with multileaf collimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579786,Medical engineering & physics,2019 05 03,"The Cyberknife system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) enables radiotherapy using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) with a large number of non-coplanar beam orientations. Recently, a multileaf collimator has also been available to allow flexibility in field shaping. This work aims to evaluate the quality of treatment plans obtainable with the multileaf collimator. Specifically, the aim is to find a subset of beam orientations from a predetermined set of candidate directions, such that the treatment quality is maintained but the treatment time is reduced. An evolutionary algorithm is used to successively refine a randomly selected starting set of beam orientations. By using an efficient computational framework, clinically useful solutions can be found in several hours. It is found that 15 beam orientations are able to provide treatment quality which approaches that of the candidate beam set of 110 beam orientations, but with approximately half of the estimated treatment time. Choice of an efficient subset of beam orientations offers the possibility to improve the patient experience and maximise the number of patients treated.",Hurdles in gene therapy regulatory approval: a retrospective analysis of European Marketing Authorization Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579785,Drug discovery today,2019 03 28,"Gene therapy medicinal products (GTMPs) are innovative and promising treatment strategies. In Europe, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) is responsible for making marketing authorization recommendations to the Committee of Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). In the current study, we identified major objections, issues, or concerns raised during the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) process for products resulting from the interaction of both committees between 2008 and 2017. During the first few years following CAT establishment, quality issues were often identified as major deficiencies, whereas issues at the nonclinical level appeared to be less frequent. Clinical efficacy and safety issues appeared to have a major role in unsuccessful MAA outcome for GTMPs. Most deficiencies were addressed through clarification during the MAA review or in postmarketing settings. The MAA procedure for GTMPs is complex and it is anticipated that continuous MAA submissions will further enhance the experience of both regulators and applicants, reducing the attrition rate for approval.",Macrophage biology in the peripheral nervous system after injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579784,Progress in neurobiology,2019 01 23,"Neuroinflammation has positive and negative effects. This review focuses on the roles of macrophage in the PNS. Transection of PNS axons leads to degeneration and clearance of the distal nerve and to changes in the region of the axotomized cell bodies. In both locations, resident and infiltrating macrophages are found. Macrophages enter these areas in response to expression of the chemokine CCL2 acting on the macrophage receptor CCR2. In the distal nerve, macrophages and other phagocytes are involved in clearance of axonal debris, which removes molecules that inhibit nerve regeneration. In the cell body region, macrophage trigger the conditioning lesion response, a process in which neurons increase their regeneration after a prior lesion. In mice in which the genes for CCL2 or CCR2 are deleted, neither macrophage infiltration nor the conditioning lesion response occurs in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Macrophages exist in different phenotypes depending on their environment. These phenotypes have different effects on axonal clearance and neurite outgrowth. The mechanism by which macrophages affect neuronal cell bodies is still under study. Overexpression of CCL2 in DRG in uninjured animals leads to macrophage accumulation in the ganglia and to an increase in the growth potential of DRG neurons. This increased growth requires activation of neuronal STAT3. In contrast, in acute demyelinating neuropathies, macrophages are involved in stripping myelin from peripheral axons. The molecular mechanisms that trigger macrophage action after trauma and in autoimmune disease are receiving increased attention and should lead to avenues to promote regeneration and protect axonal integrity.",CCNA2 Ablation in Aged Mice Results in Abnormal rRNA Granule Accumulation in Hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579783,The American journal of pathology,2019 03 29,"Mounting evidence in the literature suggests that RNA-RNA binding protein aggregations can disturb neuronal homeostasis and lead to symptoms associated with normal aging as well as dementia. The specific ablation of cyclin A2 in adult neurons results in neuronal polyribosome aggregations and learning and memory deficits. Detailed histologic and ultrastructural assays of aged mice revealed that post-mitotic hippocampal pyramidal neurons maintain cyclin A2 expression and that proliferative cells in the dentate subgranular zone express cyclin A2. Cyclin A2 loss early during neural development inhibited hippocampal development through canonical/cell-cycle mechanisms, including prolonged cell cycle timing in embryonic hippocampal progenitor cells. However, in mature neurons, cyclin A2 colocalized with dendritic rRNA. Cyclin A2 ablation in adult hippocampus resulted in decreased synaptic density in the hippocampus as well as in accumulation of rRNA granules in dendrite shafts. We conclude that cyclin A2 functions in a noncanonical/non-cell cycle regulatory role to maintain adult pyramidal neuron ribostasis."

Methods We reviewed prognostic tools available online and extracted all uncertainty descriptions. We adapted an existing classification and classified each extracted statement by presentation of uncertainty. Results We reviewed 222 different prognostic risk tools, which produced 772 individual estimates. When describing aleatory uncertainty, almost all (90%) prognostic tools included a quantitative description, such as ""chances of survival after surgery are 10%"", though there was heterogeneity in the use of percentages, natural frequencies, and use of graphics. Only 14% of tools described epistemic uncertainty. Of those that did, most used a qualitative prefix such as ""about"" or ""up to"", while 22 tools described quantitative descriptions using confidence intervals or ranges. Conclusions Considerable heterogeneity exists in the way uncertainties are communicated in cancer prognostic tools. Few tools describe epistemic uncertainty. This variation is predominately explained by a lack of evidence and consensus in risk communication, particularly for epistemic uncertainty. Practice Implications As precision medicine seeks to improve prognostic estimates, the community may not be equipped with the tools to communicate the results accurately and effectively to clinicians and patients.",Selecting mixtures on the basis of dietary exposure and hazard data: application to pesticide exposure in the European population in relation to steatosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579770,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2019 03 09,"Populations are exposed to mixtures of pesticides through their diet on a daily basis. The question of which substances should be assessed together remains a major challenge due to the complexity of the mixtures. In addition, the associated risk is difficult to characterise. The EuroMix project (European Test and Risk Assessment Strategies for Mixtures) has developed a strategy for mixture risk assessment. In particular, it has proposed a methodology that combines exposures and hazard information to identify relevant mixtures of chemicals belonging to any cumulative assessment group (CAG) to which the European population is exposed via food. For the purposes of this study, food consumption and pesticide residue data in food and drinking water were obtained from national surveys in nine European countries. Mixtures of pesticides were identified by a sparse non-negative matrix underestimation (SNMU) applied to the specific liver steatosis effect in children from 11 to 15 years of age, and in adults from 18 to 64 years of age in nine European countries. Exposures and mixtures of 144 pesticides were evaluated through four different scenarios: (1) chronic exposure with a merged concentration dataset in the adult population, (2) chronic exposure with country-specific concentration datasets in the adult population, (3) acute exposure with a merged concentration dataset in the adult population, and (4) chronic exposure with a merged concentration dataset in the paediatric population. The relative potency factors of each substance were calculated to express their potency relative to flusilazole, which was chosen as the reference compound. The selection of mixtures and the evaluation of exposures for each country were carried out using the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) software. Concerning chronic exposure, one mixture explained the largest proportion of the total variance for each country, while in acute exposure, several mixtures were often involved. The results showed that there were 15 main pesticides in the mixtures, with a high contribution of imazalil and dithiocarbamate. Since the concentrations provided by the different countries were merged in the scenario using merged concentration data, differences between countries result from differences in food consumption behaviours. These results support the approach that using merged concentration data to estimate exposures in Europe seems to be realistic, as foods are traded across European borders. The originality of the proposed approach was to start from a CAG and to integrate information from combined exposures to identify a refined list of mixtures with fewer components. As this approach was sensitive to the input data and required significant resources, efforts should continue regarding data collection and harmonisation among the different aspects within the pesticides regulatory framework, and to develop methods to group substances and mixtures to characterise the risk.",Cytotoxic and antibacterial triterpenoids from the roots of Morinda officinalis var. officinalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579769,Fitoterapia,2019 03 25,"Seven new pentacyclic triterpenoids including six ursane-type, marinoids A-F (1-6), and one oleanane-type, marinoid G (7), along with five known analogues (8-12), were separated from the roots of Morinda officinalis var. officinalis.

The name Pleione flower breaking virus (PlFBV) was suggested for the new virus. The presence of the virus was confirmed using RT-PCR, with newly designed primers targeting this new species.

Intensity normalization is a widely applied technique for reducing the variance of the data for which there are several methods available ranging from uniformity transformation to histogram equalization. The current study analyses the influence of intensity normalization on cerebellum segmentation performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN).",Draxin alters laminin organization during basement membrane remodeling to control cranial neural crest EMT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579765,Developmental biology,2019 05 08,"Premigratory neural crest cells arise within the dorsal neural tube and subsequently undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to leave the neuroepithelium and initiate migration. Draxin is a Wnt modulator that has been shown to control the timing of cranial neural crest EMT. Here we show that this process is accompanied by three stages of remodeling of the basement membrane protein laminin, from regression to expansion and channel formation. Loss of Draxin results in blocking laminin remodeling at the regression stage, whereas ectopic maintenance of Draxin blocks remodeling at the expansion stage. The latter effect is rescued by addition of Snail2, previously shown to be downstream of Draxin. Our results demonstrate an essential function for the Wnt modulator Draxin in regulating basement membrane remodeling during cranial neural crest EMT.",PCP-dependent transcellular regulation of actomyosin oscillation facilitates convergent extension of vertebrate tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579764,Developmental biology,2019 04 15,"Oscillatory flows of actomyosin play a key role in the migration of single cells in culture and in collective cell movements in Drosophila embryos. In vertebrate embryos undergoing convergent extension (CE), the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway drives the elongation of the body axis and shapes the central nervous system, and mutations of the PCP genes predispose humans to various malformations including neural tube defects. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of oscillatory actomyosin contractions during vertebrate CE and how they are controlled by the PCP signaling remain unknown. Here, we address these outstanding issues using a combination of in vivo imaging and mathematical modeling. We find that effective execution of CE requires alternative oscillations of cortical actomyosin across cell membranes of neighboring cells within an optimal frequency range. Intriguingly, temporal and spatial clustering of the core PCP protein Prickle 2 (Pk2) is correlated to submembranous accumulations of F-actin, and depletion of Pk2 perturbs the oscillation of actomyosin contractions. These findings shed light on the significance of temporal regulation of actomyosin contraction by the PCP pathway during CE, in addition to its well-studied spatial aspects.","Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579763,The Lancet.

Here, we examined the age-related change and potential role of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) on EIH in rats. Adult and aged rats were randomly divided into one of three groups; non-exercise control, Low-exercise, and High-exercise. The animals in the Low- and High-exercise groups were subjected to a 10-minute treadmill workout at 40% and 80% maximum oxygen intake intensity, respectively. In the Low-exercise groups, a significant EIH response was observed in aged but not in adult rats. The pre-treatment with ALLO synthesis inhibitor finasteride, but not opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone, inhibited the Low-exercise induced EIH response in aged rats. Furthermore, the Low-exercise increased brain ALLO levels in aged animals compared with controls, which was correlated with the mechanical pain sensitivity. On the other hand, High-exercise could induce EIH response in both adult and aged animals, but it was more effective in adult rats. The pre-treatment with naloxone, but not finasteride, reduced the EIH observed after High-exercise in both adult and aged rats. Our findings demonstrated that effective EIH can be achieved even by mild-intensity exercise in aged animals via an increase of the brain ALLO levels."

However, recent reports suggest that the relationship between androgens and male-typical behaviors is not always linear - when androgen signaling is increased in male rodents, via exogenous androgen exposure or androgen receptor overexpression, males continue to exhibit male-typical sexual behaviors, but their sexual preferences are altered such that their interest in same-sex partners is increased. Analogous to this rodent literature, recent findings indicate that high level androgen exposure may contribute to the sexual orientation of a subset of gay men who prefer insertive anal sex and report more male-typical gender traits, whereas gay men who prefer receptive anal sex, and who on average report more gender nonconformity, present with biomarkers suggestive of low androgen exposure. Together, the evidence indicates that for both mice and men there is an inverted-U curvilinear relationship between androgens and sexual preferences, such that low and high androgen exposure increases androphilic sexual attraction, whereas relative mid-range androgen exposure leads to gynephilic attraction. Future directions for studying how individual differences in biological development mediate sexual behavior and sexual preferences in both mice and humans are discussed.",A unique location of branchial cleft cyst: case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579743,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 10,"Branchial cleft cysts (BCC) are benign lesions caused by anomalous development of the branchial apparatus.

Using the Manitoba Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Database, we identified adults not receiving dialysis with available serum creatinine measurements and bone densitometry within 1 year. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Incident major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures were ascertained from population-based health care databases. The performance of FRAX, derived without and with BMD, was studied in relation to CKD stage. Among 10,099 subjects (mean age 64 ± 13 years, 13.0% male), 2,154 had eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stage 3) and 590 had eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stages 4-5). During a 5-year observation period, 772 individuals experienced a major osteoporotic fracture and 226 had a hip fracture. FRAX predicted risk for major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture in all eGFR strata. For every standard deviation increase in FRAX score derived with BMD, the hazard ratio (HR) for hip fracture was 4.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.57-5.77) in individuals with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2, 4.52 (95% CI 3.15-6.49) in individuals with eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73m2, and 3.10 (95% CI 1.80-5.33) in individuals with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2. The relationship between FRAX and major osteoporotic fracture was stronger in those with CKD compared to those with preserved eGFR. These findings support the use of FRAX to risk stratify patients with non-dialysis CKD for major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures.",Mechanical advantage of preserving the hamstring tibial insertion for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction - A cadaver study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579723,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR",2019 01 28,"The best fixation method for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft is debated.

The considered outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures were generated from systematic literature reviews. Feedback was sought from patients and health professionals. Patients with very high-risk CKD (stages G3a/A3 and G3b/A2-G5, including dialysis, kidney transplantation, and conservative care) were selected as the target population. Using an online modified Delphi process, outcomes important to all patients were selected, such as survival and hospitalization, and to treatment-specific subgroups, such as vascular access survival and kidney allograft survival. Patient-reported outcome measures were included to capture domains of health-related quality of life, which were rated as the most important outcomes by patients. Demographic and clinical variables were identified to be used as case-mix adjusters. Use of these consensus recommendations could enable institutions to monitor, compare, and improve the quality of their CKD care."

The distribution of these conserved non-coding elements (CNE) within and across genomes has suggested that many of them may have roles as transcriptional regulatory elements. A combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches can be used to identify CNEs with regulatory activity in phylogenetically distant species. Nevertheless, the high divergent rate of genomic sequences of several organisms, such as tunicates, complicates the characterization of these conserved elements and very few examples really may prove their functional activity. We used a comparative approach to facilitate the identification of CNEs among distantly related or highly divergent species and experimentally demonstrated the functional significance of these novel CNEs. We first experimentally tested, in C. robusta and D. rerio transgenic embryos, the regulatory activity of conserved elements associated to genes involved in developmental control among different chordates (Homo sapiens and Danio rerio for vertebrates, Ciona robusta and Ciona savignyi for tunicates and Branchiostoma floridae for cephalochordates). Once demonstrated the cross-species functional conservation of these CNEs, the same gene loci were used as references to locate homologous regions and possible CNEs in available tunicate genomes. Comparison of tunicate-specific and chordate-specific CNEs revealed absence of conservation of the regulatory elements in spite of conservation of regulatory patterns, likely due to evolutionary specification of the respective developmental networks. This result highlights the importance of an integrative in-silico/in-vivo approach to CNEs investigation, encompassing both bioinformatics, essential for putative CNEs identification, and laboratory experiments, pivotal for the understanding of CNEs functionality.",Post-transplantation laryngeal actinomycosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579693,"Auris, nasus, larynx",2018 12 23,"A case of laryngeal actinomycosis occurred after bone marrow transplantation was reported.

As CT image demonstrated that the mass was localized at the arytenoid region with central low-density area surrounded by granulation tissue, we underwent biopsy under local anesthesia. Excision of the mass proved it to be a soft granulation including sulfur granules. Oral administration of amoxicillin 750mg per day was initiated as a postoperative medication.

To increase the surface area, polyethylene glycol was introduced into the material formulation as pore forming agent. The influence of photoinitiator (Omnirad 819) and photoabsorber (Reactive Orange 16, RO16) concentration was investigated in order to optimize printing resolution, allowing to reliably 3D print features as small as 200 μm and of highly complex Schoen Gyroids. Protein binding was measured on AEX adsorbers with a range of ligand densities (0.00, 2.03, 2.60 and 3.18 mmol/mL) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and c-phycocyanin (CPC) as model proteins. The highest equilibrium binding capacity was found for the material presenting the lowest ligand density analysed (2.03 mmol/mL), adsorbing 73.7 ± 5.9 mg/mL and 38.0 ± 2.2 mg/mL of BSA and CPC, respectively. This novel 3D printed material displayed binding capacities in par or even higher than commercially available chromatographic resins. We expect that the herein presented approach of using bifunctional monomers, bearing commonly used chromatography ligands, will help overcome the material limitations currently refraining 3D printing applications in separation sciences.",Development of a new particulate 4-μm adsorbent layer for ultrathin-layer chromatography (miniaturized chromatogram).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579642,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 03 04,"The performance of particulate layers of a smaller particle size than given HPTLC plates was investigated. However, reducing the particle size and thus interporous space, the capillary flow is substantially reduced. For the first time, optimizations led to the successful use of a layer made of mainly 4-μm irregular silica gel particles as stationary phase in planar chromatography. Layer thicknesses of 50 and 70 μm were studied to suit especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC). Along with it, the chromatographic fingerprint was miniaturized by 75%. The required development time and developing distance were reduced up to 50%. A typical 35-mm separation took less than 10 min. The limit of detection was improved by a factor of up to 3. Further chromatographic performance data, such as separation number (peak capacity), resolution and analytical response proved the suitability of the particulate UTLC layer. A direct transferability and miniaturization of established HPTLC methods to the UTLC dimension was aimed at. This was successfully demonstrated for eight quite different separations, i.e. food dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, steviol glycosides in cough drops and sweetener tablets, preservatives in shrimp-surimi salad, gingerol in ginger-containing products, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in honey, tanshinones in Salvia miltiorriza extracts and monacolin K in fermented red rice food supplements. The direct method transfer, mainstream usability and fast analyses at low running costs are crucial features of the developed UTLC plate. Profiting from such advantages, the miniaturized fingerprint shows potential to shift the field of HPTLC towards UTLC. Nevertheless, the full separation potential will first be exploited with tailored, miniaturized instrumentation capable to operate with the reduced layer thickness and UTLC format.",Effect of nature of electrolytes on retention and selectivity in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579641,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 02 15,"This work investigates the selectivity and retention changes on four classes of HILIC columns upon addition of 1-20 mM electrolyte. The effect of four electrolytes (Na+Cl-, Na+ClO4-, Na+PF6-, and Na+CF3CO2-) were tested on neutral, cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic analytes under HILIC conditions (70-90% ACN). These electrolytes alter the retention and selectivity on silica, zwitterionic and diol columns through ion exchange and ionic screening mechanisms. Neutral analytes were unaffected by addition of 1-20 mM electrolyte, indicating minimal change to the retentivity of the water layer. Cationic and anionic analytes increase and decrease in retention, respectively (Na+PF6- ≈ Na+ClO4- > Na+CF3CO2- > Na+Cl-). Chaotropic electrolytes accumulate at the mobile phase/water layer interface, enhancing the ion exchange and ionic screening effects of the mobile phase electrolyte. Altering the buffer cation (Li+, Na+, K+) caused small but statistically significant changes in retention.",Study on the adsorption behavior of glycerin from fatty acid methyl esters by a tertiary amine-type anion exchange resin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579640,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 03 06,"A weakly basic anion exchange resin with hydroxylated tertiary amine groups was successfully synthesized and used for the first time in an adsorption study for glycerin in fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A kinetic study of glycerin adsorption on the resin demonstrated that the resin exhibited a rapid initial adsorption behavior, and the correlation coefficients (r22) of the pseudo-second order reaction model were all greater than 0.98, which indicated the existence of hydrogen bonds through sharing electrons between glycerin and active sites on the resin. The whole process of glycerin adsorption onto the resin was a combination mechanism involving hydrogen bond sorption and intraparticle diffusion. The thermodynamic experiments showed that the glycerin adsorption onto the resin was a spontaneous exothermic process accompanied with a gradual decrease in entropy. In addition to intraparticle diffusion, the adsorption behaviors of the resin for glycerin also involved hydrogen bond forces between the OH in the glycerin molecule and N atom in the N(CH3)2 group, glycerin intermolecular hydrogen bond attraction, the dipole bond forces between glycerin and the N(CH3)2 group (90.96%) in the resin, and the dipole bond forces between glycerin and several of the N(CH3)3+ groups (9.04%) in the resin.","A multi-analytical platform based on pressurized-liquid extraction, in vitro assays and liquid chromatography/gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry for food by-products valorisation. Part 2: Characterization of bioactive compounds from goldenberry (Physalis peruviana L.) calyx extracts using hyphenated techniques.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579639,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 02 15,"A multi-analytical strategy for the valorisation of goldenberry calyx, a promising source of health-promoting compounds, is presented in this work. A comprehensive characterization of P. peruviana calyx extracts, obtained by an optimized pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) procedure, is developed applying first an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-q-TOF-MS/MS) method in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. A total of fifty-six phytochemicals, including major phenolic components, several withanolides (C28-isoprenoids) with a variety of biological activities, and a large family of anti-inflammatory sucrose esters were tentatively identified using this methodology. An integrated identification strategy based on accurate mass data obtained by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), ion source fragmentation, MS/MS fragmentation patterns, generated molecular formulae and subsequent unsaturation degree calculation, along with database and bibliographic search is proposed. Isobaric withanolides-type compounds were tentatively identified or classified according to their different hydroxy and epoxy positions, on the basis of the complementary information provided by MS/MS product ion spectra obtained in both ESI+ and ESI- mode. The proposed structural elucidation approach provides a valuable contribution to the limited information available regarding the MS/MS structural analysis of withanolides in ESI(-) mode. Moreover, an alternative elucidation strategy based on deconvolution and database search was successfully applied for the phytochemical profiling analysis of the volatile fraction of P. peruviana calyx extracts by gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-q-TOF-MS), which reveals the presence of relevant terpenoids, including phytosterols and tocopherols (Vitamin E). The results of the phytochemical characterization obtained herein demonstrates the great potential of applying integrated identification strategies to HRMS data obtained from complementary LC- and GC-q-TOF-MS(/MS) platforms, as powerful identification tools for improving our understanding on the phytochemical composition of natural extracts intended to be used in functional foods or in traditional medicine preparations.",Theoretical and experimental approach to hydrophilic interaction dispersive solid-phase extraction of 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid from human post-mortem blood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579638,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 02 25,"In this paper, we proposed an innovative hydrophilic interaction dispersive solid-phase extraction (HI-d-SPE) protocol suitable for the isolation of the potential cyanide intoxication marker, 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA), from such complicated matrix as post-mortem blood. To create an optimal HI-d-SPE protocol, two sorbents were used: a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and commercially available Oasis-MCX®. The latter sorbent was identified as more recovery-efficient with higher clean-up abilities in a carefully optimized process. Computational analysis was employed to provide insight into the adsorption mechanism of the two selected sorbents. The theoretical results were in agreement with the experiment regarding the efficiency of the sorbent. HI-d-SPE was successfully applied to the analysis of ATCA in 20 post-mortem blood samples using LC-MS/MS. The analytical performance of the method was finally compared to prior existing methods, in turn revealing its superiority.",A simple and highly-available microextraction of benzoic and sorbic acids in beverages and soy sauce samples for high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579637,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 04 17,"A simple and highly-available air-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure with organic phase solidiﬁcation (AA-DLLME-OPS) was developed as new approach for pretreatment of complex sample matrix. Menthol was investigated as novel extractant for the AA-DLLME-OPS. In this procedure, a cloudy solution of ﬁne molten menthol droplets is formed when a mixture of molten menthol and aqueous sample is rapidly aspirated into a dispenser and injected into an extraction vial. In the AA-DLLME-OPS, air bubbles promote molten menthol dispersion into aqueous sample phase. Finally, the obtained mixture is cooled and menthol phase is solidified because of the low melting point, which facilitates collection for analysis. To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested approach, the AA-DLLME-OPS procedure was applied for the HPLC-UV determination of benzoic and sorbic acids as proof-of-concept analytes in beverages and soy sauce samples. The procedure developed provides microextraction of benzoic and sorbic acids from samples with recovery from 93 to 105% and from 96 to 101%, respectively. Under optimal experimental conditions the linear detection ranges were found to be 0.1-150 mg L-1 for benzoic acid and 0.05-100 mg L-1 for sorbic acid with LODs calculated from a blank test, based on 3σ, 0.03 mg L-1 and 0.02 mg L-1, respectively.",Prediction uncertainty assessment of chromatography models using Bayesian inference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579636,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 03 04,"Mechanistic modeling of chromatography has been around in academia for decades and has gained increased support in pharmaceutical companies in recent years. Despite the large number of published successful applications, process development in the pharmaceutical industry today still does not fully benefit from a systematic mechanistic model-based approach. The hesitation on the part of industry to systematically apply mechanistic models can often be attributed to the absence of a general approach for determining if a model is qualified to support decision making in process development. In this work a Bayesian framework for the calibration and quality assessment of mechanistic chromatography models is introduced. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to assess parameter uncertainty by generating samples from the parameter posterior distribution. Once the parameter posterior distribution has been estimated, it can be used to propagate the parameter uncertainty to model predictions, allowing a prediction-based uncertainty assessment of the model. The benefit of this uncertainty assessment is demonstrated using the example of a mechanistic model describing the separation of an antibody from its impurities on a strong cation exchanger. The mechanistic model was calibrated at moderate column load density and used to make extrapolations at high load conditions. Using the Bayesian framework, it could be shown that despite significant parameter uncertainty, the model can extrapolate beyond observed process conditions with high accuracy and is qualified to support process development."

The article then summarizes recent studies that document adverse moral consequences of ED crowding, including poorer patient outcomes; increased medical errors; compromises in patient physical privacy, confidentiality, and communication; and provider moral distress. It describes several organizational strategies implemented to relieve crowding and implications of ED crowding for individual practitioners.

More specifically, we are interested in the intentionality attributed to the actions and decisions taken by political leaders - whether they are perceived as designed to benefit the politician's own interests, or the interests of the public. In two field studies, we show that the political orientation of constituents plays a central role in driving constituents' judgments about political leaders and their actions (in terms of beneficiary attributions), reflecting an identity-motivated reasoning process. Political leaders of the ingroup are perceived more favorably than political leaders of the outgroup, in terms of trust and a desire to see that leader represent the country in the international arena. More interestingly, constituents are likely to attribute the actions of ingroup leaders as intended to benefit the country (national interests), and the actions of outgroup leaders as intended to benefit the political leaders themselves (egoistic interests).","Universal health coverage in Indonesia: concept, progress, and challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579611,"Lancet (London, England)",2019 01 14,"Indonesia is a rapidly growing middle-income country with 262 million inhabitants from more than 300 ethnic and 730 language groups spread over 17 744 islands, and presents unique challenges for health systems and universal health coverage (UHC). From 1960 to 2001, the centralised health system of Indonesia made gains as medical care infrastructure grew from virtually no primary health centres to 20 900 centres. Life expectancy improved from 48 to 69 years, infant mortality decreased from 76 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 23 per 1000, and the total fertility rate decreased from 5·61 to 2·11. However, gains across the country were starkly uneven with major health gaps, such as the stagnant maternal mortality of around 300 deaths per 100 000 livebirths, and minimal change in neonatal mortality. The centralised one size fits all approach did not address the complexity and diversity in population density and dispersion across islands, diets, diseases, local living styles, health beliefs, human development, and community participation. Decentralisation of governance to 354 districts in 2001, and currently 514 districts, further increased health system heterogeneity and exacerbated equity gaps. The novel UHC system introduced in 2014 focused on accommodating diversity with flexible and adaptive implementation features and quick evidence-driven decisions based on changing needs. The UHC system grew rapidly and covers 203 million people, the largest single-payer scheme in the world, and has improved health equity and service access. With early success, challenges have emerged, such as the so-called missing-middle group, a term used to designate the smaller number of people who have enrolled in UHC in wealth quintiles Q2-Q3 than in other quintiles, and the low UHC coverage of children from birth to age 4 years. Moreover, high costs for non-communicable diseases warrant new features for prevention and promotion of healthy lifestyles, and investment in a robust integrated digital health-information system for front-line health workers is crucial for impact and sustainability.

Currently, the most successful de novo methods for RNA secondary structure prediction are based on free energy minimization. Existing free energy minimization methods focus more on building energy calculation models and optimizing energy parameters while paying less effort on developing structure space search algorithm. This study proposes a de novo method, namely DPARSS, for RNA secondary structure prediction. DPARSS proposes a novel dynamic programming algorithm for structure space search and intends to generate predictions with minimal free energy. An evaluation on a benchmark dataset consisting of tRNAs indicates that the DPARSS method achieves better predictive performance than existing free energy minimization methods. Additionally, case studies suggest that the improvement achieved by the DPARSS algorithm is likely due to the fact that the predictions generated by DPARSS algorithm form more base pairs, contain less mismatches and form longer base pair segments.","Azepine derivative T4FAT, a new copper chelator, inhibits tyrosinase.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579605,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 04,"Melanin plays an important role in the protection of the skin from ultraviolet irradiation. However, excessive melanin deposition leads to hyperpigmentation and freckles, which are recognized as skin problems, and signs of aging. Tyrosinase, a copper-containing protein, is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis and first catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the further oxidization to dopaquinone. To assist the proper regulation of melanin production, we screened compounds and found that 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-furo[3,2-c]azepine-4-thione (T4FAT), a thioamide derivative, inhibited melanogenesis in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. T4FAT was not toxic to cells and was stable in water; in addition, it inhibited the activity of tyrosinase derived from mushroom and B16F10 cells in a non-competitive manner. T4FAT downregulated tyrosinase protein expression in B16F10 cells without affecting mRNA expression. As copper binding to the tyrosinase protein is required for both enzymatic activity, correct folding, and maturation, we examined the metal-chelating activities of T4FAT. Equimolar amount of T4FAT resulted in almost complete chelation of copper ions. The thioamide group of T4FAT is essential for copper chelation and tyrosinase inhibition, which subsequently resulted in melanogenesis inhibition in B16F10 cells. Although T4FAT has similar in vitro properties to kojic acid, which is also a copper chelator and approved as a component of cosmetic formulations, T4FAT inhibited melanogenesis in B16F10 cells 30 times more efficiently than kojic acid. These results suggested that T4FAT, a novel copper chelator, may be helpful for the development of new cosmetics for skin whitening.",Endoplasmic reticulum stress is induced in growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes in G610C mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579604,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 12,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary bone disorder most commonly caused by autosomal dominant mutations in genes encoding type I collagen. In addition to bone fragility, patients suffer from impaired longitudinal bone growth. It has been demonstrated that in OI, an accumulation of mutated type I collagen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces ER stress in osteoblasts, causing osteoblast dysfunction leading to bone fragility. We hypothesize that ER stress is also induced in the growth plate where bone growth is initiated, and examined a mouse model of dominant OI that carries a G610C mutation in the procollagen α2 chain. The results demonstrated that G610C OI mice had significantly shorter long bones with growth plate abnormalities including elongated total height and hypertrophic zone. Moreover, we found that mature hypertrophic chondrocytes expressed type I collagen and ER dilation was more pronounced compared to wild type littermates. The results from in vitro chondrocyte cultures demonstrated that the maturation of G610C OI hypertrophic chondrocytes was significantly suppressed and ER stress related genes were upregulated. Given that the alteration of hypertrophic chondrocyte activity often causes dwarfism, our findings suggest that hypertrophic chondrocyte dysfunction induced by ER stress may be an underlying cause of growth deficiency in G610C OI mice.",HEF1 regulates differentiation through the Wnt5a/β-catenin signaling pathway in human gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579603,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 04,"The human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1) is a multi-domain docking protein of the p130 Cas family. Research reports on the mechanism of HEF1 in gastric cancer (GC) differentiation are limited. In this study, we reveal that HEF1 plays an essential role in regulating of differentiation in human GC. HEF1 was found to be highly expressed in GC tissues. Besides, In GC tissues or cells, cellular level of HEF1 negatively correlated with tumor differentiation. In addition, we showed that upregulation of HEF1 increased Wnt5a expression and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, thereby resulting in poor differentiation in GC. Notably, GC patients with a higher expression of HEF1 showed significantly poorer disease-free and overall survival. Thus, our findings suggest that HEF1 reduces differentiation through the Wnt5a/β-catenin signaling pathway and that HEF1 is an independent unfavorable prognostic death factor in GC.","Serum tumor-associated glycoprotein 72, a helpful predictor of lymph nodes invasion in esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579602,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 04,"Disruption of cell-cell junction and adhesion to vessels are crucial steps in tumor metastasis. Tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) is a crucial membrane mucin in gastroesophageal mucosa for microenvironment contact with cells. Thus, the TAG-72 value may be an indicator of the malignant involvement of lymph nodes in esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGAC) patients. Of the 183 patients suspected as gastroesophageal neoplasms, 129 were subsequently diagnosed as EGAC, and 54 were subsequently diagnosed as benign gastroesophageal diseases by imageological or/and histological examination. After we obtained preoperative serum TAG-72 values, the relationship between serum TAG-72 and lymphatic metastasis status, extent of invaded lymph nodes and clinical stage was tested using Spearman correlation analysis and χ2 tests. Compared with those in patients who suffered either benign gastroesophageal diseases or preinvasive carcinoma, the median serum TAG-72 values were statistically higher in EGAC patients with positive lymph nodes (Kruskal-Wallis test; P < 0.001). Serum TAG-72 values were significantly correlated with Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) (Spearman correlation; P < 0.001). Using corresponding ROC (95% CI = 0.621-0.783, P < 0.0001), serum TAG-72 values with an optimal cut-off (2.2 kU/mL) showed a sensitivity of 0.632 and a specificity of 0.690 for predicting malignant lymph node involvement in EGAC.

As a pivotal proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17A exerts a protective effect on the survival and function of HCC cells. It is widely accepted that IL-17A plays an important role in regulating autophagy. Bcl2, a key molecule promoting the survival of HCC cells, also plays an indispensable role as an autophagy regulator. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Bcl2 in IL-17A-regulated autophagy of HCC cells. The results showed that IL-17A not only inhibited autophagic activity, but also increased Bcl2 levels in HCC cells under starvation. Besides, IL-17A could prevent the dissociation of autophagy protein Beclin1 from Bcl2-Beclin1 complex upon starvation. Overexpression of Beclin1 rescued the autophagy deficiency of HCC cells in presence of IL-17A. Moreover, RNAi-induced Bcl2 silencing impaired the function of IL-17A in inhibiting the activation of autophagy, subsequently reducing the viability and migration of HCC cells, while the inhibition of Beclin1 by spautin-1 could reduce autophagic activity to a certain degree, thus restoring the viability and migration of HCC cells. In summary, it was suggested that the inhibition of Bcl2 degradation may be an important mechanism by which IL-17A inhibits autophagy response, subsequently maintaining the survival in HCC cells."

The current study presents a method for predicting the GRFs in level and incline/decline walking that may be used in various outdoor biomechanics studies geared towards the above applications. The method was developed to predict the complete set of GRFs at walking inclinations of 0°, ±5°, ±10°, ±15°, and ±20°. Plantar pressure insoles were used to obtain inclination-specific, linear regression models based on three periods of gait stance phase, and the model-determined GRFs were compared with those measured from a forceplate. The three periods were determined based on the observed shifting of load-bearing insole sensors from heel to forefoot during walking, i.e., heel-strike, midstance, and toe-off. Six subjects wearing minimalist shoes fitted with plantar pressure insoles containing 99 pressure sensors performed ten walking trials at each of the aforementioned inclinations on an adjustable ramp with an embedded forceplate. Data from contact of the instrumented shoes with the forceplate were used to create linear regressions to transform insole pressure data into a complete set of GRFs. The root mean square error (RMSE) over peak recorded values were on average 10%, 3%, 21% for level walking and 11%, 4%, 23% for ramp walking in the respective anteroposterior, vertical, and mediolateral directions. The multistage linear regression model developed in the current study may be an acceptable option for estimating GRFs during walking in various environments without the restraint of a forceplate.",Effect of stochastic resonance on proprioception and kinesthesia in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579577,Journal of biomechanics,2019 02 04,"Low amplitude mechanical noise vibration has been shown to improve somatosensory acuity in various clinical groups with comparable deficiencies through a phenomenon known as Stochastic Resonance (SR). This technology showed promising outcomes in improving somatosensory acuity in other clinical patients (e.g., Parkinson's disease and osteoarthritis). Some degree of chronic somatosensory deficiency in the knee has been reported following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. In this study, the effect of the SR phenomenon on improving knee somatosensory acuity (proprioception and kinesthesia) in female ACL reconstructed (ACLR) participants (n = 19) was tested at three months post-surgery, and the results were compared to healthy controls (n = 28). Proprioception was quantified by the measure of joint position sense (JPS) and kinesthesia with the threshold to detection of passive movement (TDPM). The results based on the statistical analysis demonstrated an overall difference between the somatosensory acuity in the ACLR limb compared to healthy controls (p = 0.007). A larger TDPM was observed in the ACLR limb compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.002). However, the JPS between the ACLR and healthy limbs were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.365). SR significantly improved JPS (p = 0.006) while the effect was more pronounced in the ACLR cohort. The effect on the TDPM did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.681) in either group. In conclusion, deficient kinesthesia in the ACLR limb was observed at three months post-surgery. Also, the positive effects of SR on somatosensory acuity in the ACL reconstructed group warrant further investigation into the use of this phenomenon to improve proprioception in ACLR and healthy groups.",Comparison of platelet activation through hinge vs bulk flow in bileaflet mechanical heart valves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579576,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 02,"Bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs) are prone to thromboembolic complications which are believed to be initiated by platelet activation. Platelets are activated by non-physiologic shear stresses in the bulk flow or the leakage/hinge flow, whose contributions has yet to be quantified. Here, the contribution of bulk and hinge flows to the activation of platelets in BMHVs is quantified for the first time by performing simulations of the flow through a BMHV and resolving the hinge by overset grids (one grid for the bulk flow and two for the hinge regions coupled together using one-way and two-way interpolation). It was found that two-way coupling is essential to obtain correct hinge flow features. The platelet activation through the hinge for two gap sizes (250 and 150 μm) is compared to the activation in the bulk flow using two platelet activation models to ensure the consistency of the observed trends. The larger gap has a higher total activation, but a better washout ability due to higher velocities. The maximum shear stress observed in the bulk flow (∼320dyne/cm2) is much smaller than the hinge (∼1000dyne/cm2). However, the total activation by the bulk flow is found to be several folds higher than by the hinge/leakage flow. This is mainly due to the higher flow rate of the bulk flow which exposes much more platelets to shear stress than the leakage flow."

Heart failure admissions in patients with ACHD continue to rise at both pediatric and adult care facilities. Data from the Pediatric Health Information Systems database (2005 to 2015) were used to identify patients (≥18 years) admitted with congenital heart disease (745.xx-747.xx) and principal diagnosis of heart failure (428.xx). High resource use (HRU) admissions were defined as those over the 90th percentile. There were 562 admissions (55.9% male) across 39 pediatric hospitals. ACHD-related heart failure admissions increased from 4.1% in 2006 to 6.3% in 2015 (p = 0.015). Median hospital charge for ACHD-related heart failure admissions was $59,055 [IQR $26,633 to $156,846]. Total charges increased with more complex anatomic category (p = 0.049). Though HRU admissions represented 10% of ACHD-related heart failure admissions, they accounted for >66% of the total charges. The median total hospital charges for HRU admissions were $1,018,656 [IQR $722,574 to $1,784,743], compared with $58,890 [IQR $26,456 to $145,890] for non-HRU admissions (p < 0.001).

Although theories are suggested, the mechanism is unknown. Only indirect measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP) have been performed in spaceflight. Direct determination of in-flight ICP is crucial to understanding VIIP. Current ""gold standard"" is lumbar puncture (LP). The only direct evaluation has occurred with postflight LP. In-flight measurements would allow correlation of opening pressures/possible contributing factors. The only imaging modality on the International Space Station (ISS) is ultrasound. With appropriate methodology, remotely guided ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture (USGLP) may allow safe performance in flight. Therefore, we sought to develop a novel ultrasound approach for definitive placement of an LP needle, and to show this can be achieved with remote guidance by those without training.METHODS: Literature review and round-table discussions with multiple medical fields was performed. Volunteers were scanned with ultrasound for optimizing technique. A cadaver was used to perform this technique by a radiologist, then taught to volunteers not experienced in image guided procedures, and finally was repeated multiple times by volunteers with simulated remote guidance.RESULTS: Optimal visualization was in the fetal and seated exaggerated kyphotic [corrected] positions. Technical success was achieved by the radiologist in all attempts and achieved in 9 of 11 attempts by the trainees.DISCUSSION: Given ultrasound experience at NASA and the ability to educate non-image-guided trained personnel, these could make this technique feasible and aid in direct in-flight measurements to further research VIIP.Lerner DJ, Chima RS, Patel K, Parmet AJ.

History and clinical profile did not suggest any traumatic, hematologic, or vasculitic etiology. His inflammatory markers, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, complement levels, and whole-body PET scan did not suggest any evidence of vasculitis. Presence of any other intracranial aneurysms was also ruled out. He underwent curative excision biopsy, which showed perivascular inflammation. He was diagnosed as a case of left superficial temporal artery aneurysm. The recovery period was uneventful and the follow-up color Doppler flow imaging of the temporal artery and acute phase reactants was normal.DISCUSSION: Spontaneous aneurysms involving the superficial temporal artery is a very rare diagnosis. Occurrence of such an aneurysm in a young pilot without any identifiable predisposing factors led the authors to hypothesize a possible etiological combination of environmental and mechanical factors along with aviation stresses with the likely compounding role of the helmet.

Several factors, including reversed shift missions, can negatively affect sleep patterns and increase the risk of fatigue due to sleep restriction. Currently, there is a lack of objective data regarding the current rest and activity patterns of military aviators across multiple operational conditions. The purpose of this descriptive study was to document the rest and activity patterns of U.S. Army aviators in operational training and garrison (routine) environments using wrist-worn actigraphy devices.METHODS: Actigraphy data were collected from U.S. Army aviators in training (N = 20) and garrison (N = 77) environments for a period of 1 wk.RESULTS: Results from this study indicate that 90% of subjects in the training environment, even after accounting for small sleep bouts during the day, averaged less than the recommended 8 h of sleep daily across the recording week. Approximately half of subjects in garrison averaged less than 8 h of sleep daily after accounting for smaller sleep bouts. Sleep efficiency was relatively high and similar in both groups (∼84%). Subjects in the training group averaged significantly more time awake and less time sleeping than those in the routine garrison group. Moreover, subjects in training were exposed to more light during sleep than those in garrison.DISCUSSION: Training environments that are representative of deployed conditions restrict aviator restorative sleep.

These effects correlate with changes in lab test results, including urea and bone minerals. Difficulties with collecting blood and urine during space missions limit the available data. This pilot study investigated metabolic changes during a space mission using untimed spot samples of urine and saliva. Untimed spot urine was used for urinalysis with data normalization per creatinine concentration. Saliva was proven useful as an index of serum urea and phosphorus.METHODS: Two astronauts collected urine and saliva samples 75 ± 5 d before launch (baseline) and 3-5 times during a 6-mo space mission. Samples were collected 3 h after morning breakfast. Urine was collected using a standard NASA device. Saliva was collected using a Salivette™ synthetic swab. Samples were kept frozen using automated biochemistry until lab work-up. Anthropometric data were collected at baseline and after the mission.RESULTS: For astronauts 1 and 2, respectively, total bone mineral density decreased (-1.4% and -0.9%). In-flight changes were as follows: transiently decreased urine urea/creatinine ratio (-32% and -24%), transiently decreased urine phosphorus/creatinine ratio (-52% and -30%), increased urine calcium/creatinine ratio (up to +116% and +27%), and transient increases in saliva urea (up to +48% and +195%) and phosphorus (up to +29% and +46%). The astronaut with greater changes in urine minerals had greater reduction in bone mineral density.DISCUSSION: The results support the hypothesis that untimed samples of urine and saliva are useful for investigation of metabolic changes during space missions.

Aircrew with immune-active hepatitis are unfit for flying duties due to the risk of acute hepatic decompensation; those who have begun on treatment are generally also disqualified from flying duties due to the potential side effects of antiviral treatment. As treatment endpoints for nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are typically achieved after prolonged therapy, aircrew treated for CHB may be subjected to an extended period of flying restriction.METHODS: We present a retrospective case series of seven aircrew who were returned to flying duties while on varying combinations of NUC for the treatment of CHB. All seven aircrew were comanaged by the flight surgeon and hepatologist, reviewed by a panel of flight surgeons, and had achieved normalized liver function tests prior to resumption of flying duties; two out of the seven aircrew had detectable serum Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA when reinstated back to flying duties. Only one aircrew member experienced side effects from the NUC treatment. This was promptly evaluated and managed prior to resumption of flying duties to ensure flight safety.DISCUSSION: Aircrew with CHB infection can be safely allowed back to flying duties, especially when their conditions have been well controlled via treatment with any of the NUC regimes.

We conducted this study to analyze the psychophysiological response of soldiers in two different high intensity interval training protocols (HIIT), resisted (RHIIT) and endurance (EHIIT), in order to determine which HIIT elicits a psychophysiological response similar to that in actual theaters of operation.METHODS: We recruited 21 professional soldiers from the Spanish Army. HIIT protocols were conducted in accordance with actual military scenarios, performed at 36-38°C.RESULTS: Both protocols, RHIIT and EHIIT, produced a significant increase in blood lactate (1.6 ± 0.3 to 6.4 ± 4.8 and 1.7 ± 0.6 to 11.2 ± 5.0, respectively), rate of perceived exertion, heart rate, and lower limb explosive strength; skin temperature and bodyweight presented significant decreases. Only EHIIT presented a significant increase on cortical arousal (35.9 ± 2.1 to 37.3 ± 2.8) and isometric hand-grip strength, achieving similar psychophysiological response as in previous simulated combat studies.DISCUSSION: Both endurance and resisted high interval intensity training protocols produced a significant increase in the psychophysiological response of soldiers. EHIIT presented more similarities with actual combat situations.Tornero-Aguilera JG, Clemente-Suárez VJ. Resisted and endurance high intensity interval training for combat preparedness.

Results obtained with various large correlation-consistent basis sets are compared at the vibrationally averaged bond length r0 in the ground state. Results over the full range of r values are presented at the CISD/d-aug-cc-pV6Z level for all of the independent components of the property tensors. In general, our values agree well with previous ab initio results of high accuracy for the ranges of H-H distances that have been treated in common. To our knowledge, for H2 in the ground state, our results are the first to be reported in the literature for Φ for r > 7.0 a.u., γ and B for r > 6.0 a.u., and C and E for any H-H separation outside a narrow range around the potential minimum. Quantum Monte Carlo values of Θ have been given previously for H-H distances out to 10.0 a.u., but the statistical error is relatively large for r > 7.0 a.u. At the larger r values in this work, αxx and αzz show the expected functional forms, to leading order in r-1. As r increases further, Θ and Φ vanish, while α, γ, and the components of B converge to twice the isolated-atom values. Components of C and E diverge as r increases.

We adopt the analytically solvable random phase approximation and show that this theory predicts reasonably well the structure of the fluid-in comparison with exact Monte Carlo results-within a unique parameterization of the direct correlation function inside the hard core of particles. In particular, the theory follows correctly the development, in the structure factor, of a local peak at low wavevectors, as peculiarly associated with the onset of aggregation. We then model the direct correlation function in the same wavevector regime by a Gaussian function, so as to systematically investigate, in a ""reverse"" scheme, how varying the properties of the local peak modifies the original underlying competing interaction. We show that large variations in the height of the peak are generally associated with comparatively smaller variations in the height of the microscopic repulsive barrier; moreover, the shrinking and shifting towards lower wavevectors of the peak may be interpreted in terms of the displacement of the barrier, producing a substantial enlargement of the range of both the attractive and repulsive contributions to the interaction potential. Finally, we document the way the repulsive barrier tends to vanish as the two-Yukawa fluid approaches a ""simple fluid"" behavior, heralding the onset of a liquid-vapor phase separation.",Quantumness in light harvesting is determined by vibrational dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579316,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 07,"We demonstrate for the multi-level spin-boson (MLSB) Hamiltonian, typically used to describe biological light-harvesting, that the distinction between quantum and classical dynamics is determined entirely by the thermal environment. In particular, any MLSB model featuring classical interactions with a classical bath is exactly equivalent in its absorption and energy transfer dynamics to a classical model involving coupled harmonic oscillators. This result holds in the linear response regime for both pulsed and incoherent excitation. In the biological context, this finding highlights the centrality of vibrational dynamics in determining the ""quantumness"" of photosynthetic light-harvesting, particularly in the creation of the photosynthetic energy funnel where excitation energy concentrates near the reaction center via a series of downhill energy transfer events. These findings support the idea that this energy funnel is exclusively quantum-mechanical in origin, although it need not rely on entanglement.",Non-orthogonal determinants in multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions for fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579315,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"The accuracy and efficiency of ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms benefit greatly from compact variational trial wave functions that accurately reproduce ground state properties of a system. We investigate the possibility of using multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions with non-orthogonal determinants by optimizing identical single particle orbitals independently in separate determinants. As a test case, we compute variational and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) energies of a C2 molecule. For a given multi-determinant expansion, we find that this non-orthogonal orbital optimization results in a consistent improvement in the variational energy and the FN-DMC energy on the order of a few tenths of an eV. In some cases, fewer non-orthogonal determinants are required compared to orthogonal ones in order to achieve similar accuracy in FN-DMC.

The donor and acceptor units are joined by a thiophene linkage. We have substituted the 5,5'-positions of the isoindigo acceptor unit with different +I groups, viz., -CH3, -NH2, -SH, -OH, -OCH3, and -CH=CH2, and -I groups, viz., -F, -NO2, -CN, -COCH3, -COOH, and -CF3. We have studied the structural, charge injection, and transport properties employing the density functional theory (DFT) formalism. Our study explores that the presence of bulky substituents adversely affects these properties. Values of frontier orbital energies, ionization potentials, and electron affinities are calculated for each compound to predict the ease of charge injection from metal electrodes to these compounds. Most of our compounds show the ease of hole injection ability and show a large electron injection barrier. Computation of reorganization energies followed by the charge transfer integral and charge transfer rate have also been performed. Our findings reveal that compounds substituted with +I groups possess larger hole mobilities than the compounds with -I groups. Substitution of a dimer of compound 9 with -NO2 leads to the highest hole and electron mobility. Dipole moment values have also been calculated to study the charge transport properties. We have also computed the absorption properties of the compounds using the time-dependent DFT method. Our study indicates that absorption properties are changed by the attachment of substituents and can be tuned according to the requirements. Among the studied compounds, the -OCH3 substituted dimer (dimer 6) exhibits the largest bathochromic shift with a λ

However, the influence of chain stiffness on the slow dynamics and dynamical heterogeneity when approaching the glass transition point is still not well understood. In this work, we investigate the influence of chain stiffness on the dynamic heterogeneity and fragility of supercooled polymer melts by using molecular dynamics simulation. The chain stiffness is tuned by varying the bending strength, and the diffusion and relaxation of polymer segments are studied. We find that the power law relation between the rescaled diffusion coefficient and the structural relaxation time does not change with changing chain stiffness, indicating similarities of glass-forming behavior of polymer melts with different chain stiffness. The dynamical heterogeneities are characterized by the non-Gaussian parameter and dynamic susceptibility, and the string-like cooperative motion is analyzed by the string-length. It is found that the non-Gaussian parameter and dynamic susceptibility characterize a different aspect of dynamical heterogeneities. Though both decreasing temperature and increasing bending strength lead to slower dynamics and growing dynamical heterogeneities, there is no simple superposition between temperature and bending strength. Our work may shed new light on the glass transition behavior of polymers with different chain stiffness.",The role of solvent quality and chain stiffness on the end-to-end contact kinetics of semiflexible polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579311,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"Motivated by loop closure during protein folding and DNA packing, we systemically studied the effects of the solvent quality and chain stiffness on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the end-to-end contact formation for semiflexible polymer chains with reactive ends by Langevin dynamics simulations. In thermodynamics, a rich variety of products of the end-to-end contact have been discovered, such as loop, hairpin, toroid, and rodlike bundle, the populations of which are dependent on the solvent quality and chain stiffness. In kinetics, the overall pathways to form the end-to-end contact have been identified.

The theoretical calculations include density functional theory for both Ln species and a scalar relativity correction, electron correlation, and spin-orbit coupling for the Ce species. The MATI spectrum of LaNH exhibits a single vibronic band system with a strong origin band and two weak vibronic progressions, whereas the spectrum of CeNH displays two band systems separated by 75 cm-1 with each being like the LaNH spectrum. By comparing with the theoretical calculations, both LaNH and CeNH are identified as linear molecules with C∞v symmetry, and the two vibronic progressions are attributed to the excitations of Ln-N stretching and Ln-N-H bending modes in the ions. The additional band system observed for CeNH is due to the spin-orbit splitting from the interactions of triplet and singlet states. The ground valence electron configurations of LaNH and CeNH are La 6s1 and Ce 4f16s1, and the ionization of each species removes the Ln 6s1 electron. The remaining two electrons that are associated with the isolated Ln atoms or ions are in a doubly degenerate molecular orbital that is a bonding combination between Ln 5dπ and N pπ orbitals."

In this work, we observe a hydration mediated surface transition in supercooled oil nanodroplets in aqueous solutions using second harmonic and sum frequency scattering techniques. Hexadecane nanodroplets dispersed in water freeze at a temperature of ∼15 °C below the melting point of the bulk alkane liquid. Addition of a trimethylammonium bromide (CXTA+) type surfactant with chain length equal to or longer than that of the alkane causes the bulk oil droplet freezing transition to be preceded by a structural interfacial transition that involves water, oil, and the surfactant. Upon cooling, the water loses some of its orientational order with respect to the surface normal, presumably by reorienting more parallel to the oil interface. This is followed by the surface oil and surfactant alkyl chains losing some of their flexibility, and this chain stretching induces alkyl chain ordering in the bulk of the alkane phase, which is then followed by the bulk transition occurring at a 3 °C lower temperature. This behavior is reminiscent of surface freezing observed in planar tertiary alkane/surfactant/water systems but differs distinctively in that it appears to be induced by the interfacial water and requires only a very small amount of surfactant.",An improved static corrugation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579298,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"Accurately describing surface temperature effects for the dissociation of H2 on Cu(111) remains challenging. While Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), the current state-of-the-art method for modelling such systems, can produce accurate results, it is computationally very expensive to use for extensive testing of, for example, density functionals. A chemically accurate static corrugation model for H2 and D2 on Cu(111) dissociation was made by introducing effective three-body interactions as well as an H2-bond dependence and fitting the model to density functional theory energies for 15 113 different configurations. Reaction probabilities and rovibrational (in)elastic scattering probabilities were computed and compared to experiments and other calculations. Theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement, except for the reaction of (v = 0, J = 0) H2 where both AIMD and the newly developed static corrugation model, both based on the same underlying density functional, predict a similar deviation from the experiment.",Atomistic mechanisms for chemical defects formation in polyethylene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579297,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"Chemical defects can progressively degrade the electronic structure of polymer dielectrics, ultimately leading to their failure.

Using a combination of density functional theory calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose seven atomistic mechanisms for the formation of common chemical defects in polyethylene using which a variety of defect-related experimental observations can be explained. This work provides a comprehensive connection among the experiments related to polyethylene defects and aging, laying the groundwork for an understanding of polymer degradation and breakdown.",Selective suppression of CARS signal with two competing stimulated Raman scattering processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579296,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 07,"Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy and microscopy have been used in studying the structure and dynamics of a wide range of chemical and biological systems. However, the spatial resolution of CARS microscopy is still limited by the diffraction barrier, and hence a suitable scheme to selectively switch off the CARS imaging signal is essential for super-resolution CARS microscopy. Here, we present theoretical descriptions about three different ways to selectively suppress the pump-Stokes-pump two-beam CARS signal by employing three-beam double stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) schemes. Using a semiclassical theory for the interaction of radiation with the Raman-active molecule, we obtain coupled differential equations for the intensities of the pump, Stokes, depletion, and the generated CARS signal fields. We find approximate solutions of these coupled differential equations. They are then used to show that the pump-Stokes-pump CARS signal can be selectively suppressed by increasing the added depletion beam intensity, when the three injected beam frequencies are tuned in such a way that they can induce two SRS processes simultaneously. To show that these switching-off methods can be used to develop super-resolution CARS imaging techniques, we numerically calculate the full-width-at-half-maximum of the CARS imaging point spread function assuming that the spatial profiles of the pump and Stokes beams are Gaussian functions and that the spatial profile of the depletion beam is doughnut-shaped. We anticipate that the proposed selective CARS suppression schemes will be of use in developing super-resolution, label-free CARS microscopy.",Towards the description of adsorption of water in slit-like pores with walls covered by molecular brushes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579295,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"The density profiles, adsorption isotherms, and phase behavior of a water model in a slit-like pore with walls modified by pre-adsorbed tethered chain molecules have been studied in the framework of a density functional theory. Each chain is bonded to the surface by its terminal segment, and the surface density of grafted chains is the same for each wall. The model for water taken from the work of Clark et al. [Mol. Phys. 104, 3561 (2006)] reproduces successfully a bulk equation of state. The mean field approach has been used to describe the effects of attractive interactions. The chemical association effects are taken into account by using the first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory of Wertheim. We have found that the presence of molecular brushes on the pore walls has important consequences for the adsorption and phase behavior of confined water. If the brush segments do not attract water molecules strongly, the vapor-liquid coexistence envelope shrinks upon increasing brush density, but the critical temperature is weakly affected. Alteration from capillary condensation to evaporation is observed with changes in the brush density, number of segments of tethered chains, and/or chemical identity of segments. The crossover temperature is affected by all these factors. Moreover, we have shown that affinity of water to segments of tethers is an important factor determining adsorption of water vapor and the entire phase diagram.",Probing the electric field-induced doping mechanism in YBa2Cu3O7 using computed Cu K-edge x-ray absorption spectra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579294,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"We recently demonstrated that the superconductor-to-insulator transition induced by ionic liquid gating of the high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) is accompanied by a deoxygenation of the sample [A. M. Perez-Munoz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 114, 215 (2017)]. Density functional theory calculations helped establish that the pronounced changes in the spectral features of the Cu K-edge absorption spectra measured in situ during the gating experiment arise from a decrease of the Cu coordination within the CuO chains. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the electronic structure origin of the changes in the spectra resulting from three different types of doping: (i) the formation of oxygen vacancies within the CuO chains, (ii) the formation of oxygen vacancies within the CuO2 planes, and (iii) the electrostatic doping. For each case, three stoichiometries are studied and compared to the stoichiometric YBa2Cu3O7, i.e., YBa2Cu3O6.75, YBa2Cu3O6.50, and YBa2Cu3O6.25. Computed vacancy formation energies further support the chain-vacancy mechanism. In the case of doping by vacancies within the chains, we study the effect of oxygen ordering on the spectral features and we clarify the connection between the polarization of the x-rays and this doping mechanism. Finally, the inclusion of the Hubbard U correction on the computed spectra for antiferromagnetic YBa2Cu3O6.25 is discussed.",Perspective: Searching for simplicity rather than universality in glass-forming liquids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579292,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 28,"This article gives an overview of experimental results on dynamics in bulk glass-forming molecular liquids.

First, the electric field gradient (EFG) present in the liquid-crystalline phases of ferroelectric FELIX-R&D is determined using NMR spectroscopy of noble gases 21Ne and 131Xe. The 21Ne and 131Xe NMR spectra were recorded over a temperature range, which covers all the mesophases of FELIX-R&D: nematic N*, smectic A, and smectic C*. The spin quantum number of both 21Ne and 131Xe is 3/2. Their electric quadrupole moment interacts with the EFG at the nuclear site, which in liquid-crystalline phases results in the NMR spectra of the triplet structure, instead of a singlet detectable in the isotropic phase. The total EFG experienced by the noble gas nuclei consists of two contributions; one arises from the quadrupole moments of the liquid crystal molecules (external contribution) and the other one from the deformation of the electron distribution of the atoms (deformational contribution). The total EFGs determined from the 131Xe and 21Ne quadrupole splittings are very similar in the nematic and smectic A phases but differ in the smectic C* phase, being about twice larger in the 21Ne case which stems from the larger deformation of the xenon electron cloud than that of neon. For the first time, EFG was determined also in the smectic C* phase applying noble gas NMR spectroscopy. Second, the structure of molecules which, as a mixture, compose the used ferroelectric liquid crystal, FELIX-R&D, is determined by applying a number of various NMR methods and sophisticated spectral analysis. In this part, NMR spectra were recorded from FELIX-R&D/CDCl3 solution. The NMR spectral analysis was divided into four subsystems with over 13 000 000 nonzero intensity transitions. It appeared that FELIX-R&D is composed of three phenyl pyrimidine derivatives and a chiral dopant with fluorine in the asymmetric carbon atom.",Lattice models and Monte Carlo methods for simulating DNA origami self-assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579289,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 01 07,"The optimal design of DNA origami systems that assemble rapidly and robustly is hampered by the lack of a model for self-assembly that is sufficiently detailed yet computationally tractable. Here, we propose a model for DNA origami that strikes a balance between these two criteria by representing these systems on a lattice at the level of binding domains. The free energy of hybridization between individual binding domains is estimated with a nearest-neighbour model. Double helical segments are treated as being rigid, but we allow flexibility at points where the backbone of one of the strands is interrupted, which provides a reasonably realistic representation of partially and fully assembled states. Particular attention is paid to the constraints imposed by the double helical twist, as they determine where strand crossovers between adjacent helices can occur. To improve the efficiency of sampling configuration space, we develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling scaffold conformations in near-assembled states, and we carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, enabling us to avoid considering states with unbound staples. We demonstrate that our model can quickly sample assembled configurations of a small origami design previously studied with the oxDNA model, as well as a design with staples that span longer segments of the scaffold. The sampling ability of our method should allow for good statistics to be obtained when studying the assembly pathways and is suited to investigating, in particular, the effects of design and assembly conditions on these pathways and their resulting final assembled structures."

Numerous electrophysiological tests have been employed to monitor the integrity of the facial nerve prior to, during, and after MVD treatment. The authors sought to verify if facial motor evoked potential (FMEP) with paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (pTMS) can be utilized as a tool to predict prognosis following MVD for HFS.METHODSFMEP using pTMS was performed preoperatively and postoperatively for 527 HFS patients who underwent an MVD treatment. Various interstimuli intervals (ISIs), which included 2, 10, 20, 25, 30, 75, and 100 msec, were applied for each paired stimulation and pTMS(%) was obtained. A graph of pTMS(%) versus each ISI was drawn for every patient and its pattern was analyzed in accordance with patients' clinical outcomes.RESULTSWith ISIs of 75 and 100 msec, pTMS(%) was physiologically further inhibited, whereas it was relatively facilitated under ISIs of 20, 25, and 30 msec; loss of this specific pattern, that is, further inhibition-relative facilitation, indicated impaired integrity of the facial nerve. Those patients who immediately benefited from an MVD and experienced no relapse tended to show proper restoration of this further inhibition-relative facilitation pattern (p = 0.01). Greater resemblance between the physiological pattern of pTMS(%) and postoperative pTMS(%) was correlated to better outcome (p = 0.019).CONCLUSIONSA simple linear graph of pTMS(%) versus each ISI may be a helpful tool to predict prognosis for HFS following an MVD.",Subcostal nerve injury after laparoscopic lipoma surgery: an unusual culprit for an unusual complication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579276,Journal of neurosurgery,2018 12 22,"Endoscopic surgery has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. Nerve injury after laparoscopic surgery is presumably rare, with only scarce reports in the literature; however, the use of these techniques for new purposes presents the opportunity for novel complications. The authors report a case of subcostal nerve injury after an anterior laparoscopic approach to a posterior abdominal wall lipoma.A 62-year-old woman presented with a left abdominal flank bulge (pseudohernia) that developed after laparoscopic posterior flank wall lipoma resection. Imaging demonstrated frank ballooning of the oblique muscles; denervation atrophy and thinning of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis muscles; and thinning of the rectus abdominis muscle. The patient underwent subcostal nerve repair and removal of a foreign plastic material from the laparoscopic procedure. At 8 months, she has regained substantial improvement in abdominal wall strength.Although endoscopic procedures have resulted in significant reduction in morbidity, ""minimally invasive"" approaches should not be confused with ""low risk"" when approaching novel pathology. The subcostal nerve is at risk of injury in posterior abdominal wall surgery, whether laparoscopic or not. With the pseudohernia and abdominal bulge after this surgery, the cosmetic appeal of laparoscopic incisions was definitively undone.

Quantitative volumetric measurement of hemorrhagic blood is a good predictor of SDHC but might be impractical in the clinical setting. Qualitative assessment performed using scales such as the modified Fisher scale (mFisher) and the original Graeb scale (oGraeb) is easier to conduct but provides limited predictive power. In between, the modified Graeb scale (mGraeb) keeps the simplicity of the qualitative scales yet adds assessment of acute hydrocephalus, which might improve SDHC-predicting capabilities. In this study the authors investigated the likely capabilities of the mGraeb and compared them with previously validated methods. This research also aimed to define a tailored mGraeb cutoff point for SDHC prediction.METHODSThe authors performed retrospective analysis of patients admitted to their institution with the diagnosis of aSAH between May 2013 and April 2016. Out of 168 patients, 78 were included for analysis after the application of predefined exclusion criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the use of all 4 methods (quantitative volumetric assessment and the mFisher, oGraeb, and mGraeb scales) to predict the likelihood of SDHC development based on clinical data and blood amount assessment on initial CT scans.RESULTSThe mGraeb scale was demonstrated to be the most robust predictor of SDHC, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.848 (95% CI 0.763-0.933). According to the AUC results, the performance of the mGraeb scale was significantly better than that of the oGraeb scale (χ2 = 4.49; p = 0.034) and mFisher scale (χ2 = 7.21; p = 0.007). No statistical difference was found between the AUCs of the mGraeb and the quantitative volumetric measurement models (χ2 = 12.76; p = 0.23), but mGraeb proved to be the simplest model since it showed the lowest Akaike information criterion (66.4), the lowest Bayesian information criterion (71.2), and the highest R2Nagelkerke coefficient (39.7%). The initial mGraeb showed more than 85% specificity for predicting the development of SDHC in patients presenting with a score of 12 or more points.CONCLUSIONSAccording to the authors' data, the mGraeb scale is the simplest model that correlates well with SDHC development. Due to limited scientific evidence of treatments aimed at SDHC prevention, we propose an mGraeb score higher than 12 to identify patients at risk with high specificity. This mGraeb cutoff point might also serve as a useful prognostic tool since patients with SDHC after aSAH have worse functional outcomes.",Ablation dynamics of subsequent thermal doses delivered to previously heat-damaged tissue during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579274,Journal of neurosurgery,2018 12 22,"OBJECTIVEIntraoperative dynamics of magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) have been previously characterized for ablations of naive tissue. However, most treatment sessions require the delivery of multiple doses, and little is known about the ablation dynamics when additional doses are applied to heat-damaged tissue. This study investigated the differences in ablation dynamics between naive versus damaged tissue.METHODSThe authors examined 168 ablations from 60 patients across various surgical indications. All ablations were performed using the Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system (Medtronic), which employs a 980-nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases with multiple topographically overlapping doses with constant power were selected for this study. Single-dose intraoperative thermal damage was used to calculate ablation rate based on the thermal damage estimate (TDE) of the maximum area of ablation achieved (TDEmax) and the total duration of ablation (tmax). We compared ablation rates of naive undamaged tissue and damaged tissue exposed to subsequent thermal doses following an initial ablation.RESULTSTDEmax was significantly decreased in subsequent ablations compared to the preceding ablation (initial ablation 227.8 ± 17.7 mm2, second ablation 164.1 ± 21.5 mm2, third ablation 124.3 ± 11.2 mm2; p = < 0.001). The ablation rate of subsequent thermal doses delivered to previously damaged tissue was significantly decreased compared to the ablation rate of naive tissue (initial ablation 2.703 mm2/sec; second ablation 1.559 mm2/sec; third ablation 1.237 mm2/sec; fourth ablation 1.076 mm/sec; p = < 0.001). A negative correlation was found between TDEmax and percentage of overlap in a subsequent ablation with previously damaged tissue (r = -0.164; p < 0.02).CONCLUSIONSAblation of previously ablated tissue results in a reduced ablation rate and reduced TDEmax. Additionally, each successive thermal dose in a series of sequential ablations results in a decreased ablation rate relative to that of the preceding ablation. In the absence of a change in power, operators should anticipate a possible reduction in TDE when ablating partially damaged tissue for a similar amount of time compared to the preceding ablation.",Maffucci syndrome complicated by three different central nervous system tumors sharing an IDH1 R132C mutation: case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579273,Journal of neurosurgery,2018 12 22,"Maffucci syndrome (MS) and Ollier disease (OD) are nonhereditary congenital diseases characterized by multiple enchondromas and/or chondrosarcomas. Recent studies have implicated somatic mosaic mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) as contributing to the pathogenesis of MS and OD. Occasionally, patients with these disorders may also present with central nervous system (CNS) tumors; however, detailed genetic analyses are limited. In this article, the authors report on a male patient with MS, harboring three CNS tumors that share a common genetic alteration. Over a 9-year period, three separate tumor resections were conducted for sellar, intraparenchymal brainstem, and osseous clival tumors. The histopathological diagnoses were pituitary adenoma, diffuse astrocytoma, and chondrosarcoma, respectively. Sanger sequencing revealed a common IDH1 R132C mutation among all three CNS tumors but not in blood DNA. Administering chemotherapy (nimustine) and subsequent radiation therapy to the brainstem glioma and the residual lesion in the clivus have kept the patient progression free for 18 months. This is the first report demonstrating an IDH1 mutation shared among three different CNS tumors in a single patient with MS. The findings support the hypothesis that in MS and OD, a single common IDH1 mutation triggers tumorigenesis in cells of different origins and locations in a somatic mosaic fashion.",Anatomical assessment of the endoscopic endonasal approach for the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579271,Journal of neurosurgery,2018 12 22,"OBJECTIVEEndoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) are increasingly being incorporated into the neurosurgeon's armamentarium for treatment of various pathologies, including paraclinoid aneurysms. However, few anatomical assessments have been performed on the use of EEA for this purpose. The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive anatomical assessment of the EEA for the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms.METHODSFive cadaveric heads underwent an endonasal transplanum-transtuberculum approach to expose the paraclinoid area. The feasibility of obtaining proximal and distal internal carotid artery (ICA) control as well as the topographic location of the origin of the ophthalmic artery (OphA) relative to dural landmarks were assessed. Limitations of the EEA in exposing the supraclinoid ICA were also recorded to identify favorable paraclinoid ICA aneurysm projections for EEA.RESULTSThe extracavernous paraclival and clinoidal ICAs were favorable segments for establishing proximal control. Clipping the extracavernous ICA risked injury to the trigeminal and abducens nerves, whereas clipping the clinoidal segment put the oculomotor nerve at risk. The OphA origin was found within 4 mm of the medial opticocarotid point on a line connecting the midtubercular recess point to the medial vertex of the lateral opticocarotid recess. An average 7.2-mm length of the supraclinoid ICA could be safely clipped for distal control. Assessments showed that small superiorly or medially projecting aneurysms were favorable candidates for clipping via EEA.CONCLUSIONSWhen used for paraclinoid aneurysms, the EEA carries certain risks to adjacent neurovascular structures during proximal control, dural opening, and distal control. While some authors have promoted this approach as feasible, this work demonstrates that it has significant limitations and may only be appropriate in highly selected cases that are not amenable to coiling or clipping. Further clinical experience with this approach helps to delineate its risks and benefits.",Clinical tolerance of corticospinal tracts in convection-enhanced delivery to the brainstem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579270,Journal of neurosurgery,2018 12 22,"OBJECTIVEConvection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been explored as a therapeutic strategy for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Variables that may affect tolerance include infusate volume, infusion rate, catheter trajectory, and target position. Supratentorial approaches for catheter placement and infusate distribution patterns may conflict with corticospinal tracts (CSTs). The clinical relevance of these anatomical constraints has not been described. The authors report their experience using CED in the brainstem as it relates to anatomical CST conflict and association with clinical tolerance.METHODSIn a phase I clinical trial of CED for DIPG (clinical trial registration no. NCT01502917, clinicaltrials.gov), a flexible infusion catheter was placed with MRI guidance for infusion of 124I-8H9, a radioimmunotherapeutic agent. Intra- and postprocedural MR images were analyzed to identify catheter trajectories and changes in T2-weighted signal intensity to approximate volume of distribution (Vd). Intersection of CST by the catheter and overlap between Vd and CST were recorded and their correlation with motor deficits was evaluated.RESULTSThirty-one patients with a mean age of 7.6 years (range 3.2-18 years) underwent 39 catheter insertions for CED between 2012 and 2017. Thirty catheter insertions had tractography data available for analysis. The mean trajectory length was 105.5 mm (range 92.7-121.6 mm). The mean number of intersections of CST by catheter was 2.2 (range 0-3) and the mean intersecting length was 18.9 mm (range 0-44.2 mm). The first 9 infusions in the highest dose level (range 3.84-4.54 ml infusate) were analyzed for Vd overlap with CST. In this group, the mean age was 7.6 years (range 5.8-10.3 years), the mean trajectory length was 109.5 mm (range 102.6-122.3 mm), and the mean overlap between Vd and CST was 5.5 cm3. For catheter placement-related adverse events, 1 patient (3%) had worsening of a contralateral facial nerve palsy following the procedure with two CST intersections, an intersecting distance of 31.7 mm, and an overlap between Vd and CST of 3.64 cm3. For infusion-related adverse events, transient postinfusion deficits were noted in 3 patients in the highest dose level, with a mean number of 2 intersections of CST by catheter, mean intersecting length of 12.9 mm, and mean overlap between Vd and CST of 6.3 cm3.CONCLUSIONSA supratentorial approach to the brainstem crossing the CST resulted in one worsened neurological deficit. There does not appear to be a significant risk requiring avoidance of dominant motor fiber tracts with catheter trajectory planning.

Cesium-131 (Cs-131) radiation sources were embedded in modular collagen carriers positioned in the operative bed on completion of resection. The Cox proportional hazards model with this treatment as a predictive term was used to model its effect on time to local tumor progression.RESULTSNineteen patients (median age 64.5 years, range 50-78 years) with 20 recurrent, previously irradiated tumors were treated. The WHO grade at R+BT was I in 4 (20%), II in 14 (70%), and III in 2 (10%) cases. The median number of prior same-site radiation courses and same-site surgeries were 1 (range 1-3) and 2 (range 1-4), respectively; the median preoperative tumor volume was 11.3 cm3 (range 0.9-92.0 cm3). The median radiation dose from BT was 63 Gy (range 54-80 Gy). At a median radiographic follow-up of 15.4 months (range 0.03-47.5 months), local failure (within 1.5 cm of the implant bed) occurred in 2 cases (10%). The median treatment-site time to progression after R+BT has not been reached; that after the most recent prior therapy was 18.3 months (range 3.9-321.9 months; HR 0.17, p = 0.02, log-rank test). The median overall survival after R+BT was 26 months, with 9 patient deaths (47% of patients). Treatment was well tolerated; 2 patients required surgery for complications, and 2 experienced radiation necrosis, which was managed medically.CONCLUSIONSR+BT utilizing Cs-131 sources in modular carriers represents a potentially safe and effective treatment option for recurrent, previously irradiated aggressive meningiomas.",Corpus callosotomy via laser interstitial thermal therapy: a case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579267,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,2019 03 22,"Corpus callosotomy has been used as a form of surgical palliation for patients suffering from medically refractory generalized seizures, including drop attacks. Callosotomy has traditionally been described as involving a craniotomy with microdissection. MR-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRg-LITT) has recently been used as a minimally invasive method for performing surgical ablation of epileptogenic foci and corpus callosotomy. The authors present 3 cases in which MRg-LITT was used to perform a corpus callosotomy as part of a staged surgical procedure for a patient with multiple seizure types and in instances when further ablation of residual corpus callosum is necessary after a prior open surgical procedure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case series of corpus callosotomy performed using the MRg-LITT system with a 3.3-year average follow-up. Although MRg-LITT is not expected to replace the traditional corpus callosotomy in all cases, it is a safe, effective, and durable alternative to the traditional open corpus callosotomy, particularly in the setting of a prior craniotomy.",Comparison of head impact exposure in practice drills among multiple youth football teams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579266,Journal of neurosurgery.

However, few studies have explored the mediators related to epidermal cell apoptosis in an oxidative stress microenvironment. Cellular viability was determined using the MTT assay, TUNEL staining, western blot analysis and LDH release assay. Two independent siRNAs were transfected into HaCaT cell to repress INF2 and/or HIF1 in the presence of H2O2. Mitochondrial function was determined using JC-1 staining, mitochondrial ROS staining, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In the present study, our data demonstrated that the expression of inverted formin-2 (INF2) increased rapidly when the cells were exposed to H2O2. Interestingly, INF2 knockdown promoted HaCaT cell survival via reducing H2O2-mediated cell apoptosis. Molecular investigations demonstrated that INF2 deletion attenuated mitochondrial ROS overloading, restored the cellular redox balance, sustained the mitochondrial membrane potential, improved mitochondrial respiratory function and corrected the mitochondrial dynamics disorder in an H2O2-mimicking oxidative stress microenvironment. In addition, INF2 deletion upregulated the expression of HIF1. Interestingly, the inhibition of HIF1 increased cell death and caused mitochondrial stress despite the deletion of INF2, suggesting that the HIF1 signaling pathway is required for INF2 deletion-mediated HaCaT cell survival and mitochondrial protection. Altogether, our results identified INF2 as a novel apoptotic mediator for oxidative stress-mediated HaCaT cell death via modulating mitochondrial stress and repressing the HIF1 signaling pathway. This finding provides evidence to support the critical role played by the INF2-HIF1 axis in regulating mitochondrial stress and epidermal cell viability in an oxidative stress microenvironment.",Fangchinoline supplementation attenuates inflammatory markers in experimental rheumatoid arthritis-induced rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579253,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 13,"The present study evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of fangchinoline in rheumatoid arthritis-induced rats.

The serum levels of lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), catalase, reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, ceruloplasmin, uric acid, and copper were determined. Chondrocyte cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cellular levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were assessed. Lipid peroxidation, GSH, SOD, catalase, and Gpx levels recovered to near normal levels by fangchinoline treatment. Fangchinoline treatment significantly reduced the TNF-α level by 17.8% and 40.8% in groups III and IV respectively, whereas IL-6 was significantly decreased by 23.2% and 45%, respectively. Fangchinoline treatment significantly decreased the MMP-3 level by 23.1% and 65.1% in groups III and IV respectively, whereas PGE2 was significantly decreased by 31.8% and 63.8%, respectively. Fangchinoline treatment decreased NO, uric acid, ceruloplasmin, and copper levels, whereas the zinc content was increased. Chondrocyte proliferation was significantly reduced to 73.3%, 51.3%, and 42.4% at 2 μM, 4 μM, and 6 μM fangchinoline treatment respectively.

Children completed first- and second-order ToM measures, and parents completed the Social Skills Improvement System (SSiS) Rating Scales questionnaire as an assessment of their children's social skills. Results indicated that ToM and total SSiS scores were unique predictors of children's cheating, such that with increased ToM and SSiS scores children were significantly less likely to cheat. In particular, children's responsibility scores (subscale of SSiS Rating Scales) emerged as a unique predictor of cheating. Children's performance on both scales were examined together and demonstrated that only children who had high levels of both ToM and responsibility were significantly less likely to cheat compared with children who were low on both measures. These findings demonstrate that children's sociocognitive development affects their cheating behaviors, likely through an understanding of the importance of maintaining positive social relationships.",Sustained visual attention is more than seeing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579246,Journal of experimental child psychology,2018 12 30,"Sustained visual attention is a well-studied cognitive capacity that is relevant to many developmental outcomes. The development of visual attention is often construed as an increased capacity to exert top-down internal control. We demonstrate that sustained visual attention, measured in terms of momentary eye gaze, emerges from and is tightly tied to sensory-motor coordination. Specifically, we examined whether and how changes in manual behavior alter toddlers' eye gaze during toy play. We manipulated manual behavior by giving one group of children heavy toys that were hard to pick up and giving another group of children perceptually identical toys that were lighter and easy to pick up and hold. We found a tight temporal coupling of visual attention with the duration of manual activities on the objects, a relation that cannot be explained by interest alone. Toddlers in the heavy-object condition looked at objects as much as toddlers in the light-object condition but did so through many brief glances, whereas looks to the same objects were longer and sustained in the light-object condition. We explain the results based on the mechanism of hand-eye coordination and discuss its implications for the development of visual attention.","""Is it worth my time and effort?"": How children selectively gather information from experts when faced with different kinds of costs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579245,Journal of experimental child psychology,2018 12 30,"Gathering good-quality information is important for effective learning, but children may often need to expend time or energy (i.e., costs) in order to do so.

Children were given three types of question cards (doctor-related, mechanic-related, and neutral questions) and could assign each question to either a doctor or car mechanic puppet. One puppet (either the doctor or the car mechanic, counterbalanced) could be accessed immediately, but the other puppet required either waiting 30 s or completing a tedious sorting task first. Children's verbal intelligence and executive function skills were also assessed. Results showed that cost influenced how children sought information from each of the expert puppets; children selected the costly expert for domain-relevant questions at chance levels and otherwise strongly preferred to question the non-costly puppet. In addition, executive function skills (but not verbal intelligence) related to how frequently children were willing to direct questions to the costly puppet. Overall, these results indicate that children are influenced by costs when gathering information from others and that their ability to expend a cost to gather good-quality information may relate to their inhibition skills. Implications for encouraging effective learning are discussed."

It is also used as a raw material in the GMP-manufacturing of gene-, cell- and tissue advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs). However, quality methods are currently lacking. Therefore, a LC method was developed, based on hydrophilic interaction (HILIC)-ion exchange (IE) mixed-mode liquid chromatography. The final method consisted of an isocratic system with 15 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 2.5 with HCl) acetonitrile (30:70, v/v) mobile phase on a zwitterionic HILIC column, containing an hydrophilic ligand embedded cation-exchange functionality and a surface anion-exchange group. A flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and UV detection at 240 nm was applied. The assay method of APMg was validated, obtaining adequate linearity (R2 = 0.999), precision (RSD of 0.49%) and accuracy (overall recovery of 100.4%). The developed method was successfully applied on five currently marketed products from different suppliers, showing different related substance impurity profiles. Using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), magnesium was found to be bound on the stationary phase, requiring a strong mobile phase to rinse the column. Finally, related impurities were identified using MS/MS and high resolution MS, and found to be ascorbic acid as well as ethyl derivatives, which was further confirmed by NMR.","Isolation, identification, characterization, synthesis and quality control strategy of new process-related impurities in ambrisentan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579233,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 03,"Ambrisentan is a highly selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Usually, VCM and CRE levels are measured in serum or plasma specimens obtained from venous blood, after phlebotomy. As the majority of hospitals in Developing Countries do not have on-site access to VCM measurements, the availability of data on patient's VCM levels would involve the transport of liquid samples to specialized laboratories. An alternative to overcome the logistic difficulties of liquid biological specimens is the use of dried microsamples, such as plasma applied to volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) devices. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a LC-MS/MS assay for the simultaneous determination of VCM and CRE in plasma applied to VAMS devices. VCM and CRE levels were determined in clinical relevant ranges with acceptable precision and accuracy and both compounds were stable in VAMS for up to two weeks at 45 °C. Concentrations measured in VAMS differed from those measured in plasma and the use of estimation approaches was necessary to estimate plasma concentrations. VCM levels in plasma can be estimated by multiplying VAMS measurements by the correction factor of 0.934. The unbiased estimation of CRE plasma levels from VAMS required the use of the equation CREplasma = 0.9808 * CREVAMS + 1.6621. VAMS can be used as an alternative for short-term storage and transportation of plasma at ambient and high temperatures, allowing a more widespread access to VCM therapeutic drug monitoring in limited-resources settings.",Quantitative determination of the antimalarials artemether and lumefantrine in biological samples: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579231,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 03,"Malaria is a worldwide health issue, with 216 million cases reported in 2016. Due to the widespread resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to conventional drugs, the first line treatment recommended by World Health Organization for uncomplicated malaria is artemisinin-based combined therapy (ACT), which combines two drugs with different mechanisms of action. The association of artemether and lumefantrine is the most common ACT used in the clinical practice. However, there have been reports of clinical artemisinin and derivatives partial resistance, which is defined as delayed parasite clearance. In this context, the monitoring of drug concentration in biological matrices is essential to evaluate treatment response, the need of dose adjustment and the occurrence of dose dependent adverse effects. Furthermore, it is also important for pharmacokinetic studies and in the development of generic and similar drugs. Determination of antimalarial drugs in biological matrices requires a sample pre-treatment, which involves drug extraction from the matrix and analyte concentration. The most used techniques are protein precipitation (PP), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE). Subsequently, a liquid chromatography step is usually applied to separate interferences that could be extracted along with the analyte. Finally, the analytes are detected employing techniques that must be selective and sensitive, since the analyte might be present in trace levels. The most used approach for detection is tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), but ultraviolet (UV) is also employed in several studies.

Degradations of imazapic, imazapyr, and a mixture of them (Onduty®) was investigated in the presence of the optimized biochars in the soil during a 70-days incubation. Based on the results, the polar herbicides were resistant to hydrolysis degradation. Photolysis rates of the herbicides reduced significantly in the presence of the biochars in the soil. EFB biochar had greater effects due to its chemical compositions and surface functional groups. Photo-degradation of imazapyr was more affected by biochars amendment. The imidazolinones bio-degradation, however, accelerated significantly with the presence of EFB and RH biochars in soil with the greater effects of RH biochar. It was concluded that the application of the optimized EFB and RH biochars as an innovative sustainable strategy has the potential to decrease the persistence of the imidazolinones and minimize their environmental hazards.",Modeling of electrokinetic remediation of Cd- and Pb-contaminated kaolinite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579229,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"A physiscochemical model is presented for the reactive-transport of chemical scpecies through a contaminated soil during an acid-enhanced electrokinetic remediation treatment.

Therefore, six STWs with two plant species and earthworm addition were investigated to evaluate their effects on HMs distribution and bioavailability. The results showed that plant uptake of HMs was insignificant with earthworm addition. Earthworm had the highest enrichment for Cd with bioaccumulation factors of 6.9-7.3. Moreover, earthworm had a positive effect to remove HMs in accumulated sludge. Meanwhile, the bioavailability of Cd in accumulated sludge was decreased by earthworm addition, with the acid-soluble fraction decreased from range 16.5-22.7% to range 7.2-10.1%. Furthermore, HMs mass balance in the STWs revealed that HMs were widely distributed in the accumulated sludge, leachate and others, while their (except Cd) accumulation in the plants and earthworm are less than 1%. The Cd toxicity in the accumulated sludge can be reduced by the addition of earthworm with enrichment of 3.6-8.2%.

Phase-contrast MRI is a velocimetry technique routinely used in the clinic to measure fast flows in biological tissues, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the order of cm/s. Use of this technique to encode slower flows is hampered by diffusion weighting and phase error introduced by gradient hardware imperfections. In this study, a new PC-MRI technique is developed using stimulated echo preparation to overcome these challenges. Flows as slow as 1 μm/s are measured and validated using controlled water flow through a pipe at 4.7 T. The error in measured flow rate obtained by integrating the measured velocity over the cross-sectional area of the pipe is less than 10%. The developed method was also able to capture slow natural convection flows appearing in liquids placed inside a horizontal bore magnet.

The radio frequency (RF) pulses used in EPR imaging to excite electron spins must be very short to match their fast relaxation. With traditional pulse schemes and ninety degree flip angles, this can lead to either unsafe specific absorption rate (SAR) levels or unfeasibly long repetition times. In spectroscopy experiments, it has been shown that stochastic excitation and correlation detection can reduce the power while maintaining sensitivity but have yet to be applied to imaging experiments. Stochastic excitation is implemented using a pseudo-random phase modulation of the input stimulus. Using a crossed coil resonator assembly comprised of an outer saddle coil and an inner surface coil, it was possible to obtain a minimum isolation of ∼50 dB across a 12 MHz bandwidth. An incident peak RF power of 5 mW was used to excite the system. The low background signal obtained from this resonator allowed us to generate images with 32 dB (>1000:1) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while exciting with a traditional pulse sequence in a phantom containing the solid paramagnetic probe NMP-TCNQ (N-methyl pyridinium tetracyanoquinodimethane). Using two different stochastic excitation schemes, we were able to achieve a greater than 4-fold increase in SNR at the same peak power and number of averages, compared to single pulse excitation. This procedure allowed imaging at significantly lower RF power levels than used in conventional EPR imaging system configurations. Similar techniques may enable clinical applications for EPR imaging by facilitating the use of larger RF coils while maintaining a safe SAR level."

Although it has been suggested that biodegradable polymers, such as polylactic acid, may be used to replace some polyethylene packaging, little is known about their effects on marine organisms. Blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, have become a ""model organism"" for investigating the effects of microplastics in marine ecosystems. We show here that repeated exposure, over a period of 52 days in an outdoor mesocosm setting, of M. edulis to polyethylene microplastics reduced the number of byssal threads produced and the attachment strength (tenacity) by ∼50%. Exposure to either type of microplastic altered the haemolymph proteome and, although a conserved response to microplastic exposure was observed, overall polyethylene resulted in more changes to protein abundances than polylactic acid. Many of the proteins affected are involved in vital biological processes, such as immune regulation, detoxification, metabolism and structural development. Our study highlights the utility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics to assess the health of key marine organisms and identifies the potential mechanisms by which microplastics, both conventional and biodegradable, could affect their ability to form and maintain reefs.",Toxicity responses of different organs of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to silver nanoparticles with different particle sizes and surface coatings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579210,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 19,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic ecosystems are toxic to aquatic organisms. In this study, we aimed to investigate the toxicities and molecular mechanisms of AgNPs with different surface coatings (sodium citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and particle sizes (20 nm and 100 nm) in the gills, intestines, and muscles of zebrafish after 96 h of exposure. Our results indicated that the contribution of particle size to AgNP toxicity was greater than that of the surface coating. Citrate-coated AgNPs were more toxic than polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs, and 20-nm AgNPs were more toxic than 100-nm AgNPs. The toxic effects of AgNPs to the tissues were in the order intestines > gills > muscles. Differential expression of genes with the different AgNPs confirmed that they had toxic effects in the zebrafish tissues at the molecular level. Our comprehensive comparison of the toxicities of different AgNPs to aquatic ecosystems will be helpful for further risk assessments of AgNPs.",New environmental model for thermodynamic ecology of biological phosphine production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579209,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"We present a new model for the biological production of phosphine (PH3). Phosphine is found globally, in trace amounts, in the Earth's atmosphere. It has been suggested as a key molecule in the phosphorus cycle, linking atmospheric, lithospheric and biological phosphorus chemistry. Phosphine's production is strongly associated with marshes, swamps and other sites of anaerobic biology. However the mechanism of phosphine's biological production has remained controversial, because it has been believed that reduction of phosphate to phosphine is endergonic. In this paper we show through thermodynamic calculations that, in specific environments, the combined action of phosphate reducing and phosphite disproportionating bacteria can produce phosphine. Phosphate-reducing bacteria can capture energy from the reduction of phosphate to phosphite through coupling phosphate reduction to NADH oxidation. Our hypothesis describes how the phosphate chemistry in an environmental niche is coupled to phosphite generation in ground water, which in turn is coupled to the phosphine production in water and atmosphere, driven by a specific microbial ecology. Our hypothesis provides clear predictions on specific complex environments where biological phosphine production could be widespread. We propose tests of our hypothesis in fieldwork.",Effects of aeration rates on the structural changes in humic substance during co-composting of digestates and chicken manure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579208,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"High humidity and potential threat of pathogen of anaerobic digestates are unfavorable to the environment by direct utilization. To achieve the sustainable utilization of digestates, composting might be a good choice. Meanwhile, the aeration rate of composting has been optimized. Co-composting of digestates and chicken manure was performed under different aeration conditions (0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 L·min-1·kg-1·organic matter (OM)). During composting, internal transformation of humic substance (HS) has been studied for obtaining the potential application value of the co-composting products. Results suggested that the HS concentration was increased by 21.1%, 26.4% and 22.4% with the aeration rates were 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 L·min-1·kg-1·OM, respectively. The aeration rate of 0.15 L·min-1·kg-1·OM was more conducive to germination. Parallel factor analysis and dimensional correlation spectra (2DCOS) have been combined to reveal the conversion relationships of HS components for understanding the compost application pattern. Hetero-2DCOS indicated that aeration of 0.05 min-1·kg-1·OM and 0.1 L·min-1·kg-1·OM contributed to the formation of complex compounds at long wavelength, and aeration of 0.15 L·min-1·kg-1·OM was beneficial for labile compounds formation at short wavelength. In views of the aeration of 0.1 L·min-1·kg-1·OM was more beneficial to improve HS concentration than 0.05 L·min-1·kg-1·OM, 0.1 L·min-1·kg-1·OM and 0.15 L·min-1·kg-1·OM were consider as the most important aeration rate to conduct digestates composting. Overall, the aeration affected the HS composition which, in turn, might affect the application ways of composting products. This study could provide a reference for industrial composting production and applications.",In situ simulation of thin-layer dredging effects on sediment metal release across the sediment-water interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579207,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Dredging is widely applied to remediate contaminated sediments in aquatic ecosystems. However, the efficiency of thin-layer dredging for metal pollution control remains uncertain and even controversial. This study conducted an in-situ simulation experiment in Lake Taihu to investigate dredging effects on sediment metal release based on metal fractions, diffusion flux and kinetics parameters of metal resupply, using diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT), multi-microelectrode, and European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction scheme. Results indicated that the exchange fluxes of metals did not necessarily correspond to total sediment metal concentrations or the contents of different sequentially-extracted metal fractions; there were appreciable decreases in Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn in terms of total sediment metal concentrations and metal fractions, whereas the bioavailability and release fluxes of labile Ni, Cu and Zn (but not Cd) were all notably promoted (by 136, 128 and 149%, respectively) in dredged area compared to those in un-dredged sediments. Further analysis on the kinetics of metal resupply by DGT technique and DGT-induced fluxes in sediments model (DIFS) showed higher concentrations of labile metals, with a larger resupply ability from sediments after dredging. Therefore, thin-layer dredging had the possibility to increase metal release from sediments to the water column. This was attributed to the remobilization of metal sulfides in anoxic deep sediments, as oxidation increased after dredging due to the introduction of oxygenated water, causing subsequent dissolution of sulfide-bound metals. In conclusion, dredging may not mitigate metal contamination, although it can reduce the total pollution load. Our findings indicated dual effects of dredging and provided new insights into the remobilization mechanism of metal release induced by dredging.",A combined quantitative property-property relationship (QPPR) for estimating packaging-food and solid material-water partition coefficients of organic compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579206,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"The packaging-food partition coefficient (Kpf) is a key parameter to estimate the chemical migration from packaging to food and resulting ingestion exposures. As a particular case of Kpf, the solid material-water partition coefficient (Kmw) is also important in relating the material to the water phase-based skin permeation coefficient to further assess dermal contact exposure to chemicals in solid consumer products. Existing correlations to estimate Kpf or Kmw are applicable for a limited number of chemical-food-packaging or chemical-material combinations without considering the temperature effect. The present study develops a combined quantitative property-property relationship (QPPR) to predict Kpf and Kmw with a wide applicability. We compiled a dataset of 1846 measured Kpf or Kmw for 232 chemicals in 19 consolidated material types. A regression model predicts Kpf or Kmw as a function of chemical's Kow, food or water's ethanol equivalency, temperature and material type, which shows good fitting performance with R2adj of 0.93, and has been verified by internal and external validations to be robust, stable and has good predicting ability (R2ext > 0.80). A generic QPPR is also developed to predict Kpf or Kmw from chemical's Kow, food or water's ethanol equivalency, and temperature only (R2adj = 0.90), without the need to assign a specific material type. These QPPRs provide a comprehensive correlation method to estimate Kpf for diverse chemical-food-packaging combinations or to estimate Kmw for materials other than food packaging, which will facilitate high-throughput assessments of consumer exposures to chemicals in food packaging and in other solid materials such as building materials, furniture and toys.",Effects of treated wastewater irrigation on the establishment of young grapevines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579205,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Irrigation with treated wastewater could produce excessive accumulations within the plant and soil, negatively affecting the yield and production quality. In addition, the presence of biological and chemical contaminants could harm the agricultural environment, as well as the health of farmers and consumers. During this work, the suitability of secondary and tertiary treated wastewater for use in young grapevines was evaluated by studying the effect of the wastewater irrigation on the soil-plant system, crop yield, fruit quality and the presence of inorganic chemical contamination (salts, elements and heavy metals), organic chemical contamination (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and microbial contamination (E. coli, total coliforms). The results show that tertiary treated wastewater had positive impact on plant growth and yield while secondary treated wastewater had negative impact on fruit safety in comparison with tap water. Sodium levels in soils irrigated with treated wastewater increased at the end of the irrigation period while decreased during the wet season. The total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the soils ranged from 363 μg/kg to 374 μg/kg at the end of the experiment for all irrigation treatments applied. The use of tertiary treated wastewater was recommended for the irrigation of young grapevines as an alternative water source secured protection of environment, plant health and fruit quality.",Novel phosphate-solubilising bacteria isolated from sewage sludge and the mechanism of phosphate solubilisation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579204,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"A great amount of insoluble phosphate in agricultural soils is not available for crops. Three strains of bacteria (Bacillus megaterium YLYP1, Pseudomonas prosekii YLYP6 and Pseudomonas sp. YLYP29) isolated from activated sludge and soil could efficiently solubilise tricalcium phosphate. In particular, the novel strain P. prosekii YLYP6 produced 716 mg L-1 of available phosphate within 6 days under the optimal culture conditions [20 °C, pH 7.9, inoculum size of 0.5% (v:v)] determined by response surface methodology. P. prosekii YLYP6 demonstrated efficient phosphate solubilisation in response to broad variations in pH (5-9) and temperature (15-35 °C). The phosphate solubilisation curves of the strains fit well with a first-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.939), with a half-life of 1.51-5.94 d for 5.0 g L-1 calcium phosphate. Continuous culture experiments combined with scanning electron microscopic observations and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 2,3-dimethylfumaric acid, gluconic and N-butyl-tert-butylamine that were produced by P. prosekii YLYP6 were responsible for phosphate solubilisation by supplying H+ ions and organic anions. Efficient phosphate solubilisation in actual soil by P. prosekii YLYP6 demonstrated the strong application potential to reduce the use of chemical P fertilisers and the resulting agricultural nonpoint pollution.","Combining flux monitoring and data reconstruction to establish annual budgets of suspended particulate matter, mercury and PCB in the Rhône River from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579203,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Long term and high resolution data on water discharge, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and contaminant concentrations in rivers are required for a better understanding of particulate transfers from the continental areas to the seas. The aim of this study was to provide a novel estimation of annual fluxes of SPM and related pollutants in the Rhône River from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea by combining high frequency or time-integrative monitoring and novel relations between SPM concentration (Cs) and water discharge (Q). At six stations of the Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR), SPM fluxes were calculated over the 2000-2016 period by combining observational data and Cs-Q relations. Monthly average concentrations of mercury (Hg) and PCB 180 were obtained by analysis of SPM samples collected in time integrative particle traps between 2011 and 2016. These pollutants were selected because of the well documented contamination of the Rhône watershed by these substances. Inter-annual fluxes at the Rhône River outlet averaged 6.6 Mt. yr-1 for SPM, 572 kg yr-1 for Hg and 14 kg yr-1 for PCB 180. The Isère and Durance tributaries were found to be the main contributors of SPM fluxes. Annual SPM budgets were not balanced, suggesting deposition, remobilization of bottom sediments and/or contributions from non-monitored tributaries. The SPM sampled at the outlet was more contaminated than the combined SPM inputs from the monitored tributaries, suggesting that intermediate sources of contamination were not captured in the budget.",Is dissolved COD a suitable design parameter for ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in wastewater?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579202,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 26,"Ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater was investigated in pilot-scale after a high- and a low loaded activated sludge process. Higher ozone doses were required to remove organic micropollutants in the effluent wastewater from the high loaded activated sludge process. Further comparison of the micropollutant removal was based on normalized ozone doses, expressed as g O3/g DOC and g O3/g soluble COD (sCOD). A clear difference was noted for the two effluents when the micropollutant removal was normalized by DOC. This difference disappeared almost completely when the removal was linked to ozone doses normalized by sCOD. The dose-response curves for the organic micropollutants were practically linear in the removal range up to 95%. A linear prediction model was developed and compared with literature values to test the transferability of the obtained results. Results from this comparison indicated that the slope of the dose-response functions could be used to predict the removal efficiency of organic micropollutants at a third plant with an average uncertainty of 10%. The modeled ozone requirements were then set in relation to the COD concentrations in the discharged water from approximately 90 Swedish activated sludge treatment plants with and without nitrogen removal. This comparison highlighted the need for a well-functioning biological treatment for an effective ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants. The results in this study suggest that soluble COD should be further explored for design and modeling of ozone oxidation of organic micropollutants in biologically treated wastewater."

The surface properties and microstructures were characterized by FTIR, TG-DTG, SEM and TEM, which indicate that GO was effectively reduced to rGO and subsequently loaded onto the outer surface of the microbe Shewanella. CLSM was performed to get insight into the growth of the bacteria after core-shell materials formation. The reduction properties of Shewanella@graphene materials were evaluated using nitrobenzene, a representative model pollutant, as an electron acceptor. The reduction efficiency of Shewanella was improved by strengthening the contact among electron donors, electron shuttles and electron acceptors and changed with the proportions of core-shell materials. The optimal proportion of the core-shell material was OD600 = 0.6:GO = 10 mg/L, which was enhanced by the wrapped rGO and improved adsorption capability. The reduction rate was elevated 30% in comparison with pure Shewanella. In addition, the core-shell material exhibited a favorable recycling performance, which can be reused for at least five times. Facile fabrication and enhanced reduction performance of Shewanella@graphene core-shell composite endows this material with considerable potential in environmental remediation.","Spatial and temporal distribution, chemical characteristics, and sources of ambient particulate matter in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579189,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Particulate matter (PM) pollution is severe in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Although the air quality has improved, the average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in 2016 were still higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard by 2.0 and 1.7 times, respectively. Using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method to analyze the spatial characteristics of its 13 cities, it was found that the BTH region could be categorized into four districts. The first district included Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding; the second district included Handan, Hengshui, and Langfang; the third district included Beijing, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and Tianjin; and the fourth district included Qinhuangdao, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou. PM2.5 samples were collected synchronously in five typical cities, and it was shown that the major chemical constituents of PM included organic carbon (OC), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+), elemental carbon (EC), Si, Cl-, Fe, Al, and Mg. The species with the highest contents were OC in the winter, SO42- and NH4+ in the summer, and NO3- in the spring. The highest concentrations of OC, NO3-, EC, Si, Cl-, Al, and Mg were found in Baoding, and the highest concentrations of SO42-, NH4+, and Fe were found in Shijiazhuang. The sources of PM2.5 were analyzed using the positive matrix factorization model. The major sources of PM2.5 in the BTH region included coal combustion (10.9%-18.6%), secondary inorganic aerosols (35.4%-42.4%), vehicle emissions (10.6%-18.6%), soil/road dust (10.6%-23.6%), and industrial emissions (8.6%-18.2%).",Association between personality traits and risk of suicidal ideation in Chinese university students: Analysis of the correlation among five personalities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579188,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"The purpose of our study was to determine the incidence of suicidal ideation among Chinese college students and to explore the risk factors for suicidal ideation. A large-sample epidemiological survey was conducted in 13 colleges in Chongqing, China (n = 69,790). Suicidal ideation was reported by 13.03% of the college students who were surveyed. The participants with suicidal ideation were more likely to be female, to come from rural areas, and to have poor life quality and psychological disorder compared to those without suicidal ideation. Moreover, this study revealed that neuroticism, psychoticism, impulsivity, and aggression are risk factors for suicidal ideation, while extroversion has a protective effect on suicidal ideation. We found that four personality traits of students with suicidal ideation, including impulsivity, aggression, psychoticism, and neuroticism, are positively correlated. However, there is a negative correlation between extroversion and the other four traits. These findings highlight the need for further exploration of personality traits in the risk of suicidal ideation.",A comparison of visual hallucinations across disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579187,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"Research into hallucinations typically regards them as single sensory or unimodal experiences leading to a comparative neglect of co-occurring multi-sensory hallucinations (MSH). People with psychosis who have visual hallucinations (VH) report high rates of hallucinations in other senses (auditory, olfactory, tactile). However, it is not known if this is similar to other groups who report VH. Consequently, this study explored MSH in four different patient groups who all had current VH. Archival data from standardised assessments of visual hallucinations in people with psychosis (n = 22), eye disease (ED) (n = 82), Lewy body Dementia (LBD) (n = 41), and Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 41) determined the presence of MSH. People with psychosis and visual hallucinations reported significantly higher rates of MSH (auditory, 73%; tactile, 82%; olfactory/gustatory hallucinations, 27%) than the LBD group (auditory, 21%; tactile, 28%; olfactory/gustatory, 6%), ED (auditory, 1%; tactile, 11%; olfactory/gustatory, 0%) and PD patients (auditory, 3%; tactile, 8%; olfactory/gustatory, 3%). Regardless of diagnostic grouping, participants with MSH reported greater conviction that the VH were real, and reported greater distress. People with psychosis with VH report high rates of MSH unlike groups of older adults with VH.

The relationship between FP and delusional experiences has not yet been examined in the literature. The current study hypothesised that FP would be significantly associated with and predict delusion severity as well as the associated delusional distress, preoccupation and conviction. Ninety-five patients with current psychosis (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder) were assessed for overall delusional severity using the PANSS (clinician-rated) and the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI; self-report). FP was assessed using the Creative Experiences Questionnaire (CEQ). Forty-six healthy control participants also completed the PDI and CEQ. Significant positive correlations were observed between FP and delusion severity in both groups; and distress, preoccupation and conviction in patients only. Linear regression analyses, controlling for manic and depressive symptoms, revealed that greater FP predicted higher levels of severity, distress, preoccupation, and conviction associated with delusions in patients, and higher severity only in healthy controls. The findings highlight the role of specific cognitive biases in delusional experiences, and empirically support models of unusual belief formation and maintenance.",Evaluation of serum inflammatory markers in treatment-resistant manic patients and adequate responder manic patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579185,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"Mania is accompanied with immune activation as indicated by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins; and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is known to accompany signs of immune-inflammatory responses in bipolar disorder (BD) and medical disorders.

We analyzed the relationship between PE and psychological disorders by the Pearson correlation and multifactorial logistic regression. There were significant differences in SAS(p < 0.01) and SDS(p < 0.05) scores between the PE and non-PE groups. However, Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was no correlation between ejaculatory latency and SDS.

In this study, adult patients hospitalised for BD treatment (n = 1,591) were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. With survival as the effectiveness measure and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the utility measure, a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was conducted over the 3-year follow-up period by post-discharge frequency of OPD visits. Compared to those making 1-7, 8-12 and 18 or more OPD visits, BD patients making 13-17 OPD visits within the first year after discharge had the lowest psychiatric and total healthcare costs over the follow-up period. With survival status as the effectiveness outcome, making 13-17 OPD visits was more likely to be the cost-effective option, as revealed by incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated that having 13-17 OPD visits was probably the more cost-effective option when considering QALYs; for instance, if society was willing to pay NTD1.5 million for one additional QALY, there was a 75.2% (psychiatric costs) to 77.4% (total costs) likelihood that 13-17 OPD visits was the most cost-effective option. In conclusion, post-discharge OPD appointments with a frequency of 13-17 visits within the first year were associated with lower psychiatric and total healthcare costs in the subsequent 3 years.

We hypothesized that rejection sensitivity would be indirectly associated with suicide ideation (i.e., a cognitive-affective reaction to social rejection) through greater perceptions of rejection (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, constructs from the interpersonal theory of suicide), in parallel. Results from bootstrapped parallel mediation regression procedures indicated that the relation between rejection sensitivity and suicide ideation was significantly indirectly associated through the additive effect of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, such that greater rejection sensitivity was associated with greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and subsequently greater suicide ideation. Further, rejection sensitivity was significantly indirectly associated with suicide ideation independently through thwarted belongingness, but not perceived burdensomeness. These findings provide support for the rejection sensitivity model and the interpersonal theory of suicide in an effort to advance our conceptualization of suicide risk among psychiatric inpatients.",Olfactory and cognitive functions in Chinese individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579181,Psychiatry research,2019 05 20,"The abnormal olfactory function has been regarded as a sign in psychosis. To confirm the theory that olfactory and cognitive functions are deficient in Chinese cohort with clinical high risk state of psychosis, 19 individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRs) and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The CHRs scored significantly lower than the HCs in the olfactory identification test and all other cognitive tests. Our findings suggest that olfactory dysfunction may be an early change of psychosis."

Loratadine and desloratadine residues have been found at very low concentrations (ng/L) in the aquatic environment but their toxic effects are still not well known. Both drugs are light-sensitive even under environmentally simulated conditions and some of the photoproducts have been isolated and characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute and chronic ecotoxicity of loratadine, desloratadine and their light-induced transformation products in organisms of the aquatic trophic chain. Bioassays were performed in the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and in two crustaceans, Thamnocephalus platyurus and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Loratadine exerted its acute and chronic toxicity especially on Ceriodaphnia dubia (LC50: 600 µg/L, EC50: 28.14 µg/L) while desloratadine showed similar acute toxicity among the organisms tested and it was the most chronically effective compound in Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.

Despite the reported toxicity effects, little information is available on their environmental contamination, except for few particular congeners such as diphenylamine. In this study, the occurrence of two kinds of Ar-SAs, substituted diphenylamines (S-DPAs) and novel substituted p-phenylenediamines (S-PPDs), was investigated in dust samples collected from outdoor rubber playgrounds and residential houses. Seven S-DPAs (GM: 102 ng/g) and two S-PPDs (GM: 20.9 ng/g) were detected in indoor dust.

While the growth of one algal species, Chlorella sorokiniana B1-1, was completely inhibited by the addition of pharmaceuticals, and the one of Scenedesmus sp. B2-2 was strongly inhibited, the other algal strains grew well and produced biomass. In general, lipophilic compounds were removed highly efficient from the culture medium by the microalgae (>70% in average within 2 days). The most lipophilic compounds Biperiden, Trihexyphenidyl, Clomipramine and Amitriptyline significantly accumulated in the biomass of most algal species, with a positive correlation between accumulation and their total biomass content. More persistent in the growth medium were hydrophilic compounds like Caffeine, Fluconazole, Trimetoprim, Codeine, Carbamazepin, Oxazepam and Tramadol, which were detected in amounts of above 60% in average after algal treatment. While Coelastrella sp. 3-4 and Coelastrum astroideum RW10 were most efficient to accumulate certain compounds in their biomass, two algae species, Chlorella vulgaris 13-1 and Chlorella saccharophila RNY, were not only highly efficient in removing all 19 pharmaceuticals from the growth medium within 12 days, at the same time only small amounts of these compounds accumulated in their biomass allowing its further use.

However, little attention has been paid to understand the transgenerational effects of DPM. In the present study, we focused on the transgenerational effects of DPM in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) exposed in either maternal generation (F0) or consecutive generations (F0-F5). In maternal exposure manner, 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM significantly increased the germ cell apoptosis at F0 generation, while the number of apoptotic germ cells at F1-F5 generation were gradually recovered back to control level. The brood size were significantly reduced by DPM at F2 generation and recovered to control level at F3-F5 generations. In continuous exposure manner, although 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL DPM induced significant germ cell apoptosis in F0 generation, there was no difference between F0 and other generations. Continuous exposure to DPM at 0.1 and 1.0 µg/mL impaired the brood size in F2 to F5 generations. Using a series of loss-of-function mutant strains, we found that cep-1 (w40), hus-1 (op241), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) related signaling pathway genes were involved in DPM-induced apoptosis. Our results clearly demonstrated that the adverse effects of DPM could be passed on through long-term multigenerational exposure and DNA damage checkpoint genes and MAPK signal pathway played an essential role in response to DPM induced development and reproduction toxicity.",Development of bisphenol A (BPA)-sensing indicator Arabidopsis thaliana which synthesizes anthocyanin in response to BPA in leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579163,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 02 15,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine disruptor which disturbs a normal animal development. We generated an indicator plant that senses and provides a clear visual indicator of an estrogen-like compound BPA in the environment. We developed transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing a construct designed to synthesize anthocyanin (thus showing a red color) in response to BPA. We transformed Arabidopsis with a recombinant vector containing the chimeric estrogen receptor (XVE region), LAP and coding region of PtrMYB119 (transcription factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in poplar and Arabidopsis). Upon binding of the estrogen compound to the ligand-binding domain of E (estrogen receptor) in XVE, the XV domain binds to LAP promoter and triggering the transcription of PtrMYB119 with a subsequent enhancement of anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression, resulting in anthocyanin synthesis. The leaves of the transgenic Arabidopsis line XVE-PtrMYB119 turned red in the presence of 10 ppm BPA. The transcript level of PtrMYB119 peaked at day 3 of BPA exposure, then decreased to its minimal level at day 5. Similar expression patterns to that of PtrMYB119 were detected for genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes chalcone synthase, chalcone flavanone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, anthocyanidin synthase, and UFGT (UGT78D2). The leaves of transgenic plants did not turn red in response to BPA at concentrations below 10 ppm, but PtrMYB119 expression was induced by BPA at concentrations as low as 1 ppt BPA. Since this transgenic plant turns red in the presence of BPA without any experimental procedures, this line can be easily used by non-scientists.",Ambient PM2.5 causes lung injuries and coupled energy metabolic disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579162,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 02 15,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a challenge to public health worldwide. Although increasing numbers of recent epidemiological studies have emphasized the critical role of PM2.5 in promoting respiratory diseases, the precise mechanism behind PM2.5-mediated lung obstruction remains obscure. In the present study, we analyzed lung structure and function and further investigated mitochondrial morphology and transcription-modulated energy metabolism in mice following PM2.5 aspiration. The results showed that PM2.5 exposure reduced pulmonary function and induced severe pathological alterations, including alveolar endothelial disruption and airway obstruction. Based on ultrastructural observations, we also found mitochondrial vacuolation and mitochondrial membrane rupture in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Importantly, the abnormality of mitochondrial structure was coupled with energy metabolism disorders, as evidenced by the decrease in ATP levels, the accumulation of pyruvate and lactate content, and the altered transcription of related genes. Moreover, the reduction in mitochondrial markers, including PGC-1α, NRF-1, and TFAM, were involved in mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest that energy metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction may be the important contributors to pulmonary injuries in response to PM2.5 exposure, indicating possible targets for protection and therapy in polluted areas.",Lipidomic alteration and stress-defense mechanism of soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in response to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579161,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 02 15,"To assess the impacts of man-made extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) on soil ecosystems, the soil nematode was applied as a biological indicator to characterize ecotoxicity of ELF-EMF. In this paper, a soil-living model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was exposed to 50 Hz, 3 mT ELF-EMF. The integrated lipidome, proteome and transcriptome analysis were applied to elucidate physiological acclimations. Lipidomic analysis showed that ELF-EMF exposure induced significant alterations of 64 lipids, including significant elevation of triacylglycerols (TGs). Proteome results implied 157 changed protein expressions under ELF-EMF exposure. By transcriptomic analysis, 456 differently expressed genes were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) function and pathway analyses showed lipidomic alteration, mitochondrial dysfunction and the stress defense responses following ELF-EMF exposure in C. elegans. Conjoint analysis of proteome and transcriptome data showed that a higher expression of genes (sip-1, mtl-1 and rpl-11.1, etc.) were involved in stress defense responses to ELF-EMF exposure. These results indicated that ELF-EMF can induce effects on soil nematodes, mainly through disturbing lipid metabolism such as increasing TGs content, and eliciting stress defense responses. This study provided a new understanding in ELF-EMF exposure effects on soil nematodes and suggested a potential way of interpreting ELF-EMF influences on soil ecosystems.",The effect of maternal tobacco smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure on human milk oxidant-antioxidant status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579160,Environmental research,2019 02 03,"Many women who smoke tobacco continue to do so during lactation, and many non-smoking women are exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) during the period that she wishes to breastfeed.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the gene expression profile and the immunolocalization of β-NGF and its high-affinity receptor TrkA in sex organs in rabbits during sexual maturation period. β-NGF concentration for both SP and blood plasma (BP) and BP testosterone levels were determined as well as the seminal parameters during such period. Ten New Zealand White x California young rabbits were trained to semen collection since 20 weeks of age and routinely done once a week with two ejaculations per session. At 22 and 37 weeks of age, semen collection was carried out three times a week and seminal parameters were evaluated. Four males were randomly assigned and slaughtered in each age (n = 8); sex organs (prostate, bulbourethral glands and epididymis) were dissected and collected to determine β-NGF and TrkA gene expression and immunolocalization. SP and BP were also taken at each semen collection session to evaluate β-NGF concentration, and testosterone levels were also assessed in BP. The highest β-NGF mRNA expression was observed in prostate compared to bulbourethral glands and epididymis. These two last tissues showed residual β-NGF mRNA expression and limited localization of the neurotrophin. The prostate epithelial cells and lumen were strongly stained with regard to the other sex organs indicating that immunolocalization of β-NGF rely mainly in the prostate. TrkA gene expression was lower but constant and differentially immunolocalized in the sex organ tissues. Finally, β-NGF concentration in SP and BP remained unchanged in accordance to age, while some seminal characteristics such as sperm concentration, percentage of live sperm and mass and progressive motility were enhanced as endowed by BP testosterone variation. β-NGF and its cognate TrkA receptor are expressed and immunolocalized in the male reproductive tract in the two ages studied, independently of the circulating levels of testosterone and β-NGF.","Seasonal expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), its receptor IGF-1R and klotho in testis and epididymis of the European bison (Bison bonasus, Linnaeus 1758).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579142,Theriogenology,2019 02 15,"The European bisons are the largest mammals of Europe that are still in danger of extinction.

Our previous studies indicated the involvement of some of the growth factors in the regulation of male seasonal reproductive activities in bison, showing expression patterns that seemed to be regulated by the length of the daylight. In the present study, using RT-PCR and Western blot approaches, we verified the expression and possible relationship between the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), its receptor (IGF-1R), and klotho in testis and epididymis of the European bison in pre- and post-reproductive periods, i.e., in June and in December. The observed expression of IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA in testis and epididymis was higher in June than in December. At the same time, klotho mRNA expression in both testis and epididymis did not differ between the analyzed seasons. However, along with the higher levels of IGF-1R protein observed in June, klotho protein levels for the membrane form and for the secrete form were higher in December than in June. Finally, the messenger and protein expression profiles presented herein indicate the importance of both the IGF-system and klotho in reproductive processes in the European bison, implying their involvement in the regulation of seasonal testicular activity in males of this threatened species.",The effect of non-pharmacological sleep interventions on depression symptoms: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579141,Sleep medicine reviews,2019 05 07,"Poor sleep is a significant risk factor for depression across the lifespan and sleep problems have been hypothesised to contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression symptoms. However, sleep problems are usually not a direct target of interventions for depression. A range of non-pharmacological treatments can reduce sleep problems but it is unclear whether these interventions also reduce other depression symptoms. The aim of this review was to examine whether non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems are effective in reducing symptoms of depression. We carried out a systematic search for randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological sleep interventions that measured depression symptoms as an outcome. Forty-nine trials (n = 5908) were included in a random effects meta-analysis. The pooled standardised mean difference for depression symptoms after treatment for sleep problems was -0.45 (95% CI: -0.55,-0.36). The size of the effect on depression symptoms was moderated by the size of the effect on subjective sleep quality. In studies of participants with mental health problems, sleep interventions had a large effect on depression symptoms (d = -0.81, 95% CI: -1.13,-0.49). The findings indicate that non-pharmacological sleep interventions are effective in reducing the severity of depression, particularly in clinical populations. This suggests that non-pharmacological sleep interventions could be offered as a treatment for depression, potentially improving access to treatment.",Effects of National Health Insurance on household out-of-pocket expenditure structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579140,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 02 15,"Achieving universal health insurance coverage is a major objective for many countries. Taiwan implemented its National Health Insurance (NHI) program with universal coverage in 1995. This study investigates whether the NHI program affects the level and structures of out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures. We used data from the Taiwan Survey of Family Income and Expenditure released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. We identified a case and a control group and then employed coarsened exact matching to match the two groups using several available variables. We then conducted a difference-in-difference analysis and determined that there was a statistically significant negative effect on OOP expenditure that was attributable to NHI (a reduction of 2.11 percentage points in total household expenditure). The largest reductions were found in health care services (-1.63%) and pharmaceuticals (-0.45%). We found a statistically significant positive effect on purchases of private insurance related to health care, which was attributable to NHI (an increase of 0.96 percentage points in household budget share). In addition, we discovered that the NHI program had a greater impact on households of a lower socioeconomic status compared with higher socioeconomic status households. The structure of OOP payments in the post-NHI period remained similar to that of the pre-NHI period in the full sample but varied slightly depending on the educational level of the head of the household.",Evaluation of the antimicrobial and intestinal integrity properties of boric acid in broiler chickens infected with Salmonella enteritidis: Proof of concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579139,Research in veterinary science,2019 05 09,"The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of boric acid (BA) on Salmonella enteritidis colonization, intestinal permeability, total intestinal IgA levels, and cecal microbiota composition in broiler chickens. For this purpose, sixty day-old-chicks were randomly allocated to one of two groups: 1) non-treated control group and 2) 0.1% (w/w) BA in feed. All chicks were challenged with 104 cfu of S.

On day 3 and 10 post-challenge, samples of crop and ceca-cecal tonsils (CCT) were aseptically collected to evaluate overall aerobic and lactic acid bacteria, as well as S. Enteritidis recovery. Blood and intestinal samples were also collected to evaluate intestinal permeability and total intestinal IgA production, respectively. On day 10 post-challenge, the concentration of S. Enteritidis in crop and CCT significantly decreased (P < .05) by 2.60 log10 and 5.26 log10, respectively, in the BA group compared to the control group. Furthermore, chickens treated with 0.1% BA had a significant reduction in serum fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) concentration and lower total intestinal IgA levels when compared to the control group. Interestingly, in the microbiota analysis, only the abundance of Actinobacteria phylum was significantly lower in the BA group in comparison with the control group and significant differences in beta diversity were also observed between comparing groups. The results of the present study suggest that BA could maintain intestinal homeostasis, as well as the balance in the microbiota due to its effectiveness in controlling S.

The iridium complexes possessed excellent antiproliferative properties, a substantial improvement over cisplatin, especially the best 1C containing the fluorine atom and 2C containing the naphthyridine. On the contrary, the ruthenium complexes displayed much less antiproliferative activity. Two X-ray crystal structures were determined. The cytotoxicity of the complexes can be changed flexible by regulating the metal center and the ancillary ligands. The best complex 1C was chose to study further on the mechanism of action. The chemical reactivity such as hydrolysis, reaction with nucleobases, glutathione and catalytic conversion of NADH to NAD+, were investigated. Complex 1C can react with 9-ethylguanine (9-EtG) and catalyze oxidation of NADH. In addition, the self-luminescence of the complex 1C was also successfully used in confocal microscopy images for elucidating the subcellular localization. Complex 1C specifically targeted to lysosomes in A549 cancer cells and caused lysosomal damages and promote cathepsin B released. Flow cytometry studies confirmed that the biological effects of this type of complexes induced apoptosis, especially late apoptosis. Our results suggested that changes in the mitochondria membrane potential were responsible for apoptosis. The chemistry and biological studies has showed that this class of metal complexes are worthy of further exploration for the design of novel anticancer drugs.",Current scenario of artemisinin and its analogues for antimalarial activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579122,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 02 15,"Human malaria, one of the most striking, reemerging infectious diseases, is caused by several types of Plasmodium parasites. Whilst advances have been made in lowering the numbers of cases and deaths, it is clear that a strategy based solely on disease control year on year, without reducing transmission and ultimately eradicating the parasite, is unsustainable. Natural products have served as a template for the design and development of antimalarial drugs currently in the clinic or in the development phase. Artemisinin combine potent, rapid antimalarial activity with a wide therapeutic index and an absence of clinically important resistance. The alkylating ability of artemisinin and its semi-synthetic analogues toward heme related to their antimalarial efficacy are underlined. Although impressive results have already been achieved in malaria research, more systematization and concentration of efforts are required if real breakthroughs are to be made. This review will concisely cover the clinical, preclinical antimalarial and current updates in artemisinin based antimalarial drugs. Diverse classes of semi-synthetic analogs of artemisinin reported in the last decade have also been extensively studied. The experience gained in this respect is discussed.",Discovery of novel nonsteroidal VDR agonists with novel diarylmethane skeleton for the treatment of breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579121,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 02 15,"Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is recognized as a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer which is the most common malignancy among women in the world. In this study, a series of nonsecosteroidal VDR agonists with a novel diarylmethane skeleton was designed, synthesized and the anti-tumor activities of these compounds were determined. Compound 28 was identified as the most effective agents in reducing the viability of MCF-7 cells, with a low IC50 via the inhibition of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis by regulating the expression of p21, Bcl2 and Bax. In addition, compound 28 showed high VDR-binding affinity and displayed significant VDR-agonistic activities. Further investigation revealed that compound 28 inhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic breast-tumor model without causing hypercalcemia which is the main side effect of secosteroidal VDR modulators. In summary, these findings discovered novel VDR modulators as promising candidates for cancer chemotherapy.","The photodynamic activity and toxicity evaluation of 5,10,15-tris(ethoxylcarbonyl)corrole phosphorus(V) in vivo and in vitro.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579120,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 02 15,"The development of novel, efficient and nontoxic photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenging task for photodynamic therapy (PDT).

In vitro photodynamic activities and toxicity of 1-P in HepG2 xenograft tumours was evaluated by standard assay. The results shown 1-P displayed a potential efficient and low-toxic PS, which suggesting this kind of corrole is a powerful and promising antitumor PS for PDT. In addition, the potential anti-tumour mechanism study of 1-P was also investigated by the apoptosis antibody array, immunohistochemical and western blotting assay (WB) experiments, we found that the PDT activity of 1-P can degrade SIRT1 (an important deacetylase), and activate the Fas signal pathway to inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells.",Substrate binding versus escape dynamics in a pH-affected fungal beta-glucosidase revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579119,Carbohydrate research,2019 06 04,"The cellulolytic ability of fungal species is important to both natural and engineered biocycling of plant matter. One essential step is the conversion of cellobiose into glucose catalyzed by beta-glucosidases. Mutagenesis studies have implicated altering the substrate binding pocket to influence the pH-activity profile of this enzyme. However, structural understanding of the pH-affected substrate binding environment is lacking. Here we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of fully hydrated TrBgl2, a beta-glucosidase of Trichoderma reesei, equilibrated at its optimal pH (pH 6) and two unfavorable pHs (pH 5 and pH 7.5). We identified structural arrangement of specific residues that facilitated substrate escape from the catalytic site at pH 5 but locked the bound substrate in an unfavorable orientation at pH 7.5. For comparative analysis, we also performed simulations of a mutated TrBgl2 with previously demonstrated improved catalysis as a function of pH. We captured the responsible conformational changes in the engineered substrate binding pocket.",USP25 promotes endotoxin tolerance via suppressing K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3 in Kupffer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579117,Molecular immunology,2019 04 30,"The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) degradation induces endotoxin tolerance (ET) in macrophages. However, the mechanisms leading to TRAF3 inhibition by ET are largely unknown. Here, we found that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 25 (USP25), a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), interacted with TRAF3 and stabilized ET in Kupffer cells (KCs). Lentiviral knockdown of USP25 activated K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and the cytoplasmic translocation of the Myd88-associated multiprotein complex in tolerized KCs. This outcome led to a subsequent activation of Myd88-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines. The overexpression of TRAF3 attenuated the proinflammatory effects of USP25 knockdown in tolerized KCs. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of endotoxin-mediated TRAF3 degradation in KCs.",Ecological momentary assessment of various tobacco product use among young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579116,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 07,"Young adults are at high risk for using traditional and novel tobacco products.

The aims of this study were thus to derive a map of how problematic gambling behaviours and harms are situated across a continuum, and identify the best available indicators of low severity problems to inform assessment and secondary prevention. This involved the Rasch analyses of baseline data from the Quinte Longitudinal Study (QLS); a community-based survey involving random-digit dialling of numbers around Belleville, Canada. Participants were n = 1305 adults with non-zero scores across 26-items from: the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI); the NORC DSM Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS); and the Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure (PPGM). Results indicated that item-level measures except chasing losses provided fit to the Rasch model, and most were clustered within a narrow region of the continuum which resembled addictive disorders. At the most severe end were mainly items about harms, while there were few items representing low severity levels (feeling guilty, betting more than one can afford, attempts to reduce gambling, gambling more than intended). There was Differential Item Functioning (DIF) for several indicators of low severity problems. The findings suggest that measures remain closely aligned with psychiatric models and are suited for discriminating across severe levels of problem gambling or addictive disorder. Although cognitive-affective and behavioural indicators comprise the best available indicators of low severity symptoms, there is an urgent need for improvements in conceptualisation and measurement.",Patterns of sustained e-cigarette use in a sample of young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579114,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 07,"E-cigarette use and devices are rapidly changing, yet there is not much scientific evidence examining these changes over time.

For this reason, this review comprehensively discussed the biomass production, SW treatment efficiencies, and bioenergy generation potentials through cultivating microalgae in SW. Microalgae species grow well in SW with large amounts of biomass being produced, despite the impact of various parameters (e.g., nutrients and toxicants levels, cultivation conditions, and bacteria in SW).

Despite significant microbiological reduction on pork skin, further studies should be carried out to optimize this promising technology.",Transdermal delivery of 40-nm silk fibroin nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579057,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Transdermal administration of drugs improves their bioavailability and is capable of systemic and local treatment. To improve the skin permeability of drugs, nano-sized systems have attracted attention as drug carriers for transdermal drug delivery system. We considered that silk fibroin composed of a crystalline region with many hydrophobic amino acids and an amorphous region with many hydrophilic amino acids was useful as a carrier for transdermal administration of a drug because of the balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. In this study, silk fibroin nanoparticles with mean volume diameters of 42.3 nm were successfully prepared, and storage stability was confirmed by storing the nanoparticle suspension at 4, 32, and 37 °C for a week. At any storage temperature, the mean volume diameter and standard deviation were stable. The polydispersity indexes were 0.19-0.23, and no specific trends were observed. Then, to investigate the transdermal delivery route of the silk fibroin nanoparticles, skin permeability in vivo was evaluated using mice. Six hours after administration, fluorescent substances were observed in the dermis in addition to the stratum corneum, hair follicles and the epidermis around them. This result indicated that fibroin nanoparticles with the mean volume diameter of 40-nm penetrated the stratum corneum and was delivered deep into the skin. Therefore, it was suggested that small nanoparticles prepared using silk fibroin are useful for drug delivery to the dermis.",Carrier particle mediated stabilization and isolation of valsartan nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579056,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Drug nanoparticles are a promising solution to the challenging issues of low dissolution rates and erratic bioavailability due to their greater surface/volume ratio. The central purpose of this study is to prepare, stabilize and isolate nanoparticles of poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into a dried form with the help of clay carrier particles. Isolation of nanoparticles from suspension into the dried state is crucial to avoid the problems of aggregation and Ostwald ripening. In this study nanoparticles of the API valsartan were generated via a reverse antisolvent process at high supersaturations. Montmorillonite (MMT) and protamine functionalized montmorillonite (PA-MMT) were employed for stabilization and isolation of the valsartan (Val) nanoparticles (ca. 50 nm) into a dried form. A high dissolution rate of the resultant solid formulation at high drug loadings (up to 33.3% w/w) was achieved. The dissolution rates of the isolated valsartan nanoparticle carrier composites (dried Val-MMT nanocomposites and dried Val-PA-MMT nanocomposites) were similar to that of freshly prepared suspended valsartan nanoparticles, confirming that the high surface area of the nanoparticles is retained during the adsorption and drying processes. Differential scanning calorimetry and PXRD studies indicated that the valsartan nanoparticles were amorphous when adsorbed onto the carrier particles. The dissolution rates of the Val-MMT and Val-PA-MMT nanocomposites were maintained after 10 months' storage which indicates that no aggregation or solid state transformation of the carrier-stabilized Val nanoparticles had occurred.",Defined cell adhesion for silicon-based implant materials by using vapor-deposited functional coatings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579055,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"The field of implantable electronics relies on using silicon materials due to the merits of a well-established fabrication process and favorable properties; of particular interest is the surface modification of such materials. In the present study, we introduce a surface modification technique based on coatings of functionalized Parylene on silicon substrates, where the modified layers provide a defined cell adhesion capability for the resultant silicon materials/devices. Functionalization of Parylene was achieved during a one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization process, forming NHS ester-functionalized Parylene, and subsequent RGD attachment was enabled via a conjugation reaction between the NHS ester and amine groups. The modification procedures additionally provided a clean and gentle approach to avoid thermal excursions, intense irradiation, chemicals, or solvents that might damage delicate structures or sensitive molecules on the devices. The modification layers exhibited excellent mechanical strength on the substrate, meeting the high standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and the resultant cell adherence property was verified by a centrifugation assay and the analysis of attached cell morphologies; the results collectively demonstrated robust and sustainable modification layers of the NHS ester-functionalized Parylene and confirmed that the cell-adherence property imparted by using this facile modification technique was effective. The modification technology is expected to benefit the design of prospective interface properties for silicon-based devices and related industrial products.",PEG-coated vesicles from Pluronic/lipid mixtures for the carrying of photoactive erythrosine derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579054,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Liposomes are very attractive membrane models and excellent drug delivery systems. Concerning their drug delivery aspects, the mixing liposomes with biocompatible copolymers allows for stability and the incorporation of several drugs. We developed PEG coated vesicles from the mixture of DPPC and F127 Pluronic copolymer to obtain long-circulating nanoparticles (mixed vesicles). We employed an innovative process previously developed by us: a small amount of F127 mixed in DPPC, thin film preparation, followed by hydration (lipids plus F127) using a bath sonicator cleaner type, forming unilamellar spherical vesicles with diameter ∼100 nm. The formed PEG coated vesicles were incorporated with the xanthene dye Erythrosine B (ERY), and its ester derivatives as photosensitizers (PS) for photodynamic proposes. The F127/DPPC mixed vesicles promoted a higher PS incorporation, and with better thermal and kinetic stability, at least 60 days, when compared to conventional DPPC liposome. The binding constant and quenching analysis revealed that with a higher PS hydrophobicity, PS affinity increases toward the nanoparticle and results in a deeper PS location inside the lipid bilayer. An increment in the fluorescence quantum yield was observed, while the PS singlet oxygen generations remained high. Dialysis studies demonstrated that PS were released based on their hydrophobicity. Permeation analysis showed that all PS can reach the deeper regions of the skin. The Decyl Ester derivative/nanoparticle exhibited high photoactivity against Caco-2 cancer cells (in vitro studies). The PEG coated from F127/DPPC mixed vesicles are very promising nanocarriers for erythrosine and its derivatives.",Lipid core nanoparticles as a broad strategy to reverse fluconazole resistance in multiple Candida species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579053,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Fungal resistance is the major problem related to fluconazole treatments. This study aims to develop innovative lipid core nanocapsules and nanostructured lipid carriers containing fluconazole, to study in vitro antifungal activity and to assess the possibility of resistance reversion in Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis isolates. The action mechanism of nanoparticles was investigated through efflux pumps and scanning electron microscopy studies. The lipid core nanocapsules and nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer and high-pressure homogenization methods, respectively. Both nanostructures presented sizes below 250 nm, SPAN < 1.6, negative zeta potential, pH slightly acid, high drug content and controlled drug release. The nanostructured lipid carriers were unable to reverse the fungal resistance. Lipid core nanoparticles displayed advantages such as a reduction in the effective dose of fluconazole and resistance reversion in all isolates tested - with multiple mechanisms of resistance. The main role of the supramolecular structure and the composition of the nanoparticles on antifungal mechanisms of action were discussed. The results achieved through this study have an impact on clinical therapy, with a potential application in the treatment of fungal infections caused by resistant isolates of Candida spp.","Visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac by carbon quantum dots modified porous g-C3N4: Mechanisms, degradation pathway and DFT calculation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579052,Water research,2019 02 03,"Metal-free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern in recent years. In this work, a new class of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is synthesized via a facile polymerization method. With the optimal CQDs loading, the CQDs modified g-C3N4 exhibits ∼15 times higher degradation kinetic towards diclofenac (DCF) than that of pure g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the improved separation of charge carriers as well as the tuned band structure. Moreover, a photosensitation-like mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photo-generated electrons transfer and reactive radicals formation. CQDs are anchored to g-C3N4 surface via C-O bond, which provide channels for the preferential transfer of photo-excited electrons on DCF molecule to the conduction band of g-C3N4. Superoxide radical (·O2-) dominates the degradation of DCF, while holes (h+) show a negligible contribution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation successfully predicts that the sites on DCF molecule with high Fukui index (f0) are preferable to be attacked by radicals. DCF degradation pathway mainly includes ring hydroxylation, ring closure and C-N bond cleavage processes. Acute toxicity estimation indicates the formation of less toxic intermediates/products compared to DCF after photocatalysis. Moreover, the hybrid photocatalysts exhibit good reusability in five consecutive cycles. This work not only proposes a deep insight into photosensitation-like mechanism in the photocatalysis system by using C3N4-based materials, but also develops new photocatalysts for potential application on removal of emerging organic pollutants from waters and wastewaters.",Sulfur and iron cycles promoted nitrogen and phosphorus removal in electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland treating wastewater treatment plant effluent with high S/N ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579051,Water research,2019 02 03,"Phosphate (PO43--P) and nitrate (NO3--N) in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants are the predominant sources of eutrophication. In this study, a bench-scale electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland (E-VFCW) was developed, which exhibited favorable PO43--P (89.7-99.4%), NO3--N (82.7-99.6%), and TN (51.9-93.7%) removal efficiency in tertiary wastewater treatment. In addition, little N2O accumulation (0.32-2.19% of △NO3--N) was observed. The study further elucidated that PO43--P was removed mainly in the anode chamber by co-precipitation (Fe(n+)OH-PO4) and adsorption (FeOOH-PO4) pathways. Multi-pathway of NO3--N reduction was proposed, with 13.9-30.2% of NO3--N predominantly eliminated in the anode chamber by ferrous-dependent NO3--N reduction bacteria. In the cathode chamber, electrons storage and resupply modes during S cycle exerted crucial roles in NO3--N reduction, which enhanced the resilience capabilities of the E-VFCW to shock loadings. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that 3.3-6.6 mmol e-/cycle were stored in the form of S0, FeS, and FeS2 in the E-VFCW under longer HRT or higher current density. However, the deposited S resupplied 19.6% and 28.3% of electrons for NO3--N reduction under shorter HRT (1 h) or lower current density (0.01 mA cm-2). Moreover, ferrous-driven NO3--N-reducing or DNRA bacteria also promoted NO3--N elimination in the cathode chamber. These findings provide new insight into the coupling interactions among S, Fe and H cycles, as well as N and P transformations in electrochemically assisted NO3--N reduction systems.","Plant genome sequences: past, present, future.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579050,Current opinion in plant biology,2019 05 22,"The green plants (Viridiplantae) are an essential kingdom of life, responsible via photosynthesis for the majority of global primary production, and directly utilized by humankind for nutrition, animal feed, fuel, clothing, medicine and other purposes. There are an estimated 391 000 species of land plants, in addition to 8000 species of green algae. Their genomes are unusually diverse compared to those of other kingdoms, ranging in size from ∼10 Mb to over 100 Gb. Knowledge of plant genomes initially lagged behind those of other kingdoms but has greatly increased with the development of new technologies for DNA sequencing; bioinformatic analysis, rather than data production, is increasingly the bottleneck to further knowledge. Recent proposals are now contemplating the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the genomes of all of the world's plant species; meanwhile, low coverage sequencing to measure diversity across collections and wild populations has already become commonplace for many species, especially those utilized as crops.",Intraoperative clinical application of augmented reality in neurosurgery: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579049,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2019 01 29,"The interest and potential use of augmented reality (AR) in several medical fields since the early 90's has increased consistently. It provides intraoperative guidance for surgical procedures by rendering visible what cannot be seen directly, possibly affecting surgical outcomes. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the intraoperative clinical application of augmented reality in neurosurgery, in studies published during the last five years. We carried out an electronic search in the PUBMED database using the terms ""Augmented Reality"" and ""Neurosurgery."" After exclusions, 12 published articles that evaluated the utility of intraoperative clinical applications in surgical settings were included in our review. The results evaluated involved AR technique and visualization, time, complications, projection error, and located structures. We can conclude that the neurovascular application is the most frequent type of use for AR in neurosurgery (47.3%), followed by applications in neuro-oncological pathologies (46.7%), and non-vascular and non-neoplasic lesions (5.9%). The use of AR also allows a surgeon to maintain their view on the operative site permanently, and is useful for locating structures, guiding resections, and planning the craniotomy with more precision, decreasing the risk of injury. The intraoperative application of an augmented reality system helps to improve the quality and characteristics of the surgical field image. The injection of 3D images with AR allows for the successful integration of images in vascular, oncological and other lesions without the need of look away from the surgical field, improving safety, surgical experience, or clinical outcome. However, comparative studies are still required to determine its effectiveness."
