Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultivated on hydrogels for 7, 14 and 21 days. Cell morphology was visualized using fluorescent staining at Days 7 and 14 for fibroblast cells and Days 14 and 21 for HUVEC. Metabolic activity of cells was analyzed using a colorimetric assay (water soluble tetrazolium (WST) assay). Compared to pure Alg, Alg/SPI and Alg/SPI/BG provided superior surfaces for both types of cells, supporting their attachment, growth, spreading and metabolic activity. Fibroblasts showed better colonization and growth on Alg/SPI/BG hydrogels compared to Alg/SPI hydrogels.

The interactions between dyes and surfactants may influence the hydrolysis of dye during dyeing. In this investigation, the effect of ethylene oxide content in nonionic surfactant on the hydrolytic reaction of reactive dye was firstly investigated in a siloxane reverse emulsion dyeing system. Compared with no surfactants, the hydrolytic reaction of vinyl sulfone reactive dye was a slowdown when some nonionic surfactants were used during dyeing. Usually, the hydrophobic groups in nonionic surfactants were dodecyl chains but their polar head groups were different. The hydrolytic reaction of vinyl sulfone dye showed that the longer of EO (ethylene oxide) chains, the faster the hydrolytic reaction of vinyl sulfone dye. From the absorption spectrum of dye, it could be concluded that more of dyes would be solubilized into the formed micelles, and dye-surfactant complexes were adhered to the surface of micelles if the molecular structure of surfactant had a shorter EO chains. Furthermore, the intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bond could be formed between dye and surfactant, which would further influence the hydrolytic reaction of vinyl sulfone dye. However, the solubility of surfactant in siloxane non-aqueous media would decrease with the increase of EO chains. Meanwhile, the dispersion of dye was enhanced as well as the hydrolytic reaction of dye. From this investigation, some surfactant can be used to improve the fixation of reactive dye during dyeing. Furthermore, washing times after dyeing and the ecological problems can be decreased.",Effects of Hydrothermal Pretreatment on the Structural Characteristics of Organosolv Lignin from Triarrhena lutarioriparia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961082,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effects of hydrothermal pretreatment (170⁻180 °C, 30⁻60 min) on the structural characteristics of enzymatic and extracted lignin from Triarrhena lutarioriparia (TL) during the integrated delignification process have been comprehensively investigated. Ion chromatography and NMR characterization showed that liquid products after mild hydrothermal process (170 °C, 30 min) were mainly composed of xylooligosaccharide (XOS) with different degrees of polymerization (DP ≥ 2). In addition, the structural changes of lignin during hydrothermal pretreatment and organic acid delignification process have been demonstrated by quantitative 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (2D-HSQC) and 31P-NMR techniques. Results showed that the structural changes of lignin (e.g., cleavage of β-O-4 linkages) induced by the hydrothermal pretreatment will facilitate the subsequent organic acid delignification process, and acetylated lignin could be obtained with a considerable yield, which can be used in lignin-based composite and candidate feedstock for catalytic upgrading of lignin. In short, the proposed process facilitates the producing of XOS and acetylated lignin for lignin valorization.",Slip Spring-Based Mesoscopic Simulations of Polymer Networks: Methodology and the Corresponding Computational Code.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961081,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In previous work by the authors, a new methodology was developed for Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo (BD/kMC) simulations of polymer melts. In this study, this methodology is extended for dynamical simulations of crosslinked polymer networks in a coarse-grained representation, wherein chains are modeled as sequences of beads, each bead encompassing a few Kuhn segments. In addition, the C++ code embodying these simulations, entitled Engine for Mesoscopic Simulations for Polymer Networks (EMSIPON) is described in detail. A crosslinked network of cis-1,4-polyisoprene is chosen as a test system. From the thermodynamic point of view, the system is fully described by a Helmholtz energy consisting of three explicit contributions: entropic springs, slip springs and non-bonded interactions. Entanglements between subchains in the network are represented by slip springs. The ends of the slip springs undergo thermally activated hops between adjacent beads along the chain backbones, which are tracked by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, creation/destruction processes are included for the slip springs at dangling subchain ends. The Helmholtz energy of non-bonded interactions is derived from the Sanchez⁻Lacombe equation of state. The isothermal compressibility of the polymer network is predicted from equilibrium density fluctuations in very good agreement with the underlying equation of state and with experiment. Moreover, the methodology and the corresponding C++ code are applied to simulate elongational deformations of polymer rubbers. The shear stress relaxation modulus is predicted from equilibrium simulations of several microseconds of physical time in the undeformed state, as well as from stress-strain curves of the crosslinked polymer networks under deformation.",The Continuum Approach to the Description of Semi-Crystalline Polymers Deformation Regimes: The Role of Dynamic and Translational Defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961080,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper presents a new approach to describe the mechanical behavior of semi-crystalline polymers, the plastic deformation of which is determined by their two-phase structure. To describe the plastic behavior of semi-crystalline polymers, a two-phase model is used. In the framework of this model, one phase is in a hard (crystalline) state, and the other in a soft (amorphous) state. The two-phase material is modeled by a single-phase homogeneous continuum based on the approximation of the effective medium. It is assumed that two infinitely close material points of the continuum are connected in series by elastic and viscous bonds, which corresponds to the Maxwell model. It is shown that, in this case, the Maxwell continuum is a pseudo-Euclidean space. Generalizing the definition of defects from a three-dimensional space to a four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space, we obtained a dynamic system of nonlinear, interrelated equations to describe the behavior of translational-type defects in the solid phase and dynamic defects in the amorphous phase. As an example of an application for these equations, the phenomenon of creep under uniaxial loading is considered. It is shown that the formalism of the proposed two-phase model makes it possible to describe creep phenomenon regularities, which correspond to both the aging theory and the flow theory.",Mechanisms of the Complex Thermo-Mechanical Behavior of Polymer Glass Across a Wide Range of Temperature Variations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961079,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper aims to explore the mechanisms of the complex thermo-mechanical behavior of polymer glass across a wide range of temperature variations. To this end, the free vibration frequency spectrum of simply supported poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beams was thoroughly investigated with the aid of the impulse excitation technique. It was found that the amplitude ratio of the multiple peaks in the frequency spectrum is a strongly dependent on temperature, and that the peaks correspond to the multiple vibrational modes of the molecular network of PMMA. At a low temperature, the vibration is dominated by the overall microstructure of PMMA. With increasing the temperature, however, the contribution of the sub-microstructures is retarded by β relaxation. Above 80 °C, the vibration is fully dominated by the microstructure after relaxation. The relaxation time at the transition temperature is of the same order of the vibration period, confirming the contribution of β relaxation. These findings provide a precise method for establishing reliable physical-based constitutive models of polymer glass.",Effects of Calcium Alginate Submicroparticles on Seed Germination and Seedling Growth of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961078,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Calcium alginate (CaAlg) submicroparticles have a potential application in agricultural delivery systems. This study investigated the effects of CaAlg submicroparticles on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat. CaAlg submicroparticles with a Z-average diameter of around 250.4 nm and a measured zeta potential value of about -25.4 mV were prepared and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). After this, the effects of the concentration of CaAlg submicroparticles (10⁻500 μg/mL) on germination percentage, seedling length, the number of adventitious roots, chlorophyll content and soluble protein content were evaluated. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the level of germination percentage (9.0%), seedling index (50.3%), adventitious roots (27.5%), seedling length (17.0%), chlorophyll (8.7%) and soluble protein contents (4.5%) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. However, an inhibitory effect was observed at a concentration of 500 μg/mL. The SEM examination showed that CaAlg submicroparticles could be successfully adsorbed onto the surface of the wheat seed. Further studies proved that CaAlg submicroparticles at a concentration of 100 μg/mL promoted the expression of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-related genes (YUCCA9, AUX1, ARF and UGT) in wheat, which resulted in an increase of 69% and 21% in IAA concentration in wheat roots and shoots, respectively.",Recycled Carbon Fiber-Supported Polyaniline/Manganese Dioxide Prepared via One-Step Electrodeposition for Flexible Supercapacitor Integrated Electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961077,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The exploration of multifunctional electrode materials has been a hotspot for the development of high-performance supercapacitors.

The catalytic activities of these three platinum catalysts were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrometer (¹H NMR). The properties of bio-phenol siloxane were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT⁻IR), UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV) and thermogravimeter (TGA), and its antibacterial property against Escherichia coli was also studied. The results showed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst Pt-CNT was preferable. When the catalyst concentration was 100 ppm, the reaction temperature was 80 °C and reaction time was 6 h, the reactant conversion rate reached 97%. After modification with bio-phenol, the thermal stability of the obtained bio-phenol siloxane was improved. For bio-phenol siloxane, when the ratio of weight loss reached 98%, the pyrolysis temperature was raised to 663 °C which was 60 °C higher than hydrogenterminated siloxane. Meanwhile, its autonomic antibacterial property against Escherichia coli was improved significantly.","A Phenolphthalein-Dummy Template Molecularly Imprinted Polymer for Highly Selective Extraction and Clean-Up of Bisphenol A in Complex Biological, Environmental and Food Samples.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961075,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for highly selective solid-phase extraction (SPE) of bisphenol A (BPA) was prepared using phenolphthalein (PP) as the novel dummy template by bulk polymerization.

During their manufacturing, the reinforcements or prepregs should be performed to the desired shape beforehand. Mechanical behaviours accordingly play an important role during this process. However, this preforming process is usually under high temperatures, thus, the mechanical behaviours could be modified under this state. Especially for reinforcements produced by flax yarns, has barely been studied. To fill this gap, in this paper the thermos-mechanical characterization of Flax/Polyamide12 (PA12) commingled yarn and prepreg woven fabric is analysed using tensile and in-plane shearing tests under different temperatures and tensile speeds. The results conclusively show that strength can be improved by increasing the temperature below the PA12 melting value on woven fabrics, which is inverse tendency for single yarn. Moreover, increasing tensile speed could increase the strength of the single yarn and fabric. This reveals that the PA12 fluidity has great influence on tensile behaviour. The characterisation results would be employed as prescriptive recommendations in the process of manufacturing flax fibre-reinforced composite parts.",Inorganic and Organic Hybrid Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Crosslinkers for Rubber Vulcanization with High-Filler Rubber Interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961063,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Improving the interfacial interaction between rubber and silica nanoparticles, and simultaneously reducing free sulfur and preventing migration and volatilization of a rubber vulcanizing agent, commercial sulfur compound aliphatic ether polysulfide (VA-7) was chemically attached to the silica surface to obtain a functionalized nanoparticle (silica-s-VA7). Functional nanoparticles can not only effectively crosslink rubber without sulfur as a novel vulcanizator, but are also evenly dispersed in the rubber matrix and improve the dispersion of the remaining pristine silica as an interfacial compatibilizer. In addition, the thicker immobilized polymer layer and prominent crosslinking density of SBR nanocomposites simultaneously demonstrate that the novel vulcanizing agent silica-s-VA7 gives rise to significant improvement on the rubber⁻filler interfacial adhesion on account of the covalent linkages of organic and inorganic interfaces between elastomer and nanofillers. We envisage that this strategy may provide a new avenue to implement high-efficiency design for a multifunctional rubber-vulcanizing agent through an organic and inorganic hybridization mechanism.",Enhanced Adsorption of Bisphenol A from Aqueous Solution with 2-Vinylpyridine Functionalized Magnetic Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961062,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, a novel 2-vinylpyridine functionalized magnetic nanoparticle (Mag-PVP) was successfully prepared. The prepared Mag-PVP was characterized by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and was used for the adsorption of bisphenol A (BPA) from aqueous solutions. Mag-PVP, which is composed of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles and poly divinylbenzene-2-vinylpyridine (with a thickness of 10 nm), exhibited magnetic properties (Ms = 44.6 emu/g) and thermal stability. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) of Mag-PVP for BPA obtained from the Langmuir isotherm was 115.87 mg/g at 20 °C, which was more than that of Fe₃O₄ nanospheres. In the presence of NaCl, the improved adsorption capacity of Mag-PVP was probably attributed to the screening effect of Mag-PVP surface charge and salting-out effect. In the presence of CaCl₂ and humic acid (HA), the adsorption capacity of BPA decreased due to competitive adsorption. The adsorption of BPA by Mag-PVP increased slightly with the increase in pH from 3.0 to 5.0 and obtained the largest adsorption amount at pH 5.0, which was probably attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, in actual water, Mag-PVP still showed excellent adsorption performance in removing BPA. The high adsorption capacity and excellent reusability performance in this work indicated that Mag-PVP was an effective adsorbent for removing BPA from aqueous solutions.",Development of a Semiglobal Reaction Mechanism for the Thermal Decomposition of a Polymer Containing Reactive Flame Retardants: Application to Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Polybutylene Terephthalate Blended with Aluminum Diethyl Phosphinate and Melamine Polyphosphate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961061,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This work details a methodology for parameterization of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the thermal decomposition of polymers blended with reactive additives. This methodology employs Thermogravimetric Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Microscale Combustion Calorimetry, and inverse numerical modeling of these experiments. Blends of glass-fiber-reinforced polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) with aluminum diethyl phosphinate and melamine polyphosphate were used to demonstrate this methodology. These additives represent a potent solution for imparting flame retardancy to PBT. The resulting lumped-species reaction model consisted of a set of first- and second-order (two-component) reactions that defined the rate of gaseous pyrolyzate production. The heats of reaction, heat capacities of the condensed-phase reactants and products, and heats of combustion of the gaseous products were also determined. The model was shown to reproduce all aforementioned experiments with a high degree of detail. The model also captured changes in the material behavior with changes in the additive concentrations. Second-order reactions between the material constituents were found to be necessary to reproduce these changes successfully. The development of such models is an essential milestone toward the intelligent design of flame retardant materials and solid fuels.",Optimization of Mechanical and Thermal Properties of iPP and LMPP Blend Fibres by Surface Response Methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961060,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Optimization of the mechanical and thermal properties of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) homopolymer blended with relatively new low molecular low modulus polypropylene (LMPP) at different blend ratios was carried out via surface response methodology (RSM). Regression equations for the prediction of optimal conditions were achieved considering eight individual parameters: naming, elongation at break, tensile strength and elastic modulus, crystallization temperature (TC), first melting temperatures (TM1), heat fusion (Hf), crystallinity, and melt flow rate (MFR), which were measured as responses for the design of experiment (DOE). The adjusted and predicted correlation coefficient (R²) shows good agreement between the actual and the predicted values. To confirm the optimal values from the response model, supplementary experiments as a performance evaluation were conducted, posing better operational conditions. It has been confirmed that the RSM model was adequate to reflect the predicted optimization. The results suggest that the addition of LMPP into iPP could effectively enhance the functionality and processability of blend fibres if correctly proportioned.",Novel Photocatalytic PVDF/Nano-TiO₂ Hollow Fibers for Environmental Remediation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961059,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) mixed matrix membranes loaded with inorganic TiO₂ nanoparticles have received increasing attention in the last few years as self-cleaning membranes for possible application in wastewater treatment and seawater filtration.

Moreover, some of the characteristic properties of polylactide (PLA)-based biomaterials, such as brittleness, hydrophobicity, and longer degradation time, are not suitable for certain biomedical applications. However, such properties can be altered by the copolymerization of PLA with other biodegradable monomers, such as glycolic acid. A series of high molecular weight PLGAs were synthesized through the direct condensation copolymerization of lactic and glycolic acids, starting from 0 to 50 mol% of glycolic acid, and the wettability of its films was monitored as a function of the feed molar ratio. Copolymerization was performed in the presence of a bi-catalytic system using stannous chloride dihydrate and methanesulfonic acid (MSA). The viscosity average molecular weight of the resulting PLGA was in the range of 80k to 135k g/mol. The PLGA films were prepared using the solvent casting technique, and were treated with oxygen plasma for 2 min. The water contact angle of the PLGA films was determined before and after the oxygen plasma treatments, and it was observed that the wettability increased with an increase in the glycolic acid contents, however, the manifolds increased after 2 min of oxygen plasma treatments.",Heat Dissipation in Epoxy/Amine-Based Gradient Composites with Alumina Particles: A Critical Evaluation of Thermal Conductivity Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961056,Polymers,2019 04 11,"For the design of the next generation of microelectronic packages, thermal management is one of the key aspects and must be met by the development of polymers with enhanced thermal conductivity. While all polymer classes show a very low thermal conductivity, this shortcoming can be compensated for by the addition of fillers, yielding polymer-based composite materials with high thermal conductivity. The inorganic fillers, however, are often available only in submicron- and micron-scaled dimensions and, consequently, can sediment during the curing reaction of the polymer matrix. In this study, an epoxy/amine resin was filled with nano- and submicron-scaled alumina particles, yielding a gradient composite. It was found that the thermal conductivity according to laser flash analysis of a sliced specimen ranged from 0.25 to 0.45 W·m-1·K-1 at room temperature. If the thermal conductivity of an uncut specimen was measured with a guarded heat flow meter, the 'averaged' thermal conductivity was measured to be only 0.25 W·m-1·K-1. Finite element analysis revealed that the heat dissipation through a gradient composite was of intermediate speed in comparison with homogeneous composites exhibiting a non-gradient thermal conductivity of 0.25 and 0.45 W·m-1·K-1.",Functionalization of Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Microspheres for the Highly Selective Removal of Contaminants from Aqueous Solutions and the Analysis of Food-Grade Fish Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961055,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The proliferation of pollution in aquatic environments has become a growing concernand calls for the development of novel adsorbents capable of selectively removing notorious andrecalcitrant pollutants from these ecosystems. Herein, a general strategy was developed for thesynthesis and functionalization of molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (MIPs) that couldbe optimized to possess a significant adsorption selectivity to an organic pollutant in aqueousmedia, in addition to a high adsorption capacity. Considering that the molecular imprinting alonewas far from satisfactory to produce a high-performance MIPs-based adsorbent, further structuralengineering and surface functionalization were performed in this study. Although the more carboxylgroups on the surfaces of the MIPs enhanced the adsorption rate and capacity toward an organicpollutant through electrostatic interactions, they did not strengthen the adsorption selectivity in aproportional manner. Through a systematic study, the optimized sample exhibiting both impressiveselectivity and capacity for the adsorption of the organic pollutant was found to possess a smallparticle size, a high specific surface area, a large total pore volume, and an appropriate amount ofsurface carboxyl groups. While the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to better describethe process of the adsorption onto the surface of MIPs as compared to the pseudo-first-order kineticmodel, neither Langmuir nor Freundlich isothermal model could be used to well fit the isothermaladsorption data. Increased temperature facilitated the adsorption of the organic pollutant onto theMIPs, as an endothermic process. Furthermore, the optimized MIPs were also successfully employedas a stationary phase for the fabrication of a molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction column,with which purchased food-grade fish samples were effectively examined."

In the present work, a ceramic/polymer nanocomposite as a novel dielectric layer is developed to intensify the overall electrowetting performances by multiscale interface effect. Hereinto, surface fluoro-modified ZrO₂ nanoparticles (mZrO₂) are dispersed well in AF 1600 matrix to form a mZrO₂@AF 1600 nanocomposite. The small addition of mZrO₂ improves the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite, and the experimental value is larger than the theoretical value calculated by Maxwell⁻Garnett model, but fits well with the Rahaman⁻Khastgir model. The molecular dynamics simulations with the explicit model further verify the interfacial effect. Meanwhile, double contact angle modulation and higher breakdown field strength (Eb) are obtained. For the three-layer sandwich structure, both the top and bottom AF 1600 layer decrease the surface roughness for better electrowetting reproducibility and wider wettability modulation. The Forlani⁻Minnaja theory related to the empirical relationship between Eb and thickness of dielectric layer fit well with the monolayer structure, but cannot be applied in multi-layer structures. A new relationship is proposed to guide the design of dielectric multi-layers with high breakdown field strength.",A 3D Printable Thermal Energy Storage Crystalline Gel Using Mask-Projection Stereolithography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961043,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Most of the phase change materials (PCMs) have been limited to use as functional additions or sealed in containers, and extra auxiliary equipment or supporting matrix is needed. The emergence of 3D printing technique has dramatically advanced the developments of materials and simplified production processes. This study focuses on a novel strategy to model thermal energy storage crystalline gels with three-dimensional architecture directly from liquid resin without supporting materials through light-induced polymerization 3D printing technique. A mask-projection stereolithography printer was used to measure the 3D printing test, and the printable characters of crystalline thermal energy storage P(SA-DMAA) gels with different molar ratios were evaluated. For the P(SA-DMMA) gels with a small fraction of SA, the 3D fabrication was realized with higher printing precision both on milli- and micro- meter scales. As a comparison of 3D printed samples, P(SA-DMAA) gels made by other two methods, post-UV curing treatment after 3D printing and UV curing using conventional mold, were prepared. The 3D printed P(SA-DMAA) gels shown high crystallinity. Post-UV curing treatment was beneficial to full curing of 3D printed gels, but did not lead to the further improvement of the crystal structure to get higher crystallinity. The P(SA-DMAA) crystalline gel having the highest energy storage enthalpy was developed, which reached 69.6 J·g-1. Its good thermoregulation property in the temperature range from 25 to 40 °C was proved. The P(SA-DMAA) gels are feasible for practical applications as one kind of 3D printing material with thermal energy storage and thermoregulation functionality.",The Ternary Heterostructures of BiOBr/Ultrathin g-C₃N₄/Black Phosphorous Quantum Dot Composites for Photodegradation of Tetracycline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961042,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Herein, we synthesized BiOBr/ultrathin g-C₃N₄/ternary heterostructures modified with black phosphorous quantum dots using a simple water bath heating and sonication method. The ternary heterostructure was then used for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline in visible light, with an efficiency as high as 92% after 3 h of irradiation. Thus, the photodegradation efficiency is greatly improved compared to that of ultrathin g-C₃N₄, BiOBr, and black phosphorous quantum dots alone. The synthesized ternary heterostructure improves the charge separation efficiency, thus increasing the photodegradation efficiency.

This trade-off relation makes it difficult to improve the two factors simultaneously. One approach is the development of silica wet masterbatch (WMB) technology for producing compounds containing a high silica content with good dispersion. The technology involves a step to mix surface-modified silica and rubber latex. The technique requires a coagulant to break up the micelles of the rubber latex and cause the surface-modified silica and the rubber molecules to co-coagulate due to van der Waals forces. In this study, the effect of coagulant type on the characteristics of silica surface, and the mechanical properties of the emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (ESBR)/silica WMB compounds was investigated, as well as the abrasion properties and the viscoelastic properties of the vulcanizates.",Some Key Factors Influencing the Flame Retardancy of EDA-DOPO Containing Flexible Polyurethane Foams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961040,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The role of various additives (emulsifier, anti-dripping agent) and formulation procedures (pre-dispersion of solid additives in polyol via milling) which influence the flame retardancy of 6,6'-[ethan-1,2-diylbis(azandiyl)]bis(6H-dibenzo[c,e][1,2]oxaphosphin-6-oxid) (EDA-DOPO) containing flexible polyurethane foams has been investigated in this work. For comparison, the flame retardancy of two additional structurally-analogous bridged 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO)-based compounds, i.e., ethanolamine-DOPO (ETA-DOPO) and ethylene glycol-DOPO (EG-DOPO) were also evaluated together with EDA-DOPO in flexible PU foams of various formulations. The flame retardancy of these three bridged-DOPO compounds depends on the type of PU formulation. For certain PU formulations containing EDA-DOPO, lower fire performance was observed. Addition of emulsifier and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to these PU formulations influenced positively the flame retardancy of EDA-DOPO/PU foams. In addition, dispersion of EDA-DOPO and PTFE via milling in polyol improved the flame retardancy of the PU foams. Mechanistic studies performed using a microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) and its coupling to FTIR showed no difference in the combustion efficiency of the bridged-DOPO compounds in PU foams. From MCC experiments it can be concluded that these bridged-DOPO compounds and their decomposition products may work primarily in the gas phase as flame inhibitors. The physiochemical behavior of additives in PU formulation responsible for the improvement in the flame retardancy of PU foams was further investigated by studying the dripping behavior of the PU foams in the UL 94 HB test. A high-speed camera was used to study the dripping behavior in the UL 94 HB test and results indicate a considerable reduction of the total number of melt drips and flaming drips for the flame retardant formulations. This reduction in melt drips and flaming drips during the UL 94 HB tests help PU foams achieve higher fire classification.",Synthesis of High Molecular Weight Polyester Using in Situ Drying Method and Assessment of Water Vapor and Oxygen Barrier Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961039,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The preparation of renewable polyesters with good barrier properties is highly desirable for the packaging industry. Herein we report the synthesis of high molecular weight polyesters via an innovative use of an in situ drying agent approach and the barrier properties of the films formed from these polyesters.

In this present work, ammonium polyphosphate (APP) intercalated LDHs and zinc borate (ZB) was incorporated into a polypropylene (PP) matrix using the solvent mixing method. The structures, morphologies, and performance of the composites were characterized carefully. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) reduction of PP containing 10 and 20 wt % APP-LDH reached 27% and 55%, respectively, which increased up to 63% compared with PP/CO₃-LDH. After incorporating 2 wt % ZB in the PP/APP-LDH system, the flame retardant property was further improved. Polypropylene composites with 20 wt % APP-LDH and 2 wt % ZB showed a 58% PHRR reduction.

The effects of the oil to water weight ratio (1:1 to 1:3) and the concentration of CNCs (1.0⁻3.0 wt %) on the stability of the emulsion were studied. Emulsions were characterized according to the emulsion stability index, droplet size, and droplet distribution. The emulsion prepared under the condition of oil to water ratio 1:1 and concentration of CNCs at 2.0 wt % showed good stability during the two-week storage period. Nanocomposite foams were formed by heating the Pickering emulsion at 90 °C for 60 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the foam has a microporous structure with a non-uniform cell size that varied from 0.3 to 380 μm. The CNCs stabilized Pickering emulsion provides a versatile approach to prepare innovative functional bio-based materials.","One-Step Quaternization/Hydroxypropylsulfonation to Improve Paste Stability, Adhesion, and Film Properties of Oxidized Starch.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961035,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To investigate the influences of quaternization/hydroxypropylsulfonation on viscosity stability, adhesion to fibers and film properties of oxidized tapioca starch (OTS) for ameliorating its end-use ability in applications such as warp-sizing and paper-making, a series of quaternized and hydroxypropylsulfonated OTS (QHOTS) samples were synthesized by simultaneous quaternization and hydroxypropylsulfonation of OTS with N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt (CHPS-Na). The QHOTS granules were characterized by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopic and scanning electron microscope techniques. Apparent viscosity and viscosity stability were determined, and adhesion was evaluated by measuring the bonding force of starch to the fibers. Film properties were also estimated in terms of tensile strength, breaking elongation, bending endurance, degree of crystallinity, and moisture regain. It was showed that quaternization/hydroxypropylsulfonation was capable of obviously improving viscosity stability of gelatinized OTS paste, enhancing bonding forces of OTS to cotton and polylactic acid (PLA) fibers, increasing breaking elongation, bending endurance and moisture regain of film and decreasing its tensile strength and degree of crystallinity, thereby obviously stabilizing paste viscosity, improving adhesion to fibers and lessening film brittleness. Increasing the level of quaternization/hydroxypropylsulfonation favored improvement in the stability, enhancement in adhesion and decrease in brittleness. The QHOTS showed potential in the applications of cotton and PLA sizing."

However, up to now, only its application to hydrophobic compounds has been deeply studied and the encapsulation of some strongly hydrophilic compounds, such as caffeine, remains a challenge. Caffeine loaded poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles were produced in a confined impinging jet mixer using acetone as the solvent and water as the antisolvent. Caffeine was dissolved either in acetone or in water to assess the effects of two different process conditions. Nanoparticles properties were assessed in terms of loading capacity (LC%), encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and in vitro release kinetics. Samples were further characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy to determine the size, morphology, and structure of nanoparticles. FNP was proved an effective technique for entrapping caffeine in PCL and to control its release behavior. The solvent used to solubilize caffeine influences the final structure of the obtained particles.

The parameters of the ablation process were congruent, so no chemical changes in the polymeric material were observed. Evaluation of the surface condition of the laser-textured samples was performed using a Leica MZ6 stereoscopic microscope, operating with MultiScan 8.0 image analysis software. The contact angles were determined for all the samples before and after the surface modification process. Following modification of the surface morphology, with the best parameters of laser ablation, the contact angle increased, reaching 147°, which is very close to the threshold of superhydrophobicity (150°). On the basis of the results from several tests, laser ablation with a fiber-pulsed laser can be considered a very useful method for producing rubbers with superhydrophobic surfaces.","Kinetic, Isotherm, and Thermodynamic Studies for Ag(I) Adsorption Using Carboxymethyl Functionalized Poly(glycidyl methacrylate).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961015,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Industrial wastewater contains large amounts of silver ions.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the adsorbent. The experimental parameters affecting the adsorption are solution pH, contact time, and initial silver ion concentration. The optimum pH for adsorption of Ag(I) is pH 4. The maximum adsorption capacity at pH 4 is 157.05 mg/g, and the adsorption reaches equilibrium at 300 min. The kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption process were described by pseudo second-order, Langmuir and D-R models, respectively. The adsorption process was a single layer chemical adsorption, exothermic, feasible, and spontaneous. The adsorption mechanism is electrostatic or chelation. The adsorbent selectively absorbed Ag(I) from coexisting ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+). Finally, the removal rate of silver ions decreased from 79.29% to 65.01% after four repetitive experiments, which proved that the adsorbent had good reusability. The adsorbent has great potential benefit in removing Ag(I)."

These properties are mirrored in intrachain site-to-site distances and diffusion coefficients of mutual site-to-site motion. Both distance distribution and diffusion determine the extent of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two sites labeled with a FRET donor and acceptor. The relatively large Förster radii of traditional FRET methods (R₀ > 20 Å) lead to a fairly low contribution of diffusion. We introduced short-distance FRET (sdFRET) where Dbo, an asparagine residue conjugated to 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, acts as acceptor paired with donors, such as naphtylalanine (NAla), tryptophan, 5-l-fluorotryptophan, or tyrosine. The Förster radii are always close to 10 Å, which makes sdFRET highly sensitive to diffusional motion. We recently found indications that the FRET enhancement caused by diffusion depends symmetrically on the product of the radiative fluorescence lifetime of the donor and the diffusion coefficient. In this study, we varied this product by two orders of magnitude, using both donors of different lifetime, NAla and FTrp, as well as a varying viscogen concentration, to corroborate this statement. We demonstrate the consequences of this relationship in evaluating the impact of viscogenic coadditives on peptide dimensions.",Incorporation of Conductive Materials into Hydrogels for Tissue Engineering Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961003,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In the field of tissue engineering, conductive hydrogels have been the most effective biomaterials to mimic the biological and electrical properties of tissues in the human body. The main advantages of conductive hydrogels include not only their physical properties but also their adequate electrical properties, which provide electrical signals to cells efficiently. However, when introducing a conductive material into a non-conductive hydrogel, a conflicting relationship between the electrical and mechanical properties may develop. This review examines the strengths and weaknesses of the generation of conductive hydrogels using various conductive materials such as metal nanoparticles, carbons, and conductive polymers. The fabrication method of blending, coating, and in situ polymerization is also added. Furthermore, the applications of conductive hydrogel in cardiac tissue engineering, nerve tissue engineering, and bone tissue engineering and skin regeneration are discussed in detail.",High-Efficient and Recyclable Magnetic Separable Catalyst for Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 Linkage in Lignin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961002,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Lignin is recognized as a good sustainable material because of its great abundance and potential applications. At present, lignin hydrogenolysis is considered as a potential but challenging way to produce low-molecular-mass aromatic chemicals. The most common linkage between the structural units of lignin polymer is the β-O-4 aryl ether, which are primary or even only target chemical bonds for many degradation processes. Herein, a Pd-Fe₃O₄ composite was synthesized for catalytic hydrogenolysis of β-O-4 bond in lignin. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by XRD, XPS, and SEM and the lignin depolymerization products were analyzed by GC-MS. The catalyst showed good catalytic performance during the hydrogenolysis process, lignin dimer was degraded into monomers completely and a high yield of monomers was obtained by the hydrogenolysis of bagasse lignin. More importantly, the magnetic catalyst was separated conveniently by magnet after reaction and remained highly catalytically efficient after being reused for five times. This work has demonstrated an efficient &amp; recyclable catalyst for the cleavage of the β-O-4 bond in lignin providing an alternative way to make better use of lignins.",Electrically-Responsive Reversible Polyketone/MWCNT Network through Diels-Alder Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961001,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study examines the preparation of electrically conductive polymer networks based on furan-functionalised polyketone (PK-Fu) doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reversibly crosslinked with bis-maleimide (B-Ma) via Diels-Alder (DA) cycloaddition. Notably, the incorporation of 5 wt.% of MWCNTs results in an increased modulus of the material, and makes it thermally and electrically conductive. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that MWCNTs, due to their diene/dienophile character, covalently interact with the matrix via DA reaction, leading to effective interfacial adhesion between the components. Raman spectroscopy points to a more effective graphitic ordering of MWCNTs after reaction with PK-Fu and B-Ma. After crosslinking the obtained composite via the DA reaction, the softening point (tan(δ) in dynamic mechanical analysis measurements) increases up to 155 °C, as compared to the value of 130 °C for the PK-Fu crosslinked with B-Ma and that of 140 °C for the PK-Fu/B-Ma/MWCNT nanocomposite before resistive heating (responsible for crosslinking). After grinding the composite, compression moulding (150 °C/40 bar) activates the retro-DA process that disrupts the network, allowing it to be reshaped as a thermoplastic. A subsequent process of annealing via resistive heating demonstrates the possibility of reconnecting the decoupled DA linkages, thus providing the PK networks with the same thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties as the crosslinked pristine systems.",Substituent Effects of Phenyl Group on Silylene Bridge in Stereospecific Polymerization of Propylene with C₁-Symmetric Ansa-Silylene(fluorenyl)(amido) Dimethyl Titanium Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30961000,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A C₁-symmetric (methylphenyl)silylene-bridged (fluorenyl)(naphthylamido) titanium complex (1) and (diphenyl)silylene-bridged (fluorenyl)(naphthylamido) titanium complex (2) were synthesized and characterized by ¹H NMR, element analysis, and X-ray crystal analysis. The coordination mode of the fluorenyl ligand to the titanium metal is an η³ manner in each complex. These complexes were applied for propylene polymerization using dried modified methyaluminoxane (dMMAO) as a cocatalyst under different propylene pressures in a semi batch-type method. The catalytic activity was strongly dependent on the structure of the complex and the propylene pressure, where complex 1 exhibited the highest activity (600 kg mol-1·h-1) under a propylene pressure of 8.0 atm to produce high molecular weight polypropylene. The polypropylenes obtained were syndiotactic-rich with an rr value of 0.50, indicating that the silylene bridge was not efficient for the isospecificity of a constrained geometry catalyst (CGC). The mechanical properties of the resulting polymers depended on their microstructure.","Internal Relative Humidity, Autogenous Shrinkage, and Strength of Cement Mortar Modified with Superabsorbent Polymers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960999,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Laboratory evaluations were performed to investigate the effect of internal curing (IC) by superabsorbent polymers (SAP) on the internal relative humidity (IRH), autogenous shrinkage, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and strength characteristics of low water-cement ratio (w/c) mortars. Four types of SAP with different cross-linking densities and particle sizes were used. Test results showed that the SAP inclusion effectively mitigated the IRH drops due to self-desiccation and corresponding autogenous shrinkage, and the IC effectiveness tended to increase with an increased SAP dosage. The greater the cross-linking density and particle size of SAP, the less the IRH drop and autogenous shrinkage. The trend of autogenous shrinkage developments was in good agreement with that of IRH changes, with nearly linear relationships between them. Both immediate deformation (ID)-based and full response-based CTEs were rarely affected by SAP inclusions. There were no substantial losses in compressive and flexural strengths of SAP-modified mortar compared to reference plain mortar. The findings revealed that SAPs can be effectively used to reduce the shrinkage cracking potential of low w/c cement-based materials at early ages, without compromising mechanical and thermal characteristics.","Fabrication, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity of Thermoplastic Polyurethane/Poly(lactic acid) Material Using Human Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Stem Cells (hASCs).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960998,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and poly(lactic acid) are types of biocompatible and degradable synthetic polymers required for biomedical applications. Physically blended (TPU+PLA) tissue engineering matrices were produced via solvent casting technique. The following types of polymer blend were prepared: (TPU+PLA) 7:3, (TPU+PLA) 6:4, (TPU+PLA) 4:6, and (TPU+PLA) 3:7. Various methods were employed to characterize the properties of these polymers: surface properties such as morphology (scanning electron microscopy), wettability (goniometry), and roughness (profilometric analysis). Analyses of hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the obtained polymer blends were conducted. Tensile tests demonstrated that the blends exhibited a wide range of mechanical properties. Cytotoxicity of polymers was tested using human multipotent stromal cells derived from adipose tissue (hASC). In vitro assays revealed that (TPU+PLA) 3:7 matrices were the most cytocompatible biomaterials. Cells cultured on (TPU+PLA) 3:7 had proper morphology, growth pattern, and were distinguished by increased proliferative and metabolic activity. Additionally, it appeared that (TPU+PLA) 3:7 biomaterials showed antiapoptotic properties. hASC cultured on these matrices had reduced expression of Bax-α and increased expression of Bcl-2.

This method can be mainly divided into two steps, for which the mixture of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was first deposited on the surface of carbon fiber paper through a vacuum filtration device followed by immersing the hybrid paper into concentrated aniline solution to polymerize polyaniline (PANI). Compared to carbon fiber paper, the acid-treated carbon fiber paper (A-CFP)-based electrode provides more active sites, which are beneficial for the polymerization of polyaniline. The mixture of CNFs and CNTs could coat on the A-CFP by vacuum-filtration due to the high hydrophilicity of A-CFP improved by acid-treatment. PANI with different polymerization time was in-situ synthesized on the surface of the hybrid paper to form a three-dimensional cross-linked structure that greatly enhanced the electrochemical performance of the electrode by improving high capacitance, high rate-capability, and long cycle-life. Moreover, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor showed a high area capacitance of 626 mF·cm-2 and an energy density of 87 µWh·cm-2. This facile, easy performed, and low-cost strategy may provide a feasible method for the production of supercapacitor electrodes.",An Oligoimide Particle as a Pickering Emulsion Stabilizer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960996,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and 4,4'-oxydianiline (ODA)-based oligoimide (PMDA-ODA) was synthesized by a one-step procedure using water as a solvent. The PMDA-ODA particles showed excellent partial wetting properties and were stably dispersed in both water and oil phases. A stable dispersion was not obtained with comparison PMDA-ODA particles that were synthesized by a conventional two-step method using an organic solvent. Both oil-in-water and water-in-oil Pickering emulsions were prepared using the oligoimide particles synthesized in water, and the size of the emulsion droplet was controlled based on the oligoimide particle concentration. The oligoimide particles were tested to prepare Pickering emulsions using various kinds of oils. The oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were successfully applied to prepare microcapsules of the emulsion droplets. Our new Pickering emulsion stabilizer has the advantages of easy synthesis, no need for surface modification, and the capability of stabilizing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions.",Biosourced Binder for Wood Particleboards Based on Spent Sulfite Liquor and Wheat Flour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960995,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Currently, the majority of binders used in wood particleboard (PB) manufacturing are formaldehyde-based synthetic resins. Because of the toxicity of formaldehyde, there is a strong demand for eco-friendly alternatives with similar performances and economic viability. In this work, thick spent sulfite liquor (TSSL), an industrial byproduct from sulfite pulp mills, is proposed as a binder for fully bio-based PBs. The results showed that PBs bound with TSSL present appropriate mechanical performance, which was further improved when TSSL was combined with wheat flour at an 84:16 dry weight ratio and preheated to 94 °C prior to application. For 13.2% binder content per dry wood weight, the PB internal bond strength was 0.46 N mm-2, which is above the standard requirements for PB type P2 (0.35 N mm-2). Optical microscopy showed that TSSL hinders the gelatinization of starch granules during preheating, allowing the binder mixture to maintain a low viscosity suitable for combination with wood particles and PB production."

Graphene oxide (GO) is an inert material, from the electrical and thermal conductivity point of view, and is incompatible with the usually-used poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. During surface-modification by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, the GO was transformed into a conducting and compatible material with the PDMS showing enormous light-induced actuation capability. The GO surface-modification with poly(2-(trimethylsilyloxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PHEMATMS) chains was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, with an on-line monitoring of gasses using FTIR. The improved compatibility was elucidated using contact angle and dielectric properties measurements. The PHEMATMS shell was investigated using gel permeation chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance. The improved electric conductivity was measured using the four-point probe method and by Raman spectroscopy. The very important mechanical properties were elucidated using dynamic mechanical analysis, and with the help of thermo-mechanic analysis for the light-induced actuation. The excellent actuation capabilities observed, with changes in the length of around 0.8% at 10% pre-strain, are very promising from the point of view of applications.",Cellulose⁻Chitosan Antibacterial Composite Films Prepared from LiBr Solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960983,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Cellulose and chitosan solutions were prepared in 60% LiBr and mixed with a different weight ratio. The washing and drying of the prepared cellulose⁻chitosan composite films were performed under identical conditions. The color of the liquefied mixtures and films was initially transparent but changed from colorless to brownish yellow depending on the ratio of chitosan in the solution. The cross section observed in the SEM results indicated that the film developed with a higher ratio of chitosan was more robust and possessed greater antibacterial properties. FT-IR analysis of the films showed that hydrogen bonds between cellulose and chitosan in composite films were successfully achieved and retained excellent mechanical properties. The proper ratio of chitosan in the cellulose solution can increase the tensile strength and improve the elongation of the films; however, the E-modulus property was consistently reduced. The antibacterial activity and mechanical properties of the films were greatly improved as the amount of chitosan in the film increased.","The Electrical, Mechanical and Surface Properties of Thermoplastic Polyester Elastomer Modified by Electron Beta Radiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960982,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The main advantages of Thermoplastic Polyester Elastomers (TPE-E) are their elastomer properties as well as their ability to be processed in the same way as thermoplastic polymers (e.g., injection moulding, compression moulding and extrusion). However, TPE-Es' properties, mainly their mechanical properties and thermal characteristics, are not as good as those of elastomers. Because of this TPE-Es are often modified with the aim of improving their properties and extending their range of application. Radiation cross-linking using accelerated electron beams is one of the most effective ways to change virgin polymers' properties significantly. Their electrical (that is to say permittivity and resistivity measurements), mechanical (that is, tensile and impact tensile tests), as well as surface (that is, nano-indentation) properties were measured on modified/cross-linked TPE-E specimens with and/or without a cross-linking agent at irradiation doses of 0, 33, 66, 99, 132, 165 and 198 kGy. The data acquired from these procedures show significant changes in the measured properties. The results of this study allow the possibility of determining the proper processing parameters and irradiation doses for the production of TPE-E products which leads to the enlargement of their application in practice.",Flexible Biocomposites with Enhanced Interfacial Compatibility Based on Keratin Fibers and Sulfur-Containing Poly(urea-urethane)s.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960981,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Feathers are made of keratin, a fibrous protein with high content of disulfide-crosslinks and hydrogen-bonds. Feathers have been mainly used as reinforcing fiber in the preparation of biocomposites with a wide variety of polymers, also poly(urea-urethane)s. Surface compatibility between the keratin fiber and the matrix is crucial for having homogenous, high quality composites with superior mechanical properties. Poly(urea-urethane) type polymers are convenient for this purpose due to the presence of polar functionalities capable of forming hydrogen-bonds with keratin. Here, we demonstrate that the interfacial compatibility can be further enhanced by incorporating sulfur moieties in the polymer backbone that lead to new fiber-matrix interactions. We comparatively studied two analogous thermoplastic poly(urea-urethane) elastomers prepared starting from the same isocyanate-functionalized polyurethane prepolymer and two aromatic diamine chain extenders, bis(4-aminophenyl) disulfide (TPUU-SS) and the sulfur-free counterpart bis(4-aminophenyl) methane (TPUU). Then, biocomposites with high feather loadings (40, 50, 60 and 75 wt %) were prepared in a torque rheometer and hot-compressed into flexible sheets. Mechanical characterization showed that TPUU-SS based materials underwent higher improvement in mechanical properties than biocomposites made of the reference TPUU (up to 7.5-fold higher tensile strength compared to neat polymer versus 2.3-fold). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) images also provided evidence that fibers were completely embedded in the TPUU-SS matrix. Additionally, density, thermal stability, and water absorption of the biocomposites were thoroughly characterized.",Droplet-Assisted Microfluidic Fabrication and Characterization of Multifunctional Polysaccharide Microgels Formed by Multicomponent Reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960980,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polysaccharide-based microgels have broad applications in multi-parametric cell cultures, cell-free biotechnology, and drug delivery. Multicomponent reactions like the Passerini three-component and the Ugi four-component reaction are shown in here to be versatile platforms for fabricating these polysaccharide microgels by droplet microfluidics with a narrow size distribution. While conventional microgel formation requires pre-modification of hydrogel building blocks to introduce certain functionality, in multicomponent reactions one building block can be simply exchanged by another to introduce and extend functionality in a library-like fashion. Beyond synthesizing a range of polysaccharide-based microgels utilizing hyaluronic acid, alginate and chitosan, exemplary in-depth analysis of hyaluronic acid-based Ugi four-component gels is conducted by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy, confocal Brillouin microscopy, quantitative phase imaging, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to elucidate the capability of microfluidic multicomponent reactions for forming defined polysaccharide microgel networks. Particularly, the impact of crosslinker amount and length is studied. A higher network density leads to higher Young's moduli accompanied by smaller pore sizes with lower diffusion coefficients of tracer molecules in the highly homogeneous network, and vice versa. Moreover, tailored building blocks allow for crosslinking the microgels and incorporating functional groups at the same time as demonstrated for biotin-functionalized, chitosan-based microgels formed by Ugi four-component reaction. To these microgels, streptavidin-labeled enzymes are easily conjugated as shown for horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which retains its activity inside the microgels.",Preparation and Physicochemical Properties of Blend Films of Feather Keratin and Poly(vinyl alcohol) Compatibilized by Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960979,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Blend films of feather keratin (FK) and synthetic poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) that were compatibilized by tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) were successfully prepared by a solution-casting method. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that a phase separation occurred in the FK/PVA/Tris blended system. Analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the main interactions between the three components were hydrogen bonds. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the FK/PVA/Tris blend films were partially crystalline. The barrier properties, mechanical properties, and contact angles of the FK/PVA/Tris films were investigated to determine the effects of the PVA and Tris concentrations. More specifically, upon increasing the PVA content, the elongation at break, the hydrophilicity, and the oxygen barrier properties were enhanced. However, at a constant PVA content, an increase in the Tris content caused the oxygen permeability and the contact angle to decrease, while the tensile strength, elongation at break, and oxygen barrier properties were enhanced. These results indicated that the mechanical properties and gas resistance of the FK/PVA/Tris blend films could be successfully improved using the method described herein, confirming that this route provided a convenient and promising means to prepare FK plastics for practical applications.",Synthesis of Polystyrene-Coated Superparamagnetic and Ferromagnetic Cobalt Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960978,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polystyrene-coated cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized through a dual-stage thermolysis of cobalt carbonyl (Co₂(CO)₈). The amine end-functionalized polystyrene surfactants with varying molecular weight were prepared via atom-transfer radical polymerization technique. By changing the concentration of these polymeric surfactants, Co NPs with different size, size distribution, and magnetic properties were obtained. Transmission electron microscopy characterization showed that the size of Co NPs stabilized with lower molecular weight polystyrene surfactants (Mn = 2300 g/mol) varied from 12⁻22 nm, while the size of Co NPs coated with polystyrene of middle (Mn = 4500 g/mol) and higher molecular weight (Mn = 10,500 g/mol) showed little change around 20 nm. Magnetic measurements revealed that the small cobalt particles were superparamagnetic, while larger particles were ferromagnetic and self-assembled into 1-D chain structures. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the grafting density of polystyrene with lower molecular weight is high. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to obtain both superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic Co NPs by changing the molecular weight and concentration of polystyrene through the dual-stage decomposition method.",Nanocomposite Film Containing Fibrous Cellulose Scaffold and Ag/TiO₂ Nanoparticles and Its Antibacterial Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960977,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Cellulose is a natural polymer that is widely used in daily life, but it is susceptible to microorganism growth.

The morphology and crystal structure of the as-prepared Ag/TiO₂/cellulose composite film were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. Antibacterial tests involving the use of Escherichia coli (E. coli) were carried out under dark and UV-light conditions to evaluate the efficiency of the Ag/TiO₂/cellulose composite film in comparison with pristine cellulose paper and TiO₂/cellulose composite film. The results indicated that the antibacterial activity of the Ag/TiO₂/cellulose composite film outperformed all other samples, where the Ag content of 0.030 wt% could inhibit more than 99% of E. coli. This study suggests that finely dispersed nanocale Ag/TiO₂ particles in the cellulose scaffold were effective at slowing down bacterial growth, and the mechanisms of this are also discussed.","Thin Film Composite and/or Thin Film Nanocomposite Hollow Fiber Membrane for Water Treatment, Pervaporation, and Gas/Vapor Separation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960976,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Thin film composite (TFC) polymeric hollow fiber (HF) membranes are widely used in industrial gas/vapor separations and water treatment.

The fique was subjected to three chemical treatments to modify its surface (alkalinization, silanization and pre-impregnation with polyethylene) to increase the quality of its interfaces. Additionally, panels with 10%, 20%, and 30% v/v of fiber were manufactured by the hot compression molding. The mechanical properties of the different composite materials showed that the pre-impregnation treatment promoted a significant increase in the tensile and flexural properties with respect to the fiber-reinforced composite without surface modification. Additionally, in materials with 30% fibers that were treated with pre-impregnation, there was a decrease in the water absorption capacity of 53.15% when compared to composites made with 30% native fibers. Finally, increases in the fiber content mainly caused better mechanical performances, which increased as a direct function of the amount of fique incorporated."

Protein delivery reagents such as cell penetration peptides (CPPs) and protein transduction domains (PTDs) are frequently used to facilitate protein delivery. Herein, synthetic polymer mimics of PTDs, called PTDMs, were studied for their ability to self-assemble in aqueous media as it was not known whether self-assembly plays a role in the protein binding and delivery process. The results obtained from interfacial tensiometry (IFT), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transmittance assays (%T), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that PTDMs do not readily aggregate or self-assemble at application-relevant time scales and concentrations. However, additional DLS experiments were used to confirm that the presence of protein is required to induce the formation of PTDM-protein complexes and that PTDMs likely bind as single chains.",Removal of Aromatic Chlorinated Pesticides from Aqueous Solution Using β-Cyclodextrin Polymers Decorated with Fe₃O₄ Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960963,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This article describes the sorption properties of cyclodextrin polymers (nanosponges; NS) with the pesticides 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (TCF), including an evaluation of its efficiency and a comparison with other materials, such as granulated activated carbon (GAC). NS-pesticide complexes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR), UV⁻VIS, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This confirms the interactions of the guests with nanosponges and shows that the polymers have favorable sorption capacities for chlorinated aromatic guests. Our studies also show that the inclusion complex is predominantly favored for NS/CPA rather than those formed between TCF and NS due to the size of the adsorbate and steric effects. Sorption studies carried with repeated cycles demonstrate that NS polymers could be an improved technology for pollutant removal from aquatic environments, as they are very efficient and reusable materials. Our experiments and characterization by SEM, EDS, UV⁻VIS, and magnetization saturation (VSM) also show that NS is an optimal substrate for the deposition of magnetite nanoparticles, thus improving the usefulness and properties of the polymer, as the nanosponges could be retrieved from aqueous solution with a neodymium magnet without losing its efficiency as a pesticide sorbent.",Self-Assembly DBS Nanofibrils on Solution-Blown Nanofibers as Hierarchical Ion-Conducting Pathway for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960962,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, we reported a novel proton exchange membrane (PEM) with an ion-conducting pathway. The hierarchical nanofiber structure was prepared via in situ self-assembling 1,3:2,4-dibenzylidene-d-sorbitol (DBS) supramolecular fibrils on solution-blown, sulfonated poly (ether sulfone) (SPES) nanofiber, after which the composite PEM was prepared by incorporating hierarchical nanofiber into the chitosan polymer matrix. Then, the effects of incorporating the hierarchical nanofiber structure on the thermal stability, water uptake, dimensional stability, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability of the composite membranes were investigated. The results show that incorporation of hierarchical nanofiber improves the water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability of the membranes. Furthermore, the composite membrane with 50% hierarchical nanofibers exhibited the highest proton conductivity of 0.115 S cm-1 (80 °C), which was 69.12% higher than the values of pure chitosan membrane. The self-assembly allows us to generate hierarchical nanofiber among the interfiber voids, and this structure can provide potential benefits for the preparation of high-performance PEMs.",The Impact of Plasticizer and Degree of Hydrolysis on Free Volume of Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960961,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effect of plasticizer species and the degree of hydrolysis (DH) on the free volume properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were studied using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Both glycerol and propylene glycol caused an increase in the free volume cavity radius, although exhibited distinct plasticization behavior, with glycerol capable of occupying existing free volume cavities in the PVA to some extent. The influence of water, normally present in PVA film under atmospheric conditions, was also isolated. Water added significantly to the measured free volume cavity radius in both plasticized and pure PVA matrices. Differences in plasticization behavior can be attributed to the functionality of each plasticizing additive and its hydrogen bonding capability. The increase in cavity radii upon plasticizer loading shows a qualitative link between the free volume of voids and the corresponding reduction in Tg and crystallinity. Cavity radius decreases with increasing DH, due to PVA network tightening in the absence of acetate groups. This corresponds well with the higher Tg observed in the resin with the higher DH. DH was also shown to impact the plasticization of PVA with glycerol, indicating that the larger cavities-created by the weaker hydrogen bonding acetate groups-are capable of accommodating glycerol molecules with negligible effect on the cavity dimensions.",Hydrophobic Modification of Nanocellulose via a Two-Step Silanation Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960960,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMOS), which is a silanation modifier, was grafted onto nanocellulose crystals (NCC) through a two-step method using KH560 (ɤ-(2,3-epoxyproxy)propytrimethoxysilane) as a linker to improve the hydrophobicity of NCC. The reaction mechanism of NCC with KH560 and DTMOS and its surface chemical characteristics were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and HCl⁻acetone titration. These analyses confirmed that KH560 was grafted onto the surface of NCC through the ring-opening reaction, before DTMOS was covalently grafted onto the surface of NCC using KH560 as a linker. The grafting of NCC with DTMOS resulted in an improvement in its hydrophobicity due to an increase in its water contact angle from 0° to about 140°. In addition, the modified NCC also possessed enhanced thermal stability.",Sugar Functionalized Synergistic Dendrimers for Biocompatible Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960959,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Sugars containing cationic polymers are potential carriers for in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid delivery. Monosaccharides such as glucose and galactose have been chemically conjugated to various materials of synergistic poly-lysine dendrimer systems for efficient and biocompatible delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA). The synergistic dendrimers, which contain lipid conjugated glucose terminalized lysine dendrimers, have significantly lower adverse impact on cells while maintaining efficient cellular entry. Moreover, the synergistic dendrimers complexed to siRNA induced RNA interference (RNAi) in the cells and profoundly knocked down green fluorescence protein (GFP) as well as the endogenously expressing disease related gene Plk1. The new synergic dendrimers may be promising system for biocompatible and efficient siRNA delivery.",Bioinspired Engineering towards Tailoring Advanced Lignin/Rubber Elastomers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960958,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The pursuit of high volume and high value-added applications for lignin has been a long-term challenge. In this work, inspired by the energy sacrificial mechanism from biological materials, we developed high-performance lignin/carbon black (CB)/nitrile rubber (NBR) elastomers by constructing a dual-crosslinking network consisting of sulfur covalent bonds and dynamic coordination sacrificial bonds. Lignin was not only used for the substitution of half mass of CB in the NBR elastomer but also served as natural ligands for the Zn-based coordination bonds, providing a significant synergistic coordination enhancement effect. The mechanical performance of the elastomers can be easily manipulated by adjusting the proportion of non-permanent coordination bonds and permanent covalent bonds. Lignin/CB/NBR elastomers with a higher strength and modulus than CB-filled elastomers were obtained while maintaining excellent elasticity. The thermal stability and the high-temperature oil resistance of NBR elastomers were also improved by incorporation of lignin and metal coordination bonds. Overall, this work inspires a new solution for the design of high-performance lignin/rubber elastomers with a high lignin loading content.",Biomimetic Growth of Hydroxyapatite on Electrospun CA/PVP Core⁻Shell Nanofiber Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960957,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, cellulose acetate (CA)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) core⁻shell nanofibers were successfully fabricated by electrospinning their homogeneous blending solution. Uniform and cylindrical nanofibers were obtained when the PVP content increased from 0 to 2 wt %. Because of the concentration gradient associated with the solvent volatilization, the composite fibers flattened when the PVP increased to 5 wt %. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the existence of a hydrogen bond between the CA and PVP molecules, which enhanced the thermodynamic properties of the CA/PVP nanofibers, as shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results. To analyze the interior structure of the CA/PVP fibers, the water-soluble PVP was selectively removed by immersing the fiber membranes in deionized water. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the PVP component, which has a low surface tension, was driven to the exterior of the fiber to form a discontinuous phase, whereas the high-content CA component inclined to form the internal continuous phase, thereby generating a core⁻shell structure. After the water-treatment, the CA/PVP composite fibers provided more favorable conditions for mineral crystal deposition and growth. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and FTIR proved that the crystal was hydroxyapatite (HAP) and that the calcium to phosphorus ratio was 1.47, which was close to the theoretical value of 1.67 in HAP. Such nanofiber membranes could be potentially applicable in bone tissue engineering.",Microstructure Evolution of Immiscible PP-PVA Blends Tuned by Polymer Ratio and Silica Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960956,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Composites of polypropylene (PP) and water soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can become an environmentally friendly precursor in preparing porous material, and their biphasic morphology needs to be manipulated. In this work, PP-PVA extrudates were prepared with a twin-screw extruder, and different PP/PVA ratios were employed to manipulate the morphology of the blends. Afterwards, different silicas were imbedded within the blends to further regulate the biphasic microstructure. PVA continuity, as a vital parameter in obtaining porous material, was determined by selective extraction measurement, and PP-PVA biphasic morphology was characterized by scanning microscopy analyses (SEM). Rheological measurement was also performed to correlate the microstructure evolution of the blends. First, it was found that with the increment of PVA proportion, PVA continuity is raised gradually, and the microstructure of blends containing 40⁻50 wt % of PVA is approaching co-continuous. Second, the localization of silicas was predicted based on the wettability of silica and polymers, and it was also confirmed by TEM that different silicas showed selective distribution. It is inspiring that R972 nanoparticles were found mainly distributed at the interface, which gives a possibility in preparing a surface-modified porous material. The shape distribution and average size of PVA nodules were examined by analyzing the SEM images. It is indicated that silicas with different wettabilities play disparate roles in tuning the biphasic microstructures, leading to heterogeneous PVA continuity.",Dyeing Property and Adsorption Kinetics of Reactive Dyes for Cotton Textiles in Salt-Free Non-Aqueous Dyeing Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960955,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In recent years, new concepts in textile dyeing technology have been investigated which aim to decrease the use of chemicals and the emission of water. In this work, dyeing of cotton textiles with reactive dyes has been investigated in a silicone non-aqueous dyeing system. Compared with conventional aqueous dyeing, almost 100% of reactive dyes can be adsorbed on cotton textiles without using any salts in non-aqueous dyeing systems, and the fixation of dye is also higher (80%~90% for non-aqueous dyeing vs. 40%~50% for traditional dyeing). The pseudo-second-order kinetic model can best describe the adsorption and equilibrium of reactive dyes in the non-aqueous dyeing systems as well as in the traditional water dyeing system. In the non-aqueous dyeing systems, the adsorption equilibrium of reactive dyes can be reached quickly. Particularly in the siloxane non-aqueous dyeing system, the adsorption equilibrium time of reactive dye is only 5⁻10 min at 25 °C, whereas more time is needed at 60 °C in the water dyeing system. The surface tension of non-aqueous media influences the adsorption rate of dye. The lower the surface tension, the faster the adsorption rate of reactive dye, and the higher the final uptake of dye. As a result, non-aqueous dyeing technology provides an innovative approach to increase dye uptake under a low dyeing temperature, in addition to making large water savings."

The mesh is capable of carrying large loads of chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel (PTX), as well as magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The mesh generates heat when the loaded MNPs are activated in an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The mesh is thermo-responsive, so the heat generated can be also used to trigger PTX release from the mesh. An electrospinning method was employed to fabricate the mesh using a copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide and N-hydroxymethylacrylamide, the phase transition temperature of which was adjusted to the mild-hyperthermia temperature range around 43 °C. In vitro anti-tumor studies demonstrated that both MNP- and PTX-loaded mesh killed about 66% of cells, whereas only PTX-loaded mesh killed about 43% of cells. In a mouse lung cancer model, the thermo-chemotherapy combo displayed enhanced anti-tumor activity and the systemic toxic effects on mice were eliminated due to local release of the chemotherapeutic agents. The proposed fiber system might provide a blueprint to guide the design of the next generation of local drug delivery systems for safe and effective cancer treatment.",Thermal Stability and Flame Retardancy of Polypropylene Composites Containing Siloxane-Silsesquioxane Resins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960943,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A novel group of silsesquioxane derivatives, which are siloxane-silsesquioxane resins (S4SQ), was for the first time examined as possible flame retardants in polypropylene (PP) materials. Thermal stability of the PP/S4SQ composites compared to the S4SQ resins and neat PP was estimated using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis under nitrogen and in air atmosphere. The effects of the non-functionalized and n-alkyl-functionalized siloxane-silsesquioxane resins on thermostability and flame retardancy of PP materials were also evaluated by thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and by cone calorimeter tests. The results revealed that the functionalized S4SQ resins may form a continuous ceramic layer on the material surface during its combustion, which improves both thermal stability and flame retardancy of the PP materials. This beneficial effect was observed especially when small amounts of the S4SQ fillers were applied. The performed analyses allowed us to propose a possible mechanism for the degradation of the siloxane-silsesquioxane resins, as well as to explain their possible role during the combustion of the PP/S4SQ composites.",Mechanism of Yellowing: Carbonyl Formation during Hygrothermal Aging in a Common Amine Epoxy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960942,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Epoxies are often exposed to water due to rain and humid air environments. Epoxy yellows during its service time under these conditions, even when protected from UV radiation. The material's color is not regained upon redrying, indicating irreversible aging mechanisms. Understanding what causes a discoloration is of importance for applications where the visual aspect of the material is significant. In this work, irreversible aging mechanisms and the cause of yellowing were identified. Experiments were performed using a combination of FT-NIR, ATR-FT-IR, EDX, HR-ICP-MS, pH measurements, optical microscopy, SEM, and DMTA. Such extensive material characterization and structured logic of investigation, provided the necessary evidence to investigate the long-term changes. No chain scission (hydrolysis or oxidation-induced) was present in the studied common DGEBA/HDDGE/IPDA/POPA epoxy, whilst it was found that thermo-oxidation and leaching occurred. Thermo-oxidation involved evolution of carbonyl groups in the polymeric carbon⁻carbon backbone, via nucleophilic radical attack and minor crosslinking of the HDDGE segments. Four probable reactive sites were identified, and respective reactions were proposed. Compounds involved in leaching were identified to be epichlorohydrin and inorganic impurities but were found to be unrelated to yellowing. Carbonyl formation in the epoxy backbone due to thermo-oxidation was the cause for the yellowing of the material.",Improve the Performance of Soy Protein-Based Adhesives by a Polyurethane Elastomer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960941,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The purpose of this study was to improve the performance of soy protein isolate (SPI) adhesives using a polyurethane elastomer. Triglycidylamine (TGA), SPI, thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU), and γ-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (KH-560) were used to develop a novel SPI-based adhesive. The residual rate, functional groups, thermal stability, and fracture surface micrographs of the cured adhesives were characterized. Three-ply plywood was fabricated, and the dry/wet shear strength was determined. The experimental results suggested that introducing 2% TGA improved the residual rate of the SPI/TGA adhesive by 4.1% because of the chemical cross-linking reaction between epoxy groups and protein molecules. Incorporating 7% TPU into the SPI/TGA adhesive, the residual rate of the adhesive increased by 5.2% and the dry/wet shear strength of plywood bonded by SPI/TGA/TPU adhesive increased by 10.7%/67.7%, respectively, compared with that of SPI/TGA adhesive. When using KH-560 and TPU together, the residual rate of the adhesive improved by 0.9% compared with that of SPI/TGA/TPU adhesive. The dry and wet shear strength of the plywood bonded by the SPI/TGA/TPU/KG-560 adhesive further increased by 23.2% and 23.6% respectively when compared with that of SPI/TGA/TPU adhesive. TPU physically combined with the SPI/TGA adhesive to form a interpenetration network and KH-560 acted as a bridge to connect TPU and SPI/TGA to form a joined crosslinking network, which improved the thermo stability/toughness of the adhesive and created a uniform ductile fracture section of the adhesive.",New Methods to Study the Behavior of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers in Aprotic Solvents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960940,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This work presents three new experimental methods for studying molecular imprinting. The electric conductivity measurements of the pre-polymerization mixture of amine templates in an aprotic solvent provide evidence of ionic dissociation of the pre-polymerization complexes. The displacement measurement of the template propranolol from its molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) using a quaternary ammonium ion in toluene, shows that this MIP behaves as an ion exchanger even in a non-polar solvent. The same experiment also shows that template binding to the MIP from toluene involves ionic interaction. The third experimental method introduced here serves to study the models of template binding on MIPs. To this end the binding isotherm of propranolol (PR) has been measured on a polymer mixture consisting of non-imprinted control polymer (NIP) and a stronger binding acidic polymer, respectively. All three methods are suitable for studying several other imprinting systems.","Sponge-Like Water De-/Ad-Sorption versus Solid-State Structural Transformation and Colour-Changing Behavior of an Entangled 3D Composite Supramolecuar Architecture, [Ni₄(dpe)₄(btc)₂(Hbtc)(H₂O)₉]·3H₂O.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960939,Polymers,2019 04 11,"An entangled composite compound, [Ni₄(dpe)₄(btc)₂(Hbtc)(H₂O)₉]·3H₂O (1), where H₃btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and dpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane, has been synthesized and structurally characterized. Single-crystal structural determination reveals that compound 1 consists of four coordination polymers (CPs), with two two-dimensional (2D) (4,4) layered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of [Ni(dpe)(Hbtc)(H₂O)] and [Ni(dpe)(btc)(H₂O)]- anion, and two one-dimensional (1D) polymeric chains of [Ni(dpe)(btc)(H₂O)₃]- anion and [Ni(dpe)(H₂O)₄]2+ cation, respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture of 1 is constructed via the inter-penetration of inter-digited, double-layered, 2D rectangle-grid MOFs by two 1D coordination polymeric chains, and tightly entangled together via the combination of inter-CPs π⁻π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. The ad-/de-sorption isotherms of 1 for water displays a hysteresis profile with a maximum adsorption of 17.66 water molecules of per molecule unit at relative P/P₀ < 0.89. The reversible de-/re-hydration processes in 1 monitored by cyclic water de-/ad-sorption TG analysis and PXRD measurements evidence a sponge-like water de-/ad-sorption property associated with a thermal-induced solid-state structural transformation. The magnetic property of 1 suggests that the ferromagnetic coupling might refer to a stronger inter-Ni(II) interaction, which could be along the btc3- or Hbtc2- ligands; the antiferromagnetic coupling corresponding to the weaker inter-Ni(II) interactions, which could be the dpe ligands for the 2D framework.",Influence of the Lignin Content on the Properties of Poly(Lactic Acid)/lignin-Containing Cellulose Nanofibrils Composite Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960938,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/lignin-containing cellulose nanofibrils (L-CNFs) composite films with different lignin contents were produced bythe solution casting method. The effect of the lignin content on the mechanical, thermal, and crystallinity properties, and PLA/LCNFs interfacial adhesion wereinvestigated by tensile tests, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The tensile strength and modulus of the PLA/9-LCNFs (9 wt % lignin LCNFs) composites are 37% and 61% higher than those of pure PLA, respectively. The glass transition temperature (Tg) decreases from 61.2 for pure PLA to 52.6 °C for the PLA/14-LCNFs (14 wt % lignin LCNFs) composite, and the composites have higher thermal stability below 380 °C than pure PLA. The DSC results indicate that the LCNFs, containing different lignin contents, act as a nucleating agent to increase the degree of crystallinity of PLA. The effect of the LCNFs lignin content on the PLA/LCNFs compatibility/adhesion was confirmed by the FTIR, SEM, and Tg results. Increasing the LCNFs lignin content increases the storage modulus of the PLA/LCNFs composites to a maximum for the PLA/9-LCNFs composite. This study shows that the lignin content has a considerable effect on the strength and flexibility of PLA/LCNFs composites.",Thickness-Dependent DC Electrical Breakdown of Polyimide Modulated by Charge Transport and Molecular Displacement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960937,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyimide has excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties and is widely used as a dielectric material in electrical equipment and electronic devices. However, the influencing mechanism of sample thickness on electrical breakdown of polyimide has not been very clear until now. The direct current (DC) electrical breakdown properties of polyimide as a function of thickness were investigated by experiments and simulations of space charge modulated electrical breakdown (SCEB) model and charge transport and molecular displacement modulated (CTMD) model. The experimental results show that the electrical breakdown field decreases with an increase in the sample thickness in the form of an inverse power function, and the inverse power index is 0.324. Trap properties and carrier mobility were also measured for the simulations. Both the simulation results obtained by the SCEB model and the CTMD model have the inverse power forms of breakdown field as a function of thickness with the power indexes of 0.030 and 0.339. The outputs of the CTMD model were closer to the experiments. This indicates that the displacement of a molecular chain with occupied deep traps enlarging the free volume might be a main factor causing the DC electrical breakdown field of polyimide varying with sample thickness.",High Pressure Treatment for Improving Water Vapour Barrier Properties of Poly(lactic acid)/Ag Nanocomposite Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960936,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Effects of high pressure treatment (0, 200 and 400 MPa) on water vapour barrier, microstructure, thermal, and mechanical properties of poly (lactic acid) (PLA)/Ag nanocomposite films were investigated. The migration behavior of nano-Ag from the nanocomposite films in the presence of 50% (v/v) ethanol as a food simulant was also studied. The water vapour barrier properties increased as pressure was applied to film-forming solutions. High pressure treatment enhanced the mutual effect between PLA and nanoparticles, leading to a more compact network structure in PLA/Ag nanocomposite films. Furthermore, PLA/Ag nanocomposite films treated by high pressure were significantly affected by microstructure, thermal, and mechanical properties when, compared with untreated samples. High pressure treatment at 200 to 400 MPa significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the migration of nano-Ag from the films.

The nanoparticle dispersion can be achieved in oligomer matrices due to the presence of electrostatic interactions. We show that the overall configuration of ionic oligomer chains, as characterized by their radii of gyration, can be perturbed at dilute nanoparticle loading by the presence of charged nanoparticles. In addition, the nanoparticle's diffusivity is reduced due to the electrostatic interactions, in comparison to conventional nanocomposites where the electrostatic interaction is absent. The charged nanoparticles are found to move by a hopping mechanism."

A profound understanding of the driving forces of standard methods like ultrasonic and mechanical dispersion is necessary. To derive the impact of applied frequency and strain on the resulting dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-filled epoxy resin, this work addresses the strain and frequency dependency of oscillatory shear flow-induced network changes. Strain- and frequency-sweeps were performed for a wide parameter set with in-line measurement of electrical DC resistance to monitor changes in the MWCNT network. Changes in electrical resistance reveal destruction and formation of the MWCNT network. A fundamental novel finding is the governing dependency of changes in the electrical network on applied shear amplitude. The applied frequency barely induces network changes. Applied shear rates do not correlate with particular network states.",Fabrication of PPy Nanosphere/rGO Composites via a Facile Self-Assembly Strategy for Durable Microwave Absorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960923,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Traditional magnetic metal and alloy materials suffer from easy oxidation and high density, which hinders their practical application as high-performance microwave absorbers. Lightweight and durability have become new goals in the fabrication of the next generation of microwave absorbers. Herein, we report the synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) nanosphere/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites through chemical reduction of self-assembly PPy nanosphere/GO hybrids. PPy nanospheres and GO are integrated effectively by π⁻π interaction of dual conjugated systems. When the mass ratio of PPy nanospheres to rGO is 0.6:1, the resultant composite, PPy/rGO-0.6, presents comparable/superior reflection loss characteristics to those magnetic metals and their related graphene-based composites in previous studies. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that well-matched characteristic impedance, multiple polarization loss, and good conductivity loss are, together, responsible for the excellent microwave absorption performance of PPy/rGO-0.6. More importantly, PPy/rGO-0.6 also exhibits good microwave absorption after being treated at 423 K for a long time. This work provides a new idea for designing and preparing a high-performance microwave absorber with lightweight and durable features.",Hydrogel Biomaterials for Stem Cell Microencapsulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960922,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Stem cell transplantation has been recognized as a promising strategy to induce the regeneration of injured and diseased tissues and sustain therapeutic molecules for prolonged periods in vivo. However, stem cell-based therapy is often ineffective due to low survival, poor engraftment, and a lack of site-specificity. Hydrogels can offer several advantages as cell delivery vehicles, including cell stabilization and the provision of tissue-like environments with specific cellular signals; however, the administration of bulk hydrogels is still not appropriate to obtain safe and effective outcomes. Hence, stem cell encapsulation in uniform micro-sized hydrogels and their transplantation in vivo have recently garnered great attention for minimally invasive administration and the enhancement of therapeutic activities of the transplanted stem cells. Several important methods for stem cell microencapsulation are described in this review. In addition, various natural and synthetic polymers, which have been employed for the microencapsulation of stem cells, are reviewed in this article.",Preparation and Properties of sc-PLA/PMMA Transparent Nanofiber Air Filter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960920,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Particulate matter (PM) pollution is a serious concern for the environment and public health. To protect indoor air quality, nanofiber filters have been used to coat window screens due to their high PM removal efficiency, transparency and low air resistance. However, these materials have poor mechanical property. In this study, electrostatic induction-assisted solution blowing was used to fabricate polylactide stereocomplex (sc-PLA), which served as reinforcement to enhance the physical cross-linking point to significantly restrict poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) molecular chain motion and improve the mechanical properties of sc-PLA/PMMA nanofibers. Moreover, the introduction of sc-PLA led to the formation of thick/thin composite nanofiber structure, which is beneficial for the mechanical property. Thus, sc-PLA/PMMA air filters of ~83% transparency with 99.5% PM2.5 removal and 140% increase in mechanical properties were achieved when 5 wt % sc-PLA was added to PMMA. Hence, the addition of sc-PLA to transparent filters can effectively improve their performance.",Extraction of Keratin from Rabbit Hair by a Deep Eutectic Solvent and Its Characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960918,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Keratin from a variety of sources is one of the most abundant biopolymers. In livestock and textile industries, a large amount of rabbit hair waste is produced every year, and therefore it is of great significance to extract keratin from waste rabbit hair in terms of the treatment and utilization of wastes. In this study, a novel, eco-friendly and benign choline chloride/oxalic acid deep eutectic solvent at a molar ratio of 1:2 was applied to dissolve waste rabbit hair, and after dissolution keratin was separated by dialysis, filtration, and freeze-drying. The dissolution temperature effect was discussed, and the resulting keratin powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, protein electrophoresis, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, and amino acid analysis. During the dissolution process, the α-helix structure of rabbit hair was deconstructed, and the disulfide bond linkages were broken. The solubility of rabbit hair was significantly enhanced by increasing dissolution temperature, and reached 88% at 120 °C. The keratin produced by dissolving at 120 °C displayed flaky powders after freeze-drying, and had a molecular weight ranging from 3.8 to 5.8 kDa with a high proportion of serine, glutamic acid, cysteine, leucine, and arginine. Such features of molecular weight and amino acid distribution provide more choices for the diverse applications of keratin materials.","Fabrication of High Quality, Large Wet Lay-Up/Vacuum Bag Laminates by Sliding a Magnetic Tool.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960917,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study presents a novel method to fabricate high-quality, large composite parts which can be used in a wet lay-up/vacuum bag (WLVB) process. The new method utilizes a commercial lifting magnet, which is commonly used for transporting ferrous plates, to apply a magnetic consolidation pressure on the WLVB composite lay-up. The pressure is applied on a large area of the laminate by slowly sliding the magnet over the vacuum bag surface, which leads to an improved laminate quality. When further improvement is desirable, multiple passes of the magnet can be performed, where each pass successively compacts the lay-up. To explore the feasibility of implementing this technique, random mat and plain weave glass/epoxy laminates were fabricated, and their properties compared to conventional WLVB laminates. The effects of the number of moving passes of the lifting magnet on the laminate microstructure and properties are also investigated. As a result of multiple passes, the fiber volume fraction in random mat and plain weave laminates increases to 34% and 53%, representing 80% and 16% improvements, respectively. In addition, the void volume fraction reduces almost by 60% to a very low level of 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. Consequently, the flexural properties considerably enhance by 20⁻81%, which demonstrates the potential of the proposed method to produce WLVB parts with substantially higher quality. It is also shown that there exists an optimal number of passes, depending on the fabric type where additional passes induce new voids as a result of excessive resin removal.",Synthesis and in Vitro Cytocompatibility of Segmented Poly(Ester-Urethane)s and Poly(Ester-Urea-Urethane)s for Bone Tissue Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960916,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Two series of segmented polyurethanes were obtained and their mechanical and thermal properties as well as their biodegradability and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The chemical nature of the polyurethanes was varied by using either 1,4 butanediol (poly-ester-urethanes, PEUs) or l-lysine ethyl ester dihydrochloride (poly-ester-urea-urethanes, PEUUs) as chain extenders. Results showed that varying the hard segment influenced the thermal and mechanical properties of the obtained polymers. PEUs showed strain and hardness values of about 10⁻20 MPa and 10⁻65 MPa, respectively. These values were higher than the obtained values for the PEUUs due to the phase segregation and the higher crystallinity observed for the polyester-urethanes (PEUs); phase segregation was also observed and analyzed by XRD and DSC. Moreover, both series of polymers showed hydrolytic degradation when they were submerged in PBS until 90 days with 20% of weight loss. In vitro tests using a Human Osteoblastic cell line (Hob) showed an average of 80% of cell viability and good adhesion for both series of polymers.",Morphology and Thermal Properties of Calcium Alginate/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960915,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Calcium alginate (CaAlg) is a kind of biodegradable and eco-friendly functional material, and CaAlg/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites are expected to be applied as new textile, heat-generating, and flame-retardant materials. In this paper, the CaAlg/rGO composites were prepared by a sol-gel method and their morphological and thermal properties were studied. The results showed that the introduction of rGO can efficiently improve the thermal stability of CaAlg. Further study showed that rGO increased the carbon formation rate by 4.1%, indicating that the thermal stability was improved by the promotion of carbon formation. Moreover, the weight loss rate of the composites was faster at 180⁻200 °C than that of CaAlg, after which the rate was less comparatively, suggesting the better thermal stability of the composite. This maybe because the high heat transfer efficiency of rGO allowed the material to reach the temperature of the thermal decomposition of the glycan molecule chain within a short time, and then promoted carbon formation. The thermal cracking mechanism of the composites is proposed based on the experimental data.",Biodegradable Polycarbonate Iongels for Electrophysiology Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960914,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In recent years, gels based on ionic liquids incorporated into polymer matrices, namely iongels, have emerged as long-term contact media for cutaneous electrophysiology. Iongels possess high ionic conductivity and negligible vapor pressure and can be designed on demand. In spite of the extensive efforts devoted to the preparation of biodegradable ionic liquids, the investigations related to the preparation of iongels based on biodegradable polymers remain scarce. In this work, biodegradable polycarbonate-based iongels are prepared by ring-opening polymerization of N-substituted eight ring membered cyclic carbonate monomers in the presence of imidazolium lactate ionic liquid. Our iongels are able to take up 10⁻30 wt % of ionic liquid and become softer materials by increasing the amount of free ionic liquid. Rheological measurements showed that the cross-over point between the storage modulus G' and loss modulus G″ occurs at lower angular frequencies when the loading of free ionic liquid increases. These gels are able to take up to 30 wt % of the ionic liquid and the ionic conductivity of these gels increased up to 5 × 10-4 S·cm-1 at 25 °C as the amount of free ionic liquid increased. Additionally, we assess the biodegradation studies of the iongels by immersing them in water. The iongels decrease the impedance with the human skin to levels that are similar to commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes, allowing an accurate physiologic signals recording. The low toxicity and biodegradability of polycarbonate-based iongels make these materials highly attractive for cutaneous electrophysiology applications.",Limitations of Viscoelastic Constitutive Models for Carbon-Black Reinforced Rubber in Medium Dynamic Strains and Medium Strain Rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960913,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Modelling the viscoelastic behavior of rubber for use in component design remains a challenge. Most of the literature does not consider the typical regimes encountered by anti-vibration devices that are deformed to medium dynamic strains (0.5 to 3.5) at medium strain rates (0.5/s to 10/s). Previous studies have either focused on the behaviour at small strains and small strain rates or in fast loading conditions that result in low cycle fatigue or tearing phenomena. There is a lack of understanding of the dynamic response of natural rubber suspension components when used in real vehicle applications. This paper presents a review of popular viscoelastic nonlinear constitutive models and their ability to model the mechanical behaviour of typical elastomer materials such as Natural Rubber (NR) incorporating different PHR (Parts per Hundred Rubber, XX) of carbon black. The range of strain and strain rate are typical for the materials used in rubber suspensions when operating in severe service operating conditions, such as over rough terrain or over pot-holes. The cyclic strain is applied at different amplitudes and different strain rates in this medium strain range. Despite the availability of many models in the literature, our study reports that none of the existing models can fit the data satisfactorily over a wide range of conditions."

In this study, flexibility of PLA/starch (PSt) blend was enhanced using epoxidized palm oil (EPO) as the green plasticizer. The PLA/starch/EPO (PSE) blends were prepared while using the solution casting method by fixing the content of starch and varying ratio of EPO. The thermal properties, such as glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and crystallization temperature (Tcc) were decreased by increasing the amount of EPO into PSt, indicating that EPO increases the chain mobility. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that thermal degradation resistance of PSE was higher when compared to PSt. The mechanical testing revealed that EPO at all contents improved the mechanical properties, such as increment of the elongation-at-break and impact strength. Whereas, dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the addition of filler into PLA decreased the storage modulus of PLA. The carbonyl group of the aliphatic ester remained the same in the PSE blends. The morphological study verified the ductility of PSE blends surface when compared to the brittle surface of PSt. As for the soil burial tests, EPO accelerated the degradation of blends. From these results, it can be concluded that EPO improved the flexibility of PLA blends.",Effect of Extrusion Temperature on the Physico-Mechanical Properties of Unidirectional Wood Fiber-Reinforced Polylactic Acid Composite (WFRPC) Components Using Fused Deposition Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960901,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Wood fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites (WFRPCs) were used as a filament to manufacture the unidirectional WFRPC components by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM). The physico-mechanical properties of the WFRPC components printed at different extrusion temperatures (200, 210, 220, and 230 °C) were determined. The results revealed that most of the physical properties (moisture content, surface roughness, water absorption rate, and thickness swelling rate) of the printed WFRPC component were not significantly influenced by extrusion temperature, while its density and color difference increased as the extrusion temperature increased. Additionally, the tensile and flexural properties of the FDM-printed WFRPC component decreased when the extrusion temperature was more than 200 °C, whereas the compressive strength and internal bond strength increased by 15.1% and 24.3%, respectively, when the extrusion temperature was increased from 200 to 230 °C. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that the fracture surface of the tensile component printed at a higher extrusion temperature exhibited a better compatibility at fiber/PLA interfaces and good adhesion between the extruded filament segments. These results indicate that the FDM printing process using different extrusion temperatures has a substantial impact on the surface color, density, and mechanical properties of the printed WFRPC component.",Phase Separation Driven On-Demand Debondable Waterborne Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960900,Polymers,2019 04 11,A waterborne pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) that shows high adhesive performance and easy debondability on demand without leaving residues on the substrate (adhesive failure) has been developed. A key component of the PSA is a semicrystalline phase that is beneficial for the adhesive properties and that becomes fluid when heated above the melting temperature. Migration of this liquid-like polymer to the substrate-adhesive interface and hardening upon cooling results in a hard non-tacky interface that facilitates debonding. The effect of the particle morphology on the debonding ability is discussed.,Detection of Acidic Pharmaceutical Compounds Using Virus-Based Molecularly Imprinted Polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960899,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have proven to be particularly effective chemical probes for the molecular recognition of proteins, DNA, and viruses. Here, we started from a filamentous bacteriophage to synthesize a multi-functionalized MIP for detecting the acidic pharmaceutic clofibric acid (CA) as a chemical pollutant. Adsorption and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring experiments showed that the phage-functionalized MIP had a good binding affinity for CA, compared with the non-imprinted polymer and MIP. In addition, the reusability of the phage-functionalized MIP was demonstrated for at least five repeated cycles, without significant loss in the binding activity. The results indicate that the exposed amino acids of the phage, together with the polymer matrix, create functional binding cavities that provide higher affinity to acidic pharmaceutical compounds.",Viscoelastic Properties of Unentangled Multicyclic Polystyrenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960898,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We report on the viscoelastic properties of linear, monocyclic, and multicyclic polystyrenes with the same low molecular weight. All polymers investigated were found to exhibit unentangled dynamics. For monocyclic polymers without inner loops, a cyclic-Rouse model complemented by the contribution of unlinked chains (whose fraction was determined experimentally) captured the observed rheological response. On the other hand, multicyclic polymers with inner loops were shown to follow a hierarchical cyclic-Rouse relaxation with the outer loops relaxing first, followed by the inner loop relaxation. The influence of unlinked linear chains was less significant in multicyclic polymers with inner loops. The isofrictional zero-shear viscosity decreased with increasing number of constrained segments on the coupling sites, which was attributed to the decreasing loop size and the dilution effect due to the hierarchical relaxation.",Spinning Cellulose Hollow Fibers Using 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium Acetate⁻Dimethylsulfoxide Co-Solvent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960897,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The mixture of the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EmimAc) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was employed to dissolve microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). A 10 wt % cellulose dope solution was prepared for spinning cellulose hollow fibers (CHFs) under a mild temperature of 50 °C by a dry⁻wet spinning method. The defect-free CHFs were obtained with an average diameter and thickness of 270 and 38 µm, respectively. Both the XRD and FTIR characterization confirmed that a crystalline structure transition from cellulose I (MCC) to cellulose II (regenerated CHFs) occurred during the cellulose dissolution in ionic liquids and spinning processes. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that regenerated CHFs presented a similar pyrolysis behavior with deacetylated cellulose acetate during pyrolysis process. This study provided a suitable way to directly fabricate hollow fiber carbon membranes using cellulose hollow fiber precursors spun from cellulose/(EmimAc + DMSO)/H₂O ternary system.",An Investigation of the Compressive Behavior of Polymer Electrode Membrane Fuel Cell's Gas Diffusion Layers under Different Temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960896,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this paper, a commercial gas diffusion layer is used, to quantitatively study the correlation between its compressive characteristics and its operating temperature. In polymer electrode membrane fuel cells, the gas diffusion layer plays a vital role in the membrane electrode assembly, over a wide range of operating temperatures. Therefore, understanding the thermo-mechanical performance of gas diffusion layers is crucial to design fuel cells. In this research, a series of compressive tests were conducted on a commercial gas diffusion layer, at three different temperatures. Additionally, a microscopical investigation was carried out with the help of a scanning electron microscope, to study the evolution and development of the microstructural damages in the gas diffusion layers which is caused by the thermo-mechanical load.

Methods of calculation of the most important flow characteristics, such as the solid bed profile, the pressure and temperature profiles, the mass flow rate, the power demand, the screw torque and the energy consumption were analysed. According to the mathematical model, a computer program was developed. Based on the computer program, simulation studies of the injection moulding process were conducted. Thereafter, the experimental studies, evaluating the theoretical model from the accuracy and usefulness point of view, were carried out. Important output quantities, such as the temperature and pressure profiles, the power demand by the screw, the torque on the screw and the screw rotation time were measured. The studies were performed on a specially made research office. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data measured for the most popular polymers and different operating parameters of the injection machine. The experimental studies have indicated the need to introduce some corrections to the mathematical model. Several modifications have been made to the model, mainly related to the methods of stress determining in the polymer layer. Finally, the output characteristics of the plasticization process in the injection moulding are now correctly determined by the model with an average error less than 10%.",Influence of Network Structure on the Crystallization Behavior in Chemically Crosslinked Hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960894,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The network structure of hydrogels is a vital factor to determine their physical properties. Two network structures within hydrogels based on eight-arm star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)(8PEG) have been obtained; the distinction between the two depends on the way in which the macromonomers were crosslinked: either by (i) commonly-used photo-initiated chain-growth polymerization (8PEG⁻UV), or (ii) Michael addition step-growth polymerization (8PEG⁻NH₃). The crystallization of hydrogels is facilitated by a solvent drying process to obtain a thin hydrogel film. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) results reveal that, while in the 8PEG⁻UV hydrogels only nano-scaled crystallites are apparent, the 8PEG⁻NH₃ hydrogels exhibit an assembly of giant crystalline domains with spherulite sizes ranging from 100 to 400 µm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses further confirm these results.

In this study, the influence of crosslinking via electronic beam irradiation on the morphology and mechanical behavior of unreinforced PA 66 and two types of short glass fiber reinforced PA 66 (30 wt % glass fiber content, 35 wt % glass fiber content) was investigated. In total, five different electronic beam irradiation doses in the range of 0 and 200 kGy were applied. Besides experiments with unconditioned specimens, also preconditioned specimens saturated with water at 80 °C for seven days were investigated. It was found that irradiation causes a shift to lower melting temperatures and lower melting enthalpies, while simultaneously leading to higher glass transition temperatures (TG), increasing small strain modulus values and higher tensile strengths. Also, as expected, preconditioning samples in water at 80 °C to water uptake saturation leads to a shift to lower TG values ('plasticization' effect). In terms of tensile behavior at room temperature, water saturated specimens (being above TG at room temperature) exhibited lower modulus and tensile strength values compared to quasi-dry specimens (being below TG at room temperature)."

The test results revealed that the water resistance of the DSF-based adhesive was significantly improved, attributed to the formation of a solid three-dimensional crosslinked network structure resulted from the repolymerization of DSF, the Maillard reaction between the protein and carbohydrate, and chemical crosslinking between the crosslinker and DSF. Moreover, SDS destroyed the hydrophobic interactions within protein and inhibited macromolecular aggregations during the thermal treatment. Therefore, more reactive groups buried within the globular structure of the soybean protein component of DSF could be released, which supported the repolymerization, Maillard reaction, and chemical crosslinking of DSF, thereby leading to an improved crosslinking density of the cured DSF-based adhesive. In addition, the adhesive composed of thermo-chemically treated DSF and EMPA exhibited preferable viscosity and viscosity stability suitable for the production of wood composites.",Biodegradable Rice Starch/Carboxymethyl Chitosan Films with Added Propolis Extract for Potential Use as Active Food Packaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960879,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Active films from rice starch/carboxymethyl chitosan (RS/CMCh) incorporated with propolis extract (ppl) were developed and characterized. The effect of the ppl content (0⁻10% w/w based on RS/CMCh) on the developed films' properties were determined by measuring the optical, mechanical, thermal, swelling, barrier, antimicrobial, and antioxidant attributes. The thermal stability and biodegradability of the films were also investigated. As the ppl content increased, free radical scavenging and a* and b* color values increased, whereas luminosity (L*) and swellability of the films decreased. The active films with 5⁻10% ppl possessed antimicrobial ability against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus). The active film with 10% ppl displayed increased flexibility and thermal stability, without a change in oxygen permeability. The results indicated that incorporation of ppl into RS/CMCh film could enhance the films' antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.",Inhibition of Tumor Growth via Systemic siRNA Delivery Using Reducible Bile Acid-Conjugated Polyethylenimine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960878,Polymers,2019 04 11,"RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), has been considered as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer owing to its ability to suppress target genes in a sequence-specific manner. In this study, a conjugate of the low molecular weight (MW) polyethylenimine (PEI) (MW 1800) and deoxycholic acid (DA) was further modified with 4-fluorothiophenol (FTP) (TP-DA-PEI) to achieve systemic siRNA delivery. The thiophenol group would be involved with disulfide bonds between the polymer chains and siRNA modified with free thiols (thiol-siRNA) to form and π⁻π interactions between the pendent aromatic groups and coprostane ring of the bile acid. The TP-DA-PEI conjugates could generate stable nanoparticles with thiol-siRNA. The TP-DA-PEI conjugate not only achieved enhanced intracellular uptake, serum stability, and transfection efficiency, but also showed high accumulation of TP-DA-PEI/thiol-siRNA polyplexes and significant tumor growth inhibition effect in tumor-bearing mice after systemic administration.",Study on the Sensing Signal Profiles for Determination of Process Window of Flexible Sensors Based on Surface Treated PDMS/CNT Composite Patches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960876,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, analysis of sensing signal profiles was conducted focusing on the close relationship between electrical conductivity and signal intensity in surface treated poly(dimethylsiloxane)/carbon nanotube (PDMS/CNT) composite patches for the purpose of their practical application as flexible chemical sensors. The flexible PDMS/CNT composite patches were prepared from a PDMS/CNT mixture with a two-roll apparatus. It was found that the PDMS/CNT pads showed a high electrical conductivity (10-1 S/m) even at low CNT loading (0.6 wt %) and a contact angle range of 105⁻118°. The surface of the obtained PDMS/CNT composite patches was treated using a simple bio-conjugation method to incorporate beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) molecules onto the surface as a sensing medium, in order to detect a model compound (Methyl Paraben, MePRB). FT-IR spectra indicated that beta-cyclodextrin molecules were effectively introduced on the surface of the PDMS/CNT patches. It was shown that the sensor signal intensity was substantially dependent on the base current value, which increased with increasing CNT loading. Accordingly, the base current value was intimately associated with the electrical conductivity of the composite patches. On the other hand, the increase in current over the base current (ΔI/I₀) obtained after the addition of the model compound was inversely proportional to the CNT content. In this way, analysis on the sensing signal profiles of the flexible chemical sensor system was conducted to determine a process window. This study is a very useful springboard for future research activities, as more profound studies are necessary to fully understand sensing signal profiles.",Structural Evolution of Two-Phase Blends of Polycarbonate and PMMA by Simultaneous Biaxial Stretching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960875,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We investigated the structural evolution of the two-phase blends of polycarbonate (PC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at various blend compositions by simultaneous biaxial stretching, using optical microscopy and SEM observation. The spherical PMMA domains and PC matrix of 30/70 PC/PMMA were enlarged uniformly at the all in-plane direction, while the anisotropic-shaped co-continuous structure in 50/50 PC/PMMA was deformed to a crosshatched structure by the in-plane bimodal orientation. In 70/30 PC/PMMA, the phase inversion was found to occur by simultaneous biaxial stretching; that is, the spherical PMMA domains were changed to a crosshatched matrix by the in-plane bimodal orientation due to coalescence of the PMMA domains during the stretching. Owing to the phase inversion, the surface hardness estimated by the pencil hardness test became harder, from 2B to 2H, increasing the strain from 1.0 to 2.0.",A Hyaluronic Acid Based Injectable Hydrogel Formed via Photo-Crosslinking Reaction and Thermal-Induced Diels-Alder Reaction for Cartilage Tissue Engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960874,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A hyaluronic acid (HA) based injectable hydrogel with gradually increasing mechanical properties was synthesized via photo-crosslinking reaction and thermal-induced Diels-Alder (DA) reaction. The injectable hydrogel can quickly gelate within 30 s by photo-crosslinking of HA-furan under the catalysis of lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP). This injectable property is beneficial to keep the encapsulated cell activity and convenient for clinical operation. And the mechanical properties can be control from 4.86 to 10.66 kPa by exposure time. Then, the thermal-induced DA click chemistry further occurs between furan groups and maleimide groups which gradually promoted the crosslinking density of the injectable hydrogel. The mechanical properties of the injectable hydrogel can be promoted to 21 kPa. ATDC-5 cells were successfully encapsulated in the injectable hydrogel and showed good activity. All the results suggested that the injectable hydrogel with gradually increasing mechanical properties formed by photo-crosslinking reaction and thermal-induced DA reaction has a good prospect of application in cartilage tissue engineering.","Oral Vaccine Delivery for Intestinal Immunity-Biological Basis, Barriers, Delivery System, and M Cell Targeting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960873,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Most currently available commercial vaccines are delivered by systemic injection. However, needle-free oral vaccine delivery is currently of great interest for several reasons, including the ability to elicit mucosal immune responses, ease of administration, and the relatively improved safety. This review summarizes the biological basis, various physiological and immunological barriers, current delivery systems with delivery criteria, and suggestions for strategies to enhance the delivery of oral vaccines. In oral vaccine delivery, basic requirements are the protection of antigens from the GI environment, targeting of M cells and activation of the innate immune response. Approaches to address these requirements aim to provide new vaccines and delivery systems that mimic the pathogen's properties, which are capable of eliciting a protective mucosal immune response and a systemic immune response and that make an impact on current oral vaccine development.",Evaluation of the Bactericidal and Fungicidal Activities of Poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethyl Ammonium Chloride)(Poly (METAC))-Based Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960872,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethyl ammonium chloride) (METAC) and the gels were prepared and evaluated for their bactericidal and fungicidal activities.

The effects of the thickness ratio of layers, different stratified structures and the variety of fillers on the sound absorption performance of the NBR-PUFM composites and the sound absorption mechanism were studied. The results show that the NBR-PUFM composite with a sandwich structure and thickness ratio of 1:8:1 displays good sound absorption, which could be improved further by adding fillers. Because the airflow resistivity, resonance absorption, interface dissipation and interface reflection were combined organically in the sandwich structure, the composites show excellent low-frequency sound absorption performance. Moreover, the composite also has advantages in cost and functionalization aspects.",Antibacterial Superabsorbent Polymers from Tara Gum Grafted Poly(Acrylic acid) Embedded Silver Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960870,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Tara gum/silver composite superabsorbent polymers were synthesized with tara gum grafted poly(acrylic acid), using K₂S₂O₈ (KPS) as an initiator and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a cross-linker.

The structures of complexes 3a, 2b and 3b were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. Complex 3a contained two iminopyridine ligands coordinated to the iron metal center forming an octahedral geometry, whereas 2b adopted a chloro-bridged dimer, and 3b featured with two patterns of cobalt centers bridged via chlorine atoms. Complexes 2b and 3b represented rare examples of chlorine bridged bimetallic Co(II) complexes. The fluorine substituents effects, particularly on catalytic activity and polymer properties such as molecular weight and regio-/stereo-selectivity were investigated when these complexes were employed for isoprene polymerization. Among the Fe(II)/methylaluminoxane (MAO) systems, the 4-CF₃ substituted iminopyridine Fe(II) complex 1a was found as a highly active isoprene polymerization catalyst exhibiting the highest activity of 10⁶ g·(mol of Fe)-1·h-1. The resultant polymer displayed lower molecular weight (Mn = 3.5 × 10⁴ g/mol) and moderate polydispersity index (PDI = 2.1). Furthermore, the ratio of cis-1,4-/3,4 was not affected by the F substituents. In the series of Co(II)/AlEt₂Cl binary systems, complexes containing electron-withdrawing N-aryl substituents (R = 4-CF₃, 2,6-2F) afforded higher molecular weights polyisoprene than that was obtained by the complex containing electron-donating N-alkyl substituents (R = octyl).

The as-prepared PCs with a multilayered structure exhibits significant improvement in overall EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) by adjusting the contents and distribution of electrical and magnetic loss fillers. The layer-structured PCs with low nanofiller content (5 wt % graphene nanosheets (GNSs) and 15 wt % Fe₃O₄) and a thickness of only 2 mm exhibited ultrahigh electrical conductivity and excellent EMI SE, reaching up to 2000 S/m and 45.7 dB in the X-band, respectively. The increased EMI SE of the layer-structured PCs was mainly based on the improved absorption rather than the reflection of electromagnetic waves, which was attributed to the ""absorb-reflect-reabsorb"" process for the incident electromagnetic waves. This work may provide a simple and effective approach to achieve new EMI shielding materials, especially for absorption-dominated EMI shielding.",Effects of Lubricant and Toughening Agent on the Fluidity and Toughness of Poplar Powder-Reinforced Polylactic Acid 3D Printing Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960857,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Three dimensional (3D) printing materials were manufactured with polylactic acid (PLA) and poplar powder using the twin screw extruder and 3D printing consumables extruder. Lubricant (TPW604) and toughening agent polyolefin elastomer (POE) were utilized to improve the fluidity and toughness of the materials. 3D printing materials were tested by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, melt flow rate, rheology behavior, impact and scanning electron microscope.

And POE can fill the voids formed by poplar powder in PLA, enhance interface compatibility between poplar powder and PLA, and effectively improve the fluidity and impact strength of 3D printing materials.",Bagasse Cellulose Grafted with an Amino-Terminated Hyperbranched Polymer for the Removal of Cr(VI) from Aqueous Solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960856,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A novel bio-adsorbent was fabricated via grafting an amino-terminated hyperbranched polymer (HBP-NH₂) onto bagasse cellulose. The morphology and microstructure of the HBP-NH₂-grafted bagasse cellulose (HBP-g-BC) were characterized and its adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) ions in aqueous solutions was investigated. The rough surface structure of HBP-g-BC that is beneficial for improving the adsorption capacity was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The grafting reaction was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The adsorbent performance was shown to be better with a lower pH value, a higher adsorbent dosage, or a higher initial Cr(VI) concentration. Moreover, the kinetics study revealed that the adsorption behavior followed a pseudo-second-order model. The isotherm results showed that the adsorption data could be well-fitted by the Langmuir, Freundlich, or Temkin models.

In this functional zone, the polymer melt is pressurized and readied to be pumped through the die. We have recently proposed a set of heuristic models for predicting the flow behavior of power-law fluids in two- and three-dimensional metering channels. These novel theories remove the need for numerical simulations and can be implemented easily in practice. Here we present a comparative study designed to validate these new methods against experimental data. Extensive experiments were performed on a well-instrumented laboratory single-screw extruder, using various materials, screw designs, and processing conditions. A network-theory-based simulation routine was written in MATLAB to replicate the flow in the metering zones in silico. The predictions of the three-dimensional heuristic melt-conveying model for the axial pressure profile along the screw are in excellent agreement with the experimental extrusion data.

The lignin-g-styrene product under the selected conditions had a grafting degree of 31 mol % of styrene, which was determined by quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The solvent addition to the reaction mixture and deoxygenation did not improve the yield of the polymerization reaction. The produced lignin-g-styrene polymer was then sulfonated using concentrated sulfuric acid. By introducing sulfonate group on the lignin-g-styrene polymers, the solubility and anionic charge density of 92 wt % (in a 10 g/L solution) and -2.4 meq/g, respectively, were obtained. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), static light scattering, two-dimensional COSY NMR, elemental analyses, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were also employed to characterize the properties of the lignin-g-styrene and sulfonate lignin-g-styrene products.

Tensile force profiles and the shear-rate-dependent globular-coil transition for grafted and non-grafted chains are investigated to shine light on the different unfolding mechanisms. The scaling of the critical shear rate, at which the globular-coil transition takes place, with the monomer number is inverse for the grafted and non-grafted scenarios. This implicates that for the grafted scenario, larger chains have a decreased critical shear rate, while for the non-grafted scenario higher shear rates are needed in order to unfold larger chains. Protrusions govern the unfolding transition of non-grafted polymers, while for grafted polymers, the maximal tension appears at the grafted end.",Electrically Conductive Polyetheretherketone Nanocomposite Filaments: From Production to Fused Deposition Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960850,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The present work reports the production and characterization of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) nanocomposite filaments incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphite nanoplates (GnP), electrically conductive and suitable for fused deposition modeling (FDM) processing. The nanocomposites were manufactured by melt mixing and those presenting electrical conductivity near 10 S/m were selected for the production of filaments for FDM. The extruded filaments were characterized for mechanical and thermal conductivity, polymer crystallinity, thermal relaxation, nanoparticle dispersion, thermoelectric effect, and coefficient of friction. They presented electrical conductivity in the range of 1.5 to 13.1 S/m, as well as good mechanical performance and higher thermal conductivity compared to PEEK. The addition of GnP improved the composites' melt processability, maintained the electrical conductivity at target level, and reduced the coefficient of friction by up to 60%. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) printed test specimens were produced, showing a Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength comparable to those of the filaments, but a lower strain at break and electrical conductivity. This was attributed to the presence of large voids in the part, revealing the need for 3D printing parameter optimization. Finally, filament production was up-scaled to kilogram scale maintaining the properties of the research-scale filaments."

The influence of the type of filler included in different morphologies and filler loading has been explored using copper exchanged materials such as the layered porous titanosilicate AM-4, layered stannosilicate UZAR-S3, and zeolites Y, MOR, and BEA. Compared to commercially available anion-exchange membranes, the best performing membranes in terms of WU, IEC, OH- conductivity and WVP in this study were those containing 10 wt % of Cu-AM-4 and Cu-UZAR-S3, although 10 wt % Cu-MOR provided better mechanical strength at close values of WVP and anion conductivity. It was also observed that when Cu was exchanged in a porous silicate matrix, its oxidation state was lower than when embedded as unsupported metal NPs. In addition, the statistical analysis of variance determined that the electrochemical properties of the membranes were noticeably affected by both the type and filler loading, and influenced also by the copper oxidation state and content in the membrane, but their hydrophilic properties were more affected by the polymers. The largest significant effects were noticed on the water sorption and transport properties, which gives scope for the design of AAEMs for electrochemical and water treatment applications.",New Pyridinium Type Poly(Ionic Liquids) as Membranes for CO₂ Separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960837,Polymers,2019 04 11,"New pyridinium based PILs have been prepared by modification of their precursors based on high molecular weight aromatic polyethers bearing main chain pyridine units. The proposed methodology involves the conversion of the precursors to their ionic analogues via N-methylation reaction, followed by anion exchange methathesis reaction to result in PILs with the desirable anions (tetrafluoroborate and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide). These PILs show excellent thermal stability, excellent mechanical properties, and most importantly can form very thin, free standing films with minimum thickness of 3 μm. As expected, the PIL containing the TFSI- anion showed improved CO₂ and CH₄ permeabilities compared to its analogue containing the BF₄-. PIL-IL composites membranes have also been prepared using the same PIL and different percentages of pyridinium based IL where it was shown that the membrane with the highest IL weight percentage (45 wt %) showed the highest CO₂ permeability (11.8 Barrer) and a high CO₂/CH₄ ideal selectivity of 35 at room temperature.",Role of PhaC Type I and Type II Enzymes during PHA Biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960835,Polymers,2019 04 11,"PHA synthases (PhaC) are grouped into four classes based on the kinetics and mechanisms of reaction. The grouping of PhaC enzymes into four classes is dependent on substrate specificity, according to the preference in forming short-chain-length (scl) or medium-chain-length (mcl) polymers: Class I, Class III and Class IV produce scl-PHAs depending on propionate, butyrate, valerate and hexanoate precursors, while Class II PhaC synthesize mcl-PHAs based on the alkane (C6 to C14) precursors. PHA synthases of Class I, in particular PhaCCs from Chromobacterium USM2 and PhaCCn/RePhaC1 from Cupriavidus necator/Ralstonia eutropha, have been analysed and the crystal structures of the C-domains have been determined. PhaCCn/RePhaC1 was also studied by X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis. Models have been proposed for dimerization, catalysis mechanism, substrate recognition and affinity, product formation, and product egress route. The assays based on amino acid substitution by mutagenesis have been useful to validate the hypothesis on the role of amino acids in catalysis and in accommodation of bulky substrates, and for the synthesis of PHB copolymers and medium-chain-length PHA polymers with optimized chemical properties.",A High-Performance and Low-Cost Soy Flour Adhesive with a Hydroxymethyl Melamine Prepolymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960834,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To improve the performance of a soy flour (SF)-based adhesive, a low-cost hydroxymethyl melamine prepolymer (HMP) was synthesized and then used to modify the SF-based adhesive. The HMP was characterized, and the performance of the adhesive was evaluated, including its residual rate, functions, thermal stability, and fracture section. Plywood was fabricated to measure wet shear strength. The results indicated that the HMP preferentially reacted with polysaccharose in SF and formed a cross-linking network to improve the water resistance of the adhesive. This polysaccharose-based network also combined with the HMP self-polycondensation network and soy protein to form an interpenetrating network, which further improved the water resistance of the adhesive. With the addition of 9% HMP, the wet shear strength (63 °C) of the plywood was 1.21 MPa, which was 9.3 times that of the SF adhesive. With the HMP additive increased to 15%, the shear strength (100 °C) of the plywood was 0.79 MPa, which met the plywood requirement for exterior use (≥0.7 MPa) in accordance with Chinese National Standard (GB/T 9846.3-2004). With the addition of 9% and 15% HMP, the residual rates of the adhesive improved by 5.1% and 8.5%, respectively. The dense interpenetrating network structure improved the thermal stability of the resultant adhesive and created a compact fracture to prevent moisture intrusion, which further increased the water resistance of the adhesive.",Efficient Determination of Slip-Link Parameters from Broadly Polydisperse Linear Melts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960833,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We investigate the ability of a coarse-grained slip-link model and a simple double reptation model to describe the linear rheology of polydisperse linear polymer melts. Our slip-link model is a well-defined mathematical object that can describe the equilibrium dynamics and non-linear rheology of flexible polymer melts with arbitrary polydispersity and architecture with a minimum of inputs: the molecular weight of a Kuhn step, the entanglement activity, and Kuhn step friction. However, this detailed model is computationally expensive, so we also examine predictions of the cheaper double reptation model, which is restricted to only linear rheology near the terminal zone. We report the storage and loss moduli for polydisperse polymer melts and compare with experimental measurements from small amplitude oscillatory shear. We examine three chemistries: polybutadiene, polypropylene and polyethylene. We also use a simple double reptation model to estimate parameters for the slip-link model and examine under which circumstances this simplified model works. The computational implementation of the slip-link model is accelerated with the help of graphics processing units, which allow us to simulate in parallel large ensembles made of up to 50,000 chains. We show that our simulation can predict the dynamic moduli for highly entangled polymer melts over nine decades of frequency. Although the double reptation model performs well only near the terminal zone, it does provide a convenient and inexpensive way to estimate the entanglement parameter for the slip-link model from polydisperse data.",Acylation of Lignin with Different Acylating Agents by Mechanical Activation-Assisted Solid Phase Synthesis: Preparation and Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960832,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Acylated lignins with substituents consisting of different lengths of carbon chains were prepared by a mechanical activation-assisted solid phase synthesis (MASPS) technology with a customized stirring ball mill as a reactor. The structures and properties were analyzed by UV/Vis, FTIR, NMR, SEM, DSC, and TG. The results showed that the acylated lignins were successfully prepared with either non-cyclic or cyclic anhydrides as the acylating agents. Both aliphatic hydroxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin reacted with non-cyclic anhydrides, and different reactivity of acylating agents resulted in different relative contents of phenolic and aliphatic substituents in the products. The reactivity of the cyclic anhydrides was weaker than that of the non-cyclic anhydrides, and the reactivity of the acylating agents decreased with increasing carbon chain length and unsaturated bonds of acyl groups. All of the acylated lignins except maleylated lignin had a lower glass transition temperature (Tg) than the original lignin. The acylated lignins prepared with non-cyclic anhydrides had better thermal stability than original lignin, and the thermal stability increased, but Tg decreased with an increasing chain length of the acyl groups. The acylated lignins prepared with cyclic anhydrides had higher a Tg than those with non-cyclic anhydrides with the same carbon number, and the thermal stability was not obviously improved.","Polyurethane/Red Mud Composites with Flexibility, Stretchability, and Flame Retardancy for Grouting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960831,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Flexibility, stretchability, and flame retardancy are of ever increasing importance in constructing grouting materials. Herein, a simple and effective strategy to make organic-inorganic composite grouting material in a ""flexible, stretchable, and flame retardant"" way was based on the excellent synergistic interactions among polyurethane prepolymer, red mud, polyethylene glycol, and trimethylolpropane. The resultant polyurethane/red mud composite grouting material with three-dimensional network structure presented a favorable flexibility, desirable compressive strength of 29.2 MPa at 50% compression state, and a good elongation at 15.1%. The grouting material was mainly composed of amorphous polyurethane and crystalline red mud, and its probable formation mechanism was reaction of prepolymer with H₂O, polyethylene glycol and trimethylolpropane under vigorous stirring in the presence of catalyst. Furthermore, the grouting material possessed favorable thermal stability, flame retardancy and repairment performance for roadway cracks. This work may open a simple and convenient avenue for the massive engineering application of red mud and preparation of flexible organic-inorganic hybrid grouting material.",Dentine Surface Morphology after Chlorhexidine Application-SEM Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960830,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a widely known and a very popular antibacterial agent that decreases the level of cariogenic bacteria. CHX applied on the cavity surface of dentine may influence adhesive bond strength. The aim of the study was to evaluate the dentine surface after different chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) application protocols. Different CHG application protocols were introduced. A concentration of 0.2% or 2.0% CHG was applied on the etched or unetched dentine surface for 15 or 30 s, then water rinsed or drained. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and energy disperse spectrometer (EDS) analysis of the dentine surfaces were performed. The application of 0.2% CHG for 15 s, followed by draining, on either etched or unetched dentine surface effectively removed the smear layer, leaving the surface enriched with CHG deposits. Conclusions: The concentration of CHG and its application time influenced the amount of CHG deposits and the degree of smear layer removal from the dentine surface.",The Rediscovery of POSS: A Molecule Rather than a Filler.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960829,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The use of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) for making polymer composites has grown exponentially since the last few years of the 20th century. In comparison with the other most commonly used fillers, POSSs possess the advantage of being molecules. Thus, this allows us to combine their nano-sized cage structures, which have dimensions that are similar to those of most polymer segments and produce a particular and exclusive chemical composition. These characteristics linked with their hybrid (inorganic⁻organic) nature allow researchers to modify POSS according to particular needs or original ideas, before incorporating them into polymers. In this present study, we first start with a brief introduction about the reasons for the rediscovery of these nanoparticles over the last 25 years. Starting from the form of POSS that is most widely used in literature (octaisobutyl POSS), this present study aims to evaluate how the reduction of symmetry through the introduction of organic groups favors their dispersion in polystyrene matrix without compromising their solubility.","Nonlinear Material Model for Quasi-Unidirectional Woven Composite Accounting for Viscoelastic, Viscous Deformation, and Stiffness Reduction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960828,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To clarify the individual contribution of viscoelastic and viscous deformation to the global nonlinear response of composites, multilevel cyclic loading-unloading recovery tensile tests were carried out. The experimental results show that there is a linear relationship between the viscous strain and viscoelastic strain of composites, regardless of the off-axis angle or loading stress level. On the basis of experimental results, a coupled damage-plasticity constitutive model was proposed. In this model, the plasticity theory was adopted to assess the evolution of viscous strains. The viscoelastic strain was represented as a linear function of viscous strains. Moreover, the Weibull function of the effective stress was introduced to evaluate the damage variables in terms of stiffness reduction. The tensile stress-strain curves, predicted by the proposed model, showed a good agreement with experimental results."

Many research documents focus on paper's excellent thermal stability, but less attention has been paid to the effect of oil on paper's degradation. In this research paper, we study the influence of different amine compounds on the thermal stability of both paper and oil, and a mechanism for the influence on paper-oil insulation as well as an optimal formula are proposed. First, six groups of paper were modified with different proportions of dicyandiamide (DICY), melamine, and polyacrylamide (PAM). Then, an accelerated thermal aging test at 130 °C was conducted for 30 days and the thermal aging characteristics of the oil-modified paper insulation were measured. The results showed that the thermal stability of the insulation paper modified with the amine compounds was remarkably improved, and P2 (2.25 wt % melamine, 0.75 wt % DICY, and 0.2 wt % PAM) presented the best anti-aging properties. However, certain properties of oil were influenced, such as acid value, and it was found that the ammonia produced by the amine stabilizers increased the copper compound content, which led to the deterioration of the insulating oil. Moreover, using a front-line orbital energy analysis by molecule modeling, it was determined that melamine was the core thermal stabilizer for the paper among the three amine compounds used in P2.",Sustained Delivery of Analgesic and Antimicrobial Agents to Knee Joint by Direct Injections of Electrosprayed Multipharmaceutical-Loaded Nano/Microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960815,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, we developed biodegradable lidocaine⁻/vancomycin⁻/ceftazidime⁻eluting poly(d,l⁻lactide⁻co⁻glycolide) (PLGA) nano/microparticulate carriers using an electrospraying process, and we evaluated the release behaviors of the carriers in knee joints. To prepare the particles, predetermined weight percentages of PLGA, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and lidocaine were dissolved in solvents. The PLGA/antibiotic/lidocaine solutions were then fed into a syringe for electrospraying. After electrospraying, the morphology of the sprayed nano/microparticles was elucidated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The in vitro antibiotic/analgesic release characteristics of the nano/microparticles were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, drug release to the synovial tissues and fluids was studied in vivo by injecting drug-loaded nano/microparticles into the knee joints of rabbits. The biodegradable electrosprayed nano/microparticles released high concentrations of vancomycin/ceftazidime (well above the minimum inhibition concentration) and lidocaine into the knee joints for more than 2 weeks and for over 3 days, respectively.

The resultant material demonstrated simultaneously enhanced latent heat and heat transfer. The unique EVM pore structure and CNTs surfaces contributed to the form stability of PCE-CPCMs. The adsorption capacity was 77.75⁻81.54 wt %. The latent heat of the PCE-CPCMs increased with increasing CNTs content due to the decreasing inhibition effect of EVM and the increasing adsorption capacity of PEG, which was 83.9 J/g during melting and 104.2 J/g during solidification for PCE7.09. The pore confinement and surface EVM interactions inhibited the heat storage capacity of the PCE-CPCMs. Moreover, the inhibition effect on the heat storage capacity of PCE-CPCMs during the melting process was stronger than during solidification due to the crystallization-promoting effect. The heat transfer of PCE-CPCMs was significantly enhanced by the CNTs filler (0.5148 W/(m·K) for PCE7.09) due to the decrease in interfacial thermal resistance and the formation of rapid thermally conductive pathways. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and thermal cycles test results confirmed that the PCE-CPCMs exhibited excellent chemical compatibility, thermal stability, and reliability.",Triblock Copolymer Toughening of a Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Epoxy Composite for Bonded Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960813,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Epoxy resins are the most widely used systems for structural composite applications; however, they lack fracture toughness, impact strength and peel strength due to high cross-linking densities. Use of conventional toughening agents to combat this can lead to reductions in mechanical, thermal and processability properties desirable for bonded composite applications. In this work, an asymmetric triblock copolymer of poly(styrene)⁻b⁻poly(butadiene)⁻b⁻poly(methylmethacrylate) was used to modify an epoxy resin system, with the materials processed using both vacuum bag and positive pressure curing techniques. Interlaminar fracture toughness testing showed improvements in initiation fracture toughness of up to 88%, accompanied by a 6 °C increase in glass transition temperature and manageable reductions in gel-time. Shear testing resulted in a 121% increase in ultimate shear strain with only an 8% reduction in shear strength. Performance improvements were attributed to nano-structuring within the toughened resin system, giving rise to matrix cavitation and dissipation of crack front strain energy upon loading.",The Chain Length Distribution of an Ideal Reversible Deactivation Radical Polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960812,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The chain length distribution (CLD) of a reversible deactivation radical polymerization at full conversion is shown to be a negative binomial distribution with parameters that are simple functions of the number-average degree of polymerization and either the chain transfer constant (in the case of polymerizations that incorporate a reversible chain transfer step) or the concentrations of dormant polymer chains and deactivating agent and the rate constants of propagation and deactivation (other types of RDRP). Expressions for the CLD at intermediate conversions are also derived, and shown to be consistent with known expressions for the number-average degree of polymerization and dispersity. It is further demonstrated that these CLDs are well-approximated by negative binomial distributions with appropriate choice of parameters. The negative binomial distribution is thus a useful model for CLDs of reversible deactivation radical polymerizations.",Enhancement of Heat Dissipation by Laser Micro Structuring for LED Module.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960811,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Optimization for heat dissipation plays a significant role in energy saving and high-efficiency utilizing of integrated electronics.

The heat dissipation performance was investigated by temperature evolution of a heat sink under natural convection by infrared (IR) camera, and results showed that the heat dissipation enhancement could be up to 25%. Moreover, the heat dissipation performance of a typical heat sink in terms of light-emitting diode (LED) hip was investigated via both thermal transient measurement and the finite element analysis (FEA). The maximum LED chip temperature of the laser-textured heat sink was approximately 22.4% lower than that of the as-received heat sink. We propose that these properties accompanied with the simplicity of fabrication make laser surface texturing a promising candidate for on-chip thermal management applications in electronics.","Single-Molecule Dynamics and Discrimination between Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Amino Acids in Peptides, through Controllable, Stepwise Translocation across Nanopores.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960810,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept of real-time discrimination between patches of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers in the primary structure of custom-engineered, macro-dipole-like peptides, at uni-molecular level.

The observed differences in the ionic currents blockades through the nanopore, visible at time resolutions corresponding to peptide threading through the α-HL's constriction region, was explained by a simple model of the volumes of electrolyte excluded by either amino acid species, as groups of serine or isoleucine monomers transiently occupy the α-HL. To provide insights into the conditions ensuring optimal throughput of peptide readout through the nanopore, we probed the sidedness-dependence of peptide association to and dissociation from the electrically and geometrically asymmetric α-HL.",Fast Switchable Dual-Model Grating by Using Polymer-Stabilized Sphere Phase Liquid Crystal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960809,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We demonstrated a fast switchable dual-model grating based on a polymer-stabilized sphere phase liquid crystal.

The respective ternary phase diagrams have been studied for systems containing MEA and the equivalent systems containing CO₂-loaded MEA. The presence of MEA loaded with CO₂ hinders self-association, preventing the formation of liquid crystalline phases. One-phase liquid crystalline regions were found at low MEA concentrations (below 20 wt %) in L92. In the case of L81, only one one-phase region consisting of coexisting lamellar and disordered aggregates was found at 5 wt % MEA. The swelling of the liquid crystalline phases with MEA was investigated along designated dilution lines.

Conventional processing techniques for manufacturing micro-helices are likely to be limited in cost and mass-productivity, while Spirulina, which shows natural fine micro-helical forms, can be easily mass-reproduced at an extremely low cost. Furthermore, considering the extensive utility of conducting polymers, it is intriguing to synthesize conducting polymer micro-helices. In this study, PPy (polypyrrole), PANI (polyaniline), and PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) micro-helices were fabricated using Spirulinaplatensis as a bio-template. The successful formations of the conducting polymer micro-helix were confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize the molecular structures of the conducting polymer in micro-helical forms. In the electrochemical characterization, the optimized specific capacitances for the PPy micro-helix, the PANI micro-helix, and the PEDOT micro-helix were found to be 234 F/g, 238 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s, and 106.4 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s, respectively. Therefore, it could be expected that other conducting polymer micro-helices with Spirulina as a bio-template could be also easily synthesized for various applications."

Interestingly, PLA modified with only 0.5% DAP passed UL-94 V-0 rating, and possessed a limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 24.6%, which would further increase with the increasing loading of DAP. PLA/DAP did not exhibit obviously improved results in terms of heat release rate (HRR), as the loading of DAP was relatively low. It was found that DAP showed little effect on the thermal stability of PLA and the onset decomposition temperatures of PLA and PLA/DAP blends were very close. Besides, the degree of crystallization increased because of the plasticized effect of DAP. Based on the analyses of flame-retardant mechanism of DAP, it disclosed that DAP decomposed to generate incombustible compounds, such as water and ammonia, to dilute the concentration of oxygen and fuels, and then release some phosphorus-containing fragments that could produce phosphorus-containing free radicals to interrupt free-radical reactions, and finally noncombustible melt dripping was produced so as to bring away large amount of heat and stop the feedback of heat to the matrix.",Sulfur/Organic Copolymers as Curing Agents for Rubber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960795,Polymers,2019 04 11,"It is widely acknowledged that waste sulfur generated from the petroleum industry creates huge storage and ecological problems. Therefore, the various methods of utilization are becoming increasingly attractive research topics worldwide. The thermal ability of elemental sulfur to homolytic cleavage of S₈ rings enables its free radical copolymerization with unsaturated organic species and the obtaining of chemically stable polymeric materials. Here we report a novel possibility to use sulfur/organic copolymers obtained via ""inverse vulcanization"" as curatives for rubber. For this purpose, several various sulfur/organic copolymers were synthesized and analyzed from the point of view of their performance as rubber crosslinking agents. Solvent extraction was used to purify sulfur/organic copolymers from unreacted (elemental) sulfur. Thermal properties of the prepared copolymers were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA⁻DSC). Crosslink density and structure of cured elastomers was studied by equilibrium swelling, thiol-amine analysis and freezing point depression. Mechanical properties of the vulcanizates were determined under static and dynamic conditions (DMA-dynamic mechanical analysis). It is proved that the utilization of sulfur/organic copolymers as curatives enables an effective crosslinking process of rubbers. Taking into account the results of a crosslink density analysis and mechanical properties of the vulcanizates cured with purified copolymers, it is evident that relatively long copolymer macromolecules are also involved in the formation of chemical bonds between unsaturated rubber macromolecules.",Development and Characterization of Polyamide-Supported Chitosan Nanocomposite Membranes for Hydrophilic Pervaporation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960793,Polymers,2019 04 11,"An experimental protocol of preparation of homogeneous and nanocomposite chitosan (Ch) based membranes supported on polyamide-6 (PA6) films was developed and described in detail. Montmorillonite (MMT) and Cloisite 30B (C30B) nanoclays were used as nanofillers to improve mechanical properties of chitosan films. The surface, mechanical, and transport properties of PA6 supported Ch, Ch/MMT and Ch/C30B membranes were studied and compared with a pristine, non-supported chitosan membrane. Implementation of advanced analytical techniques e.g., SEM reveal the clays nanoparticles are well dispersed in the chitosan matrix. According to AFM images, composite chitosan/nanoclay membranes possess higher roughness compared with unfilled ones. On the other hand, an incorporation of clay particles insignificantly changed the mechanical and thermal properties of the membranes. It was also found that all membranes are hydrophilic and water is preferentially removed from EtOH/H₂O and iPrOH/H₂O mixtures by pervaporation. Supporting of chitosan and chitosan/nanoclay thin films onto PA6 porous substrate enhanced permeate flux and pervaporation separation index, in comparison to the pristine Ch membrane. Concerning separation factor (β), the highest value equal to 4500 has been found for a chitosan composite membrane containing Cloisite 30B contacting 85/15 wt % iPrOH/H₂O mixture. The mentioned membrane was characterized by the normalized flux of 0.5 μm·kg·m-2·h-1. Based on the established data, it was possible to conclude that chitosan membranes are meaningful material in dehydration of azeotropic mixtures. Nevertheless, to boost up the membrane efficiency, the further modification process is required.",Enhanced Electrorheological Response of Cellulose: A Double Effect of Modification by Urea-Terminated Silane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960792,Polymers,2019 04 11,"As a natural polymer with abundant sources, cellulose was one of the earliest applied electrorheological (ER) materials. However, cellulose-based ER materials have not attracted much attention because of their relatively low ER effect and sensitivity to water. In this study, cellulose rods were decorated with a urea-terminated silane, 1-(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl) urea, after being swelled in sodium hydroxide solution. The morphologies and structures of the cellulose particles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, confirming the dramatic differences of the treated cellulose particles from the pristine cellulose. Rheological behaviors of the pristine and modified cellulose particles in silicone oil were observed using a rotational rheometer. It was found that the silane-modified cellulose showed higher ER effect and higher dielectric properties than the pristine cellulose particles, which was not only related to the grafted polar molecules but may also be associated with the porous morphologies of the treated cellulose particles.","Novel Random Copolymers of Poly(butylene 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylate) with Outstanding Barrier Properties for Green and Sustainable Packaging: Content and Length of Aliphatic Side Chains as Efficient Tools to Tailor the Material's Final Performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960791,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The present paper describes the synthesis of novel bio-based poly(butylene 1,4-cyclohexane dicarboxylate)-containing random copolymers for sustainable and flexible packaging applications. On one side, the linear butylene moiety has been substituted by glycol subunits with alkyl pendant groups of different length. On the other side, copolymers with different cis/trans isomer ratio of cyclohexane rings have been synthesized. The prepared samples were subjected to molecular, thermal, diffractometric, and mechanical characterization. The barrier performances to O₂, CO₂, and N₂ gases were also evaluated. The presence of side alkyl groups did not alter the thermal stability, whereas it significantly influences the formation of ordered phases that deeply affect the functional properties, mainly in terms of mechanical response and barrier performance. In particular, the final materials present higher flexibility and significantly improved barrier properties with respect to the homopolymer and most polymers widely employed for flexible packaging. The improvement due to copolymerization was more pronounced in the case of higher co-unit-containing copolymers and for the samples with cyclohexane rings in the trans conformation.","PDDA-Montmorillonite Composites Loaded with Ru Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Properties in Hydrogenation of 2-Butanone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960790,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effect of synthesis parameters on the physicochemical properties of clay/ polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA)/Ru composites and their applicability in hydrogenation of 2-butanone under very mild conditions (room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and aqueous solution) was studied. Three synthetic procedures were employed, differing in the order of addition of components and the stage at which metallic Ru species were generated. The materials were characterized with XRD (X-ray diffraction), XRF (X-ray fluorescence), EDS (energy-dispersive spectroscopy), AFM (atomic force microscopy), TEM/HRTEM (transmission electron microscopy/high resolution transmission electron microscopy), and TG/DSC (thermal gravimetry/differential scanning microscopy techniques. The study revealed that the method of composite preparation affects its structural and thermal properties, and controls the distribution and size of Ru particles. All catalysts are active in hydrogenation of 2-butanone. For best catalytic performance (100% conversion within 30 min) both the size of Ru particles and the load of polymer had to be optimized. Superior catalytic properties were obtained over the composite with intermediate crystal size and intermediate PDDA load, prepared by generation of metallic Ru species in the polymer solution prior to intercalation. This method offers an easy way of controlling the crystal size by modification of Ru/PDDA ratio.",Antimicrobial LDPE/EVOH Layered Films Containing Carvacrol Fabricated by Multiplication Extrusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960789,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This work describes the fabrication of antimicrobial multilayered polymeric films containing carvacrol (used as a model essential oil) by co-extrusion and multiplication technique. The microlayering process was utilized to produce films, with up to 65 alternating layers, of carvacrol-containing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH). Carvacrol was melt compounded with LDPE or loaded into halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) in a pre-compounding step prior film production. The detailed nanostructure and composition (in terms of carvacrol content) of the films were characterized and correlated to their barrier properties, carvacrol release rate, and antibacterial and antifungal activity. The resulting films exhibit high carvacrol content despite the harsh processing conditions (temperature of 200 °C and long processing time), regardless of the number of layers or the presence of HNTs. The multilayered films exhibit superior oxygen transmission rates and carvacrol diffusivity values that are more than two orders of magnitude lower in comparison to single-layered carvacrol-containing films (i.e., LDPE/carvacrol and LDPE/(HNTs/carvacrol)) produced by conventional cast extrusion. The (LDPE/carvacrol)/EVOH and (LDPE/[HNTs/carvacrol])/EVOH films demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy against E. coli and Alternaria alternata in in vitro micro-atmosphere assays and against A. alternata and Rhizopus in cherry tomatoes, used as the food model. The results presented here suggest that sensitive essential oils, such as carvacrol, can be incorporated into plastic polymers constructed of tailored multiple layers, without losing their antimicrobial efficacy.",Assignment of Regioirregular Sequences in the 13C NMR Spectrum of Syndiotactic Polypropylene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960788,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The 13C NMR microstructure of a polypropylene (PP) sample is a fundamental source of information on its properties, and also a 'fingerprint' of the catalytic species used to produce it. Likely due to a much greater technological importance, isotactic polymers (i-PP) have been more thoroughly investigated that syndiotactic ones (s-PP). In this paper, we report the first full assignment of regioirregular sequences in s-PP samples made with two well-known molecular catalysts, namely a Cs-symmetric (cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) ansa-zirconocene and a fluxional bis(phenoxyimine)Ti species. The results shed more light on the mechanism of chain propagation at the two catalysts, and open the door to the investigation of more elusive cases like the formation of s-PP blocks in the presence of multi-sited heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta systems.",Preparation of CuONPs@PVDF/Non-Woven Polyester Composite Membrane: Structural Influence of Nanoparticle Addition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960787,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Membrane distillation techniques have appeared as promising options for guaranteeing the availability of potable water in times of scarcity of this essential resource. For membrane preparation, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is preferred due to the easier synthesis procedures, with respect to other fluorine-based polymers. In this work, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) of different weight percent (wt %) embedded in PVDF membranes supported on non-woven polyester fabric (NWPET) were prepared by the phase inversion method, and characterized by spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Raman) and electron microscopy techniques (SEM). The PVDF deposited onto the NWPET was mostly composed of its polar β-phase (F(β) = 53%), which was determined from the ATR-FTIR spectrum. The F(β) value remained constant throughout the whole range of added CuONP concentrations (2⁻10 wt %), as was determined from the ATR-FTIR spectrum. The absence of signals corresponding to CuONPs in the ATR-FTIR spectra and the appearance of peaks at 297, 360, and 630 cm-1 in the Raman spectra of the membranes suggest that the CuONPs are preferably located in the inner PVDF membrane, but not on its surface. The membrane morphologies were characterized by SEM. From the obtained SEM micrographs, a decrease and increase in the amount of micropores and nanopores, respectively, near the surface and intercalated in the finger-like layer were observed. As a result of the CuONP addition, the nanopores in the sponge-like layer decreased in size. The values of water contact angle (WCA) measurements showed a decreasing trend, from 94° to 80°, upon the addition of CuONPs (2⁻10 wt %), indicating a diminishment in the hydrophobicity degree of the membranes. Apparently, the increase in the amount of nanopores near the surface decreased the membrane roughness, so it became less hydrophobic.",Design and Electromagnetic Properties of a Conformal Ultra Wideband Antenna Integrated in Three-Dimensional Woven Fabrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960786,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Wearable antennas play an important role in transmitting signals wirelessly in body-worn systems, helping body-worn applications to achieve real-time monitoring and improving the working efficiency as well as the life quality of the users. Over conventional antenna types, ultra wideband (UWB) antennas have advantages of very large operating bandwidth, low power consumption, and high data transmission speed, therefore, they become of great interest for body-worn applications. One of the strategies for making the antenna comfortable to wear is replacing the conventional rigid printed circuit board with textile materials in the manufacturing process. In this study, a novel three-dimensional woven fabric integrated UWB antenna was proposed and fabricated with pure textile materials. The antenna electromagnetic properties were simulated and measured and its properties under bending were investigated. The antenna operated in a wide bandwidth from 2.7 to 13 GHz with the proper radiation pattern and gain value. At the same time, the antenna performance under bending varied in a reasonable range indicating that the antenna is prospectively applied on the curved surfaces of the human body. Additionally, the current distribution of the antenna showed that different conductive parts had different current densities indicating the uniqueness of the three-dimensional textile-based antenna."

The structural properties and in vitro immunity activities of cell wall polysaccharides extracted successively by hot water and sodium hydroxide solution were studied, and the results indicated that the yield and content of polysaccharides increased during the reproductive growth stage and decreased with the maturity of the fruiting body. Water-soluble cell wall polysaccharides mainly composed of glucose and galactose at a molar ratio of 3.4⁻14:1.0, and also contained a small ratio of glucuronic acid. The alkali-soluble cell wall polysaccharides were glucans with lower molecular weight and higher macrophage activation activity in vitro than water-soluble ones.

The critical association concentration (CAC) of DiPHAM was determined by viscosity changes to be 490 mg/L with different DiPHAM concentrations and particle sizes varied under such dynamic conditions. The influences of aqueous metal ions with different charges on its aqueous solution were investigated by measuring apparent viscosity, viscoelasticity, thixotropy, rheology, and particle size, and by SEM observation. The apparent viscosity of the DiPHAM solution was affected by metal ions to some extent, but the viscosity of the polymer can be still maintained at 55 mPa·s under 20 × 10⁴ mg/L NaCl. Divalent metal ions show greater impact on DiPHAM aqueous solutions, but the polymer solutions showed resistance to the changes caused in viscosity, structure, and viscoelasticity by Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The salt tolerance of DiPHAM is due to the combination of hydrophobic association, the electrostatic shield, and double layer compression of the hydration shell. Increasing the ion concentration enhances the dehydration and further compresses the hydration shell, making the non-structural viscosity decrease, even ""salting out"". Measurements of rheological properties showed that DiPHAM solutions could maintain a relatively high viscosity (0.6%-71 mPa·s/0.3%-50 mPa·s) after 120 min of continuous shearing (170 s-1) at 140 °C. Under high-salinity (5000 mg/L Ca2+/3000 mg/L Mg2+) conditions, the solution with 0.6 wt% DiPHAM still maintained a high viscosity (50 mPa·s/70 mPa·s) after continuously shearing for 120 min at 120 °C and 170 s-1. The good salt tolerance of DiPHAM can lead to a variety of applications, including in fracturing fluids for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and in sewage treatment.","Strategies to Control Performance of 3D-Printed, Cable-Driven Soft Polymer Actuators: From Simple Architectures to Gripper Prototype.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960772,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The following is a study of the performance of soft cable-driven polymer actuators produced by multimaterial 3D printing. We demonstrate that the mechanical response of the polymer actuator with an embedded cable can be flexibly tuned through the targeted selection of actuator architecture. Various strategies, such as the addition of discrete or periodic stiff inserts, the sectioning of the actuator, or the shifting of the cable channel are employed to demonstrate ways to achieve more controllable deformed shape during weight lifting or reduce the required actuation force. To illustrate these concepts, we design and manufacture a prototype of the soft polymer gripper, which is capable of manipulating small, delicate objects. The explored strategies can be utilized in other types of soft actuators, employing, for instance, actuation by means of electroactive polymers.",A Study of the Pressure-Induced Solidification of Polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960771,Polymers,2019 04 11,"By using a self-designed pressure-jump apparatus, we investigated the melt solidification behavior in the rapid compression process for poly-ethylene-terephthalate (PET), polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), isotactic polypropylene (iPP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and the living polymer sulfur. The experimental results clearly show that crystallization could be inhibited, and some melts were solidified to the full amorphous state for PET, PEEK, and sulfur. Full amorphous PEEK that was 24 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height was prepared, which exceeded the size obtained by the melt quenching method. The bulk amorphous sulfur thus obtained exhibited extraordinarily high thermal stability, and an abnormal exothermic transition to liquid sulfur was observed at around 396 K. Since the solidification of melt is realized by changing pressure instead of temperature and is not essentially limited by thermal conductivity, it is a promising way to prepare fully amorphous polymers. In addition, novel properties are also expected in these polymers solidified by the pressure-jump within milliseconds.",Coupled Hygro-Mechanical Finite Element Method on Determination of the Interlaminar Shear Modulus of Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Laminates in Bridge Decks under Hygrothermal Aging Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960770,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To investigate the mechanical degradation of the shear properties of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates in bridge decks under hygrothermal aging effects, short-beam shear tests were performed following the ASTM test standard (ASTM D790-10A). Based on the coupled hygro-mechanical finite element (FE) analysis method, an inverse parameter identification approach based on short-beam shear tests was developed and then employed to determine the environment-dependent interlaminar shear modulus of GFRP laminates. Subsequently, the shear strength and modulus of dry (0% Mt/M∞), moisture unsaturated (30% Mt/M∞ and 50% Mt/M∞), and moisture saturated (100% Mt/M∞) specimens at test temperatures of both 20 °C and 40 °C were compared. One cycle of the moisture absorption⁻desorption process was also investigated to address how the moisture-induced residual damage degrades the shear properties of GFRP laminates. The results revealed that the shear strength and modulus of moisture-saturated GFRP laminates decreased significantly, and the elevated testing temperature (40 °C) aggravated moisture-induced mechanical degradation. Moreover, an unrecoverable loss of shear properties for the GFRP laminates enduring one cycle of the moisture absorption⁻desorption process was evident.",Identity of Low-Molecular-Weight Species Formed in End-To-End Cyclization Reactions Performed in THF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960769,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Cyclic polymers were produced by end-to-end coupling of telechelic linear polymers under dilute conditions in THF, using intramolecular atom transfer radical coupling or click chemistry. In addition to the expected shift to longer elution times on gel permeation chromatography (GPC) indicative of the formation of cyclic product, lower molecular weight species were consistently observed upon analysis of the unpurified cyclization reaction mixture. By systematically removing or altering single reaction components in the highly dilute cyclization reaction, it was found that THF itself was responsible for the low-molecular-weight material, forming oligomeric chains of poly(THF) regardless of the other reaction components. When the reactions were performed at higher concentrations and for shorter time intervals, conducive to intermolecular chain-end-joining reactions, the low-molecular-weight peaks were absent. Isolation of the material and analysis by ¹H NMR confirmed that poly(THF) was being formed in the highly dilute conditions required for cyclization by end-to-end coupling. When a series of mock cyclization reactions were performed with molar ratios of the reactants held constant, but concentrations changed, it was found that lower concentrations of reactants led to higher amounts of poly(THF) side product.",Use of Whey Protein as a Natural Polymer for Tissue Adhesive: Preliminary Formulation and Evaluation In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960768,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The use of sutures is still the most widely practiced solution for wound closure and tissue reconstruction; however, scarring is a common defect resulting from sutures on topical use. In some cases, the conventional sutures are unable to seal the sites where fluid and air leakage could occur. Tissue adhesives though have lower tensile strength than sutures, may make scarless surgery possible, or prevent fluid and air leakage. A product called BioGlue® (CryoLife Inc, Kennesaw, GA, USA), based on bovine serum albumin (BSA, a protein) and glutaraldehyde (GTA, crosslinker), has been approved for clinical use in the USA. Whey protein, a byproduct of cheese-making, comprised mainly of β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and BSA. Even though the molecular weight of BSA is about three times larger than the molecular of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin, all three proteins are rich in free ε-amino groups (can react with GTA) and globular proteins. This similarity make whey protein a potential candidate to replace BSA in the tissue adhesive since whey protein is abundant and much cheaper than BSA. In this study, whey protein isolate (WPI) was used as a protein polymer with GTA as a crosslinker to evaluate the feasibility of whey protein for tissue adhesive formulation. Results showed that the WPI/GTA adhesive exhibited a comparable adhesive strength to BioGlue® control.",Effects of Jet Path on Electrospun Polystyrene Fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960767,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study we investigated the effects of jet path on the morphology and mat size of synthetic polystyrene (PS) fibers during the electrospinning process. In addition, the mechanism of the fiber mats, which were prepared by varying the solution concentration, was evaluated. The straight jet length, envelope cone and whipping frequency of each electrospun jet were studied using images captured by a high-speed photography camera. The results showed that higher solution concentrations led to longer straight jet lengths, smaller envelope cones and lower whipping frequencies. The diameter and surface morphology of the PS fibers were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that fibers spun with higher solution concentrations exhibited larger diameters and diameter distributions because of their jet path features. Furthermore, the electrospun jets with higher concentrations increased elongation and produced smaller fiber mats and higher breaking forces as a result of their different jet paths, which was a consequence of varying the solution concentration.",Preparation of Lignosulfonates from Biorefinery Lignins by Sulfomethylation and Their Application as a Water Reducer for Concrete.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960766,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Lignosulfonate (LG), a water-soluble polymer from sulfite pulping process of lignocellulosic biomass, has been commercially applied as admixture for concrete. In this work, lignosulfonates were produced from alkaline lignin (AL) and enzymatic hydrolysis residue (EHR) by sulfomethylation and these lignosulfonates as water reducers for concrete were then evaluated. Results showed that 94.9% and 68.9% of lignins in AL and EHR could be sulfonated under optimum sulfomethylation conditions, respectively. The sulfonic groups in lignosulfonates from AL (AL-LG) and EHR (EHR-LG) were 1.6 mmol/g and 1.0 mmol/g, respectively. Surface tension and zeta potential analysis indicated that both AL-LG and EHR-LG can be potentially used to as dispersant for improving the fluidity of the cement paste, similarly to commercial lignosulfonate (CM-LG). Adding 0.2 wt % of AL-LG, EHR-LG, and CM-LG in the concrete, the compressive strength (28 days) of concretes increased from 38.4 Mpa to 41.6, 42.6, and 40.9 Mpa, respectively.

The solubility of lignin in the four solvents was determined at 25 °C. The influence of the molar ratio of H₂O to [Ch][Na] ([Ch][Fa], [Ch][Va] and [Ch][Sa]) and the anionic structure on lignin solubility were systematically investigated. It was found that, the anionic structure and H₂O content significantly affected lignin dissolution. Interestingly, H₂O/[Ch][Na] and H₂O/[Ch][Fa] solvents show efficient capacity for lignin dissolution even at room temperatures. The dissolution of lignin in H₂O/[Ch][Na] and H₂O/[Ch][Fa] solvents is mainly ascribed to the interaction of lignin with the alkyl chain in the anion and cation dissociated from [Ch][Na]([Ch][Fa]) by H₂O. In addition, the recycling of the lignin solvent was examined, and the structure and thermostability of the lignin regenerated from the solvent were also estimated."

A commercial PA containing 30 wt % glass fibers and a standard stabilization package (PA-0) was used as the reference material. For the other formulation, the reference material PA-0 was compounded with two additional stabilizers (PA-S1). Keeping the specimen geometry and initial loading conditions the same, the total number of cycles to ultimate specimen failure was found to be reduced with an increase in chlorine content for both materials. As to the effect of the chlorine content on crack growth kinetics, the most pronounced effect in enhancing the crack growth rates or decreasing the FCG resistance was determined between 0 ppm and 1 ppm chlorine content. When comparing the relative change of FCG resistance in chlorinated water (10 ppm) to the FCG resistance in non-chlorinated water (0 ppm), the additional stabilization in the material PA-S1 appears beneficial over the stabilization in the reference material PA-0.",Branched Polyurethanes Based on Synthetic Polyhydroxybutyrate with Tunable Structure and Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960751,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Branched, aliphatic polyurethanes (PURs) were synthesized and compared to linear analogues. The influence of polycaprolactonetriol and synthetic poly([R,S]-3-hydroxybutyrate) (R,S-PHB) in soft segments on structure, thermal and sorptive properties of PURs was determined. Using FTIR and Raman spectroscopies it was found that increasing the R,S-PHB amount in the structure of branched PURs reduced a tendency of urethane groups to hydrogen bonding. Melting enthalpies (on DSC thermograms) of both soft and hard segments of linear PURs were higher than branched PURs, suggesting that linear PURs were more crystalline. Oil sorption by samples of linear and branched PURs, containing only polycaprolactone chains in soft segments, was higher than in the case of samples with R,S-PHB in their structure. Branched PUR without R,S-PHB absorbed the highest amount of oil. Introducing R,S-PHB into the PUR structure increased water sorption. Thus, by operating the number of branching and the amount of poly([R,S]-3-hydroxybutyrate) in soft segments thermal and sorptive properties of aliphatic PURs could be controlled.",Isophorone Diisocyanate (IPDI) Microencapsulation for Mono-Component Adhesives: Effect of the Active H and NCO Sources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960750,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyurea/polyurethane (PUa/PU) shell microcapsules (MCs), containing high loadings of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in the core, were developed to enable the production of mono-component, eco-friendly and safer adhesive formulations for the footwear industry. IPDI microencapsulation was obtained via oil⁻in⁻water (O/W) microemulsion combined with interfacial polymerization. A methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) compound (a commercial blend of monomeric and polymeric species), with higher reactivity than IPDI and low viscosity, was added to the O phase to competitively contribute to the shell formation, improving its quality. Four different active H sources were tested, aimed at achieving a high encapsulation yield. The successful encapsulation of IPDI was confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), while the MCs' morphology and size distribution were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The incorporation of a multifunctional isocyanate silane in the O phase, as ""latent"" active H source, led to the formation of impermeable PUa/PU-silica hybrid shell MCs with more than 60 wt.% of pure encapsulated IPDI. A proof-of-concept study shows high peeling strength and a structural type of failure of the adhesive joint, revealing an effective IPDI release. These new engineered MCs are found to be promising crosslinkers for mono-component adhesives for high demanding applications.","Influence of Two Polymer-Based Superplasticizers (Poly-naphthalene Sulfonate, PNS, and Lignosulfonate, LS) on Compressive and Flexural Strength, Freeze-Thaw, and Sulphate Attack Resistance of Lime-Metakaolin Grouts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960749,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A new range of grouts prepared by air lime and metakaolin (MK) as a pozzolanic admixture has been obtained by using as dispersing agents two polymers, namely poly-naphthalene sulfonate (PNS) and lignosulfonate (LS), with the aim of improving the fluidity of the fresh grouts. Fluidity and setting times of the grouts were assessed. Differences in the molecular architecture and in the anionic charge density explained the different adsorption of the polymers and the different performance. The higher anionic charge of PNS and its linear shape explained its better adsorption and effectiveness. The pozzolanic reaction was favoured in grouts with PNS, achieving the highest values of compressive strength (4.8 MPa after 182 curing days). The addition of PNS on lime grouts slightly decreased the frost resistance of the grouts (from 24 freeze-thaw cycles for the polymer-free samples to 19 or 20 cycles with 0.5 or 1 wt % of PNS). After the magnesium sulphate attack, grouts were altered by decalcification of hydrated phases and by formation of hexahydrite and gypsum. A protective role of portlandite against magnesium sulphate attack was clearly identified. Accordingly, the polymer LS, which preserves a significant amount of Ca(OH)₂, could be an alternative for the obtaining of grouts requiring high sulphate attack resistance.",Vortical Fountain Flows in Plasticating Screws.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960748,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Variances in polymers processed by single-screw extrusion are investigated. While vortical flows are well known in the fluids community and fountain flows are well known to be caused by the frozen layers in injection molding, our empirical evidence and process modeling suggests the presence of vortical fountain flows in the melt channels of plasticating screws adjacent to a slower-moving solids bed. The empirical evidence includes screw freezing experiments with cross-sections of processed high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) blended with varying colorants. Non-isothermal, non-Newtonian process simulations indicate that the underlying causality is increased flow conductance in the melt pool caused by higher temperatures and shear rates in the recirculating melt pool. The results indicate the development of persistent, coiled sheet morphologies in both general purpose and barrier screw designs. The behavior differs significantly from prior melting and plastication models with the net effect of broader residence time distributions. The process models guide potential strategies for the remediation of the processing variances as well as potential opportunities to achieve improved dispersion as well as complex micro and nanostructures in polymer processing.",Rubber-Filler Interactions in Polyisoprene Filled with In Situ Generated Silica: A Solid State NMR Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960747,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this paper we used high- and low-resolution solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques to investigate a series of polyisoprene samples filled with silica generated in situ from tetraethoxysilane by sol-gel process. In particular, ¹H spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times allowed us to get insights into the dynamic properties of both the polymer bulk and the bound rubber, and to obtain a comparative estimate of the amount of bound rubber in samples prepared with different compositions and sol-gel reaction times. In all samples, three fractions with different mobility could be distinguished by ¹H T₂ and ascribed to loosely bound rubber, polymer bulk, and free chain ends. The amount of bound rubber was found to be dependent on sample preparation, and it resulted maximum in the sample showing the best dispersion of silica domains in the rubber matrix. The interpretation of the loosely bound rubber in terms of ""glassy"" behaviour was discussed, also on the basis of ¹H T₁ and T1ρ data.","Functional Poly(dihalopentadiene)s: Stereoselective Synthesis, Aggregation-Enhanced Emission and Sensitive Detection of Explosives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960746,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The development of polymeric materials with novel structures and unique properties and functionalities is of both academic and industrial significance.

The reaction conditions and the boron trihalide used were found to have great effects on the stereochemistry of the resulting polymer structures. The obtained poly(1,5-dihalo-(Z,Z)-1,4-pentadiene)s possess high thermal stability and good film-forming ability. Their thin films show high refractive index of 1.9007⁻1.6462 in a wide wavelength region of 380⁻890 nm with low optical dispersion. The polymers are weakly emissive in dilute solutions but become highly emissive upon aggregated, demonstrating a unique phenomenon of aggregation-enhanced emission.

By virtue of the facile layer-by-layer self-assembly technique, poly(l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine) (l-PDOPA) was successfully coated on the surface of AFs, leading to the formation of AFs with controllable layers (nL-AF). Then, a hydroxyl functionalized silane coupling agent (KH550) was grafted on the surface of l-PDOPA coated AFs. The properties such as microstructure and surface morphology of AFs before and after modification were characterized by FTIR, XPS and FE-SEM. The results confirmed that l-PDOPA and KH550 were successfully introduced into the surface of AFs by electrostatic adsorption.

The results showed that in SBA-15-SH, the direct synthesis method made the absorption peak intensity weaker than that of SBA-15, while the post-grafted peak intensity did not change. Their spectra were different due to the C-H stretching bands of Si-O-Si and propyl groups. But their structure was still evenly distributed and was still hexangular mesoporous structure. Their pore size increased, and the H-SBA-15-SH had larger pore size.

The structure and size of AgNPs in such an IPN hydrogel were characterized by the Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), and the thermal properties of the IPN hydrogel were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Based on XRD patterns, Ag⁺ was successfully reduced to Ag⁰ by SS. It was observed by TEM that the particle size of silver particles was lower than 100 nm. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of IPN hydrogel was better than that of the PNIPAAm/AgNPs hydrogels, and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) values of the IPN hydrogel were obtained by DSC i.e. 31 °C. The thermal stability of the IPN hydrogel was successfully determined by the TGA.

The structures and properties of IPN hydrogel modified cotton fabric were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR, and the thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The results show that NIPAAm was successfully polymerized into PNIPAAm, and that there were neglected new groups in the hydrogel IPN. The IPN hydrogel was then successfully grafted onto cotton fabrics. SEM observations showed that the IPN hydrogel formed a membrane structure between the fibers, and improved the compactness of the fibers. At the temperature close to LCST (≈31 °C), the entire system was easily able to absorb water molecules. However, the hydrophilicity tended to decrease when the temperature was higher or lower than the LCST. The antibacterial rates of the modified cotton fabric against S. aureus and E. coli were as high as 99%."

However, the applicability of most of the traditional approaches intended for generating these biomimetic scaffolds is limited due to poor resolution and strict requirements in choosing materials. In this work, we fabricated 3D porous scaffolds based on the composite inks of gelatin (Gel), nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) using an innovative hybrid strategy based on 3D printing and freeze-drying technologies for bone tissue engineering. Initially, the PLGA scaffolds were printed using the 3D printing method, and they were then coated with the Gel/n-HA complex, yielding the Gel/n-HA/PLGA scaffolds. These Gel/n-HA/PLGA scaffolds with exceptional biodegradation, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility have enabled osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) for their convenient adhesion as a layer and have efficiently promoted their growth, as well as differentiation. We further demonstrated the bone growth by measuring the particular biomarkers that act as key players in the ossification process (i.e., alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), and collagen type-I (COL-I)) and the total proteins of the MC3T3-E1 cells. We anticipate that the convenient generation of highly porous 3D scaffolds based on Gel/n-HA/PLGA fabricated through an innovative combinatorial approach of 3D printing technology and freeze-drying methods may undoubtedly find widespread applications in regenerative medicine.",Coupling of Defect Modes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Separated by Isotropic Polymeric Layers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960730,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Cholesteric liquid crystal structures with multiple isotropic defect layers exhibit localized optical modes (defect modes).

Bony defects with a diameter of 4 mm were prepared in rabbit tibias. Fe₃O₄/PLLA nanofibers were grafted into the drilled defects and histological examination and computed tomography (CT) image detection were performed after an eight-week healing period. The histological results showed that the artificial bony defects grafted with Fe₃O₄/PLLA nanofibers exhibited a visibly higher bone healing activity than those grafted with neat PLLA. In addition, the quantitative results from CT images revealed that the bony defects grafted with 2% and 5% Fe₃O₄/PLLA nanofibers, respectively, showed 1.9- and 2.3-fold increases in bone volume compared to the control blank sample.

In the present study, non-targeted analysis using mass spectrometry coupled to gas chromatography (GC-MS) for the identification of migrants in plastic and paper-based candy wrappers was performed. Samples were analyzed after extraction with acetonitrile. Numerous compounds including N-alkanes, phthalates, acetyl tributyl citrate, tributyl aconitate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, butylated hydroxytoluene, etc. were identified. Many of the compounds detected in plastic samples are not included in the positive list of the authorized substances.

In this paper, the molecular models of pure Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A resin/Methyltetrahydrophthalic Anhydride (DGEBA/MTHPA) and their nanocomposites containing nano-SiO₂ with different particle sizes were constructed. The effects of nano-SiO₂ dopants and the crosslinked structure on the micro-structure and thermomechanical properties were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the increase of crosslinking density enhances the thermal and mechanical properties of pure EP and EP nanocomposites. In addition, doping nano-SiO₂ particles into EP can effectively improve the properties, as well, and the effectiveness is closely related to the particle size of nano-SiO₂. Moreover, the results indicate that the glass transition temperature (Tg) value increases with the decreasing particle size. Compared with pure EP, the Tg value of the 6.5 Å composite model increases by 6.68%. On the contrary, the variation of the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) in the glassy state demonstrates the opposite trend compared with Tg. The CTE of the 10 Å composite model is the lowest, which is 7.70% less than that of pure EP. The mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with the decreasing particle size. Both the Young's modulus and shear modulus reach the maximum value at 7.6 Å, with noticeable increases by 12.60% and 8.72%, respectively compared to the pure EP. In addition, the thermal and mechanical properties are closely related to the Fraction of Free Volume (FFV) and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). The crosslinking process and the nano-SiO₂ doping reduce the FFV and MSD value in the model, resulting in better thermal and mechanical properties.",Influence of SiO₂/TiO₂ Nanocomposite on the Optoelectronic Properties of PFO/MEH-PPV-Based OLED Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960725,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The influence of SiO₂/TiO₂ nanocomposites on the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on poly(9,9'-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) and various amounts of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene) (MEH-PPV) was investigated. Prior to the fabrication of the OLEDs on indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the hybrids of PFO/MEH-PPV, in the presence and absence of the SiO₂/TiO₂ nanocomposites, were prepared via the solution blending technique. Improvement of the performances of the devices in the presence of the SiO₂/TiO₂ nanocomposites was detected. The existence of the SiO₂/TiO₂ nanocomposites led to better charge carrier injection and, thus, a significant reduction in the turn-on voltage of the devices. The enhancement of MEH-PPV electroluminescence peaks in the hybrids in the presence of SiO₂/TiO₂ nanocomposites is not only a result of the Förster resonance energy transfer, but also of hole-electron recombination, which is of greater significance.

Several characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that recycled nanoplatelet graphite with lateral size of tens of micrometers can be reliably produced. Experimentally, the thermal conductivity was measured for EGNs, BMEGNs and recycled 2B fillers with/without the effect of ball milling. The in-plane thermal conductivities of 12.97 W/mK (EGN), 13.53 W/mK (recycled 2B) and 14.56 W/mK (BMEGN) and through-plane thermal conductivities of 0.76 W/mK (EGN), 0.84 W/mK (recycled 2B) and 0.95 W/mK (BMEGN) were experimentally measured. Anisotropies were calculated as 15.31, 15.98 and 16.95 for EGN, recycled 2B and BMEGN, respectively. In addition, the mechanical robustness of the developed TIMs is such that they are capable of repeatedly bending at 180 degrees with outstanding flexibility, including the low-cost renewable material of recycled lead-graphite pencils. For heat dissipating application in high-power electronics, the TIMs of recycled 2B are capable of effectively reducing temperatures to approximately 6.2 °C as favorably compared with thermal grease alone.",Immobilizing Laccase on Modified Cellulose/CF Beads to Degrade Chlorinated Biphenyl in Wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960723,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Novel modified cellulose/cellulose fibril (CF) beads (MCCBs) loaded with laccase were prepared to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in wastewater.

Cellulose/CF composite beads were modified by maleic anhydride to introduce carboxyl groups. Laccase was immobilized on the MCCBs through electrostatic adsorption and covalent bonding. The effects of pH, laccase concentration and contact time on immobilization yields and recovered activity were investigated. The best conditions were pH 4, concentration 16 g/L and contact time 3 h. The immobilized laccase under these conditions showed a good performance in thermal and operational stability. The laccase immobilized on MCCB beads can remove 85% of 20 mg/L 4-hydroxy-3,5-dichlorobiphenyl (HO-DiCB) in wastewater. The results demonstrated that MCCBs, as a new type of green-based support, are very promising in material immobilizing laccase. This technology may be of potential advantage for the removal of polychlorinated biphenyls in wastewater from an environmental point of view.",Fabrication of Porous Polyvinylidene Fluoride/Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube Nanocomposites and Their Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960722,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this paper, a solvent vapor-induced phase separation (SVIPS) technique was used to create a porous structure in polyvinylidene fluoride/Multi-walled carbon nanotube (PVDF/MWNTs) composites with the aim of increasing the electrical conductivity through the incorporation of MWNTs while retaining a low thermal conductivity. By using the dimethylformamide/acetone mixture, porous networks could be generated in the PVDF/MWNTs composites upon the rapid volatilization of acetone. The electrical conductivity was gradually enhanced by the addition of MWNTs. At the same time, the thermal conductivity of the PVDF film could be retained at 0.1546 W·m-1·K-1 due to the porous structure being even by loaded with a high content of MWNTs (i.e., 15 wt.%). Thus, the Seebeck coefficient, power factor and figure of merit (ZT) were subsequently improved with maximum values of 324.45 μV/K, 1.679 μW·m-1·K-2, and 3.3 × 10-3, respectively. The microstructures, thermal properties, and thermoelectric properties of the porous PVDF/MWNTs composites were studied. It was found that the enhancement of thermoelectric properties would be attributed to the oxidation of MWNTs and the porous structure of the composites. The decrease of thermal conductivity and the increase of Seebeck coefficient were induced by the phonon scattering and energy-filtering effect. The proposed method was found to be facile and effective in creating a positive effect on the thermoelectric properties of composites."

The prepared organic dots with AIEgens (AIE dots) are advantageous over other metal ions in detecting Cu2+, Fe3+ with high selectivity and sensitivity by forming agglomerations (on-off). The agglomerations formed by AIE dots and Cu2+ redistributed and the fluorescence was obviously recovered in the presence of cysteine (off-on). This sensor has a wide linear range for Cu2+, Fe3+ and cysteine. The fluorescent detection limits of AIE dots are calculated to be 107 nM for Cu2+, 120 nM for Fe3+ and 78 nM for cysteine, respectively.

In this view, this contribution presents a new biobased aromatic polyester, i.e., poly(propylene 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate) (PPTF), which has been compared with the furan-based counterpart (PPF). Both biopolyesters have been characterized from the molecular, thermo-mechanical and structural points of view. Gas permeability behavior has been evaluated with respect to 100% oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen at 23 °C. In case of CO₂ gas test, gas transmission rate has been also measured at different temperatures. The permeability behavior at different relative humidity has been investigated for both biopolyesters, the thiophen-containing sample demonstrating to be better than the furan-containing counterpart. PPF's permeability behavior became worse than PPTF's with increasing RH, due to the more polar nature of the furan ring. Both biopolyesters under study are characterized by superior gas barrier performances with respect to PEF and PET. With the simple synthetic strategy adopted, the exceptional barrier properties render these new biobased polyesters interesting alternatives in the world of green and sustainable packaging materials. The different polarity and stability of heterocyclic rings was revealed to be an efficient tool to tailor the ability of crystallization, which in turn affects mechanical and barrier performances.",Modeling of Laser Beam Absorption in a Polymer Powder Bed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960709,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In order to understand the absorption characteristic, a ray trace model is developed by taking into account the reflection, absorption and refraction. The ray paths are resolved on a sub-powder grid. For validation, the simulation results are compared to analytic solutions of the irradiation of the laser beam onto a plain surface. In addition, the absorptance, reflectance and transmittance of PA12 powder layers measured by an integration sphere setup are compared with the numerical results of our model. It is shown that the effective penetration depth can be lower than the penetration depth in bulk material for polymer powders and, therefore, can increase the energy density at the powder bed surface. The implications for modeling of the selective laser sintering (SLS) process and the processability of fine powder distributions and high powder bed densities are discussed.",Enhancement of Colour Effects of Dyed-Yarn Mixed Fabrics Using Cramming Motion and Finer Polyester Yarns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960708,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper reports the study of the effects of cramming motion implemented during weaving and finer weft yarns used on dyed-yarn mixed woven fabrics produced by using raw white warps and multicolored-wefts. The cramming motion was used to increase the dyed-weft yarns cover factor of fabric, and thus, to reduce the negative effect of white warp floats at the fabric face on the color attributes of fabric. The surface structure of fabric was characterized by using several key geometrical parameters that determined the resultant fabric color attributes. The effects of fabric structure and density, weft yarn count, and the introduction of black yarn on the fabric face layer on the fabric surface geometrical parameters, physical properties, as well as color attributes were investigated under the implementation of cramming motion on the fabric. The color attributes of fabrics using cramming motion and finer yarns were also compared to the fabrics without cramming motion. The experimental results indicate that the weft yarn density and cover factor of fabric face layer are increased by applying cramming motion and finer yarns for fabricating the blue-red and/or black mixed fabrics. Consequently, the fabric lightness can be further reduced for achieving a better color effect on colorful and figured woven fabrics mainly using dyed-wefts for color mixing.",Synthesis of Benzene Tetracarboxamide Polyamine and Its Effect on Epoxy Resin Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960707,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Epoxy resins have found various industrial applications in high-performance thermosetting resins, high-performance composites, electronic-packaging materials, adhesives, protective coatings, etc., due to their outstanding performance, including high toughness, high-temperature performance, chemical and environmental resistance, versatile processability and adhesive properties. However, cured epoxy resins are very brittle, which limits their applications. In this work, we attempted to enhance the toughness of cured epoxy resins by introducing benzene tetracarboxamide polyamine (BTCP), synthesized from pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) and diamines in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. During this reaction, increased viscosity and formation of amic acid could be confirmed. The chemical reactions were monitored and evidenced using ¹H-NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, water gel-phase chromatography (GPC) analysis, amine value determination and acid value determination. We also studied the effect of additives on thermomechanical properties using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA), thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and by measuring mechanical properties. The BTCP-containing epoxy resin exhibited high mechanical strength and adhesion strength proportional to the amount of BTCP. Furthermore, field-emission scanning electron microscopy images were obtained for examining the cross-sectional morphology changes of the epoxy resin specimens with varying amounts of BTCP.",The Synthesis of Low-Viscosity Organotin-Free Moisture-Curable Silane-Terminated Poly(Urethane-Urea)s.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960706,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This work explores the possibility of synthesizing moisture-curable silane-terminated poly(urethane-urea)s (SPURs) of low viscosity. First, NCO-terminated urethane prepolymers were prepared, followed by silane end-capping. The impact of polyol molecular weight and the ratio of isocyanate to polyol (NCO/OH) on viscosity and the properties of SPUR were examined. As alternatives to the organotin catalysts traditionally used for the polyurethane synthesis and curing processes, bismuth carboxylate catalysts were evaluated. In addition, the effect of organofunctional groups in the aminosilane structure (R1⁻NH⁻R2⁻Si(OR3)₃), i.e., R1 (alkyl, aryl or trimethoxysilyl-propyl), the spacer R2 (α or γ) and alkyl group R3 (methyl or ethyl), was examined. The chemical and physical structures of the SPUR were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile tests. The results reveal that silane-terminated, moisture-curable polyurethanes can be successfully synthesized and cured with bismuth carboxylate catalysts. SPUR exhibiting low viscosity, with adequate tensile strength and elongation can be prepared using environmentally benign bismuth carboxylate catalyst having a high metal content of 19%⁻21%, by utilizing secondary aminosilane end-cappers and an optimal combination of the polyol molecular weight and NCO/OH ratio.",Preparation of Molecularly Imprinted Microspheres as Biomimetic Recognition Material for In Situ Adsorption and Selective Chemiluminescence Determination of Bisphenol A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960705,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupter in environments which can induce abnormal differentiation of reproductive organs by interfering with the action of endogenous gonadal steroid hormones. In this work, the bisphenol A (BPA) molecularly-imprinted microspheres (MIMS) were prepared and used as biomimetic recognition material for in situ adsorption and selective chemiluminescence (CL) determination of BPA. Through non-covalent interaction, the BPA-MIMS was successfully prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerization using a BPA template, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) cross-linker, and a SiO₂ dispersion agent. The characterization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-disperse spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the obtained MIMS possessed a regular spherical shape and narrow diameter distribution (25⁻30 μm). The binding experiment indicated BPA could be adsorbed in situ on the MIMS-packing cell with an apparent maximum amount Qmax of 677.3 μg g-1. Then BPA could be selectively detected by its sensitive inhibition effect on the CL reaction between luminol and periodate (KIO₄), and the inhibition mechanism was discussed to reveal the CL reaction process. The CL intensity was linear to BPA concentrations in two ranges, respectively from 0.5 to 1.5 μg mL-1 with a detection limit of 8.0 ng mL-1 (3σ), and from 1.5 to 15 μg mL-1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 80 ng mL-1 (3σ). The BPA-MIPMS showed excellent selectivity for BPA adsorption and the proposed CL method has been successfully applied to BPA determination in environmental water samples.","Structure-Properties Relations for Polyamide 6, Part 2: Influence of Processing Conditions during Injection Moulding on Deformation and Failure Kinetics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960704,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effect of processing conditions during injection on the structure formation and mechanical properties of injection molded polyamide 6 samples was investigated in detail. A large effect of the mold temperature on the crystallographic properties was observed. Also the the effect of pressure and shear flow was taken in to consideration and analysed. The yield and failure kinetics, including time-to-failure, were studied by performing tensile and creep tests at several test temperatures and relative humidities. As far as mechanical properties are concerned, a strong influence of temperature and relative humidity on the yield stress and time-to-failure was found. A semi-empirical model, able to describe yield and failure kinetics, was applied to the experimental results and related to the crystalline phase present in the sample. In agreement with findings in the literature it is observed that for high mold temperatures the sample morphology is more stable with respect to humidity and temperature than in case of low mold temperatures and this effects could be successfully captured by the model. The samples molded at low temperatures showed, during mechanical testing, a strong evolution of the crystallographic properties when exposed to high testing temperature and high relative humidity, i.e., an increase of crystallinity or a crystal phase transition. This makes a full description of the mechanical behavior rather complicated.",Identification and Characterization of Novel Fc-Binding Heptapeptides from Experiments and Simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960703,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Purification of biologically-derived therapeutics is a major cost contributor to the production of this rapidly growing class of pharmaceuticals. Monoclonal antibodies comprise a large percentage of these products, therefore new antibody purification tools are needed. Small peptides, as opposed to traditional antibody affinity ligands such as Protein A, may have advantages in stability and production costs. Multiple heptapeptides that demonstrate Fc binding behavior that have been identified from a combinatorial peptide library using M13 phage display are presented herein. Seven unique peptide sequences of diverse hydrophobicity and charge were identified. All seven peptides showed strong binding to the four major human IgG isotypes, human IgM, as well as binding to canine, rat, and mouse IgG. These seven peptides were also shown to bind human IgG4 from DMEM cell culture media with 5% FCS and 5 g/L ovalbumin present. These peptides may be useful as surface ligands for antibody detection and purification purposes. Molecular docking and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms and energetics for the binding of these peptides to the Fc region. The binding site was found to be located between the two glycan chains inside the Fc fragment. Both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were found to be crucial for the binding interactions. Excellent agreement for the binding strength was obtained between experimental results and simulations.",In Situ Strain and Damage Monitoring of GFRP Laminates Incorporating Carbon Nanofibers under Tension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960702,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, conductive carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were dispersed into epoxy resin and then infused into glass fiber fabric to fabricate CNF/glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates. The electrical resistance and strain of CNF/GFRP laminates were measured simultaneously during tensile loadings to investigate the in situ strain and damage monitoring capability of CNF/GFRP laminates. The damage evolution and conduction mechanisms of the laminates were also presented. The results indicated that the percolation threshold of CNFs content for CNF/GFRP laminates was 0.86 wt % based on a typical power law. The resistance response during monotonic tensile loading could be classified into three stages corresponding to different damage mechanisms, which demonstrated a good ability of in situ damage monitoring of the CNF/GFRP laminates. In addition, the capacity of in situ strain monitoring of the laminates during small strain stages was also confirmed according to the synchronous and reversible resistance responses to strain under constant cyclic tensile loading. Moreover, the analysis of the resistance responses during incremental amplitude cyclic tensile loading with the maximum strain of 1.5% suggested that in situ strain and damage monitoring of the CNF/GFRP laminates were feasible and stable."

Nonwoven PLA mats were manufactured by solvent-free melt-blowing technology. Three types of PLA differing in d-lactide content were processed with a productivity as high as 36 g/h. The crystallinity of the PLA microfibres was enhanced by thermal annealing. A 2⁻3-fold increase in the degree of crystallinity was obtained, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fibre diameters between 2⁻14 µm were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Static tensile tests were performed on the nonwoven mats, showing the reduced moduli of the annealed fibres due the amorphous relaxation. The PLA mats were processed via the hot compaction technique and formed into SR⁻PLA composites. The morphological and mechanical properties of the obtained microstructural composites were comprehensively studied. Composites prepared from annealed, thermally more stable PLA nonwoven mats showed superior mechanical properties; the tensile strength improved by 47% due to the higher residual fibre content.",Mid-Chain Radical Migration in the Radical Polymerization of n-Butyl Acrylate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960690,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The occurrence of intramolecular transfer to polymer in the radical polymerization of acrylic monomers has been extensively documented in the literature. Whilst it has been largely assumed that intramolecular transfer to polymer leads to short chain branches, there has been some speculation over whether the mid-chain radical can migrate. Herein, by the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of poly(n-butyl acrylate) synthesized by solution polymerization under a range of conditions, it is shown that this mid-chain radical migration does occur in the radical polymerization of acrylates conducted at high temperatures, as is evident from the shape of the molecular weight distribution. Using a mathematical model, an initial approximation of the rate at which migration occurs is made and the distribution of branching lengths formed in this scenario is explored. It is shown that the polymerizations carried out under a low monomer concentration and at high temperatures are particularly prone to radical migration reactions, which may affect the rheological properties of the polymer.","Bimetallic Aluminum 5,6-Dihydro-7,7-dimethyl quinolin-8-olates as Pro-Initiators for the ROP of ε-CL; Probing the Nuclearity of the Active Initiator.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960689,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Six examples of aluminum 5,6-dihydro-7,7-dimethylquinolin-8-olates, [{2-R¹-7,7-Me₂-8-R²C₉H₆N-8-O}AlR³₂]₂ (R¹ = R² = H, R³ = Me C1; R¹ = R² = H, R³ = Et C2; R¹ = R² = H, R³ = i-Bu C3; R¹ = Cl, R² = H, R³ = Me C4; R¹ = H, R² = R³ = Me C5; R¹ = Cl, R² = R³ = Me C6), have been prepared by treating the corresponding pro-ligand (L1⁻L4) with either AlMe₃, AlEt₃ or Al(i-Bu)₃. All complexes have been characterized by ¹H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and in the case of C1 and C4 by single crystal X-ray diffraction; dimeric species are a feature of their molecular structures. In the presence of PhCH₂OH (BnOH), C1⁻C6 displayed good control and efficiency for the ROP of ε-CL with almost 100% conversion achievable in 10 min at 90 °C; the chloro-substituted C4 and C6 notably exhibited the lowest activity of the series. However, in the absence of BnOH, C1 showed only low activity with 15% conversion achieved in 30 min forming a linear polymer capped with either a methyl or a L1 group. By contrast, when one or more equivalents of BnOH was employed in combination with C1, the resulting catalyst was not only more active but gave linear polymers capped with BnO end-groups. By using ¹H and 27Al NMR spectroscopy to monitor solutions of C1, C1/BnOH and C1/BnOH/10 ε-CL over a range of temperatures, some support for a monomeric species being the active initiator at the operational temperature is presented.",Ozonation and Depolymerization of Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) Extracted from a Biofilter Treating Gaseous Toluene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960688,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Low-concentration ozonation was developed as a novel technique to control the excess biomass in volatile organic compound (VOC) biofilters. In order to understand the reaction mechanism between ozone and biomass, the changes in properties of ozone exposed extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were investigated in this study. EPS was sequestered from the biofilm, obtained from a biofilter treating gaseous toluene, and then it was exposed to gaseous ozone at 272 ± 22 ppm continuously for 12 h. The total organic carbon (TOC) results indicated that low concentration ozone could not mineralize the EPS to carbon dioxide (CO₂) completely. The excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) results demonstrated that ozone preferred to attack the benzene ring and specific amino acid residues (such as tryptophan) on the protein chain. High performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) results confirmed that the protein molecules were depolymerized after ozone attack, while the molecular weight of polysaccharides was not much affected by ozone. During ozonation, few volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, benzaldehyde and by-products of toluene, were generated, which confirms a minor change in the TOC concentration of EPS. Results revealed that low concentration ozone can reduce the molecular weight of biofilter EPS which can be a key reason for controlling biomass accumulation. Additionally, this can be used to study the composition of biofilm EPS from biofilters.",Effective Reduction of Volumetric Thermal Expansion of Aromatic Polyimide Films by Incorporating Interchain Crosslinking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960686,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To develop a facile method for reducing the coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion (CVE) of polymer films, the thermal expansion behaviors of thermally cross-linkable polyimide (PI) films with isomeric diamine structures were investigated via thermal mechanical analyses and optical interferometry measurements. The degree of crosslinking of the PI films containing the diphenylethynylene (Ph⁻C≡C⁻Ph) structure in the main chain was characterized by far-infrared (far-IR) spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and variations in the CVE induced by thermal crosslinking were quantitatively estimated. The crosslinking reactions effectively reduced the CVEs of the PI films by suppressing intermolecular free volume expansion and local molecular motions promoted at elevated temperatures. The lowest CVE value observed for a crosslinked PI cured at 400 °C (+98 ppm/K at 80⁻280 °C) was one of the smallest values reported to date in polymers. Incorporating interchain crosslinking into the main chain is an effective method for reducing the CVE of aromatic polymers.",Drug Release Properties of Diflunisal from Layer-By-Layer Self-Assembled κ-Carrageenan/Chitosan Nanocapsules: Effect of Deposited Layers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960685,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Engineering of multifunctional drug nanocarriers combining stability and good release properties remains a great challenge. In this work, natural polymers κ-carrageenan (κ-CAR) and chitosan (CS) were deposited onto olive oil nanoemulsion droplets (NE) via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly to study the release mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory diflunisal (DF) as a lipophilic drug model. The nano-systems were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential (ζ-potential) measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm the NE-coating with polymer layers. In addition, kinetic release studies of DF were developed by the dialysis diffusion bag technique. Mathematical models were applied to investigate the release mechanisms. The results showed that stable and suitably sized nanocapsules (~300 nm) were formed. Also, the consecutive adsorption of polyelectrolytes by charge reversal was evidenced. More interestingly, the drug release mechanism varied depending on the number of layers deposited. The nanosized systems containing up to two layers showed anomalous transport and first order kinetics. Formulations with three and four layers exhibited Case II transport releasing diflunisal with zero order kinetics. Hence, our results suggest that these polyelectrolyte nanocapsules have great potential as a multifunctional nanocarrier for drug delivery applications.",Polyaniline/Carbon Nanotubes Composite Modified Anode via Graft Polymerization and Self-Assembling for Microbial Fuel Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960684,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are promising devices for sustainable energy production, wastewater treatment and biosensors. Anode materials directly interact with electricigens and accept electrons between cells, playing an important role in determining the performance of MFCs. In this study, a novel carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposite film modified Indium-tin oxide (ITO) anode was fabricated through graft polymerization of PANI after the modification of γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) on ITO substrate, which was followed by layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembling of CNTs and PANI alternatively on its surface. (CNTs/PANI)n/APTES/ITO electrode with low charge transfer resistance showed better electrochemical behavior compared to the bare ITO electrode.

In addition to the synthetic polymers, varied natural precursors such as cellulose and biomolecules can also be employed to prepare biodegradable polymeric architectures.",Bending of Thin Liquid Crystal Elastomer under Irradiation of Visible Light: Finsler Geometry Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960682,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this paper, we show that the 3D Finsler geometry (FG) modeling technique successfully explains a reported experimental result: a thin liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) disk floating on the water surface deforms under light irradiation. In the reported experiment, the upper surface is illuminated by a light spot, and the nematic ordering of directors is influenced, but the nematic ordering remains unchanged on the lower surface contacting the water. This inhomogeneity of the director orientation on/inside the LCE is considered as the origin of the shape change that drives the disk on the water in the direction opposite the movement of the light spot. However, the mechanism of the shape change is still insufficiently understood because to date, the positional variable for the polymer has not been directly included in the interaction energy of the models for this system. We find that this shape change of the disk can be reproduced using the FG model. In this FG model, the interaction between σ, which represents the director field corresponding to the directional degrees of LC, and the polymer position is introduced via the Finsler metric. This interaction, which is a direct consequence of the geometry deformation, provides a good description of the shape deformation of the LCE disk under light irradiation.",Self-Erasable Nanocone Antireflection Films Based on the Shape Memory Effect of Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960681,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Arrays of nanostructure that are capable of broadband antireflection and light trapping properties are implemented in photovoltaic and photonic devices. However, most of the existing antireflection films have been hindered by a complicated fabricated method and structurally rigid. Here, we report a simple preparation method for self-erasable nanocone antireflection films using the surface replication method. Arrays of nanocone with sub-100 nm surface features could be replicated easily on the shape memory polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film, and are erased by thermal stimulation. The reflectivity of self-erasable antireflection film can be switched from the 4.5% to 0.6% averaged over the visible spectral range by controlling the temperature below or above 80 °C. Theoretical simulations have been demonstrated. The unique smart film is expected to be used to further extend the application of smart optical windows and digital screens."

In brief, the amidoxime adsorbent is obtained by grafting of acrylonitrile (AN)/methacrylic acid (MAA) onto a nonwoven fabric and subsequent amidoximation with hydroxylamine, while the ammonium adsorbent is obtained by grafting of chloromethylstyrene (CMS) followed by quaternization with trimethylamine. The AN/MAA-grafting reaches a high degree of grafting more than 100%, and the resulting amidoxime adsorbent reaches a high amidoxime density of 4.53 mmol/g. On the other hand, the CMS-grafting reaches a much higher degree of grafting above 200%, and the resulting ammonium adsorbent reaches a high ammonium density of 3.51 mmol/g. FTIR/ATR and TGA/DTA are used for the characterization of the grafted fabrics as well as the relevant fabric adsorbents. Furthermore, the chromium removal of the prepared fabric adsorbent is tested in both batch and column modes. It has been confirmed that the chromium removal was largely dependent on the pH of the solution. At pH 5.0, the amidoxime adsorbent shows a high Cr(III) adsorption capacity of 31.68 mg/g, while the ammonium adsorbent shows a much higher Cr(VI) adsorption capacity of 130.65 mg/g.",Preparation and Characterization of Softwood Kraft Lignin Copolymers as a Paper Strength Additive.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960668,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Softwood kraft lignin is a renewable type of woody material that can be converted to value-added products, for example, as a paper strength additive in the paper industry. In this study, the monomers of methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC), acrylic acid (AA), and acrylamide (AM) were grafted on softwood kraft lignin (SKL) to prepare three different SKL copolymers. Fourier-transform infrared, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, charge density, elemental, and molecular weight analyses confirmed that the monomers were successfully grafted onto SKL. The grafting rates of SKL-DMC, SKL-AA, and SKL-AM copolymers were 80.35%, 82.70%, and 79.48%, respectively. The application of SKL copolymers as a paper additive for enhancing paper physical properties was studied. The results indicated that at a 2 wt % dosage of SKL copolymers, the increase in the physical properties of paper is maximum.",Impact of Mechanical Degradation on Polymer Injectivity in Porous Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960667,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polymer flooding is an established enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method; still, many aspects of polymer flooding are not well understood. This study investigates the influence of mechanical degradation on flow properties of polymers in porous media. Mechanical degradation due to high shear forces may occur in the injection well and at the entrance to the porous media. The polymers that give high viscosity yields at a sustainable economic cost are typically large, MW > 10 MDa, and have wide molecular weight distributions. Both MW and the distributions are altered by mechanical degradation, leading to changes in the flow rheology of the polymer. The polymer solutions were subjected to different degrees of pre-shearing and pre-filtering before injected into Bentheimer outcrop sandstone cores. Rheology studies of injected and produced polymer solutions were performed and interpreted together with in situ rheology data. The core floods showed a predominant shear thickening behavior at high flow velocities, which is due to successive contraction/expansion flow in pores. When pre-sheared, shear thickening was reduced but with no significant reduction in in situ viscosity at lower flow rates. This may be explained by reduction in the extensional viscosity. Furthermore, the results show that successive degradation occurred which suggests that the assumption of the highest point of shear that determines mechanical degradation in a porous media does not hold for all field relevant conditions.",Investigating the Mechanism of Horseradish Peroxidase as a RAFT-Initiase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960666,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A detailed mechanistic and kinetic study of enzymatically initiated RAFT polymerization is performed by combining enzymatic assays and polymerization kinetics analysis. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) initiated RAFT polymerization of dimethylacrylamide (DMAm) was studied. This polymerization was controlled by 2-(propionic acid)ylethyl trithiocarbonate (PAETC) in the presence of H₂O₂ as a substrate and acetylacetone (ACAC) as a mediator. In general, well controlled polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and good agreement between theoretical and measured molecular weights are consistently obtained by this method. Kinetic and enzymatic assay analyses show that HRP loading accelerates the reaction, with a critical concentration of ACAC needed to effectively generate polymerization initiating radicals. The PAETC RAFT agent is required to control the reaction, although the RAFT agent also has an inhibitory effect on enzymatic performance and polymerization. Interestingly, although H₂O₂ is the substrate for HRP there is an optimal concentration near 1 mM, under the conditions studies, with higher or lower concentrations leading to lower polymerization rates and poorer enzymatic activity. This is explained through a competition between the H₂O₂ acting as a substrate, but also an inhibitor of HRP at high concentrations.",One-Pot Synthesis of P(O)-N Containing Compounds Using N-Chlorosuccinimide and Their Influence in Thermal Decomposition of PU Foams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960665,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Synthesis of intermediate containing P(O)-Cl bonds is the key to converting P(O)-H bonds to P(O)-N. In this work we have performed chlorination reactions of different H-phosphinates and H-phosphonates using N-chlorosuccinimide as an environmentally-benign chlorinating agent. The chlorination reaction showed high yield and high selectivity for transformation of P(O)-H bonds into P(O)-Cl analogues, resulting in an easily separable succinimide as the by-product. Using a one-pot synthesis methodology, we have synthesized a series of P(O)-N containing derivatives whose synthesis was found to be dependent on the reaction solvents and the starting materials. The synthesized P(O)-N compounds were incorporated in flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) and screened for their influence in thermal decomposition of FPUFs using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC). All solid P(O)-N compounds influenced the first-stage decomposition of FPUFs, which resulted in an accelerated decomposition or temporary stabilization of this stage. However, the liquid P(O)-N derivatives volatilize at an earlier stage and could be active in the gas phase. In addition, they also work in condensed phase via acid catalyzed decomposition for FPUFs.",Recent Overviews in Functional Polymer Composites for Biomedical Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960664,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Composite materials are considered as an essential part of our daily life due to their outstanding properties and diverse applications.

Engineered cartilages were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to promote cartilage degradation; (3) Results: articular chondrocytes have been rejected since they exhibit low cellular doubling with respect to nasal cells, with longer culture time for cell expansion; furthermore, pellet and alginate bead cultures lead to insufficient cartilage matrix production. Decellularized cartilage resulted as good support for degeneration model, but long culture time and high cell amount are required to obtain the adequate scaffold colonization. Here, we proposed, for the first time, the combined use of decellularized cartilage, as aggrecanase substrate, with pellet, alginate beads, or silk/alginate microcarriers, as polymeric scaffolds for chondrocyte cultures. This approach enables the development of suitable models of cartilaginous pathology. The results obtained after cryopreservation also demonstrated that beads and microcarriers are able to preserve chondrocyte functionality and metabolic activity; (4) Conclusions: alginate and silk/alginate-based scaffolds can be easily produced and cryopreserved to obtain a cost-affordable and ready-to-use polymer-based product for the subsequent screening of anti-inflammatory drugs for cartilage diseases.",White-Light Emission of Dye-Doped Polymer Submicronic Fibers Produced by Electrospinning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960662,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Lighting and display technologies are evolving at tremendous rates nowadays; new device architectures based on new, microscopic building blocks are being developed. Besides high light-emission efficiencies, qualities including low cost, low environmental impact, flexibility, or lightweightness are sought for developing new types of devices. Electrospun polymer fibers represent an interesting type of such microscopic structures that can be employed in developing new functionalities. White-light-emitting fiber mats were prepared by the electrospinning of different dye-doped polymer solutions. Two approaches were used in order to obtain white-light emissions: the overlapping of single-dye-doped electrospun fiber mats, and the electrospinning of mixtures of different ratios of single-dye-doped polymer solutions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphologies of the electrospun fibers with diameters ranging between 300 nm and 1 µm. Optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) were evaluated for single-dye-doped submicronic fiber mats, for overlapping mats, and for fiber mats obtained from different compositions of mixtures. Depending on the ratios of the mixtures of different dyes, the luminance was balanced between blue and red emissions. Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) measurements depict this fine-tuning of the colors' intensities, and the right composition for white-light emission of the submicronic fiber mats was found.",Structural Characterization of Lignin and Lignin-Carbohydrate Complex (LCC) from Ginkgo Shells (Ginkgo biloba L.) by Comprehensive NMR Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960661,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Lignin and lignin-carbohydrate complexes are important polymers for lignocellulosic biorefinery and functional materials, but those in ginkgo shells are not effectively analyzed and exploited.

Damaling (ML) and Ginkgo biloba L. cv. Dafozhi (FZ) correspondingly, and were structurally characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that ginkgo shells exhibited higher lignin (42%) and xylan (20%) content than general softwood species. Isolated MWLs were rich in guaiacyl units with the presence of ferulates and p-coumarates, and the molecular formula was C₉H7.93O2.73(OCH₃)0.81 and C₉H7.87O2.76(OCH₃)0.88 for MWLML and MWLFZ, respectively. Phenolic hydroxyl of MWLML (1.38 mmol/g) and MWLFZ (1.23 mmol/g) in ginkgo shells was much less than that in general softwoods, suggesting a higher etherification and condensation degree of ginkgo shells lignin, and β-5', α-O-4', and 4-O-5' bonds were the main condensed structures. O-acetylated β-d-xylopyranoside and β-d-mannopyranoside were the main polysaccharides associated with lignin, and the acetyl groups frequently acylate the C₂ and C₃ positions.

PAN nanofiber mats, created by electrospinning, are an especially interesting source to gain carbon nanofibers. A well-known problem in this process is fixing the PAN nanofiber mats during the stabilization process which is necessary to avoid contraction of the fibers, correlated with an undesired increase in the diameter and undesired bending. Fixing this issue typically results in breaks in the nanofiber mats if the tension is too high, or it is not strong enough to keep the fibers as straight as in the original state. This article suggests a novel method to overcome this problem by electrospinning on an aluminum substrate on which the nanofiber mat adheres rigidly, stabilizing the composite and carbonizing afterwards either with or without the aluminum substrate to gain either a pure carbon nanofiber mat or a metal/carbon composite."

There were C⁻O⁻Cu bonds formed between the lignin nanospheres and the metallic nanoparticles. The lignin nanospheres and the lignin nanosphere-supported catalyst werfe characterized by utilizing XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, EDS, and TGA. The immobilization of Cu₂O nanoparticles on the lignin nanospheres was beneficial for dispersion of the Cu₂O nanoparticles and preventing their aggregation, which could cause catalyst deactivation, which favored the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction.

Electrode materials with a hierarchically porous structure can not only increase the specific surface area but also promote the electron transfer, facilitating the catalysis reaction. Block copolymer is a good candidate for preparation of film with a hierarchically porous structure due to its unique characteristics of self-assembly and phase separation. In the current work, hierarchically porous block copolymer film containing both micropores and nanopores was prepared by spinodal decomposition induced phase separation. The resultant copolymer film was adopted as the electrode material to immobilize glucose oxidase (GOx) for construction of an enzyme biosensor. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle (CA) measurements, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) were adopted to investigate the microstructure of the as-developed biosensor. Results demonstrated that the hierarchically porous block copolymer film offered a favorable and biocompatible microenvironment for proteins. These as-prepared glucose biosensors possessed a wide linear range (10⁻4500 μM), a low detection limit (0.05 μM), quick response (2 s), excellent stability, and selectivity.

This strategy is achieved by two key steps: (i) precise synthesis of core⁻shell star-shaped block copolymers with crosslinkable AIEgen-precursor (AIEgen: aggregation induced emission luminogen) as pending groups on the inner blocks; (ii) gelation of the inner blocks by coupling the AIEgen-precursor moieties to generate AIE-active spacers, and thus, fluorescent nanogel. By using this strategy, a series of star-shaped block copolymers with benzophenone groups pending on the inner blocks were synthesized by grafting from a hexafunctional initiator through atom transfer radical copolymerization (ATRP) of 4-benzoylphenyl methacrylate (BPMA) or 2-(4-benzoylphenoxy)ethyl methacrylate (BPOEMA) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and tert-butyldimethylsilyl-protected 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (ProHEMA) followed by a sequential ATRP to grow PMMA or PProHEMA. The pendent benzophenone groups were coupled by McMurry reaction to generate tetraphenylethylene (TPE) groups which served as AIE-active spacers, affording a fluorescent nanogel. The nanogel showed strong emission not only at aggregated state but also in dilute solution due to the strongly restricted inter- and intramolecular movement of TPE moiety in the crosslinked polymeric network.

In this work, a multilayered carbon⁻fabric/polycarbonate laminate (multi-CFPL) was fabricated by a two-step hot-press process, mainly based on the thermoplastic properties of its polycarbonate (PC) matrix. Different from the conventional one-step method, the two-step hot-press process was composed of two separate procedures. First, a unit-hot-press operation was introduced to prepare a single-layered carbon⁻fabric/PC laminate (simplified as unit-CFPL). Subsequently, a laminating-hot-press was employed to compress several as-prepared unit-CFPLs bonded together. This combined process aims to reduce the hot-press temperature and pressure, as well as facilitate the structure designability of this new composite. Several mechanical investigations were conducted to analyze the effect of the hot-press parameters and unit-CFPL numbers on the performance of this multi-CFPL material, including flexural, uniaxial tensile and impact tests. The results reveal that the multi-CFPL exhibits a good stability of flexural and tensile properties in terms of strength and modulus. Furthermore, during impact tests, the multi-CFPL presents an accelerated growth of peak force and energy absorption capability with increasing unit-CFPL layers.","The Effect of Diluent Mixture with Upper Critical Solution Temperature on Membrane Formation Process, Microstructure, and Performance of PVDF Hollow Fiber Membrane by TIPS Process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960644,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) is a technique to prepare commercial membrane. However, the quick polymer crystallization during the quenching process will bring about a dense and thick skin layer and thus decrease permeability markedly. In this paper, a diluent mixture with upper critical solution temperature (UCST) was used to prepare polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane. That is, the separation between diluent (propylene carbonate (PC)) and non-diluent (dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP)) occurred during the quenching process when the temperature of the dope was lower than 110 °C. The effects of separation between PC and DOTP and the resulting coalescence of DOTP on the PVDF crystallization process, microstructure, and the permeability of the membranes were analyzed. The results showed that the suitable PC/DOTP weight ratio reduced the thickness of the skin layer near the outer surface markedly and resulted in a porous outer surface, and the microstructure evolution process was proposed. The maximum pure water flux for the prepared membrane is up to 128.5 L·m-2·h-1 even in a dry mode without using a hydrophilizing agent. The rejection rate of the carbonic particle is nearly 100%.

One of these properties is impact strength, essential to ensure the processability and application of these materials under impact conditions. In addition, it is known that water absorption has a plasticizing effect in polymers and polymer composites which can change the properties of such materials and limit their use. Moreover, this effect worsens when hydrophilic reinforcement is used. In this work, the impact and water uptake behavior of totally bio-based composites from polyamide 11 (PA11) and lignocellulosic pine fibers mechanically processed as stone groundwood (SGW) were studied. The impact resistance of PA11 and its composites was higher than expected, obtaining better results than those of polyolefin-based materials. The evaluated mechanical properties and the micrographs showed an adequate interface. The water uptake test showed that PA11 and its composites had non-Fickian and Fickian case I behaviours, respectively. It was found that the maximum water absorbance was similar to that of SGW reinforced polypropylene.",Construction of a Different Polymer Chain Structure to Study π-π Interaction between Polymer and Reduced Graphene Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960641,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, a different polymer chain structure was synthesized to study π-π interactions between polymer and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Polymers with different chain structures were obtained from free radical copolymerization of styrene with 4-cyanostyrene (containing substituted phenyl rings) and 2-vinylnaphthalene (containing naphthalene rings). In this work, the polystyrene, poly(styrene-co-4-cyanostyrene) and poly(styrene-co-2-vinylnaphthalene) were named as PS, PSCN and PSNP, respectively. RGO was prepared through modified Hummers' method and further thermal reduction, and nanocomposites were prepared by solution blending. Thus, different π-π interactions were formed between polymers and RGO. Raman and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the interfacial interaction, showing that the trend of the interfacial interaction should be in the order of RGO/PSCN, RGO/PS, and RGO/PSNP. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement showed that, compared with polymer matrix, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of RGO/PS, RGO/PSCN and RGO/PSNP nanocomposites with the addition of 4.0 wt% RGO are increased by 14.3 °C, 25.2 °C and 4.4 °C, respectively. Compared with π-π interaction only formed through aromatic rings, substituent groups changed the densities of electron clouds on the phenyl rings. This change resulted in the formation of donor-acceptor interaction and reinforcement of the π-π interaction at the interface, which leads to increased value of Tg.

In the toe region, the stress is almost zero, and the length of this zero-stress region becomes very large (≃150%) in, for example, certain arteries. In this paper, we study long-toe diagrams using two-dimensional (2D) and 3D FG modeling techniques and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We find that, except for the failure region, large-strain J-shaped diagrams are successfully reproduced by the FG models. This implies that the complex J-shaped curves originate from the interaction between the directional and positional degrees of freedom of polymeric molecules, as implemented in the FG model.",Significantly Enhanced Electromechanical Performance of PDMS Crosslinked PVDF Hybrids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960639,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-based ferroelectric polymers have large and tunable dielectric permittivity (εr), but rather high Young's modulus (Y), which limits its electromechanical response when used as actuators. In this work, a silicone oligomer involving amino groups is employed to crosslink a non-crystallized poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) matrix bearing double bonds (P(VDF-CTFE-DB)) via addition reaction. Thanks to the flexible silicone molecules, the modulus of the hybrids is reduced over 30% when compared with the pristine matrix. Most interestingly, the εr of the hybrids is improved to nearly 100% higher than that of the matrix when the silicone content reaches 30 wt %. This may be due to the dilution effect of silicone molecules, which favors macromolecular chain rearrangement and dipole orientation of the hybrids under an applied electric field. As a result, electric-field activated displacements of the above hybrid increases to 0.73 mm from 0.48 mm of the matrix under 60 MV/m. The maximum electric field-induced thickness strain increases from 1% of the matrix to nearly 3% of the crosslinked hybrid. This work may provide a facile strategy to fabricate PVDF-based hybrids with enhanced electromechanical performance under low activating voltage."

Ternary OPVs with different poly[thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-diyl-alt-4,9-bis(4-(2-decyltetradecyl)thien-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c']bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,5'-diyl] (PTT-DTNT-DT) doping concentrations were designed and the effect of PTT-DTNT-DT as a complementary electron donor on the performance of OPVs was investigated. The optimized PCE of OPVs was increased from 3.42% to 4.66% by doping 20 wt % PTT-DTNT-DT. The remarkable improvement in the performance of the ternary device is mainly attributed to the sharp increase in the short-circuit current density and fill-factor. The major reasons have been systematically studied from atomic force microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, surface energy, space charge limited current and photocurrent behavior. It has been found that the separation of excitons and the transportation of charge are enhanced while light absorption is increased, and the charge recombination also decreases due to the optimization of the cascade energy level and the morphology of the ternary active layer. The results show that it is feasible to improve the performance of ternary OPVs by their complementary absorption.",Cellulose-Based Absorbent Production from Bacterial Cellulose and Acrylic Acid: Synthesis and Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960627,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Cellulose-based superabsorbent was synthesized by bacterial cellulose (BC) grafting acrylic acid (AA) in the presence of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (NMBA) as a crosslinker and ammonium persulfate (APS) as an initiator. The influence of different factors on composite synthesis, including the weight ratio of the monomer to BC, initiator content, crosslinker content, AA neutralization degree, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the water absorbency of the composite, were systematically learned. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum water absorbency of the composite was 322 ± 23 g/g distilled water. However, the water absorbency was much less for the different salt solutions and the absorption capacity of the composite decreased as the concentration of the salt solutions increased. The pH value had a significant influence on water absorption performance, and with the increase of temperature, the water retention rate of the composite decreased. Additionally, the structure of this composite was characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results of NMR and FT-IR provided evidence that the composite was synthesized by BC and AA, and the microstructure showed that it had good performance for water absorption. In addition, the composite possessed suitable thermal stability, and that it could be used in a few high-temperature environments. Overall, this composite is promising for application in water absorption.",Hyaluronic Acid in the Third Millennium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960626,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Since its first isolation in 1934, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been studied across a variety of research areas. This unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid is almost ubiquitous in humans and in other vertebrates. HA is involved in many key processes, including cell signaling, wound reparation, tissue regeneration, morphogenesis, matrix organization and pathobiology, and has unique physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesivity, hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity. For these reasons, exogenous HA has been investigated as a drug delivery system and treatment in cancer, ophthalmology, arthrology, pneumology, rhinology, urology, aesthetic medicine and cosmetics. To improve and customize its properties and applications, HA can be subjected to chemical modifications: conjugation and crosslinking. The present review gives an overview regarding HA, describing its history, physico-chemical, structural and hydrodynamic properties and biology (occurrence, biosynthesis (by hyaluronan synthases), degradation (by hyaluronidases and oxidative stress), roles, mechanisms of action and receptors). Furthermore, both conventional and recently emerging methods developed for the industrial production of HA and its chemical derivatization are presented. Finally, the medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications of HA and its derivatives are reviewed, reporting examples of HA-based products that currently are on the market or are undergoing further investigations.",Preparation of Graphene-Perfluoroalkoxy Composite and Thermal and Mechanical Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960625,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) material exhibits perfect corrosion resistance under both acid or alkaline circumstances; thus, steel heat exchangers are being substituted by those made of PFA in high corrosion atmospheres. However, the low thermal conductivity of PFA degrades its heat transfer efficiency. Based on the extremely high heat conductivity of graphene, a novel grapheme-PFA composite was proposed to simultaneously meet the demands of heat transfer and corrosion resistance. Ultrasonic dispersion technology was used to disperse the aggregated graphene in the composite. Graphene⁻PFA composites with different graphene contents and using different dispersing solvents were prepared with a hot pressing method, and thermal conductivity, abrasion resistance, crystallization and pyrolysis properties were investigated. The thermal conductivity of PFA composites with graphene content of 20 wt % reached 5.017 W (m·k)-1, which is 21.88 times that of pure PFA. The relationship between the abrasion loss and the friction coefficient of the composites with different graphene contents was obtained. A thermogravimetric analyzer was used to investigate the crystallization and pyrolysis behavior of the composites; correspondingly, the temperature range that composites work in was determined. The heat conduction mechanism was analyzed through the thermal conductivity model of composite materials.

PLA is bio-based, biocompatible, biodegradable, and easy to produce. This polymer has been used to create natural fiber reinforced composites. However, to produce high-performance and presumably biodegradable composites, the interphase between PLA and natural fibers still requires further study. As such, we aimed to produce PLA-based composites reinforced with a commercial bleached kraft eucalyptus pulp. To become a real alternative, fully biodegradable composites must have similar properties to commercial materials. The results found in this research support the competence of wood fiber reinforced PLA composites to replace other glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composites from a tensile property point of view. Furthermore, the micromechanics analysis showed that obtaining strong interphases between the PLA and the reinforcement is possible without using any coupling agent. This work shows the ability of totally bio-based composites that fulfill the principles of green chemistry to replace composites based on polyolefin and high contents of glass fiber. To the best knowledge of the authors, previous studies obtaining such properties or lower ones involved the use of reagents or the modification of the fiber surfaces.",Kinetic Prediction of Fast Curing Polyurethane Resins by Model-Free Isoconversional Methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960623,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, the characterisation of reaction kinetics of a methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI)-based fast curing polyurethane resin (PUR) and the mathematical description of its curing process are presented. For the modelling of the reaction process isoconversional methods, which are also called model-free approaches, are used instead of model-based approaches. One of the main challenges is the characterisation of a reactive system with a short pot life, which already starts to crosslink below room temperature. The main focus is the evaluation of the applicability of isoconversional methods for predicting the reaction kinetics of fast curing polyurethane resins. In order to realise this, a repeatable methodology for the determination of time- and temperature-dependent reaction curves using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is defined. The cure models defined by this method serve as the basis for process simulations of PUR processing technologies such as resin transfer moulding (RTM) or reactive injection moulding (RIM) and reactive extrusion (REX). The characterisation of the reaction kinetics using DSC measurements is carried out under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Within this work isoconversional methods have been applied successfully to experimentally determined DSC data sets. It is shown that the reaction kinetics of fast curing polyurethane resins can be predicted using this methods. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the time-dependent change of conversion of the considered polyurethane under isothermal curing conditions can also be predicted using isoconversional methods based on non-isothermal DSC measurements. This results in a significant reduction in the experimental effort required to characterise and model the curing process of polyurethanes.",Voltage-Induced Wrinkle Performance in a Hydrogel by Dielectric Elastomer Actuation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960622,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Hydrogel is a type of soft smart material and is responsive to stimuli. In the development of actuation in hydrogel, electrical actuation features a fast and universal strategy which is favored in the engineering system. Due to the difficulty in direct electrical actuation in hydrogel, in this study, an indirect actuation was attained via a dielectric elastomer. An aligned wrinkle pattern was obtained in the hydrogel upon a direct-current voltage, and it is reversible. The morphology and nonlinear mechanics of the electro-wrinkling deformation was characterized and analyzed. The optical property of the wrinkle in hydrogel was investigated, demonstrating a tunable blurring effect in optics. The electro-wrinkling performance offers a potential application with soft and tunable optical property in hydrogel-based actuators.",A One Pot Method for Preparing an Antibacterial Superabsorbent Hydrogel with a Semi-IPN Structure Based on Tara Gum and Polyquaternium-7.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960621,Polymers,2019 04 11,"An antibacterial superabsorbent polymer was prepared by graft polymerization of acrylic acid onto tara gum polysaccharide, by adding N,N-dimethyl-N-2-propenyl-2-propen-1-aminium chloride and a polymer with 2-propenamide (polyquaternium-7, PQ7) as an antibacterial agent.

The superabsorbent hydrogel was characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. The results showed that poly (acrylic acid) was successfully grafted onto tara gum and a three-dimensional network structure formed with PQ7 chains penetrated in the networks. The antibacterial properties of these superabsorbent hydrogels against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli improved with increasing PQ7 content.

According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, the PI filaments exhibit an 87.16% increase in O/C atomic ratio and a 135.71% increase in the C⁻O functional group after 180 s O₂ plasma treatment. The atomic force microscope (AFM) results show that the root mean square roughness (Rq) of the treated PI filaments increases by 105.34%, from 38.41 to 78.87 nm. Owing to the increased surface oxygenic functional groups and roughness after O₂ plasma treatment, the contact angle between treated PI filaments and water reduces drastically from the pristine state of 105.08° to 56.15°. The O₂ plasma treated PI filaments also demonstrate better mechanical properties than the pristine PI filaments. Moreover, after O₂ plasma treatment, the adhesion between PI filaments and poly(amic acid) (PAA) is enhanced, and the tensile strength of the polyimide/poly(amic acid) (PI/PAA) self-reinforced composites increases from 136 to 234 MPa, even causing the failure mode of the composite changes from adhesive failure to partly cohesive failure.",Nanoparticles-Modified Chemical Sensor Fabricated on a Flexible Polymer Substrate for Cadmium(II) Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960619,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper presents the development of a chemical sensor which was microfabricated on top of liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrate.

These features demonstrate potential for integration of the sensor into automated sensing vehicles to achieve real-time detection. The sensor consists of a gold working electrode, a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, and a gold counter electrode. The working electrode of the sensor was further modified with bismuth nanoparticles and Nafion. The modified sensor exhibited a significantly enhanced sensing capability toward cadmium metal ion (Cd(II)) in comparison to the unmodified one. The effects of deposition potential and deposition time on the sensing performance of the sensor were extensively investigated through electrochemical experiments. With optimized parameters, the sensor was capable of quantifying Cd(II) in the concentration range of 0.3 to 25 µg/L. The minimum Cd(II) concentration detected by the sensor was 0.06 µg/L under quiescent deposition. The obtained results suggest that the proposed sensor has a great potential to be deployed for in-situ Cd(II) determination."

The swelling properties of the CaAlg membranes prepared with different contents of NaAlg were researched. Circular dichroism indicated that the conformation of BSA did not change during the preparing and eluting process. The thinner the CaAlg hydrogel membrane was, the larger the adsorption capacity and the higher the imprinting efficiency of the CaAlg. The maximum adsorption capacity of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and non-imprinted CaAlg hydrogel membrane (NIP) was 38.6 mg·g-1 and 9.2 mg·g-1, respectively, with an imprinting efficiency of 4.2.

We study the effect of a hydrogenated and a deuterated solvent (H₂O/D₂O), and of the hydrogenated and (partially) deuterated monomer. Deuteration of the monomer or copolymerization with deuterated monomers shifts the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) by up to 8.4 K to higher temperatures, in good agreement with known results for pNIPAM microgels. Moreover, the shape of the swelling curve is found to depend on deuteration, with the highest deuteration leading to the sharpest VPT. Finally, the quantitative agreement between FTIR spectroscopy and PCS evidences the spatial homogeneity of the microgel particles.

The transition of the spherulites-cylindrites was evaluated using in-situ two-dimensional wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering methods. The crystallinity of stretched iPP sheets was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry. The crystal morphology was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the differences of crystal microstructure of the iPP sheet depended on the stretching strain, which promoted the orientation of molecular chains. Amorphous molecular chains in the spherulites oriented and formed into a mesophase near the yield point, and the partially ordered mesophase was further stretched to form an oriented cylindrite structure after the yield point. The highest relative content of cylindrites appeared at 15% strain. Notably, as the amorphous phase embedded into the lamellae layer, the crystal size decreased with the increase of strain, which indicated that the crystallinity of the stretched iPP sheet was much higher than that of unstretched iPP sheet. The induced cylindrites structure played a more important role in improving the mechanical properties and heat resistance of iPP sheets.

However, the determination of the properties of surfaces and interfaces poses many challenges due to their extremely small dimensions. Herein, polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate thin film on silicon wafer was used as a model system for the measurement of the properties of the polymer near free surface and at the polymer-solid interface. Two different methods, i.e., nanoindentation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the gold nanoparticle embedding technique, were used for these measurements. The results showed the elastic modulus of PS near the free surface determined by nanoindentation was lower than the bulk value. Based on contact mechanics analysis, nanoparticle embedding also revealed the existence of a lower-modulus, non-glassy layer near the free surface at temperatures below the bulk glass transition temperature (Tg). However, near the polymer-solid interface, the AFM nanoindentation method is not applicable due to the geometry confinement effect. On the other hand, the nanoparticle embedding technique can still correctly reflect the interactions between the polymer and the substrate when compared to the ellipsometry results.",Green Preparation of Fluorescent Carbon Quantum Dots from Cyanobacteria for Biological Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960600,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Biomass-based carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have become a significant carbon materials by their virtues of being cost-effective, easy to fabricate and low in environmental impact. However, there are few reports regarding using cyanobacteria as a carbon source for the synthesis of fluorescent CQDs. In this study, the low-cost biomass of cyanobacteria was used as the sole carbon source to synthesize water-soluble CQDs by a simple hydrothermal method. The synthesized CQDs were mono-dispersed with an average diameter of 2.48 nm and exhibited excitation-dependent emission performance with a quantum yield of 9.24%. Furthermore, the cyanobacteria-derived CQDs had almost no photobleaching under long-time UV irradiation, and exhibited high photostability in the solutions with a wide range of pH and salinity. Since no chemical reagent was involved in the synthesis of CQDs, the as-prepared CQDs were confirmed to have low cytotoxicity for PC12 cells even at a high concentration. Additionally, the CQDs could be efficiently taken up by cells to illuminate the whole cell and create a clear distinction between cytoplasm and nucleus. The combined advantages of green synthesis, cost-effectiveness and low cytotoxicity make synthesized CQDs a significant carbon source and broaden the application of cyanobacteria and provide an economical route to fabricate CQDs on a large scale.","Estimation of Mechanical Performance, Thermal Stability and Flame Retardancy of High-Impact Polystyrene/Surface-Modified APP/Carboxylic-Functionalized MWCNTs Nanocomposites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960599,Polymers,2019 06 10,"An ammonium polyphosphate (APP) surface-modified by silane coupling agent was used as flame retardant in high-impact polystyrene (HIPS).

A composite only containing APP was also prepared as a reference material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the dispersion of the fillers into the HIPS matrix, and it was found the hydrophobic groups on the k-APP surface would greatly enhance the dispersion and prevent agglomerations compared with APP. Furthermore, the COOH⁻MWCNTs also showed good dispersibility into the matrix. Mechanical tests of the nanocomposites revealed that k-APP exhibits a more beneficial effect on both tensile and flexural properties compared with APP.

Products are characterized using ¹H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. According to mass spectrometry, the phosphazene fractions of PERO include up to 30 individual compounds with a predominance of cyclotriphosphazenes with one unsubstituted chlorine atom and four or five glycidyl groups.

In application studies, the phospha-carborane functionalized block polymer was tested as heat resistance material. Thermal stability was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) analysis. Thermal treatment and ceramic yield under air were directly correlated to the carborane content of the block copolymer. However, phosphorus content in the polymer was more crucial for the char residues when heated under nitrogen atmosphere. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) increased as the number of phosphonate functionalities increased. However, corresponding phosphonic acid derivatives featured a lower heat release rate and total heat release. Moreover, the phosphonic acid functionalities of the block copolymer offer efficient chelating capabilities for iron nanoparticles, which is of interest for applications in biomedicine in the future. The complexation with iron oxide nanoparticles was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP⁻MS)."

The as-prepared MIPs were characterized by SEM and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques to study the morphology structure. The adsorption experiments exhibited that MIP1 had adsorption capacity as high as 564 mg·g-1. The MIP2 showed faster adsorption kinetics than MIP1 and MIP3. The adsorption equilibrium could be reached for gossypol in 40 min. A selectivity study showed that the adsorption capacity of MIPs for gossypol was about 1.9 times higher than that of the structurally-similar analogs ellagic acid and 6.6 times higher than that of the quercetin. It was found that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model were more applicable for the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of gossypol binding onto the MIP1 and MIP2, respectively. Results suggested that among those three, the MIP2 was a desirable sorbent for rapid adsorption and MIP1 was suitable for selective recognition of gossypol.",Photoinduced Metal-Free Surface Initiated ATRP from Hollow Spheres Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960585,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Well-defined amphiphilic diblock copolymer poly (methyl methacrylate)-b-poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) grafted hollow spheres (HS-g-PMMA-b-PNIPAM) hybrid materials were synthesized via metal-free surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The ATRP initiators α-Bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB) were attached onto hollow sphere surfaces through esterification of acyl bromide groups and hydroxyl groups. The synthetic ATRP initiators (HS-Br) were further used for the metal-free SI-ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) using 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH) as the photocatalyst. The molecular weight of the polymers, structure, morphology, and thermal stability of the hybrid materials were characterized via gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results indicated that the ATRP initiator had been immobilized onto HS surfaces successfully followed by metal-free SI-ATRP of MMA and NIPAM, the Br atom had located at the end of the main PMMA polymer chain, and the polymerization process possessed the characteristic of controlled/""living"" polymerization.

Herein, the Tgs of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films with different thicknesses and substrates are studied by fluorescence measurements, focusing on the influence of interfacial effects on the Tgs. The strong interaction between PMMA and quartz substrate leads to increased Tgs with the decreased thickness of the film. The plasmonic silver substrate causes enhanced fluorescence intensity near the interface, resulting in the delayed reduction of the Tgs with the increasing film thickness. Moreover, as a proof of the interface-dependent Tgs, hydrogen bonds of PMMA/quartz and molecules orientation of PMMA/silver are explored by the Raman spectroscopy, and the interfacial interaction energy is calculated by the molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, we probe the inter-relationship between the interfacial interactions arising from the different substrates and the Tg behavior of polymer thin films.","A New Strategy for the Synthesis of Hydroxyl Terminated Polystyrene-b-Polybutadiene-b-Polystyrene Triblock Copolymer with High Cis-1, 4 Content.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960582,Polymers,2019 06 10,"This work reports the preparation of a hydroxyl terminated polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-polystyrene triblock copolymer (SBS) with high cis-1, 4 content via a novel nickel catalyst, [η³-Ni(CH₂CHCHCH₂OOCH₃)][BPhF₄]. FT-IR, ¹H-NMR, and 13C NMR indicated that the polybutadiene segment of the copolymer contains greater than 90% cis-1, 4 structure, indicating achievement of the objective. Toward the functionalization goal, a hydroxyl group was successfully introduced at the end of the triblock copolymer (HO⁻SBS⁻OH). The results of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed that the polymer is indeed a triblock copolymer, with no traces of homopolymer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that HO⁻SBS⁻OH synthesized using the novel catalyst had a lower glass transition temperature (Tg) than HO⁻SBS⁻OH synthesized with an alkyl lithium catalyst. Therefore, the polymer synthesized via the novel catalyst contains high cis-1,4 content and displays excellent low-temperature mechanical properties.",Rheological Properties and Thermal Conductivity of Epoxy Resins Filled with a Mixture of Alumina and Boron Nitride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960581,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Electronic packaging materials with high thermal conductivity and suitable viscosity are necessary in the manufacturing of highly integrated electronic devices for efficient heat dissipation during operation. This study looked at the effect of boron nitride (BN) platelets on the rheology and thermal conductivity of composites based on alumina (Al₂O₃) and epoxy resin (EP) for the potential application as electronic packaging. The viscosity and thermal conductivity of the composite were increased upon increasing filler content. Furthermore, thermal conductivity of the BN/Al₂O₃/EP was much higher than that of Al₂O₃/EP at almost the same filler loadings. These unique properties resulted from the high thermal conductivity of the BN and the synergistic effect of the spherical and plate shapes of these two fillers. The orientation of BN platelets can be controlled by adjusting their loading to facilitate the formation of higher thermally conductive pathways. The optimal content of the BN in the Al₂O₃/EP composites was confirmed to be 5.3 vol %, along with the maximum thermal conductivity of 4.4 W/(m·K).",Direct Numerical Simulation of Gas-Liquid Drag-Reducing Cavity Flow by the VOSET Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960580,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Drag reduction by polymer is an important energy-saving technology, which can reduce pumping pressure or promote the flow rate of the pipelines transporting fluid. It has been widely applied to single-phase pipelines, such as oil pipelining, district heating systems, and firefighting. However, the engineering application of the drag reduction technology in two-phase flow systems has not been reported. The reason is an unrevealed complex mechanism of two-phase drag reduction and lack of numerical tools for mechanism study. Therefore, we aim to propose governing equations and numerical methods of direct numerical simulation (DNS) for two-phase gas-liquid drag-reducing flow and try to explain the reason for the two-phase drag reduction. Efficient interface tracking method-coupled volume-of-fluid and level set (VOSET) and typical polymer constitutive model Giesekus are combined in the momentum equation of the two-phase turbulent flow. Interface smoothing for conformation tensor induced by polymer is used to ensure numerical stability of the DNS. Special features and corresponding explanations of the two-phase gas-liquid drag-reducing flow are found based on DNS results. High shear in a high Reynolds number flow depresses the efficiency of the gas-liquid drag reduction, while a high concentration of polymer promotes the efficiency. To guarantee efficient drag reduction, it is better to use a high concentration of polymer drag-reducing agents (DRAs) for high shear flow.",Preparation and Performances of Warp-Knitted Hernia Repair Mesh Fabricated with Chitosan Fiber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960579,Polymers,2019 06 10,"In this paper, warp-knitted knitted fabrics with chitosan fibers for ventral hernia repair were fabricated with three kinds of structures. The properties of chitosan fiber, yarns, and fabrics were tested. The results demonstrated that the properties of a mesh fabricated with 1-0/1-2/2-3/2-1// structure were slightly better than those of other fabrics. The mechanical properties of the three produced fabrics were weak. However, the results demonstrated that chitosan meshes have many advantages, such as excellent hygroscopicity, and thermal and antimicrobial properties, which makes them one of the best materials for ventral hernia repair. The findings have theoretical and practical significance for the industrial uses of chitosan in ventral hernia repair.",Effect of Material Composition on Tunable Surface Roughness of Magnetoactive Elastomers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960578,Polymers,2019 06 10,"We investigated magnetic-field-induced modifications of the surface roughness of magnetoactive elastomers (MAEs) with four material compositions incorporating two concentrations of ferromagnetic microparticles (70 wt% and 80 wt%) and exhibiting two shear storage moduli of the resulting composite material (about 10 kPa and 30 kPa). The analysis was primarily based on spread optical reflection measurements. The surfaces of all four materials were found to be very smooth in the absence of magnetic field (RMS roughness below 50 nm). A maximal field-induced roughness modification (approximately 1 μm/T) was observed for the softer material with the lower filler concentration, and a minimal modification (less than 50 nm/T) was observed for the harder material with the higher filler concentration. All four materials showed a significant decrease in the total optical reflectivity with an increasing magnetic field as well. This effect is attributed to the existence of a distinct surface layer that is depleted of microparticles in the absence of a magnetic field but becomes filled with particles in the presence of the field. We analyzed the temporal response of the reflective properties to the switching on and off of the magnetic field and found switching-on response times of around 0.1 s and switching-off response times in the range of 0.3⁻0.6 s. These observations provide new insight into the magnetic-field-induced surface restructuring of MAEs and may be useful for the development of magnetically reconfigurable elastomeric optical surfaces.",Boosting the Adhesivity of π-Conjugated Polymers by Embedding Platinum Acetylides towards High-Performance Thermoelectric Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960577,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) incorporated with π-conjugated polymers, have proven to be an effective approach in the production of advanced thermoelectric composites. However, the studied polymers are mainly limited to scanty conventional conductive polymers, and their performances still remain to be improved. Herein, a new planar moiety of platinum acetylide in the π-conjugated system is introduced to enhance the intermolecular interaction with the SWCNTs via π⁻π and d⁻π interactions, which is crucial in regulating the thermoelectric performances of SWCNT-based composites. As expected, SWCNT composites based on the platinum acetylides embedded polymers displayed a higher power factor (130.7 ± 3.8 μW·m-1·K-2) at ambient temperature than those without platinum acetylides (59.5 ± 0.7 μW·m-1·K-2) under the same conditions.

The bound state traps deriving from grafted molecule are analyzed by first-principles calculations, in combination with the electrical DC conductivity and dielectric breakdown strength experiments to study the underlying mechanism of improving the electrical insulation properties. In contrast to pure XLPE, the XLPE-graft-CAAE represents significantly suppressed space charge accumulation, increased breakdown strength, and reduced conductivity. The substantial deep traps are generated in XLPE-graft-CAAE molecules by polar group of grafted CAAE and accordingly decrease charge mobility and raise charge injection barrier, consequently suppressing space charge accumulation and charge carrier transport. The well agreement of experiments and quantum mechanics calculations suggests a prospective material modification strategy for achieving high-voltage polymer dielectric materials without nanotechnology difficulties as for nanodielectrics."

It is known from rheological behaviour of elastomers that reinforcing fillers additionally induce nonlinearity in an already inherently nonlinear system. This behaviour is often described in terms of a mechanical response of strain sweeps, essentially the transition from the linear viscoelastic (LVE) to the nonlinear viscoelastic (NVE) region. In the current investigation, the NVE region could be observed with respect to frequency under low-amplitude deformation. A foldover effect was observed, whereby the material exhibited a nonlinear dependency in relation to the increment of the filler amount above the percolation threshold. In addition, an apparent superharmonic resonance was observed within higher orders of vibrational modes which is further indication of nonlinearity. In this paper, the analytical approach is presented as a novel method to characterise the behaviour of the polymer⁻filler interaction by HF DMA.",Shape Memory Behavior of Natural Eucommia ulmoides Gum and Low-Density Polyethylene Blends with Two Response Temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960564,Polymers,2019 06 10,"A series of shape memory blends of natural Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with a bicontinuous cross-linked structure were prepared by a physical blending method, which could be used in the field of thermal response with two different temperatures. We report the shape memory properties of these blended materials with two response temperatures for the first time. The mechanical, curing, thermal and shape memory properties of the blends were studied in this manuscript. Schematic diagrams are proposed to illustrate the dual shape memory behaviors of the EUG/LDPE blends. Our study focused on observing the relationship between the shape memory behavior and the microscopic crystalline phase states in the blends. In the blends, both the cross-linked network and the LDPE crystalline regions could act as fixed domains, while the crystalline regions of LDPE or EUG could act as the reversible domain. The shape memory properties were mainly determined by the components of the fixed and reversible domains. We focused on the shape memory behavior of blends at 60 °C and 130 °C in this manuscript. The results showed that when the peroxide dicumyl peroxide (DCP) dosage was 1.0 phr, the blends exhibited acceptable shape behavior at 60 °C (R1f = 74.8%, R1r = 63.3%). At the same time, when DCP dosage was 0.4 phr, the shape memory behavior of the blends at 130 °C was good and much better than that at 60 °C (R2f = 91.1%, R2r = 89.4%).",Intelligent Machine Learning: Tailor-Making Macromolecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960563,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Nowadays, polymer reaction engineers seek robust and effective tools to synthesize complex macromolecules with well-defined and desirable microstructural and architectural characteristics. Over the past few decades, several promising approaches, such as controlled living (co)polymerization systems and chain-shuttling reactions have been proposed and widely applied to synthesize rather complex macromolecules with controlled monomer sequences. Despite the unique potential of the newly developed techniques, tailor-making the microstructure of macromolecules by suggesting the most appropriate polymerization recipe still remains a very challenging task. In the current work, two versatile and powerful tools capable of effectively addressing the aforementioned questions have been proposed and successfully put into practice. The two tools are established through the amalgamation of the Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach and machine learning techniques. The former, an intelligent modeling tool, is able to model and visualize the intricate inter-relationships of polymerization recipes/conditions (as input variables) and microstructural features of the produced macromolecules (as responses). The latter is capable of precisely predicting optimal copolymerization conditions to simultaneously satisfy all predefined microstructural features. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent modeling and optimization techniques for solving this extremely important 'inverse' engineering problem was successfully examined by investigating the possibility of tailor-making the microstructure of Olefin Block Copolymers via chain-shuttling coordination polymerization.",Macro- and Microphase Separated Protein-Polyelectrolyte Complexes: Design Parameters and Current Progress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960562,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Protein-containing polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) are a diverse class of materials, composed of two or more oppositely charged polyelectrolytes that condense and phase separate near overall charge neutrality. Such phase-separation can take on a variety of morphologies from macrophase separated liquid condensates, to solid precipitates, to monodispersed spherical micelles. In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in protein-containing PECs, with an overall goal of defining relevant design parameters for macro- and microphase separated PECs. For both classes of PECs, the influence of protein characteristics, such as surface charge and patchiness, co-polyelectrolyte characteristics, such as charge density and structure, and overall solution characteristics, such as salt concentration and pH, are considered. After overall design features are established, potential applications in food processing, biosensing, drug delivery, and protein purification are discussed and recent characterization techniques for protein-containing PECs are highlighted.",A Novel Approach of Promoting Adhesion of Reinforcing Cord to Elastomers by Plasma Polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960561,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Adhesion of cords to elastomers is crucial for many elastomeric products, such as tires and V-belts. The best adhesion system so far is based on a combination of resorcinol, formaldehyde, and a latex (RFL). However, this cord treatment has serious disadvantages in terms of processing and toxicity. A promising alternative is a plasma treatment of the cords prior to be embedded in the elastomer. For rayon cords, a plasma polymerization of sulfur-containing precursors results in adhesion levels close to RFL treatment. However, for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cords, this treatment is not satisfactory. For this type of cords, a water-plasma activation followed by a silane dip is more promising, as 72% of the adhesion level of RFL treatment could be achieved. For rayon, an even higher adhesion level was realized.",POSS-Derived Synthesis and Full Life Structural Analysis of Si@C as Anode Material in Lithium Ion Battery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960560,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-derived Si@C anode material is prepared by the copolymerization of octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (octavinyl-POSS) and styrene. Octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane has an inorganic core (-Si₈O12) and an organic vinyl shell. Carbonization of the core-shell structured organic-inorganic hybrid precursor results in the formation of carbon protected Si-based anode material applicable for lithium ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of the battery based on the as-obtained Si@C material Si reaches 1500 mAh g-1. After 550 charge-discharge cycles, a high capacity of 1430 mAh g-1 was maintained. A combined XRD, XPS and TEM analysis was performed to investigate the variation of the discharge performance during the cycling experiments. The results show that the decrease in discharge capacity in the first few cycles is related to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The subsequent rise in the capacity can be ascribed to the gradual morphology evolution of the anode material and the loss of capacity after long-term cycles is due to the structural pulverization of silicon within the electrode. Our results not only show the high potential of the novel electrode material but also provide insight into the dynamic features of the material during battery cycling, which is useful for the future design of high-performance electrode material.",The Effect of Accelerated Aging on Polylactide Containing Plant Extracts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960559,Polymers,2019 06 10,"In this study, natural extracts of plant origin were used as anti-aging compounds of biodegradable polymers.

The effectiveness of the tested extracts was compared to a commercially available anti-aging compound, 2 wt% of butylated hydroxytoluene. Visual evaluation, scanning electron microscopy, melt flow rate, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, tensile strength, and impact tensile tests were performed. We show that the use of smaller amounts of tested extracts is particularly advantageous, which do not adversely affect the properties of polylactide-based materials at low contents. At the same time, their effectiveness in stabilizing tested properties during the accelerated aging process is mostly comparable to or greater than the reference compound.",Optimized Dyeing Process for Enhancing the Functionalities of Spent Coffee Dyed Wool Fabrics Using a Facile Extraction Process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960558,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Spent coffee grounds are the byproduct of coffee brewing and are generally discarded as waste. However, spent coffee has high levels of organic compounds that have multiple biological effects, including antibacterial and antioxidant activities. In this light, spent coffee grounds were tested for fabric dyeing to both functionalize as well as color the fabrics. The dyeing solution was prepared by extracting spent coffee grounds collected from a local coffee house by using a manual espresso machine. The spent coffee extract was applied to wool fabrics using a laboratory infrared dyeing machine. After the dyeing process was completed, the fabrics were mordanted with a tannic acid aqueous solution. To optimize the dyeing conditions, the times and temperatures during the process were varied, and the functionalities and other properties including color and strength of the wool fabrics dyed with the spent coffee extract were investigated. The wool fabrics dyed with the spent coffee extract were significantly colored, and the color withstands the effect of washing and light exposure.

PEGBAB exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity to Al3+ over other competitive metal ions with the detection limit as low as 4.05 × 10-9 M. PEGBAB displayed high selectivity to Al3+ in the pH range of 5⁻10. The fluorescence response of PEGBAB to Al3+ was reversible in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Based on the fluorescence response, an INHIBIT logic gate was constructed with Al3+ and EDTA as two inputs. Moreover, test strips based on PEGBAB were fabricated facilely for convenient on-site detection of Al3+.","Crystalline Structures and Structural Transitions of Copolyamides Derived from 1,4-Diaminobutane and Different Ratios of Glutaric and Azelaic Acids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960556,Polymers,2019 06 10,"Copolyamides derived from even 1,4-butanediamine and different mixtures of odd dicarboxylic acids with a great difference in the number of methylene groups (i.e., glutaric and azelaic acids with 3 and 7 groups, respectively) have been synthesized, characterized and structurally studied. Calorimetric analyses revealed a complex behavior with multiple melting peaks associated to lamellar reordering and the presence of defective crystals. Equilibrium melting temperatures were evaluated and showed a eutectic behavior with composition. Copolymers were able to crystallize even for samples with comonomer percentages close to 50%. Negative and ringed spherulites from the melt state and small lath-like lamellar crystals from dilute solution crystallizations were attained. Furthermore, calorimetric data pointed out the exclusion of the less abundant monomer from the lattice of the predominant structure. All samples at room temperature showed a similar crystalline structure (form I) defined by two predominant reflections at spacings close to 0.430 and 0.380 nm, which has been related for even-odd nylons with a two-hydrogen bonded structure. Real time synchrotron experiments showed that melt crystallized samples have two polymorphic transitions on heating, which were practically reversible and consequently were also detected during cooling from the melt state. Interestingly, a different behavior was detected among solution crystallized samples and specifically the transition to the intermediate structure (form II) was not detected during heating for samples enriched on the azelate component or more precisely when they were exclusively crystallized in the form I."

The investigation was carried out at the microstructural, supramolecular and molecular levels using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and the viscosity method, respectively. The obtained experimental results revealed how the popular outdoor composting method, realized under two different European climatic conditions (in Poland and in Bulgaria), affects the degradation of PLA nonwoven, designed for agriculture use. The results showed the insignificant influence of the climatic conditions and prepared compost mixtures on the molecular and micromorphological structure of PLA spun-bonded mulching nonwovens, with a visible increase in crystallinity after the first year of composting. Significant changes were observed only after the second year of composting, which indicates the resistance of semicrystalline PLA to degradation in outdoor composting conditions.",Coordination between Surface Lattice Resonances of Poly(glycidyl Methacrylate) Line Array and Surface Plasmon Resonances of CdS Quantum on Silicon Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960542,Polymers,2019 05 05,"In this work, a unique hybrid system is proposed for one-dimensional gratings comprising of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) brushes and CdS quantum dots (CQDs). Generally, the emission of QDs is too weak to be observed in a dry state. Plasmonic resonances of the grating structures can be used to enhance the light emission or absorption of CQDs. The interaction between PGMA plasmonic nanostructures and inorganic CQDs plays a crucial role in engineering the light harvest, notably for optoelectronic applications. Extinction measurements of the hybrid system consisting of a PGMA grating and CQDs are reported. We designed one-dimensional gratings with various resolutions to tune the absorptance peaks of grating. PGMA grating grafted from a 1.5 µm resolution of trench arrays of photoresist exhibited absorptance peak at 395 nm, close to the absorption peak of CQDs, resulting in the photoluminescence enhancement of CQDs on the grating due to high charge carriers' recombination rate. Generally, the emission of quantum dots occurs under irradiation at characteristic wavelengths. Immobilizing QDs on the grating facilitates the emission of QDs under irradiation of full-wavelength light. Furthermore, the PGMA gratings with CQDs were immersed in various solvents to change the geometries resulting the shift of absorptance peak of grating. The proposed method could be applied for sensing the nature of the surrounding media and vice versa, as well as for various media of solvents.",Molecular Dynamics Simulation on the Effect of Bonding Pressure on Thermal Bonding of Polymer Microfluidic Chip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960541,Polymers,2019 04 30,"Thermal bonding technology is the most commonly used approach in bonding injection-molded microfluidic chips. Although the bonding mechanism is still under debate, the molecular dynamics (MD) method can provide insight into the bonding process on a macromolecular level. In this study, MD simulations for thermal bonding of PMMA substrate and cover sheet were performed. The molecule configuration and density distribution during the thermal bonding process were studied. The effects of bonding pressure on the equivalent strain, joining energy and diffusion coefficient were investigated. The debonding process was simulated to analyze the bonding strength and failure mechanism. Simulation results show that penetration mainly takes place near the interface area. Although the final density increases slightly with increasing pressure, the bonding interface is still insufficiently filled. The equivalent strain grows faster than that in the later stage because of the gap at the interface. The bonding pressure shows clear effects on the joining energy, diffusion coefficient and stress⁻strain behavior. Tensile failure occurs at the interface, with PMMA chains stretched between two layers. The majority of the change in potential energy is correlated with the change in non-bonded energy. At yield strain, the low-density defect at the interface weakens the tensile strength of bonded chip.",Exploring Next-Generation Engineering Bioplastics: Poly(alkylene furanoate)/Poly(alkylene terephthalate) (PAF/PAT) Blends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960540,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Polymers from renewable resources and especially strong engineering partially aromatic biobased polyesters are of special importance for the evolution of bioeconomy. The fabrication of polymer blends is a creative method for the production of tailor-made materials for advanced applications that are able to combine functionalities from both components. In this study, poly(alkylene furanoate)/poly(alkylene terephthalate) blends with different compositions were prepared by solution blending in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and chloroform. Three different types of blends were initially prepared, namely, poly(ethylene furanoate)/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PEF/PET), poly(propylene furanoate)/poly(propylene terephthalate) (PPF/PPT), and poly(1,4-cyclohenedimethylene furanoate)/poly(1,4-cycloxehane terephthalate) (PCHDMF/PCHDMT). These blends' miscibility characteristics were evaluated by examining the glass transition temperature of each blend. Moreover, reactive blending was utilized for the enhancement of miscibility and dynamic homogeneity and the formation of copolymers through transesterification reactions at high temperatures. PEF⁻PET and PPF⁻PPT blends formed a copolymer at relatively low reactive blending times. Finally, poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-ethylene furanoate) (PETF) random copolymers were successfully introduced as compatibilizers for the PEF/PET immiscible blends, which resulted in enhanced miscibility.",High-Performance TiO₂ Nanotubes/Poly(aryl ether sulfone) Hybrid Self-Cleaning Anti-Fouling Ultrafiltration Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960539,Polymers,2019 04 30,"A series of novel self-cleaning hybrid photocatalytic ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were fabricated to separate polyacrylamide, which is widely used as a commercial flocculant. To maximize the self-cleaning and anti-fouling properties of hybrid membranes, high surface area TiO₂ nanotubes (TNTs) with excellent photocatalytic activity were homogeneously introduced into a poly(aryl ether sulfone) matrix by chemical bonds. The chemical structure, micromorphology, hydrophilicity, separation efficiency, fouling behavior, and self-cleaning property of the prepared hybrid membranes were well characterized and evaluated. For the optimal sample, the flux recovery ratio increased from ~40% to ~80% after simulated sunlight irradiation for 20 min, which was attributable to the homogeneous dispersion and efficient photocatalytic degradation ability of TNTs. Furthermore, the intelligent fabrication strategy enhanced the anti-aging ability of the hybrid membranes via the use of a fluorine-containing poly matrix. This work provided new insight into the fabrication of high-performance self-cleaning inorganic/organic hybrid membranes.",Ethylene-co-norbornene Copolymerization Using a Dual Catalyst System in the Presence of a Chain Transfer Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960538,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Ethylene-co-norbornene copolymers were synthesized by a dual catalyst system at three concentrations of norbornene in the feed and variable amounts of ZnEt₂, as a possible chain transfer agent. The dual catalyst system consists of two ansa-metallocenes, isopropyliden(η5-cyclopentadienyl)(η⁵-indenyl)zirconium dichloride (1) and isopropyliden(η⁵-3-methylcyclopentadienyl)(η⁵-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (2), activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, in presence of TIBA. Values of norbornene content, molecular mass, glass transition temperature, and reactivity ratios r11 and r21 of copolymers prepared in the presence of 1+2 are intermediate between those of reference copolymers. The study of tensile and elastic properties of ethylene-co-norbornene copolymers (poly(E-co-N)s) gave evidence that copolymers were obtained in part through transfer of polymer chains between different transition metal sites. Mechanical properties are clearly different from those expected from a blend of the parent samples and reveal that copolymers obtained in the presence of 1+2 and ZnEt₂ consist of a reactor blend of segmented chains produced by exchange from 2 to 1 and 1 to 2 acting as the ideal compatibilizer of chains produced by the chain transfer from 1 to 1, and from 2 to 2.",Ferrocene-Modified Polyelectrolyte Film-Coated Electrode and Its Application in Glucose Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960536,Polymers,2019 04 30,"A polyelectrolyte film-coated electrode for the quantitative detection of glucose was reported. Carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide and polyelectrolyte with a ferrocenyl group were used to modify an enzyme electrode to facilitate the electron transfer between glucose oxidase and the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometric methods were adopted to investigate the effects of different polyelectrolytes and carbon nanomaterials on the electrochemical properties of enzyme electrodes. The results indicate that the ferrocenyl groups on a polyelectrolyte skeleton act as a mediator between the redox center of glucose oxidase and the electrode, which efficiently enhances the electron transfer between a glassy carbon electrode and glucose oxidase. The calibration curve of the sensor shows a linear range from 0.2 to 5 mM for glucose response. The sensor can achieve 95% of the steady-state current within 10 s. The electrodes also present high operational stability and long-term storage stability.",The Influence of DMDBS on Crystallization Behavior and Crystalline Morphology of Weakly-Phase-Separated Olefin Block Copolymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960535,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Olefin block copolymer (OBC), with its low hard segments, can form unique space-filling spherulites other than confined-crystallization morphologies, mainly due to its weak phase-separation. In this work, 1,3;2,4-Bis(3,4-dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol (DMDBS), a well-known nucleating agent, was used to tailor the crystallization behavior and crystalline morphology of OBC. It was found that DMDBS can precipitate within an OBC matrix and self-assemble into crystalline fibrils when cooling from the melt. A non-isothermal crystallization process exhibited an increased crystallization rate and strong composition dependence. During the isothermal crystallization process, DMDBS showed a more obvious nucleating efficiency at a higher crystallization temperature. OBC showed typical spherulites when DMDBS was added. Moreover, a low addition of DMDBS significantly decreased the crystal size, while a large addition of DMDBS induced aggregates, due to the limited miscibility of DMDBS with OBC. The efficient nucleating effect of DMDBS on OBC led to an increased optical transparency for OBC/DMDBS composites.",Electrical and Thermal Conductivity of Polylactic Acid (PLA)-Based Biocomposites by Incorporation of Nano-Graphite Fabricated with Fused Deposition Modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960533,Polymers,2019 05 05,"The aim of the study was to improve the electrical and thermal conductivity of the polylactic acid/wood flour/thermoplastic polyurethane composites by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). The results showed that, when the addition amount of nano-graphite reached 25 pbw, the volume resistivity of the composites decreased to 10⁸ Ω·m, which was a significant reduction, indicating that the conductive network was already formed. It also had good thermal conductivity, mechanical properties, and thermal stability. The adding of the redox graphene (rGO) combined with graphite into the composites, compared to the tannic acid-functionalized graphite or the multi-walled carbon nanotubes, can be an effective method to improve the performance of the biocomposites, because the resistivity reduced by one order magnitude and the thermal conductivity increased by 25.71%. Models printed by FDM illustrated that the composite filaments have a certain flexibility and can be printed onto paper or flexible baseplates.",Removing Pb(II) Ions from Aqueous Solution by a Promising Absorbent of Tannin-Immobilized Cellulose Microspheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960532,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Tannin/cellulose microspheres (T/C) were successfully prepared via a facile homogeneous reaction in a water/oil (W/O) emulsion for removing Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution. The structure of the microspheres was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and a zeta potential test. The effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and temperature on adsorption ability were investigated. The results showed that T/C microspheres could combine Pb(II)ions via electrostatic attractions and physical adsorption. Adsorption kinetics could be better described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption behaviors were in agreement with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model with a fitting correlation coefficient of 0.9992. The maximum adsorption capacity was 23.75 mg/g from the Langmuir isotherm evaluation at 308K with an initial pH of 5. The results suggested that tannin/cellulose microspheres could be a low-cost and effective adsorbent for removing Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution."

The silica-based materials are sometimes synthesized without a good understanding of the underlying reaction kinetics. This literature review attempts to be a comprehensive and more technical article in which the kinetics of alkoxysilanes polymerization are discussed. The kinetics of polymerization are controlled by primary factors, such as catalysts, water/silane ratio, pH, and organo-functional groups, while secondary factors, such as temperature, solvent, ionic strength, leaving group, and silane concentration, also have an influence on the reaction rates. Experiments to find correlations between these factors and reaction rates are restricted to certain conditions and most of them disregard the properties of the solvent. In this review, polymerization kinetics are discussed in the first two sections, with the first section covering early stage reactions when the reaction medium is homogenous, and the second section covering when phase separation occurs and the reaction medium becomes heterogeneous. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and other techniques are discussed in the third section. The last section summarizes the study of reaction mechanisms by using ab initio and Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods alone, and in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) methods.","A Comparative Study on Physiochemical, Thermomechanical, and Electrochemical Properties of Sulfonated Poly(Ether Ether Ketone) Block Copolymer Membranes with and without Fe₃O₄ Nanoparticles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960520,Polymers,2019 04 30,"The composite structure, good porosity, and electrochemical behavior of proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are important characteristics, which can improve the performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). In this study, we designed and synthesized an XY block copolymer via a polycondensation reaction that contains sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) (X) as a hydrophilic unit and a fluorinated oligomer (Y) as a hydrophobic unit. The prepared XY block copolymer is composed of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles to create composite architecture, which was subsequently treated with a 1 M H₂SO₄ solution at 70 °C for 1 h to eliminate Fe₃O₄ and generate a pores structure in the membrane. The morphological, physiochemical, thermomechanical, and electrochemical properties of bare XY, XY/Fe₃O₄-9 and XY(porous)-9 membranes were measured and compared in detail. Compared with XY/Fe₃O₄-9 composite, the proton conductivity of XY(porous)-9 membrane was remarkably enhanced as a result of the existence of pores as nano-conducting channels. Similarly, the XY(porous)-9 membrane exhibited enhanced water retention and ion exchange capacity among the prepared membranes. However, the PEFC power density of XY(porous)-9 membrane was still lower than that of XY/Fe₃O₄-9 membrane at 60 °C and 60% relative humidity. Also, the durability of XY(porous)-9 membrane is found to be lower compared with pristine XY and XY/Fe₃O₄-9 membranes as a result of the hydrogen crossover through the pores of the membrane.",Inductive Heating Using a High-Magnetic-Field Pulse to Initiate Chemical Reactions to Generate Composite Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960519,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Induction heating is efficient, precise, cost-effective, and clean. The heating process is coupled to an electrically conducting material, usually a metal. As most polymers are dielectric and non-conducting, induction heating is not applicable. In order to transfer energy from an electromagnetic field into polymer induction structures, conducting materials or materials that absorb the radiation are required. This report gives a brief overview of induction heating processes used in polymer technology. In contrast to metals, most polymer materials are not affected by electromagnetic fields. However, an unwanted temperature rise of the polymer can occur when a radio frequency field is applied. The now available high-field magnetic sources provide a new platform for induction heating at very low frequencies, avoiding unwanted thermal effects within the material. Using polycarbonate and octadecylamine as an example, it is demonstrated that induction heating performed by a magnetic-field pulse with a maximum flux density of 59 T can be used to initiate chemical reactions. A 50 nm thick Ag loop, with a mean diameter of 7 mm, placed in the polymer-polymer interface acts as susceptor and a resistive heating element. The formation of urethane as a linker compound was examined by infrared spectroscopic imaging and differential scanning calorimetry.",Ultrathin Photonic Polymer Gel Films Templated by Non-Close-Packed Monolayer Colloidal Crystals to Enhance Colorimetric Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960518,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Responsive polymer-based sensors have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to detect the presence of analytes and convert the detected signal into a physical and/or chemical change. High responsiveness, fast response speed, good linearity, strong stability, and small hysteresis are ideal, but to gain these properties at the same time remains challenging. This paper presents a facile and efficient method to improve the photonic sensing properties of polymeric gels by using non-close-packed monolayer colloidal crystals (ncp MCCs) as the template. Poly-(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP), a weak electrolyte, was selected to form the pH-responsive gel material, which was deposited onto ncp MCCs obtained by controlled O₂ plasma etching of close-packed (cp) MCCs. The resultant ultrathin photonic polymer gel film (UPPGF) exhibited significant improvement in responsiveness and linearity towards pH sensing compared to those prepared using cp MCCs template, achieving fast visualized monitoring of pH changes with excellent cyclic stability and small hysteresis loop. The responsiveness and linearity were found to depend on the volume and filling fraction of the polymer gel. Based on a simple geometric model, we established that the volume increased first and then decreased with the decrease of template size, but the filling fraction increased all the time, which was verified by microscopy observations. Therefore, the responsiveness and linearity of UPPGF to pH can be improved by simply adjusting the etching time of oxygen plasma. The well-designed UPPGF is reliable for visualized monitoring of analytes and their concentrations, and can easily be combined in sensor arrays for more accurate detection.",Preparation of Layered Polyethylene Oxide/rGO Composite: Flexible Lateral Heat Spreaders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960516,Polymers,2019 05 05,"In this paper, high thermal conductive polyethylene oxide (PEO)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite is prepared via large-scale green reduction. Flexible layered PEO/GO composites are pre-prepared in aqueous solution. It is demonstrated that PEO chains can form hydrogen bonds with GO. Being driven by hydrogen bonds, GO/PEO composites show homogeneous and lateral highly oriented structures, resulting in excellent mechanical properties. The pre-prepared composite films are large scale soaked into ascorbic acid solution. GO nanosheets in the matrix of the composites can be reduced by ascorbic acid. The results indicate that PEO chains can repair the damage of the films caused by the reduction process. Therefore, the films can maintain their original configuration and still keep excellent flexibility. By comparison, pristine GO films are totally destroyed when the same reduction is experienced. Due to the presence of PEO, the lateral highly oriented structure of the composite will not be damaged. After reduction, the thermal conductivity of the composite reaches to 12.03 W m-1 K-1 along the rGO nanosheet oriented direction.",Development and Investigation of Lanthanum Sulfadiazine with Calcium Stearate and Epoxidised Soyabean Oil as Complex Thermal Stabilizers for Stabilizing Poly(vinyl chloride).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960515,Polymers,2019 04 30,"Lanthanum sulfadiazine (LaSD) was synthesized from sulfadiazine and lanthanum nitrate using water as solvent under alkaline conditions, and was used as a novel rare earth thermal stabilizer to stabilize poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The structure of LaSD was characterized by elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA). The influence of lanthanum sulfadiazine with calcium stearate (CaSt₂) and epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) on stabilizing PVC was studied by using the Congo red test, oven discoloration test, UV-vis spectroscopy and thermal decomposition kinetics. The results showed that the addition of LaSD as a thermal stabilizer can significantly improve the initial whiteness and long-term stability of PVC. In addition, the synergies between LaSD, ESBO, and CaSt₂ can provide outstanding improvement in the long-term thermal stability of PVC. When the ratio of LaSD/ESBO/CaSt₂ is 1.8/0.6/0.6, its thermal stability time is 2193 s which is the best state for stabilizing PVC. Furthermore, comparing the reaction energy (Ea) and the variations in the conjugate double bond concentration in PVC samples, the order of thermal stability of PVC was PVC/LaSD/ESBO/CaSt₂ > PVC/LaSD/ESBO > PVC/LaSD. The thermal stability mechanism of LaSD on PVC was studied by the AgCl precipitation method and FTIR spectrum. The results showed that the action of LaSD on PVC was achieved through replacing unstable chlorine atoms and absorbing hydrogen chloride.",Fabrication of Ultrafine PPS Fibers with High Strength and Tenacity via Melt Electrospinning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960514,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Electrospinning (e-spinning) is an emerging technique to prepare ultrafine fibers. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is a high-performance resin which does not dissolve in any solvent at room temperature. Commercial PPS fibers are produced mainly by meltblown or spunbonded process to give fibers ~20 μm in diameter. In this research, an in-house designed melt electrospinning device was used to fabricate ultrafine PPS fibers, and the e-spinning operation conducted under inert gas to keep PPS fibers from oxidizing. Under the optimum e-spinning conditions (3 mm of nozzle diameter, 30 kV of electrostatic voltage, and 9.5 cm of tip-to-collector distance), the as-spun fibers were less than 8.0 μm in diameter. After characterization, the resultant PPS fibers showed uniform diameter and structural stability. Compared with commercial PPS staple fibers, the obtained fibers had a cold crystallization peak and 10 times higher storage modulus, thereby offering better tensile tenacity and more than 400% elongation at break.",Toughening of Epoxy Resin: The Effect of Water Jet Milling on Worn Tire Rubber Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960513,Polymers,2019 04 30,"In this work a cycloaliphatic amine-cured epoxy (EP) resin was modified by micron-scale rubber particles (RP). Nominal RP, in sizes of 200 and 600 µm respectively, were produced using worn truck tires and ultra-high-pressure water jet cutting. The RP were dispersed into the EP resin using different mixing techniques (mechanical, magnetic, and ultrasonic stirring) prior to the introduction of the amine hardener. The dispersion of the RP was studied using optical light microscopy. A longer mixing time reduced the mean size of the particles in the EP compounds. Static (tensile and flexural), dynamic (unnotched Charpy impact), and fracture mechanical (fracture toughness and strain-energy release rate) properties were determined. The incorporation of the RP decreased the stiffness and strength values of the modified EPs. In contrast, the irregular and rough surface of the RP resulted in improved toughness. The fracture toughness and strain-energy release rate were enhanced up to 18% owing to the incorporation of 1% by weight (wt%) RP. This was traced to the effects of crack pinning and crack deflection. Considerably higher improvement (i.e., up to 130%) was found for the unnotched Charpy impact energy. This was attributed to multiple cracking associated with RP-bridging prior to final fracture.",Thermal and Mechanical Analysis of Polyethylene Homo-Composites Processed by Rotational Molding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960512,Polymers,2019 05 04,"This work is aimed at studying the suitability of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers for the production of polyethylene homo-composites processed by rotational molding. Initially pre-impregnated bars were produced by co-extrusion and compression molding of UHMWPE fibers and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). A preliminary screening of different processing routes for the production of homo-composite reinforcing bars was performed, highlighting the relevance of fiber impregnation and crystalline structure on the mechanical properties. A combination of co-extrusion and compression molding was found to optimize the mechanical properties of the reinforcing bars, which were incorporated in the LLDPE matrix during a standard rotational molding process. Apart from fiber placement and an increase in processing time, processing of homo-composites did not require any modification of the existing production procedures. Plate bending tests performed on rotational molded homo-composites showed a modulus increase to a value three times higher than that of neat LLDPE. This increase was obtained by the addition of 4% of UHWMPE fibers and a negligible increase of the weight of the component. Dart impact tests also showed an increased toughness compared to neat LLPDE.",Preparation of Butadiene-Isoprene Copolymer with High Vinyl Contents by Al(OPhCH₃)(i-Bu)₂/MoO₂Cl₂∙TNPP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960511,Polymers,2019 05 05,"In this study, a butadiene-isoprene coordination polymerization was initiated by a binary molybdenum (Mo)-based catalytic system consisting of modified MoO₂Cl₂ as the primary catalyst, triethyl aluminum substituted by m-cresol as the co-catalyst and tris(nonyl phenyl) phosphate (TNPP) as the ligand. The effects of the amount of catalyst and type of co-catalyst were investigated in detail. Experimental results indicated that when the butadiene-isoprene coordination polymerization was initiated by the binary Mo-based catalytic system, the monomer conversion could reach 90%. The resulting butadiene units were primarily based on 1,2-structures, and the reactivity ratios of butadiene and isoprene were 1.13 and 0.31, respectively. The reaction in the catalytic system was attributed to the non-ideal and non-constant ratio copolymerization. When the addition of isoprene monomers was relatively low, the isoprene units on the butadiene-isoprene copolymers were primarily based on the 1,2- and 3,4-structures. Moreover, the orientation of active centers to 1,2- and 3,4-structures gradually decreased with an increase in the addition of isoprene monomers, which resulted in the generation of high vinyl butadiene-isoprene copolymers."

A key structural feature in ring polymer melts is topological constraints which allow rings to assume a threading configuration in the melt phase. In this work, we constructed a lattice model under the assumption of asymmetric diffusivity between two threading rings, and investigated a link between the structural correlation and its dynamic behavior via Monte Carlo simulations. We discovered that the hierarchical threading configurations render the whole system to exhibit abnormally slow dynamics. By analyzing statistical distributions of timescales of threading configurations, we found that the decoupling between internal structure relaxation and diffusion is crucial to understand the threading effects on the dynamics of a ring melt. In particular, in the limit of small but threaded rings, scaling exponents of the diffusion coefficient D and timescale τ diff with respect to the degree of polymerization N agree well with that of the annealed tree model as well as our mean-field analysis. As N increases, however, the ring diffusion abruptly slows down to the glassy behavior, which is supported by a breakdown of the Stokes⁻Einstein relation.",Anchor Effect in Polymerization Kinetics: Case of Monofunctionalized POSS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960499,Polymers,2019 05 05,"The effect of the anchoring group on the detailed polymerization kinetics was investigated using monomethacryloxy-heptaisobutyl POSS (1M-POSS). This compound was copolymerized with lauryl methacrylate (LM) as the base monomer, at various molar ratios. The process was initiated photochemically. The polymerization kinetics were followed by photo-DSC and photorheology while the polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For comparison, a methacrylate containing the branched siloxy-silane group (TSM) was also studied. It was found that the modifiers with a bulky substituent have a dual effect on the termination process: (i) At low concentrations, they increase the molecular mobility by increasing the free volume fraction, which leads to an acceleration of the termination and slows the polymerization; while (ii) at higher concentrations, they retard molecular motions due to the ""anchor effect"" that suppresses the termination, leading to acceleration of the polymerization. The anchor effect can also be considered from a different point of view: The possibility of anchoring a monomer with a long substituent (LM) around the POSS cage, which can further enhance propagation. These conclusions were derived based on kinetic results, determination of polymerization rate coefficients, and copolymer analysis.",Supramolecular Cyclodextrin-Based Hydrogels for Controlled Gene Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960498,Polymers,2019 05 05,Controlled delivery of gene transfer vectors is a powerful strategy to enhance the temporal and spatial presentation of therapeutic agents in a defined target. Hydrogels are adapted biomaterials for gene delivery capable of acting as a localized depot of genes while maintaining the long term local availability of DNA vectors at a specific location. Supramolecular hydrogels based on cyclodextrins (CDs) have attracted considerable attention as potential biomaterials in a broad range of drug delivery applications. Their unique characteristics of thixotropicity and low cytotoxicity due to their production under mild conditions make them potential candidates to form injectable delivery systems. This work aims to provide an overview of the use of CD-based polypseudorotaxane hydrogels as controlled gene delivery systems for different applications in regenerative medicine.,"Sorption of Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) Ions in an Aqueous Solution on the PVC-Acetylacetone Composites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960497,Polymers,2019 04 30,"The possibility of removing Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) ions by sorption on new PVC-based composite materials with different contents of acetylacetone (acac) and porophor was investigated. Composites were characterized using a scanning electron microscope and by infrared spectral analysis (FTIR). Sorption tests were conducted at 20 °C. It has been shown that the equilibrium is established in about 4 h. The reduction in ion concentration in the solution depended on the content of both acac and porophor in the composite. The maximal reduction in ion concentration ranged from 8% to 91%, 10⁻85% and 6⁻50% for Cu(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II) ions, respectively, depending on the composite composition. The best results were obtained for the composite containing 30% w/w of acac and 10% of porophor. For this composite, the sorption capacity after 4 h sorption for Zn(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions was 26.65, 25.40, and 49.68 mg/g, respectively.

Herein, we grafted poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) into the bile acid-derived three-armed macroinitiator CA-(PCL)₃, resulting in the amphiphilic block copolymers CA-(PCL-b-PDEAEMA-b-PPEGMA)₃. These pH-responsive three-armed block copolymers self-assembled into micelles in aqueous solution and PTX was encapsulated into the micellar core to form PTX-loaded micelles with a drug loading of 29.92 wt %.

Thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction patterns of the Mclay revealed that cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide successfully inserted into the interlayers of the clay. Scanning electron microscope images of the cross sections showed that the Mclay was well-dispersed in the nylon 66 matrix. The effects of clay on the mechanical, rheological, and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using an Instron 5969 machine, a capillary rheometer, and a differential scanning calorimeter. The results indicated that the incorporation of a very small amount of Mclay considerably decreased the shear viscosity of the nanocomposites and increased the melt index, acting as a viscosity reducer. More importantly, the mechanical properties and spinnability of the nylon 66/Mclay nanocomposites were not affected by the viscosity reducer.",Construction of Efficient Platform Escherichia coli Strains for Polyhydroxyalkanoate Production by Engineering Branched Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960493,Polymers,2019 04 30,"Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a potential substitute for petroleum-based plastics and can be produced by many microorganisms, including recombinant Escherichia coli. For efficient conversion of substrates and maximum PHA production, we performed multiple engineering of branched pathways in E. coli. We deleted four genes (pflb, ldhA, adhE, and fnr), which contributed to the formation of byproducts, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and overexpressed pntAB, which catalyzes the interconversion of NADH and NADPH. The constructed strain, HR002, showed accumulation of acetyl-CoA and decreased levels of byproducts, resulting in dramatic increases in cell growth and PHA content.

But high brittleness, especially at low temperatures, limits the use of iPP. The presence of transcrystallization of iPP makes it possible for fiber-reinforced iPP composites with higher strength. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a kind of cellulose with great potential to be used as a new filler to reinforce iPP due to its high crystallinity, biodegradability and efficient mechanical properties. In this study, the iPP/BC hamburger composite was prepared by a simple hot press and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used to improve the interface compatibility of iPP and BC. The polarizing microscope (POM) photograph shows that BC successfully induces the transcrystallization of iPP. The differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) date proves that the addition of BC could improve the thermal properties and crystallization rate of the composite. Especially, this change is more obvious of the iPP/MAPP/BC. The mechanical properties of the iPP/BC composites were greatly increased. This DSC date is higher than BC; we used BC particles to enhance the iPP in our previous research. The scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis intuitively shows that the interface of the iPP/MAPP/BC is more smooth and flat than the iPP/BC. The fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the iPP/BC hamburger composites was shown that a new C=O group vibration appeared at 1743 cm-1, which indicated that the hydrogen bond structure of BC molecules was weakened and some hydroxyl groups were substituted after modification which can increase the lipophilicity of BC. These results indicated that the BC fiber can easily induce the transcrystallization of iPP, which has excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, the addition of MAPP contributes greatly to the interface compatibility of iPP and BC.",Studies on Chemical IR Images of Poly(hydroxybutyrate⁻co⁻hydroxyhexanoate)/Poly(ethylene glycol) Blends and Two-Dimensional Correlation Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960491,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Biodegradable poly-[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoates] (PHBHx) have been widely studied for their applications in potentially replacing petroleum-based thermoplastics. In this study, the effect of the high molecular weight (Mn = 3400) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) blended in the films of PHBHx with different ratios of PEG was investigated using chemical FTIR imaging. Chemical IR images and FTIR spectra measured with increasing temperature revealed that PEG plays an important role in changing the kinetics of PHBHx crystallization. In addition, two-dimensional correlation spectra clearly showed that thermal properties of PHBHx/PEG blend film changed when the blending ratio of PHBHx/PEG were 60/40 and 50/50. Consequently, PEG leads to changes in the thermal behavior of PHBHx copolymers."

Relaxation of entangled symmetric star polymers proceeds via arm-retraction and constraint release (CR). In this work, we investigate arm-retraction dynamics in the framework of a single-chain slip-spring model without CR effect where entanglements are treated as binary contacts, conveniently modeled as virtual ""slip-links"", each involving two neighboring strands. The model systems are analogous to isolated star polymers confined in a permanent network or a melt of very long linear polymers. We find that the distributions of the effective primitive path lengths are Gaussian, from which the entanglement molecular weight N e , a key tube theory parameter, can be extracted. The procured N e value is in good agreement with that obtained from mapping the middle monomer mean-square displacements of entangled linear chains in slip-spring model to the tube model prediction. Furthermore, the mean first-passage (FP) times of destruction of original tube segments by the retracting arm end are collected in simulations and examined quantitatively using a theory recently developed in our group for describing FP problems of one-dimensional Rouse chains with improbable extensions. The asymptotic values of N e as obtained from the static (primitive path length) and dynamical (FP time) analysis are consistent with each other. Additionally, we manage to determine the tube survival function of star arms μ ( t ) , or equivalently arm end-to-end vector relaxation function ϕ ( t ) , through the mean FP time spectrum τ ( s ) of the tube segments after careful consideration of the inner-most entanglements, which shows reasonably good agreement with experimental data on dielectric relaxation.",Spectral Properties of PMMA Films Doped by Perylene Dyestuffs for Photoselective Greenhouse Cladding Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960478,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Luminescent polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) films were prepared by the solvent-casting technique from polymer solution doped with different concentrations of red perylene dyestuffs (KREMER 94720 and KREMER 94739).

The optimum dye concentration of photoselective PMMA films was determined by the fluorescence spectroscopy measurements and showed the best emission properties for the doping concentration 10-3 wt % of the investigated dyes.

To provide some context, we begin with a brief review of basic concepts in shockwave physics, including features particular to transitions (chemical reaction or phase transition) entailing an abrupt reduction in volume. We then discuss chemical formulations and synthesis, as well as experimental platforms used to interrogate polymers under shock loading. A high-level summary of equations of state for polymers and their decomposition products is provided, and their application illustrated. We then present results including temperatures and product compositions, thresholds for reaction, wave profiles, and some peculiarities of traditional modeling approaches.

In this effort, we proposed a novel strategy to engineer a multi-ionic network into a covalently cross-linked 1,2-polybutadiene (1,2-PB) facilitated by in-situ intercalated organic montmorillonite (OMMT) without phase separation. XRD, SEM, and TEM analysis were carried out to characterize the microstructure of the resulting polymers. Crosslinking density, dielectric performance, and cyclic tensile tests were used to demonstrate the interaction of zinc methacrylate (ZDMA) and OMMT. The dynamic nature of ionic bonds allowed it to rupture and reform to dissipate energy efficiently. Stretching orientation brought parallelism between polymer chains and OMMT layers which was beneficial for the reconstruction of the ionic network, ultimately resulting in high strength and a low stress relaxation rate.

In the current work, chitosan with or without bacterial cellulose was cross-linked with borate, tripolyphosphate, or the mixture of borate and tripolyphosphate, and the composite films were obtained by a casting of dispersion. Mechanical measurements indicated that different modes of cross-linking led to varying degrees of film strength and elongation increases, while the films treated with the borate and tripolyphosphate mixture showed the best performance. Meanwhile, changes in the fractured sectional images showed a densified texture induced by cross-linkers, especially for the borate and tripolyphosphate mixture. Measurements of Fourier transform infrared showed the enhanced interaction between the matrix polymers treated by borate, confirmed by a slight increase in the glass transitional temperature and a higher surface hydrophobicity. However, the reduced antimicrobial efficiency of composite films against E. coli, B. cinerea, and S. cerevisiae was obtained in cross-linked films compared with chitosan/bacterial cellulose films, indicating that the impact on the antimicrobial function of chitosan is a noteworthy issue for cross-linking.",Preparation and Characterization of Transparent Polyimide⁻Silica Composite Films Using Polyimide with Carboxylic Acid Groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960474,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Polyimide (PI) composite films with thicknesses of approximately 100 µm were prepared via a sol⁻gel reaction of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) with poly(amic acid) (PAA) composite solutions using a thermal imidization process.

Hence, the knowledge of their radical copolymerization kinetic coefficients is vital for both process and recipe improvements. The pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) technique is paired with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide kinetic coefficients for the copolymerization of HEMA with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in various solvents. The choice of solvent has a significant impact on both copolymer composition and on the composition-averaged propagation rate coefficient (kp,cop). Compared to the bulk system, both n-butanol and dimethylformamide reduce the relative reactivity of HEMA during copolymerization, while xylene as a solvent enhances HEMA reactivity. The magnitude of the solvent effect varies with monomer concentration, as shown by a systematic study of monomer/solvent mixtures containing 50 vol%, 20 vol%, and 10 vol% monomer.

In the majority of studies, when blends with different compositions are electrospun, the process variables such as voltage or flow rate are fixed independently of the composition and consequently the quality of the fibers is not optimized in all of the range studied. In the present work, using the design of experiments methodology, flow rate and voltage required to obtain a stable process were evaluated as responses in addition to the fiber diameter and shape memory properties. The results showed that the solution concentration and amount of PCL played an important role in the voltage and flow rate. For the shape memory properties excellent values were achieved and no composition dependence was observed. In the case of fiber diameter, similar results to previous works were observed.",Solubility Enhancement of Atrazine by Complexation with Cyclosophoraose Isolated from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii TA-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960458,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii TA-1, a kind of soil bacteria, produces cyclosophoraoses (Cys). Cyclosophoraoses contain various ring sizes with degrees of polymerization ranging from 17 to 23. Atrazine is a hardly-soluble herbicide that contaminates soil and drinking water, and remains in soil for a long time. To remove this insoluble contaminant from aqueous solutions, we have enhanced the solubility of atrazine by complexation with Cys. The complex formation of Cys and atrazine was confirmed using ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), rotating frame nuclear overhauser spectroscopy (ROESY), and molecular modeling studies. The aqueous solubility of atrazine was enhanced 3.69-fold according to the added concentrations (20 mM) of Cys, compared to the 1.78-fold enhancements by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). Cyclosophoraoses as an excellent solubility enhancer with long glucose chains that can effectively capture insoluble materials showed a potential application of microbial polysaccharides in the removal of hazardous hardly-soluble materials from aqueous solutions in the fields of biological and environmental industry.",Isothermal Crystallization Kinetics Study of Fully Aliphatic PA6 Copolyamides: Effect of Novel Long-Chain Polyamide Salt as a Comonomer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960456,Polymers,2019 05 05,"N¹, N⁶-bis (4-aminobutyl) adipamide (BABA) diamine and sebacic acid (SA), also called BABA/SA polyamide salt, were used in a typical melt polymerization processes of polyamide 6 (PA6) to form a series of PA6-BABA/SA copolyamides. The effects of BABA/SA on the isothermal crystallization kinetics of PA6-BABA/SA were studied for the first time. An isothermal crystallization analysis demonstrates that the PA6-BABA/SA matrix provided a higher crystallization rate and shorter half-crystallization time than virgin PA6 did. The degree of crystallization of the PA6-BABA/SA30 matrix was also the lowest among all of the samples considered herein. This result is attributed to the high nucleation efficacy of a small amount of BABA/SA in the crystallization of PA6. Values of the Avrami exponent (n) from 1.84 to 3.91 were observed for all of the polyamide samples, suggesting that the crystallization was involved via a two- to three-dimensional growth mechanism. These findings deepen our understanding of the structure⁻property relationship of PA6-BABA/SA copolyamides, favoring their practical application.",The Influence of bFGF on the Fabrication of Microencapsulated Cartilage Cells under Different Shaking Modes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960455,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Cell encapsulation in hydrogels has been extensively used in cytotherapy, regenerative medicine, 3D cell culture, and tissue engineering. Herein, we fabricated microencapsulated cells through microcapsules loaded with C5.18 chondrocytes alginate/chitosan prepared by a high-voltage electrostatic method. Under optimized conditions, microencapsulated cells presented uniform size distribution, good sphericity, and a smooth surface with different cell densities. The particle size distribution was determined at 150⁻280 μm, with an average particle diameter of 220 μm. The microencapsulated cells were cultured under static, shaking, and 3D micro-gravity conditions with or without bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) treatment. The quantified detection (cell proliferation detection and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)/type II collagen (Col-II)) content was respectively determined by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) and dimethylmethylene blue (DMB)/Col-II secretion determination) and qualitative detection (acridine orange/ethidium bromide, hematoxylin-eosin, alcian blue, safranin-O, and immunohistochemistry staining) of these microencapsulated cells were evaluated. Results showed that microencapsulated C5.18 cells under three-dimensional microgravity conditions promoted cells to form large cell aggregates within 20 days by using bFGF, which provided the possibility for cartilage tissue constructs in vitro. It could be found from the cell viability (cell proliferation) and synthesis (content of GAG and Col-II) results that microencapsulated cells had a better cell proliferation under 3D micro-gravity conditions using bFGF than under 2D conditions (including static and shaking conditions). We anticipate that these results will be a benefit for the design and construction of cartilage regeneration in future tissue engineering applications.",Molecular Dynamics Study on the Deformation Behaviors of Nanostructures in the Demolding Process of Micro-Injection Molding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960454,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Polymer parts with nanostructures have broad applications, possessing excellent optical, electrochemical, biological, and other functions. Injection molding technology is one of the main methods for mass production of polymer parts with various shapes and sizes. The demolding process is vital to the replication quality of molded parts with nanostructures. For this study, molecular dynamics simulations of polypropylene (PP), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and cycloolefin copolymer (COC) were conducted for the demolding process. The average velocity, density distribution, adhesion energy, and demolding resistance were introduced to analyze the deformation behaviors of polymer nanostructure from a nickel nano-cavity with an aspect ratio of 2:1. The shoulders of nanostructures were firstly separated from the nickel mold insert in the simulation. Under the external demolding force of 0.07 nN, PP and PMMA could be successfully demolded with some deformations, while COC could not be completely demolded due to the greater adhesion energy between COC and Ni. It was found that the maximum adhesion energy occurred in the separation process between the shoulder of the nanostructure and Ni and the huge adhesion energy was the main cause of demolding defects. The velocity difference of the whole polymer layer and polymer nanostructure was further analyzed to explain the nanostructure deformation. In order to improve the quality of demolding, the external force applied on polymers should be properly increased.",Organic Acids of the Microbiological Post-Culture Medium as Substrates to be Used for Starch Modification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960453,Polymers,2019 05 05,"This study aimed to identify the feasibility of producing highly-substituted starch esters via thermal modification of starch using a post-culture medium of Yarrowia lipolitica yeast. This manuscript describes a successful attempt at potato starch modification with a post-culture medium of Yarrowia lipolitica yeast with different concentrations of organic acids. Starch preparations produced by roasting (130 °C) and these produced by starch reaction with a synthetic acid mixture were compared in terms of the types and number of acid residues esterified with starch. The effectiveness of starch esterification was found to depend on medium composition and to be higher upon the use of a synthetic acid mixture. In addition, a higher reactivity with starch was demonstrated for citric acid than for α-ketoglutaric acid. The highly-substituted starch esters formed as a result of potato starch modification with post-culture medium were characterized by decreased values of thermal parameters of pasting characteristics, determined with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and by compromised resistance to amylolysis. The intensity of these changes increased along with an increasing total percentage of starch ester substitution.",Hexagonal and Square Patterned Silver Nanowires/PEDOT:PSS Composite Grids by Screen Printing for Uniformly Transparent Heaters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960452,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Transparent conductive films with hexagonal and square patterns were fabricated on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates by screen printing technology utilizing a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and silver nanowire (Ag NWs) composite ink. The printing parameters-mesh number, printing layer, mass ratio of PEDOT:PSS to Ag NWs and pattern shape-have a significant influence on the photoelectric properties of the composite films. The screen mesh with a mesh number of 200 possesses a suitable mesh size of 74 µm for printing clear and integrated grids with high transparency. With an increase in the printing layer and a decrease in the mass ratio of PEDOT:PSS to Ag NWs, the transmittance and resistance of the printed grids both decreased. When the printing layer is 1, the transmittance and resistance are 85.6% and 2.23 kΩ for the hexagonal grid and 77.3% and 8.78 kΩ for the square grid, indicating that the more compact arrangement of square grids reduces the transmittance, and the greater number of connections of the square grid increases the resistance. Therefore, it is believed that improved photoelectric properties of transparent electrodes could be obtained by designing a printing pattern with optimized printing parameters. Additionally, the Ag NWs/PEDOT:PSS composite films with hexagonal and square patterns exhibit high transparency and good uniformity, suggesting promising applications in large-area and uniform heaters.",Studying a Flexible Polyurethane Elastomer with Improved Impact-Resistant Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960451,Polymers,2019 04 30,"A flexible polyurethane elastomer (PUE) is studied, and the improved impact-resistant performance is revealed. Compressive stress⁻strain curves over a wide loading rate range were derived. Under static loading, the rubbery-like characteristics are demonstrated, which are flexible and hyperelastic, to process a large strain of about 60% followed by full recovery upon unloading. Under high-rate loadingcompared with the mechanical data of polyurethane elastomer (PUE) and polyurea (PUA) materials in the literature. Orderly parallel deformation bands were formed from carrying a large strain. The fibrils were found between deformation bands for enhancing the yield/plateau stress. A considerable plastic zone ahead of propagating crack with numerous crazes and microcracks was produced for realizing the dynamic strain energy absorption.

The slip-spring model captures the dynamics up to the formation of a 'kinked' or folded state, while the kink dynamics simulation tracks the dynamics from that point forward to complete extension. We show that a single-chain slip-spring model using affine motion of the slip-spring anchor points produces unrealistically high tension near the center of the chain once the Hencky strain exceeds around unity or so, exceeding the maximum tension that a chain entangled with a second chain is able to support. This unrealistic tension is alleviated by pairing the slip links on one chain with those on a second chain, and allowing some of the large tension on one of the two to be transferred to the second chain, producing non-affine motion of each. This explicit pairing of entanglements mimics the entanglement pairing also used in the EKD model, and allows the slip spring simulations to be carried out to strains high enough for the EKD model to become valid. We show that results nearly equivalent to those from paired chains are obtained in a single-chain slip-spring simulation by simply specifying that the tension in a slip spring cannot exceed the theoretical maximum value of ζ ' ϵ ˙ L 2 / 8 where ζ ' , ϵ ˙ and L are the friction per unit length, strain rate and contour length of the chain, respectively. The effects of constraint release (CR) and regeneration of entanglements is also studied and found to have little effect on the chain statistics up to the formation of the kinked state. The resulting hybrid model provides a fast, simple, simulation method to study the response of high molecular weight ( M w > 1 &nbsp; Mkg / mol ) polymers in fast flows ( W i R ≫ 1 ), where conventional simulation techniques are less applicable due to computational cost.","Isolation, Characterization and Structural Elucidation of Polybutylene Terephthalate Cyclic Oligomers and Purity Assessment Using a ¹H qNMR Method.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960448,Polymers,2019 04 30,"The use of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) as a food contact material is increasing over the last years. Typical contaminations in the final PBT product include its cyclic oligomers, which are allowed as additives in food contact plastics according to Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011. Their investigation is currently limited by the lack of analytical standards and physical-chemical information. Therefore, four PBT cyclic oligomers have been isolated and purified from a PBT raw material with an automated preparative HPLC-DAD system. Comprehensive characterization of the compounds was performed using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) with high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The purity of each oligomer was assessed using a ¹H qNMR method and ranged from 96.1% to 97.0% for PBT tetramer and trimer respectively. The availability of pure and well characterized PBT cyclic oligomer standards will facilitate future studies of release from plastic food packaging materials."

It is well known that the crystallinity of polymer electrolytes strongly affects the ionic conductivity and its electrochemical performance. Nowadays, alternatives to PEO are actively researched in the battery community, showing higher ionic conductivity, electrochemical window, or working temperature range. In this work, we investigated polymer electrolytes based on aliphatic polyethers with a number of methylene units ranging from 2 to 12. Thus, the effect of the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfone) imide (LiTFSI) concentration on the crystallization behavior of the new aliphatic polyethers and their ionic conductivity was investigated. In all the cases, the degree of crystallinity and the overall crystallization rate of the polymers decreased drastically with 30 wt % LiTFSI addition. The salt acted as a low molecular diluent to the polyethers according to the expectation of the Flory⁻Huggins theory for polymer⁻diluent mixtures. By fitting our results to this theory, the value of the interaction energy density (B) between the polyether and the LiTFSI was calculated, and we show that the value of B must be small to obtain high ionic conductivity electrolytes.",Effect of Silk Fibroin on Cell Viability in Electrospun Scaffolds of Polyethylene Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960435,Polymers,2019 05 05,"In this study, a coating from electrospun silk fibroin was performed with the aim to modify the surface of breast implants. We evaluated the effect of fibroin on polymeric matrices of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) to enhance cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation of HaCaT human keratinocytes to enhance the healing process on breast prosthesis implantation. We electrospun six blends of fibroin and PEO at different concentrations. These scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. We obtained diverse network conformations at different combinations to examine the regulation of cell adhesion and proliferation by modifying the microstructure of the matrix to be applied as a potential scaffold for coating breast implants. The key contribution of this work is the solution it provides to enhance the healing process on prosthesis implantation considering that the use of these PEO⁻fibroin scaffolds reduced (p < 0.05) the amount of pyknotic nuclei. Therefore, viability of HaCaT human keratinocytes on PEO⁻fibroin matrices was significantly improved (p < 0.001). These findings provide a rational strategy to coat breast implants improving biocompatibility.",Comparison of Properties of PVA Nanocomposites Containing Reduced Graphene Oxide and Functionalized Graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960434,Polymers,2019 05 05,"The thermal properties, morphologies, oxygen barrier properties, and electrical conductivities of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hybrid films containing different nanofillers were compared. For the fabrication of the PVA hybrid films, we used reduced graphene oxide (RGO) synthesized from graphite or functionalized hexadecylamine-graphene sheets (HDA-GS) obtained from HDA and GS as a reinforcing filler. The properties of the PVA hybrid films fabricated by intercalating PVA and the fillers for different filler contents ranging from 3 to 10% w/w were then compared. The dispersions of the graphene fillers in the matrix polymers were examined using wide-angle X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, and the changes in their thermal properties were observed using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Moreover, we measured the oxygen permeability and electrical conductivity of the films to investigate their industrial applications. In addition, all the physical properties of the PVA composites obtained using the two nanofillers were compared.",Multifunctional Silicone Rubber Nanocomposites by Controlling the Structure and Morphology of Graphene Material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960433,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Multifunctional elastomer nanocomposites have been applied in several high-tech fields. The design of materials with tailored properties capable of tuning their performance is a topical challenge. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to modulate the mechanical and transport properties of silicone rubber nanocomposites by controlling the structure, chemical composition and morphology of the graphene material. Intrinsic graphene properties, such as remaining oxygen groups, specific surface area, and aspect ratio, among others, have a profound effect on the final properties of the nanocomposite. Thus, the thermal conductivity benefits from larger filler size and high aromatic restoration. Whereas mechanical properties and electrical conductivity require a proper balance between filler/polymer matrix interaction and a partial aromatic restoration.",Mechanically and Thermally Induced Degradation and Modification of Cereal Biopolymers during Grinding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960432,Polymers,2019 05 05,"It is presumed that structural and functional alterations of biopolymers, which occur during grinding, are caused by a mechanical modification of polymers. As a result, thermally induced changes of flours are neglected. In this study, the impact of thermo-mechanical stress (TMS), as occurring during general grinding procedures, was further differentiated into thermal stress (TS) and mechanical stress (MS). For TS, native wheat flour, as well as the purified polymers of wheat-starch and gluten-were heated without water addition up to 110 ∘ C. Isolated MS was applied in a temperature-controlled ultra-centrifugal grinder (UCG), whereby thermal and mechanical treatment (TMS) was simultaneously performed in a non-cooled UCG. TS starch (110 ∘ C) and reference starch did not show differences in starch modification degree (2.53 ± 0.24 g/100 g and 2.73 ± 0.15 g/100 g, AACC 76-31), gelatinization onset (52.44 ± 0.14 ∘ C and 52.73 ± 0.27 ∘ C, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) and hydration properties (68.9 ± 0.8% dm and 75.8 ± 3.0%, AACC 56-11), respectively. However, TS led to an elevated gelatinization onset and a rise of water absorption of flours (Z-kneader) affecting the processing of cereal-based dough. No differences were visible between MS and TMS up to 18,000 rpm regarding hydration properties (65.0 ± 2.0% dm and 66.5 ± 0.3% dm, respectively). Consequently, mechanical forces are the main factor controlling the structural modification and functional properties of flours during grinding.",Rheological Characterization of Next-Generation Ballistic Witness Materials for Body Armor Testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960431,Polymers,2019 04 30,"Roma Plastilina No. 1 (RP1), an artist modeling clay that has been used as a ballistic clay, is essential for evaluation and certification in standards-based ballistic resistance testing of body armor. It serves as a ballistic witness material (BWM) behind the armor, where the magnitude of the plastic deformation in the clay after a ballistic impact is the figure of merit (known as ""backface signature""). RP1 is known to exhibit complex thermomechanical behavior that requires temperature conditioning and frequent performance-based evaluations to verify that its deformation response satisfies requirements. A less complex BWM formulation that allows for room-temperature storage and use as well as a more consistent thermomechanical behavior than RP1 is desired, but a validation based only on ballistic performance would be extensive and expensive to accommodate the different ballistic threats. A framework of lab-scale metrologies for measuring the effects of strain, strain rate, and temperature dependence on mechanical properties are needed to guide BWM development. The current work deals with rheological characterization of a candidate BWM, i.e., silicone composite backing material (SCBM), to understand the fundamental structure⁻property relationships in comparison to those of RP1. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear frequency sweep experiments were performed at temperatures that ranged from 20 °C to 50 °C to map elastic and damping contributions in the linear elastic regime. Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments were conducted in the non-linear region and the material response was analyzed in the form of Lissajous curve representations with the values of perfect plastic dissipation ratio reported to identify the degree of plasticity. The results show that the SCBM exhibits dynamic properties that are similar in magnitude to those of temperature-conditioned RP1, but with minimal temperature sensitivity and weaker frequency dependence than RP1. Both SCBM and RP1 are identified as elastoviscoplastic materials, which is particularly important for accurate determination of backface signature in body armor evaluation. The mechanical properties of SCBM show some degree of aging and work history effects. The results from this work demonstrate that the rheological properties of SCBM, at small and large strains, are similar to RP1 with substantial improvements in BWM performance requirements in terms of temperature sensitivity and thixotropy.",A New Method of Plugging the Fracture to Enhance Oil Production for Fractured Oil Reservoir using Gel Particles and the HPAM/Cr3+ System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960430,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Due to the strong heterogeneity between the fracture and the matrix in fractured oil reservoirs, injected water is mainly moved forward along the fracture, which results in poor water flooding. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the water cut and increase oil production by using the conformance control technology. So far, gel particles and partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)/Cr3+ gel are the most common applications due to their better suitability and low price. However, either of the two alone can only reduce the conductivity of the fracture to a certain extent, which leads to a poor effect. Therefore, to efficiently plug the fracture to enhance oil recovery, a combination of gel particles and the HPAM/Cr3+ system is used by laboratory tests according to their respective advantages. The first step is that the gel particles can compactly and uniformly cover the entire fracture and then the fracture channel is transformed into the gel particles media. This process can enhance the oil recovery to 18.5%. The second step is that a suitable HPAM/Cr3+ system based on the permeability of the gel particles media is injected in the fractured core. Thus, the fracture can be completely plugged and the oil in the matrix of the fractured core can be displaced by water flooding. This process can enhance oil recovery to 10.5%. During the whole process, the oil recovery is increased to 29% by this method. The results show that this principle can provide a new method for the sustainable and efficient development of fractured oil reservoirs.",Time Resolved Polarised Grazing Incidence Neutron Scattering from Composite Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960429,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Neutron scattering experiments are a unique tool in material science due to their sensitivity to light elements and magnetic induction. However, for kinetic studies the low brilliance at existing sources poses challenges. In the case of periodic excitations these challenges can be overcome by binning the scattering signal according to the excitation state of the sample. To advance into this direction we have performed polarised and time resolved grazing incidence neutron scattering measurements on an aqueous solution of the polymer F127 mixed with magnetic nano-particles. Magnetic nano-composites like this provide magnetically tuneable properties of the polymer crystal as well as magnetic meta-crystals. Even though the grazing incidence small angle scattering and polarised signals are too weak to be evaluated at this stage we demonstrate that such experiments are feasible. Moreover, we show that the intensity of the 111 Bragg peak of the fcc micellar crystal depends on the actual shear rate, with the signal being maximised when the shear rate is lowest (and vice-versa).",Novel Chemical Cross-Linked Ionogel Based on Acrylate Terminated Hyperbranched Polymer with Superior Ionic Conductivity for High Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960428,Polymers,2019 05 05,"A new family of chemical cross-linked ionogel is successfully synthesized by photopolymerization of hyperbranched aliphatic polyester with acrylate terminal groups in an ionic liquid of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF₄). The microstructure, viscoelastic behavior, mechanical property thermal stability, and ionic conductivities of the ionogels are investigated systematically. The ionogels exhibit high mechanical strength (up to 1.6 MPa) and high mechanical stability even at temperatures up to 200 °C. It is found to be thermally stable up to 371.3 °C and electrochemically stable above 4.3 V. The obtained ionogels show superior ionic conductivity over a wide temperature range (from 1.2 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 20 °C up to 5.0 × 10-2 S cm-1 at 120 °C). Moreover, the Li/LiFePO₄ batteries based on ionogel electrolyte with LiBF₄ show a higher specific capacity of 153.1 mAhg-1 and retain 98.1% after 100 cycles, exhibiting very stable charge/discharge behavior with good cycle performance.

High photoluminescence efficiencies and large stimulated emission cross-sections coupled with wavelength tunability and low-cost manufacturing processes make conjugated polymers ideal laser gain materials. In recent years, conjugated polymer lasers have become an attractive research direction in the field of organic lasers and numerous breakthroughs based on conjugated polymer lasers have been made in the last decade. This paper summarizes the recent progress of the subject of laser processes employing conjugated polymers, with a focus on the photoluminescence principle and excitation radiation mechanism of conjugated polymers. Furthermore, the effect of conjugated polymer structures on the laser threshold is discussed. The most common polymer laser materials are also introduced in detail. Apart from photo-pumped conjugated polymer lasers, a direction for the future development of electro-pumped conjugated polymer lasers is proposed."

The photonic nanojet is a narrow and focused high-intensity light beam emitting from the shadow-side of microspheres with tunable effective length, thus enabling its applications in biosensing technology. In this paper, we numerically studied the photonic nanojets brought about from biocompatible hydrogel core-shell microspheres with different optical properties. It was found that the presence of the shell layer can significantly affect the characteristics of the photonic nanojets, such as the focal distance, intensity, effective length, and focal size. Generally speaking, the larger the core-shell microspheres, the longer the focal distance, the stronger the intensity, the longer the effective length, and the larger the focal size of the generated photonic nanojets are. The numerical simulations of the photonic nanojets from the biocompatible core-shell microspheres on a Klarite substrate, which is a classical surface-enhancing Raman scattering substrate, showed that the Raman signals in the case of adding the core-shell microspheres in the system can be further enhanced 23 times in water and 108 times in air as compared in the case in which no core-shell microspheres are present. Our study of using tunable photonic nanojets produced from the biocompatible hydrogel core-shell microspheres shows potential in future biosensing applications.",Digital Luminescence Patterning via Inkjet Printing of a Photoacid Catalysed Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Formulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960414,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Accurate positioning of luminescent materials at the microscale is essential for the further development of diverse application fields including optoelectronics, energy, biotechnology and anti-counterfeiting. In this respect, inkjet printing has recently attracted great interest due to its ability to precisely deposit with high throughput and no contact, functional materials on different types of substrates. Here, we present a novel photoacid catalysed organic-inorganic hybrid luminescent ink. The formulation, containing monomers bearing epoxy and silane functionalities, a photoacid generator and a small percentage of Rhodamine-B, shows good jetting properties and adequate wetting of the deposited droplets on the receiving substrates. Ultraviolet exposure of the deposited material triggers the cationic ring-opening polymerization reaction of the epoxy groups. Concomitantly, if atmospheric water is available, hydrolysis and condensation takes place, overall leading to a luminescent crosslinked hybrid organic-inorganic polymeric material obtained through a simple one-step curing process, without post baking steps. Advantageously, protection of the ink from actinic light delays the hydrolysis and condensation conferring long-term stability to the ink. Digital patterning leads to patterned emissive surfaces and elements with good adhesion to different substrates, mechanical and optical properties for the fabrication of optical and photonic elements and devices.",Preparation of Hierarchical Porous Carbon Aerogels by Microwave Assisted Sol-Gel Process for Supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960413,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Low-cost resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) organic aerogels were prepared by using resorcinol and formaldehyde as precursors, and sodium hydroxide as a catalyst through a single-mode microwave radiation-assisted sol-gel method and ambient temperature drying. Because of the ring focusing and power-max technology, the fabrication procedure of carbon aerogels (CAs) are much easier, faster, and cheaper than traditional methods. The RF aerogels were then pyrolysized at 900 °C, and the KOH activation process was used to further dredge micropores in the carbon aerogels. The CAs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and a series of electrochemical tests. The KOH activated carbon aerogels with 3D-nano-network structure exhibited a high specific surface area of 2230 m² g-1 with appropriate pore volumes of micro-, meso-, and macropores. The specific capacitance of CAs activated by KOH measured in a two-electrode cell was 170 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with excellent rate capability and cycle stability in 6 M KOH electrolyte.",Effects of Freeze⁻Thaw Thermal Cycles on the Mechanical Degradation of the Gas Diffusion Layer in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960412,Polymers,2019 04 30,"In this paper, the mechanical degradation of a commercial gas diffusion layer subjected to repeated freeze⁻thaw thermal cycles is studied. In a fuel cell, the mechanical assembly state directly affects the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Particularly, the gas diffusion layer repeatedly withstands the complex heat and humidity environmental conditions in which the temperature and humidity are always greatly changed. Studying the three-dimensional mechanical degradation of gas diffusion layers due to orthotropic properties is very useful in extending the lifetime and durability of fuel cells. To investigate this, we first established the standard freeze⁻thaw thermal cycle and studied the gas diffusion layer's mechanical degradation performance with up to 400 repeated freeze⁻thaw thermal cycles. Furthermore, different types of failure in the gas diffusion layer caused by the repeated thermal aging treatment were observed using a scanning electron microscope, to explain the change in the mechanical deterioration. As a result, the different thermal failure plays different roles in the explanation of the gas diffusion layer's mechanical degradation under different thermal cycles. In particular, the thermal failure that resulted from the first 100 thermal cycles has the greatest effect on the compressive and tensile performance, compared to the shear behavior.",Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells via Surface-Confined Silver Nanoparticles on Transparent Polyimide Substrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960411,Polymers,2019 05 05,"We report about a flexible substrate incorporating surface-confined silver nanoparticles on transparent polyimide (PI). The incorporated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), which possessed excellent adhesive strength with the PI substrate, induced localized surface plasmon resonance and light scattering effects by changing the particle size and interparticle distance to promote light harvesting in the perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the reduced sheet resistance was beneficial for the charge extraction and transportation in the devices when high-conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PH1000) was deposited on the Ag NP-confined PI serving as a flexible bottom electrode. A power conversion efficiency of 10.41% was obtained for the flexible perovskite solar cells based on a Ag NP-confined PI substrate (the particle size of the Ag NPs was 25 nm mixed with 40 nm), which was obviously enhanced in all parameters. Especially, a 61% improvement existed in the short-circuit current density compared to that based on the bare PI substrates. It indicates that the substrate would be a promising candidate for the development of flexible electronics.",Tetracarbonatodiruthenium Fragments and Lanthanide(III) Ions as Building Blocks to Construct 2D Coordination Polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960410,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Two-dimensional coordination polymers of [Pr(DMSO)₂(OH₂)₃][Ru₂(CO₃)₄(DMSO)(OH₂)]·5H₂O (Prα) and [Ln(OH₂)₅][Ru₂(CO₃)₄(DMSO)]·xH₂O (Ln = Sm (Smβ), Gd (Gdβ)) formulae have been obtained by reaction of the corresponding Ln(NO₃)₃·6H₂O dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and K₃[Ru₂(CO₃)₄]·4H₂O dissolved in water. Some DMSO molecules are coordinated to the metal atoms reducing the possibilities of connection between the [Ru₂(CO₃)₄]3- and Ln3+ building blocks giving rise to the formation of two-dimensional networks. The size of the Ln3+ ion and the synthetic method seem to have an important influence in the type of two-dimensional structure obtained. Slow diffusion of the reagents gives rise to Prα that forms a 2D net that is built by Ln3+ ions as triconnected nodes and two types of Ru₂5+ units as bi- and tetraconnected nodes with (2-c)(3-c)₂(4-c) stoichiometry (α structure). An analogous synthetic procedure gives Smβ and Gdβ that display a grid-like structure, (2-c)₂(4-c)₂, formed by biconnected Ln3+ ions and two types of tetraconnected Ru₂5+ fragments (β structure).

On the basis of preliminary finite element (FEM) analysis, the design takes advantage of a suitable core geometry, characterized by a variable spring-like ring. The compliance of probes can be finely set in a wide range to measure forces in the micronewton to nanonewton range. In particular, this is accomplished by properly resizing the ring geometry and/or exploiting the mixing ratio-based elastic properties of PDMS. Fabrication by the thermal imprint lithography method allows fast and accurate tuning of ring sizes and tailoring of the contact section to their targets. By only varying geometrical parameters, the stiffness ranges from 1080 mNm-1 to 50 mNm-1, but by changing the base-curing agent proportion of the elastomer from 10:1 to 30:1, the stiffness drops to 37 mNm-1. With these compliances, the proposed device will provide a new experimental tool for investigating force-dependent biological functions in sensory systems.",Sensitivity Enhancement of Acetone Gas Sensor using Polyethylene Glycol/Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Composite Sensing Film with Thermal Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960407,Polymers,2019 05 05,"There is a need to develop a chemiresistive gas sensor equipped with a thermostat over a wide area for the sensor, which can protect the sensor from the influence of ambient temperature due to the uniform temperature of the thermostat. In this paper, we demonstrated an acetone gas sensor based on a polyethylene glycol (PEG)/Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite film, which was equipped with a thermostat. The sensor was operated at modest working temperatures for sensor sensitivity enhancement. The optimum design of the polyimide-based thermostat with widely uniform thermal distribution was investigated in detail. It was found that the temperature uniformity of the thermostat was achieved using double spiral geometry. The experimental results of the sensor response showed that the PEG/MWCNTs composite film with a moderate working temperature revealed a higher sensitivity than that without thermal treatment. Moreover, the sensing mechanisms of the PEG/MWCNTs composite gas sensor to acetone vapor were studied as well.",The Structure and Properties of Polyacrylonitrile Nascent Composite Fibers with Grafted Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes Prepared by Wet Spinning Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960406,Polymers,2019 05 05,"Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) grafted amino-functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes (amino-MWCNTs) were synthesized by in situ polymerization under aqueous solvent. The grafted MWCNT/PAN nascent composite fibers were prepared by the wet spinning method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the amino-MWCNTs and PAN macromolecular chains had interfacial interactions and formed chemical bonds. The grafting content of the PAN polymer on the amino-MWCNTs was up to 73.2% by thermo gravimetric analysis. The incorporation of the grafted MWCNTs improved the degree of crystallization and crystal size of PAN nascent fibers, and changed the thermal properties during exothermic processing in an air atmosphere. Morphology analysis and testing of mechanical properties showed that the grafted MWCNT/PAN nascent composite fibers with a more uniform diameter distribution and larger diameter had higher tensile strength and tensile modulus than the control PAN nascent fibers."

Due to non-polar media only adsorbing on the surface of fiber, cellulosic fiber could not swell as a result of the non-polar media. However, because water molecules can diffuse into the non-crystalline region of the fiber, cellulosic fiber could swell by water which was dispersed or emulsified in a non-aqueous dyeing system. To study the diffusion mechanism of an aqueous solution in the siloxane non-aqueous dyeing system, siloxane non-aqueous media was first diffused to the cellulosic fiber because of its lower surface tension. The resulting aqueous solution took more time to diffuse the surface of the cellulosic fiber, because water molecules must penetrate the siloxane non-aqueous media film. Compared with the fluorescent intensity of the fiber surface, the siloxane film could be re-transferred to the dye bath under the emulsification of the surfactant and the mechanical force. Therefore, a longer diffusion time of the aqueous solution ensured the dyeing feasibility for cellulosic fiber in the non-aqueous dyeing system.",The Role of Physisorption and Chemisorption in the Oscillatory Adsorption of Organosilanes on Aluminium Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960394,Polymers,2019 05 05,"The effect of physisorbed and chemisorbed species on the time-dependent self-assembly mechanism of organosilane films has been investigated on aluminium oxide using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The role of physisorbed species was determined through their removal using a simple rinsing procedure while monitoring film substrate coverage. Removing physisorbed species from Propyldimethylmethoxysilane films, shown to follow a Langmuir-type adsorption profile, reduces the substrate coverage initially but quickly results in coverages equivalent to films that did not undergo a rinsing procedure. This indicates that all Propyldimethylmethoxysilane molecules are covalently bound to the substrate following 15 s of film growth. Removing physisorbed species from films, which have been shown to follow an oscillatory adsorption profile, Propyltrimethoxysilane and Propylmethyldimethoxysilane, reveal the persistence of these oscillations despite a reduction in silane substrate coverage. These results not only confirm the presence of two thermodynamically favourable phases in the condensation equilibrium reaction as physisorbed and chemisorbed species, but also indicate that the desorption of species during film growth involves both states of chemical binding.",Two-Step Separation of Chitin from Shrimp Shells Using Citric Acid and Deep Eutectic Solvents with the Assistance of Microwave.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960393,Polymers,2019 04 30,"In this research, a two-step extraction approach was developed for chitin preparation from shrimp shells by utilizing citric acids and deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which effectively removed minerals and proteins. In the first step, minerals of shrimp shells were removed by citric acid, and the demineralization efficiency reached more than 98%. In the second step, the removal of protein was carried out using deep eutectic solvents with the assistance of microwave, and the deproteinization efficiency was more than 88%. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the quality of DES-prepared chitin was comparable to that of traditional acid/alkali-prepared chitin. These results were realized without utilizing hazardous chemicals, which are detrimental to the environment. This research indicates that a DES-based preparation approach has the potential for application in the recovery of biopolymers from natural resources.",Effect of Post-Thermal Annealing on the Performance and Charge Photogeneration Dynamics of PffBT4T-2OD/PC71BM Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960392,Polymers,2019 05 05,"In this work, we studied influence of post thermal annealing on the performance and charge photogeneration processes of PffBT4T-2OD/PC71BM solar cells. As-prepared device exhibits a high-power conversion efficiency of 9.5%, much higher than that after thermal annealing. To understand this phenomenon, we studied charge photogeneration processes in these solar cells by means of time resolved spectroscopy. We associate the degradation of solar cell performance with the reduction of exciton dissociation efficiency and with increased bimolecular recombination of photogenerated charges as a result of annealing. We correlate the generation of localized PffBT4T-2OD polarons observed via spectro-electrochemical measurements with enhancement of the bimolecular charge recombination of annealed solar cells.",Flame Retardancy Index for Thermoplastic Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960391,Polymers,2019 05 04,"Flame Retardancy Index, FRI, was defined as a simple yet universal dimensionless criterion born out of cone calorimetry data on thermoplastic composites and then put into practice for quantifying the flame retardancy performance of different polymer composites on a set of reliable data. Four types of thermoplastic composites filled with a wide variety of flame retardant additives were chosen for making comparative evaluations regardless of the type and loading level of the additive as well as the irradiance flux. The main features of cone calorimetry including peak of Heat Release Rate (pHRR), Total Heat Release (THR), and Time-To-Ignition (TTI) served to calculate a dimensionless measure that reflects an improvement in the flame retardancy of nominated thermoplastic composites with respect to the neat thermoplastic, quantitatively. A meaningful trend was observed among well-classified ranges of FRI quantities calculated for the studied dataset on thermoplastic composites by which ""Poor"", ""Good"", and ""Excellent"" flame retardancy performances were explicitly defined and exhibited on logarithmic scales of FRI axis.

This method comprises two steps, the first one being the melt compounding of PEO with a filler, able to physically crosslink the polymer and its pelletizing, and the second the pellets' swelling with an electroactive liquid phase. This method is an adaptation of the step described in previous publications of the preparation of thermoplastic electrolytes by a single melt compounding. In comparison to the single step extrusion methodology, this new method permits employing electroactive species that are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions. The two-step method can also be designed to produce controlled phase-segregated morphologies in the electrolyte, namely polymer-poor and polymer-rich phases, with the aim of increasing ionic conductivity over that of homogeneous electrolytes. An evaluation of the characteristics of the electrolytes prepared by single and two-step procedures is done by comparing membranes prepared by both methods using PEO as a polymeric scaffold and a solution of the room-temperature ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (EMI TFSI) and the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide lithium salt (Li TFSI) as liquid phase. The electrolytes prepared by both methods have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and optic microscopy profilometry, differential scanning calorimetry, self-creep experiments, and dielectric spectroscopy. In this way, the phase separation, rheology, and ionic conductivity are studied and compared. It is striking how the electrolytes prepared with this new method maintain their solid-like behavior even at 90 °C. Compared to the single step method, the two-step method produces electrolytes with a phase-separated morphology, which results in higher ionic conductivity.",Experimentation of the Bilinear Elastic Behavior of Plain-Woven GFRP Composite with Embedded SMA Wires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960389,Polymers,2019 05 04,"In this paper, a plain-woven glass-fabric-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite with embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) wires is investigated by means of experiments. The vacuum-assisted resin injection (VARI) method is utilized to fabricate the composite specimens. Quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests are then carried out to evaluate the influence of SMA reinforcement on the stress⁻strain behavior of the composite. Only the elastic behavior of the composite is considered in the present study. The tensile strain in all the experiments is kept below 2.5% to avoid debonding of the SMA-resin interface, which would lead to failure of the composite. Stress⁻strain curves are obtained and shown to present a bilinear behavior due to phase transformation taking place in the SMA wires beyond a certain stress threshold.",Environmentally Friendly Flexible Strain Sensor from Waste Cotton Fabrics and Natural Rubber Latex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960388,Polymers,2019 05 05,"A green approach was successfully developed to fabricate flexible sensors by utilizing carbonized waste cotton fabrics in combination with natural rubber latex. Waste cotton fabrics were firstly carbonized by heat treatment in the nitrogen atmosphere before they were combined with natural rubber latex using three methods, i.e., vacuum bagging, negative pressure adsorption and drop coating. After impregnation with natural rubber, the carbonized cotton maintained the fabric structure and showed good conductivity. More importantly, the electric resistance of the textile composites changed with the tensile strain. The cyclic stretching-releasing tests indicated that the prepared wearable flexible strain sensors were sensitive to strain and stable under cyclic loading. The flexible strain sensor also demonstrated the capability of monitoring human finger and arm motion.",Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Loaded onto Polymer-Inorganic Composite Materials and Their Regulated Catalytic Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960386,Polymers,2019 04 30,"We present a novel approach for the preparation of polymer-TiO₂ composite microgels. These microgels were prepared by the in situ hydrolysis and condensation of titanium tetrabutoxide (TBOT) in a mixed ethanol/acetonitrile solvent system, using poly(styrene-co-N-isopropylacrylamide)/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (P(St-NIPAM/P(NIPAM-co-MAA)) as the core component. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were controllably loaded onto the polymer-TiO₂ composite microgels through the reduction of an ammoniacal silver solution in ethanol catalyzed by NaOH. The results showed that the P(St-NIPAM)/P(NIPAM-co-MAA)-TiO₂ (polymer-TiO₂) organic-inorganic composite microgels were less thermally sensitive than the polymer gels themselves, owing to rigid O⁻Ti⁻O chains introduced into the three-dimensional framework of the polymer microgels. The sizes of the AgNPs and their loading amount were controlled by adjusting the initial concentration of [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of the P(St-NIPAM)/P(NIPAM-co-MAA)-TiO₂/Ag (polymer-TiO₂/Ag) composite microgels can be tuned by changing the temperature of the environment. The catalytic activities of the polymer-TiO₂/Ag composite microgels were investigated in the NaBH₄ reduction of 4-nitrophenol. It was demonstrated that the organic-inorganic network chains of the polymer microgels not only favor the mass transfer of the reactant but can also modulate the catalytic activities of the AgNPs by tuning the temperature.",Study on the Changes of Structures and Properties of PAN Fibers during the Cyclic Reaction in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960385,Polymers,2019 05 04,"Thermal pre-oxidation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is a time-consuming and energy-consuming step in the production of PAN-based carbon fibers. In this paper, the effect of temperature on the structures and properties of PAN fibers cyclized in the supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO₂) medium was studied. The thermal behaviors of the PAN fibers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The cyclization reaction was sensitive to the heating temperature and gas atmosphere. The FT-IR results of the PAN fibers treated in the Sc-CO₂ confirmed that the degree of cyclization increased with the increase of the cyclization temperature. Compared with the PAN fibers treated in the air, the PAN fibers treated in the Sc-CO₂ showed a higher degree of cyclization even at the same temperature. These findings might be related to the osmotic action of Sc-CO₂ causing the fibers to be further arranged in a regular manner, which was favorable for the cyclization reaction. Moreover, as one kind of high diffusion and high heat transfer media, the heat release during the cyclization of PAN fibers could be quickly removed by Sc-CO₂, which achieved the progress of the rapid-entry cyclization reaction."

The copolymer of PEG-b-P4VP was used in the formation of core-shell micelles in water, in which the P4VP block serves as the core, while the PEG block forms the shell. In the micellar core, gold nanoparticle and metalloporphyrin were dispersed through the axial coordination. Structural and morphological characterizations of the complex micelle were carried out by transmission electron microscopy, laser light scatting, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Metalloporphyrin in the complex micelle exhibited excellent photostability by reducing the generation of the singlet oxygen. This strategy may provide a novel approach to design photocatalysts that have target applications in photocatalysis and solar cells.",Understanding the Effects of In-Service Temperature and Functional Fluid on the Ageing of Silicone Rubber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960372,Polymers,2019 05 05,"With an organic/inorganic hybrid nature, silicone elastomers are amongst the most versatile engineering materials, exploited in a wide range of applications either as end-products or in manufacturing processes. In many industrial machines, silicone components are exposed to in-service conditions, such as high or low temperatures, contact with functional fluids, mechanical loading, and deformations, which can adversely affect these components and reduce their lifespan, leading to machine failure in turn. The present study investigates the behaviour of a silicone component of a manufacturing equipment and the variations in the part's properties due to in-service conditions (temperature, exposure to heat transfer fluid, and mechanical deformation) to develop a monitoring tool. An experimental design was employed to study the main and the interaction effects of temperature (22 °C, 180 °C), medium (air, synthetic heat transfer fluid), and strain (0%, 200%) on the silicone component's properties. Results showed that while the chemistry of the component remains intact, its thermal and in particular mechanical properties are largely influenced by the in-service conditions. Consequently, leading to a physical rather than a chemical failure of the component and limiting its service life. Statistical analysis revealed that high temperature and the exposure to the heat transfer fluid have the most sever effects. Moreover, these two manufacturing parameters were found to have a significant interaction with one another, whose effect cannot not be neglected.",A Coupled Thermodynamic Model for Transport Properties of Thin Films during Physical Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960371,Polymers,2019 05 05,"A coupled diffusion model based on continuum thermodynamics is developed to quantitatively describe the transport properties of glassy thin films during physical aging. The coupled field equations are then embodied and applied to simulate the transport behaviors of O₂ and CO₂ within aging polymeric membranes to validate the model and demonstrate the coupling phenomenon, respectively. It is found that due to the introduction of the concentration gradient, the proposed direct calculating method on permeability can produce relatively better consistency with the experimental results for various film thicknesses. In addition, by assuming that the free volume induced by lattice contraction is renewed upon CO₂ exposure, the experimental permeability of O₂ within Matrimid® thin film after short-time exposure to CO₂ is well reproduced in this work. Remarkably, with the help of the validated straightforward permeability calculation method and free volume recovery mechanism, the permeability behavior of CO₂ is also well elucidated, with the results implying that the transport process of CO₂ and the variation of free volume are strongly coupled.",Synthesis and Physical Properties of Non-Crystalline Nylon 6 Containing Dimer Acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960370,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, a long carbon chain dimer acid is introduced into a nylon 6 structure and is copolymerized with different structural amines to produce amorphous nylon 6 by 4,4'-methylenebis(2-methylcyclohexylamine) (MMCA) in different copolymerization ratios. The effect of different structures and copolymerization ratios on the properties of nylon 6 is determined, along with the thermal properties, crystallinity, water absorption, dynamic mechanical properties, and optical properties. It is found that the melting point and the thermal cracking temperature Td10 of nylon 6 are respectively between 176 °C and 213 °C and 378 °C to 405 °C. The effect of introducing a bicyclohexane group containing a methyl side chain is greater than that of a meta-benzene ring, so COMM (synthesized by Caprolactam (C), dimer oleic acid (OA), and 4,4'-Methylenebis(2-methylcyclohexylamine) (MMCA)) has the lowest melting point, enthalpy, and crystallinity. As the copolymerization ratio increases, its thermal properties decrease. 10% is the lowest crystallinity. The amine structure containing a bicycloalkyl group has lower water absorption and a 10% copolymerization ratio gives the lowest water absorption. It contains the bicycloalkyl group, COM (synthesized by Caprolactam (C), dimer oleic acid (OA) and 4,4'-Methylenebis(cyclohexylamine) (MCA)), which has the highest loss modulus. The lowest loss modulus is noted for a copolymerization ratio of 7% and the value of tan δ increases as the copolymerization ratio increases. The introduction of nylon 6 with the bicycloalkyl groups, COMM and COM, significantly increases transparency. As the copolymerization ratio increases, the transparency increases and the haze decreases. The best optical properties are achieved for 10% copolymerization.",Emergence of Flexible White Organic Light-Emitting Diodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960368,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Flexible white organic light-emitting diodes (FWOLEDs) have considerable potential to meet the rapidly growing requirements of display and lighting commercialization. To achieve high-performance FWOLEDs, (i) the selection of effective flexible substrates, (ii) the use of transparent conducting electrodes, (iii) the introduction of efficient device architectures, and iv) the exploitation of advanced outcoupling techniques are necessary. In this review, recent state-of-the-art strategies to develop FWOLEDs have been summarized. Firstly, the fundamental concepts of FWOLEDs have been described. Then, the primary approaches to realize FWOLEDs have been introduced. Particularly, the effects of flexible substrates, conducting electrodes, device architectures, and outcoupling techniques in FWOLEDs have been comprehensively highlighted.

The transfer matrix method is used for optical modeling of an organic solar cell, which was inspired by the McGehee Group in Stanford University. The software simulation calculates the optimal thicknesses of the active layers to provide the best short circuit current (JSC) value. First, we show three designs of multi-junction polymer solar cells, which can absorb sunlight beyond the 1000 nm wavelengths. Then we present a novel high-efficiency hybrid (organic and inorganic) solar cell, which can absorb the sunlight with a wavelength beyond 2500 nm. Approximately 12% efficiency was obtained for the multi-junction polymer solar cell and 20% efficiency was obtained from every two-, three- and four-junction hybrid solar cell under 1 sun AM1.5 illumination.",Effect of Hydration in Corona Layer on Structural Change of Thermo-Responsive Polymer Micelles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960366,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effect of hydration in corona layer on temperature responsiveness of polymer micelles consisting of poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-block-poly(n-octadecyl acrylate) (PVP-b-PODA) was investigated. Small-angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering showed two-step shape change of PVP-b-PODA micelles around 45 and 65 °C with elevating temperature, although only one-step shape change was observed at 45 °C in cooling process. In the first step, shape of PVP-b-PODA micelles was changed from disk to ellipsoidal oblate at the melting temperature (Tm) of PODA, although similar micelles consisting of another amphiphilic block copolymers containing PODA simply changed from disk to sphere at the Tm with elevating temperature. PVP-b-PODA micelles changed to spherical shape above 65 °C. Two-dimensional (2D) ¹H-NMR showed the PVP chains were perfectly dehydrated above 65 °C. Therefore, it was suggested that the appearance of ellipsoidal shape between Tm of PODA and 65 °C was caused owing to shape memory effect of pseudo network of corona layer due to robust hydration of PVP chains.",Delayed Crosslinking Amphiphilic Polymer Gel System with Adjustable Gelation Time Based on Competitive Inclusion Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960365,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Delayed crosslinking polymer gel systems are widely utilized in deep profile control processes for water production control in oilfields. In this paper, a kind of delayed crosslinking amphiphilic polymer gel system with adjustable gelation time based on competitive inclusion was prepared and its delayed crosslinking gelling properties were studied. The amphiphilic polymer of P(acrylamide (AM)⁻sodium acrylate (NaA)⁻N-dodecylacrylamide (DDAM)) was synthesized and it showed much better salt resistance, temperature resistance, and shear resistance performance compared with hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). Phenol can be controlled released from the the cavity of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) ring in the presence of the hydrophobic group used as the competitive inclusion agent in the amphiphilic polymer backbone. Accordingly, the gelation time of the delayed crosslinking amphiphilic polymer gel system is closely related to release rate of the crosslinker from the the cavity of β-CD ring. This study screened an amphiphilic polymer with good salt resistance and temperature resistance performance, which can be used in high temperature and high salinity reservoirs, and provided a feasible way to control the gelation time of the polymer gel system by the competitive inclusion method.",Investigation of the Structure-Property Effect of Phosphorus-Containing Polysulfone on Decomposition and Flame Retardant Epoxy Resin Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960364,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The flame retardant modification of epoxy (EP) is of great signification for aerospace, automotive, marine, and energy industries. In this study, a series of EP composites containing different variations of phosphorus-containing polysulfone (with a phosphorus content of approximately 1.25 wt %) were obtained. The obtained EP/polysulfone composites had a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and high flame retardancy. The influence of phosphorus-containing compounds (ArPN₂, ArPO₂, ArOPN₂ and ArOPO₂) on the thermal properties and flame retardancy of EP/polysulfone composites was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a UL-94 vertical burning test, and cone calorimeter tests. The phosphorus-containing polysulfone enhanced the thermal stability of EP. The more stable porous char layer, less flammable gases, and a lower apparent activation energy at a high degree of conversion demonstrated the high gas inhibition effect of phosphorus-containing compounds. Moreover, the gas inhibition effect of polysulfone with a P⁻C bond was more efficient than the polysulfone with a P⁻O⁻C bond. The potential for optimizing flame retardancy while maintaining a high Tg is highlighted in this study. The flame-retardant EP/polysulfone composites with high thermal stability broaden the application field of epoxy.",Tablet of Ximenia Americana L.

This strategy represents a technological innovation that can be applied to improving the treatment of oral infections, such as oral candidiasis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a tablet of Ximenia americana L. from mucoadhesive polymers for use in the treatment of oral candidiasis. An X. americana extract (MIC of 125 μg·mL-1) was obtained by turbolysis at 50% of ethanol, a level that demonstrated activity against Candida albicans. Differential Thermal Analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy techniques allowed the choice of HPMC as a mucoadhesive agent, besides polyvinylpyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, and mannitol to integrate the formulation of X. americana. These excipients were granulated with an ethanolic solution 70% v/v at PVP 5%, and a mucoadhesive tablet was obtained by compression. Finally, mucoadhesive strength was evaluated, and the results demonstrated good mucoadhesive forces in mucin disk and pig buccal mucosa. Therefore, the study allowed a new alternative to be developed for the treatment of buccal candidiasis, one which overcomes the inconveniences of common treatments, costs little, and facilitates patients' adhesion."

Effective imaging methods for longitudinal studies are critical to evaluating the new bone formation and the fate of the scaffolds. Computed tomography (CT) is a prevailing technique employed to investigate hard tissue scaffolds; however, the CT signal becomes weak in mainly-water containing materials, which hinders the use of CT for hydrogels-based materials. Nevertheless, hydrogels such as gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) are widely used for tissue regeneration due to their optimal biological properties and their ability to induce extracellular matrix formation. To date, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been suggested as promising contrast agents, due to their high X-ray attenuation, biocompatibility, and low toxicity. In this study, the effects of different sizes and concentrations of AuNPs on the mechanical properties and the cytocompatibility of the bulk GelMA-AuNPs scaffolds were evaluated. Furthermore, the enhancement of CT contrast with the cytocompatible size and concentration of AuNPs were investigated. 3D printed GelMA and GelMA-AuNPs scaffolds were obtained and assessed for the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Lastly, 3D printed GelMA and GelMA-AuNPs scaffolds were scanned in a bone defect utilizing µCT as the proof of concept that the GelMA-AuNPs are good candidates for bone tissue engineering with enhanced visibility for µCT imaging.",New Alginate/PNIPAAm Matrices for Drug Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960350,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper deals with a comparative study on the interpolymeric complexes of alginate poly(N-isopropyl acryl amide (PNIPAAm) and corresponding graft copolymers with various compositions in respect to their toxicity, biocompatibility and in vitro and in vivo release of theophylline (THP). Loading of the various matrices with theophylline and characterization of loaded matrices was studied by near infrared spectroscopy⁻chemical imaging (NIR⁻CI) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was appreciated that THP loading is higher than 40% and the drug is relatively homogeneous distributed within all matrices because of some specific interactions between components of the system. All samples have been found to be non-toxic and biocompatible. It was established that graft copolymers having a good stability show a better drug carrier ability, a higher THP loading, a prolonged release (longer release duration for graft copolymers of 235.4⁻302.3 min than that for IPC 72/28 of 77.6 min, which means approximately four times slower release from the graft copolymer-based matrices than from the interpolymeric complex) and a good bioavailability. The highest values for THP loading (45%), prolonged release (302.3 min) and bioavailability (175%) were obtained for graft copolymer AgA-g-PNIPAAm 68. The drug release mechanism varies with composition and architecture of the matrix.",Study on Soy-Based Adhesives Enhanced by Phenol Formaldehyde Cross-Linker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960349,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To find the effects of cross-linker phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin on the performance of soy-based adhesives, the reaction between model compounds hydroxymethyl phenol (HPF) and glutamic acid were studied in this paper. HPF prepared in laboratory conditions showed higher content of hydroxymethyl groups than normal PF resin, which was proved by the results of Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C-NMR). The results of ESI-MS, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and 13C-NMR based on resultant products obtained from model compounds showed better water resistance of the soy protein-based adhesive modified by PF-based resin, which indicated the reaction between PF resin and soy protein. However, it seemed that the soy-based adhesive cross-linked by HPF with the maximum content of hydroxymethyl groups did not show the best water resistance.",Solution Blown Nylon 6 Nanofibrous Membrane as Scaffold for Nanofiltration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960348,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, a nylon 6 nanofibrous membrane was prepared via solution blowing technology and followed hot-press as scaffold for nanofiltration. The structure and properties of the hot-pressed nylon 6 nanofibrous membrane (HNM) were studied the effect of hot-pressing parameters and areal densities. Then an ultra-thin polyamide (PA) active layer was prepared by interfacial polymerization on HNM. The effects of nanofibrous scaffolds on the surface properties of ultra-thin nanofiltration membranes and their filtration performance were studied. Results showed that the nylon 6 nanofibers prepared at a concentration of 15 wt % had a good morphology and diameter distribution and the nanofibers were stacked more tightly and significantly reduced in diameter after hot pressing at 180 °C under the pressure of 15 MPa for 10 s. When the porous scaffold was prepared, HNM with an areal density of 9.4 and 14.1 g/m² has a better apparent structure, a smaller pore size, a higher porosity and a greater strength. At the same time, different areal densities of HNM have an important influence on the preparation and properties of nanofiltration membranes. With the increase of areal density, the uniformity of HNM increased while their surface roughness and pore size decreased, which is beneficial to the establishment of PA barrier layer. With areal density of 9.4 and 14.1 g/m², the as-prepared nanofiltration membrane has a smoother surface and more outstanding filtration performance. The pure water flux is 13.1 L m-2 h-1 and the filtration efficiencies for NaCl and Na₂SO₄ are 81.3% and 85.1%, respectively.",Prediction of Thermal Exposure and Mechanical Behavior of Epoxy Resin Using Artificial Neural Networks and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960347,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Thermal degradation detection of cured epoxy resins and composites is currently limited to severe thermal damage in practice. Evaluating the change in mechanical properties after a short-time thermal exposure, as well as estimating the history of thermally degraded polymers, has remained a challenge until now. An approach to accurately predict the mechanical properties, as well as the thermal exposure time and temperature of epoxy resin, using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-spectroscopy, data processing, and artificial neural networks, is presented here. Therefore, an epoxy resin has been fully cured and exposed to elevated temperatures for different time periods. A FTIR-spectrometer was used to measure molecular changes, using mid-IR (MIR)-FTIR for film samples and near-IR (NIR)-FTIR for bulk samples. A quantitative analysis of the thermally degraded film samples shows oxidation, chain-scission, and dehydration in the FTIR spectra in the MIR-range. Using NIR spectroscopy for the bulk samples, only minor changes in the FTIR spectra could be detected. However, using data processing, molecular information was extracted from the NIR range and a degradation model, using an artificial neural network, has been trained. Even though the changes due to thermal exposure were small, the presented model is capable of accurately predicting the time, temperature, and residual strength of the polymer.",Exploring the Critical Factors Limiting Polyaniline Biocompatibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960346,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Today, the application of polyaniline in biomedicine is widely discussed. However, information about impurities released from polyaniline and about the cytotoxicity of its precursors aniline, aniline hydrochloride, and ammonium persulfate are scarce. Therefore, cytotoxicity thresholds for the individual precursors and their combinations were determined (MTT assay) and the type of cell death caused by exposition to the precursors was identified using flow-cytometry. Tests on fibroblasts revealed higher cytotoxicity of ammonium persulfate than aniline hydrochloride. Thanks to the synergic effect, both monomers in combination enhanced their cytotoxicities compared with individual substances. Thereafter, cytotoxicity of polyaniline doped with different acids (sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, and methanesulfonic) was determined and correlated with impurities present in respective sample (HPLC). The lowest cytotoxicity showed polyaniline doped with phosphoric acid (followed by sulfuric, methanesulfonic, and nitric acid). Cytotoxicity of polyaniline was mainly attributed to the presence of residual ammonium persulfate and low-molecular-weight polar substances. This is crucial information with respect to the purification of polyaniline and production of its cytocompatible form.","Synthesis and Gas-Permeation Characterization of a Novel High-Surface Area Polyamide Derived from 1,3,6,8-Tetramethyl-2,7-diaminotriptycene: Towards Polyamides of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM-PAs).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960345,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A triptycene-based diamine, 1,3,6,8-tetramethyl-2,7-diamino-triptycene (TMDAT), was used for the synthesis of a novel solution-processable polyamide obtained via polycondensation reaction with 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (6FBBA). Molecular simulations confirmed that the tetrasubstitution with ortho-methyl groups in the triptycene building block reduced rotations around the C⁻N bond of the amide group leading to enhanced fractional free volume. Based on N₂ sorption at 77 K, 6FBBA-TMDAT revealed microporosity with a Brunauer⁻Emmett⁻Teller (BET) surface area of 396 m² g-1; to date, this is the highest value reported for a linear polyamide. The aged 6FBBA-TMDAT sample showed moderate pure-gas permeabilities (e.g., 198 barrer for H₂, ~109 for CO₂, and ~25 for O₂) and permselectivities (e.g., αH₂/CH₄ of ~50) that position this polyamide close to the 2008 H₂/CH₄ and H₂/N₂ upper bounds. CO₂⁻CH₄ mixed-gas permeability experiments at 35 °C demonstrated poor plasticization resistance; mixed-gas permselectivity negatively deviated from the pure-gas values likely, due to the enhancement of CH₄ diffusion induced by mixing effects.",Warpage Reduction of Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic Using Microcellular Foaming Process Applied Injection Molding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960344,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study analyzes the fundamental principles and characteristics of the microcellular foaming process (MCP) to minimize warpage in glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), which is typically worse than that of a solid polymer. In order to confirm the tendency for warpage and the improvement of this phenomenon according to the glass fiber content (GFC), two factors associated with the reduction of the shrinkage difference and the non-directionalized fiber orientation were set as variables. The shrinkage was measured in the flow direction and transverse direction, and it was confirmed that the shrinkage difference between these two directions is the cause of warpage of GFRP specimens. In addition, by applying the MCP to injection molding, it was confirmed that warpage was improved by reducing the shrinkage difference. To further confirm these results, the effects of cell formation on shrinkage and fiber orientation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, micro-CT observation, and cell morphology analysis. The micro-CT observations revealed that the fiber orientation was non-directional for the MCP. Moreover, it was determined that the mechanical and thermal properties were improved, based on measurements of the impact strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, and deflection temperature for the MCP.",Characterization of Polyurethane Foam Waste for Reuse in Eco-Efficient Building Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960343,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In the European Union, the demand for polyurethane is continually growing. In 2017, the estimated value of polyurethane production was 700,400 Tn, of which 27.3% is taken to landfill, which causes an environmental problem. In this paper, the behaviour of various polyurethane foams from the waste of different types of industries will be analyzed with the aim of assessing their potential use in construction materials. To achieve this, the wastes were chemically tested by means of CHNS, TGA, and leaching tests. They were tested microstructurally by means of SEM. The processing parameters of the waste was calculated after identifying its granulometry and its physical properties i.e., density and water absorption capacity. In addition, the possibility of incorporating these wastes in plaster matrices was studied by determining their rendering in an operational context, finding out their mechanical resistance to flexion and compression at seven days, their reaction to fire as well as their weight per unit of area, and their thermal behaviour. The results show that in all cases, the waste is inert and does not undergo leaching. The generation process of the waste determines the foam's microstructure in addition to its physical-chemical properties, which directly affect building materials in which they are included, thus offering different ways in which they can be applied.",Comparative Study on Kinetics of Ethylene and Propylene Polymerizations with Supported Ziegler⁻Natta Catalyst: Catalyst Fragmentation Promoted by Polymer Crystalline Lamellae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960342,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The kinetic behaviors of ethylene and propylene polymerizations with the same MgCl₂-supported Ziegler⁻Natta (Z⁻N) catalyst containing an internal electron donor were compared. Changes of polymerization activity and active center concentration ([C*]) with time in the first 10 min were determined. Activity of ethylene polymerization was only 25% of that of propylene, and the polymerization rate (Rp) quickly decayed with time (tp) in the former system, in contrast to stable Rp in the latter. The ethylene system showed a very low [C*]/[Ti] ratio (<0.6%), in contrast to a much higher [C*]/[Ti] ratio (1.5%⁻4.9%) in propylene polymerization. The two systems showed noticeably different morphologies of the nascent polymer/catalyst particles, with the PP/catalyst particles being more compact and homogeneous than the PE/catalyst particles. The different kinetic behaviors of the two systems were explained by faster and more sufficient catalyst fragmentation in propylene polymerization than the ethylene system. The smaller lamellar thickness (<20 nm) in nascent polypropylene compared with the size of nanopores (15⁻25 nm) in the catalyst was considered the key factor for efficient catalyst fragmentation in propylene polymerization, as the PP lamellae may grow inside the nanopores and break up the catalyst particles."

For four types of PCE molecules-PCE1, PCE2, PCE3, and PCE4-the steric hindrance between the PCE molecules increased with increasing side chain length. The side chain length not only affects water mobility but also affects the distribution of water molecules in the system. Simulation results indicate that water molecules were trapped by the PCE molecules, reducing the diffusion properties. PCE molecules with long side chains have more water molecules probability around the main chain and fewer water molecules probability near the side chain. Microscopic-level knowledge of the interaction between superplasticizer and water molecules facilitates understanding of the performance of superplasticizers in cement systems.",Charge-Discharge Characteristics of Textile Energy Storage Devices Having Different PEDOT:PSS Ratios and Conductive Yarns Configuration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960329,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, sandwiched between two conductive yarns, has been proven to have capacitive behavior in our textile energy storage devices. Full understanding of its underlying mechanism is still intriguing. The effect of the PEDOT to PSS ratio and the configuration of the electrode yarns are the focus of this study. Three commercial PEDOT:PSS yarns, Clevios P-VP-AI-4083, Ossila AI 4083, and Orgacon ICP 1050, as well as stainless steel and silver-coated polybenzoxazole (Ag/PBO) yarns, in various combinations, were used as solid electrolytes and electrodes, respectively. Analyses with NMR, ICP-OES, TGA, and resistivity measurement were employed to characterize the PEDOT:PSS. The device charge-discharge performance was measured by the Arduino microcontroller. Clevios and Ossila were found to have identical characteristics with a similar ratio, that is, 1:5.26, hence a higher resistivity of 1000 Ω.cm, while Orgacon had a lower PEDOT to PSS ratio, that is, 1:4.65, with a lower resistivity of 0.25⁻1 Ω.cm. The thermal stability of PEDOT:PSS up to 250 °C was proven. Devices with PEDOT:PSS having lower conductivity, such as Clevios P-VP-AI-4083 or Ossila AI 4083, showed capacitive behavior. For a better charge-discharge profile, it is also suggested that the PEDOT to electrode resistance should be low. These results led to a conclusion that a larger ratio of PEDOT to PSS, having higher resistivity, is more desirable, but further research is needed.","Water Softening Using a Light-Responsive, Spiropyran-Modified Nanofiltration Membrane.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960328,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A novel technique for the covalent attachment of a light-responsive spiropyran onto polyamide thin film composite nanofiltration (NF) membranes in a one-step reaction using low-energy electron beam technology is described. The effect of illumination of the immobilized spiropyran was studied, as well as the resulting membrane properties with respect to MgSO₄ retention, water permeability rate, and chlorine resistance. Electron beam irradiation showed a direct effect on the transformation of the rough PA NF membrane surface into a ridge-and-valley structure. Upon UV light irradiation, the spiropyran transformed into zwitterionic merocyanine, which had shown MgSO₄ removal of >95% with water permeation rates of 6.5 L/(m²·h·bar). Alternatively, visible light was used to convert merocyanine to spiropyran, which achieved >95% of MgSO₄ retention with a water flux of around 5.25 L/(m²·h·bar). The modified NF membranes showed higher chlorine resistance as well as a higher normalized water flux as compared to the reference membrane, without a loss of ion retention. All the NF membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This study demonstrates a simple and inexpensive method for the immobilization of molecules onto polymeric membranes, which may be applied in water softening.",Aligned Scaffolds with Biomolecular Gradients for Regenerative Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960327,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Aligned topography and biomolecular gradients exist in various native tissues and play pivotal roles in a set of biological processes. Scaffolds that recapitulate the complex structure and microenvironment show great potential in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. We begin with a discussion on the fabrication of aligned scaffolds, followed by how biomolecular gradients can be immobilized on aligned scaffolds. In particular, we emphasize how electrospinning, freeze drying, and 3D printing technology can accomplish aligned topography and biomolecular gradients flexibly and robustly. We then highlight several applications of aligned scaffolds and biomolecular gradients in regenerative medicine including nerve, tendon/ligament, and tendon/ligament-to-bone insertion regeneration. Finally, we finish with conclusions and future perspectives on the use of aligned scaffolds with biomolecular gradients in regenerative medicine.",A Simple Methodology to Estimate the Diffusion Coefficient in Pervaporation-Based Purification Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960326,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A procedure to estimate the diffusion coefficient in solution⁻diffusion models of hydrophilic membranes used in pervaporation-based purification experiments is presented. The model is based on a series solution of the general permeation problem. It considers a membrane that can be filled with water or with the feed solution before the measurement. Furthermore, the length of the tubing between the permeation cell and the place of cold traps is also addressed. To illustrate the parameter estimation procedure, we have chosen the data for the separation of water and ethanol by chitosan membranes. It is shown that the diffusion coefficient can be estimated effectively from the time course of the transported mass and by the analysis of certain well defined time lags of the permeation curve.",Hierarchical Structure and Thermal Property of Starch-Based Nanocomposites with Different Amylose/Amylopectin Ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960325,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Starch-based materials with reinforced properties were considered as one of the most promising materials to replace the petro-based packaging products, and actually, the molecular structures of starch usually determined the structures and properties of end-used starchy products. Here, starch-based nanocomposites were fabricated by starch esters derived from native starches with different amylose contents and organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT). The fractured surface under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) exhibited wrinkles formed by macromolecular aggregation owing to the interaction competition between the plasticizer and nanofiller with the starch ester. The more intense interaction within amylopectin-rich films promoted the formation of much randomly exfoliation of OMMT observed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As the amylose content increased, the interaction between the starch ester and the nanofiller was weakened, leading to the dispersion morphology of an ordered arrangement and partly intercalated structures in the dimension of 12.92 to 19.77 nm. Meanwhile, such interaction also affected both the inner ordered structure integrity of starch ester and the layer structure consistency of nanofiller according to X-ray diffraction results. Further, the stronger interaction between amylopectin and the nanofiller endowed higher thermal stability to the amylopectin-rich starch-based nanocomposites. In short, these results are beneficial for the application of starch-based nanocomposites in the food packaging industry by regulating the interaction between starch and nanofillers.",Sorption and Desorption Studies of Pb(II) and Ni(II) from Aqueous Solutions by a New Composite Based on Alginate and Magadiite Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960324,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A new composite material based on alginate and magadiite/Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (CAM-D2EHPA) was successfully prepared by previous impregnation of layered magadiite with D2EHPA extractant, and then immobilized into the alginate matrix. Air dried beads of CAM-D2EHPA were characterized by FTIR and SEM⁻EDX techniques. The sorbent was used for the separation of lead and nickel from nitrate solutions; the main parameters of sorption such as contact time, pH of the solution, and initial metal concentration were studied. The beads recovered 94% of Pb(II) and 65% of Ni(II) at pH 4 from dilute solutions containing 10 mg L-1 of metal (sorbent dosage, S.D. 1 g L-1). The equilibrium data gave a better fit using the Langmuir model, and kinetic profiles were fitted using a pseudo-second order rate equation. The maximum sorption capacities obtained (at pH 4) were 197 mg g-1 and 44 mg g-1 for lead and nickel, respectively. The regeneration of the sorbent was efficiently carried out with a dilute solution of HNO₃ (0.5 M). The composite material was reused in 10 sorption⁻elution cycles with no significant differences on sorption uptake. A study with synthetic effluents containing an equimolar concentration of both metals indicated a better selectivity towards lead ions.",Preparation of Glass Fabric/Poly(l-lactide) Composites by Thermoplastic Resin Transfer Molding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960323,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study reports the first example of the production of polylactide composites prepared by Thermoplastic Resin Transfer Molding (T-RTM) via in situ bulk polymerization of l-lactide (l-LA) after injection in a closed mold containing glass fabrics. Tin octoate Sn(Oct)₂ was used as the catalyst and first evaluated at the lab-scale in the experimental conditions required in the tank and in the mold of the RTM device. The reactions were then upscaled in the RTM in the absence of reinforcement to ensure the feasibility of the process (transfer and polymerization). Finally, poly-l-lactide (PLLA)-based composites with glass fabrics as the reinforcement were obtained. The resulting PLLA matrices exhibited conversions up to 99% along with high molar masses of up to 78,000 g·mol-1 when the polymerization was carried out under dynamic vacuum (vacuum-assisted RTM, VARTM). Moreover, a good impregnation of the glass fabrics by the matrix was observed by optical microscopy.",Gelatin Films Modified with Acidic and Polyelectrolyte Polymers-Material Selection for Soft Gastroresistant Capsules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960322,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The following investigation comprised the formation of acid-resistant gelatin-based films, intended for future use in soft-capsule technology. Such film compositions were obtained by including nonionized forms of acid-insoluble polymers in a gelatin-based film-forming mixture. The selected films were additionally modified with small amounts of anionic polysaccharides that have potential to interact with gelatin, forming polyelectrolyte complexes. The obtained film compositions were subjected to, e.g., disintegration tests, adhesiveness tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and a transparency study. As a result of the performed study, some commercial enteric polymers (acrylates), as well as cellulose acetate phthalate, were selected as components that have the ability to coalesce and form a continuous phase within a gelatin film. The use of a small amount (1.5%) of additional gelling polymers improved the rheological characteristics and adhesive properties of the obtained films, with ί-carrageenan and gellan gum appearing to be the most beneficial.",DNA Compaction and Charge Neutralization Regulated by Divalent Ions in very Low pH Solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960321,Polymers,2019 04 11,"DNA conformation is strongly dependent on the valence of counterions in solution, and a valence of at least three is needed for DNA compaction. Recently, we directly demonstrated DNA compaction and its regulation, mediated by divalent cations, by lowering the pH of a solution. In the present study, we found that the critical electrophoretic mobility of DNA is promoted to around -1.0 × 10-4 cm² V-1 s-1 to incur DNA compaction or condensation in a tri- and tetravalent counterions solution, corresponding to an about 89% neutralized charge fraction of DNA. This is also valid for DNA compaction by divalent counterions in a low pH solution. It is notable that the critical charge neutralization of DNA for compaction is only about 1% higher than the saturated charge fraction of DNA in a mild divalent ion solution. We also found that DNA compaction by divalent cations at low pH is weakened and even decondensed with an increasing concentration of counterions."

Compared to the two aromatic-based components in the biomass, carbohydrates produced much less char but more gas. Surprisingly, tannin produced a significant amount of water-soluble products; further analysis indicated that tannin could produce a large amount of catechols. The first reported NMR chemical shift databases for tannin and hemicellulose pyrolysis oils were created to facilitate the HSQC analysis. Various C⁻H functional groups (>30 different C⁻H bonds) in the pyrolysis oils could be analyzed by employing HSQC-NMR. The results indicated that most of the aromatic C⁻H and aliphatic C⁻H bonds in the pyrolysis oils produced from pine bark and pine residues resulted from the lignin and tannin components. A preliminary study for a quantitative application of HSQC-NMR on the characterization of pyrolysis oil was also done in this study. Nevertheless, the concepts established in this work open up new methods to fully characterize the whole portion of pyrolysis oils produced from various biomass components, which can provide valuable information on the thermochemical mechanisms.",Holographic Characteristics of Photopolymers Containing Different Mixtures of Nematic Liquid Crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960308,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystal (HPDLC) is used to record holographic diffraction gratings.

The diffraction efficiency obtained in the reconstruction of the holograms is evaluated to compare the influence of the different LC. Additionally, the samples are exposed to a variable electric field and the diffracted light intensity as a function of the applied voltage is measured to evaluate the influence of the LC. The results obtained show significant differences depending on the LC incorporated to the photopolymer.",Anti-Fouling and Anti-Bacterial Modification of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Membrane by Blending with the Capsaicin-Based Copolymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960307,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Membrane fouling induced by the adsorption of organic matter, and adhesion and propagation of bacteria onto the surfaces, is the major obstacle for the wide application of membrane technology. In this work, the capsaicin-based copolymer (PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin) was synthesized via radical copolymerization using methyl methacrylate (MMA), N-acrylomorpholine (ACMO) and 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide (capsaicin) as monomers. Subsequently, the capsaicin-based copolymer was readily blended with PVDF to fabricate PVDF/PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin flat sheet membrane via immersed phase inversion method. The effects of copolymer concentration on the structure and performance of resultant membranes were evaluated systematically. With increase of PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin copolymer concentration in the casting solution, the sponge-like layer at the membrane cross-section transfers to macroviod, and the pore size and porosity of membranes increase remarkably. The adsorbed bovine serum albumin protein (BSA) amounts to PVDF/PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin membranes decrease significantly because of the enhanced surface hydrophilicty. During the cycle filtration of pure water and BSA solution, the prepared PVDF/PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin membranes have a higher flux recovery ratio (FFR) and lower irreversible membrane fouling ratio (Rir), as compared with pristine PVDF membrane. PVDF/PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin membrane is found to suppress the growth and propagation of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, achieving an anti-bacterial efficiency of 88.5%. These results confirm that the anti-fouling and anti-bacterial properties of PVDF membrane are enhanced obviously by blending with the PMMA-PACMO-Capsaicin copolymer.",Synthesis of an Aqueous Self-Matting Acrylic Resin with Low Gloss and High Transparency via Controlling Surface Morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960306,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper reports on a novel, film-forming acrylic polymer resin that exhibits low-gloss surface and high transparency via controlling film morphology at sub-micron roughness levels. Such microstructure is controlled by means of the copolymerization process increasing the allyl methacrylate (AMA) crosslinker content from 0 to 0.4 wt %. This acrylic resin makes it possible to avoid high loadings of matting agents, while also having good abrasion resistance and soft-touch feeling. Gloss levels of as low as 4 units at 60° incident angle and light transmittance of up to 85% have been achieved. The chemical structure of the aqueous acrylic resin was characterized by ATR-FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The film morphology and surface roughness were measured by SEM and AFM analysis. The emulsion particle morphology and glass transition temperature were obtained by TEM and DSC, respectively. The effects of the crosslinker content on the light transmittance, glass transition temperature, and thermal degradation stability were also discussed in detail. The characterization results conclude that an acrylic polymer with interesting optical properties and high thermal stability can be obtained, which is desirable for leather applications.",Influence of MoS₂ Nanosheet Size on Performance of Drilling Mud.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960305,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Water-based drilling mud (WBM) is a non-Newtonian fluid that has a variety of applications such as in transporting cuttings during drilling, protecting the borehole, and cooling the drill bit. With the development of nano-technology, various nanoparticles have been synthesized and have been added to WBM to improve its performance. Shear thinning is the most important factor in drilling mud and this attribute can be improved when two-dimensional particles are added. MoS₂ nanoparticles, which represent a typical two-dimensional material, are easy to synthesize in large quantities and have a high thermal conductivity and low coefficient of friction. Since the two-dimensional structure, thermal conductivity, and low coefficient of friction of MoS₂ would improve the performance of WBM, we experimented with MoS₂ nanosheets as an additive, under optimal conditions, using various samples each with uniform sizes and thicknesses of nanosheets. A large amount of MoS₂ nanosheets was synthesized, sorted by thickness and diameter, and added to drilling mud. The diameter of MoS₂ was divided into a small diameter group (about 100⁻400 nm) and a big diameter group (about 300⁻650 nm), and the thickness was divided into 1⁻2 nm and 5⁻10 nm groups. Experimental results showed that when MoS₂ is added to WBM, shear thinning occurs more strongly. In addition, the addition of MoS₂ with a thickness of 1⁻2 nm and a diameter of 300⁻650 nm resulted in the highest increase in viscosity and thermal conductivity of WBM. As a result, we experimentally confirmed that MoS₂ can be used as an additive to increase the thermal conductivity and viscosity of WBM and to make shear thinning phenomenon more.","Modeling of Miniemulsion Polymerization of Styrene with Macro-RAFT Agents to Theoretically Compare Slow Fragmentation, Ideal Exchange and Cross-Termination Cases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960304,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A 5-dimensional Smith-Ewart based model is developed to understand differences for reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) miniemulsion polymerization with theoretical agents mimicking cases of slow fragmentation, cross-termination, and ideal exchange while accounting for chain length and monomer conversion dependencies due to diffusional limitations. The focus is on styrene as a monomer, a water soluble initiator, and a macro-RAFT agent to avoid exit/entry of the RAFT leaving group radical. It is shown that with a too low RAFT fragmentation rate coefficient it is generally not afforded to consider zero-one kinetics (for the related intermediate radical type) and that with significant RAFT cross-termination the dead polymer product is dominantly originating from the RAFT intermediate radical. To allow the identification of the nature of the RAFT retardation it is recommended to experimentally investigate in the future the impact of the average particle size (dp) on both the monomer conversion profile and the average polymer properties for a sufficiently broad dp range, ideally including the bulk limit. With decreasing particle size both a slow RAFT fragmentation and a fast RAFT cross-termination result in a stronger segregation and thus rate acceleration. The particle size dependency is different, allowing further differentiation based on the variation of the dispersity and end-group functionality. Significant RAFT cross-termination is specifically associated with a strong dispersity increase at higher average particle sizes. Only with an ideal exchange it is afforded in the modeling to avoid the explicit calculation of the RAFT intermediate concentration evolution.",Study Rheological Behavior of Polymer Solution in Different-Medium-Injection-Tools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960303,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Previous studies showed the difficulty during polymer flooding and the low producing degree for the low permeability layer. To solve the problem, Daqing, the first oil company, puts forward the polymer-separate-layer-injection-technology which separates mass and pressure in a single pipe. This technology mainly increases the control range of injection pressure of fluid by using the annular de-pressure tool, and reasonably distributes the molecular weight of the polymer injected into the thin and poor layers through the shearing of the different-medium-injection-tools. This occurs, in order to take advantage of the shearing thinning property of polymer solution and avoid the energy loss caused by the turbulent flow of polymer solution due to excessive injection rate in different injection tools. Combining rheological property of polymer and local perturbation theory, a rheological model of polymer solution in different-medium-injection-tools is derived and the maximum injection velocity is determined. The ranges of polymer viscosity in different injection tools are mainly determined by the structures of the different injection tools. However, the value of polymer viscosity is mainly determined by the concentration of polymer solution. So, the relation between the molecular weight of polymer and the permeability of layers should be firstly determined, and then the structural parameter combination of the different-medium-injection-tool should be optimized. The results of the study are important for regulating polymer injection parameters in the oilfield which enhances the oil recovery with reduced the cost.","Hyperbranched Polycaprolactone through RAFT Polymerization of 2-Methylene-1,3-dioxepane.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960302,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Hyperbranched polycaprolactone with controlled structure was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer radical ring-opening polymerization along with self-condensed vinyl polymerization (SCVP) of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO). Vinyl 2-[(ethoxycarbonothioyl) sulfanyl] propanoate (ECTVP) was used as polymerizable chain transfer agent. Living polymerization behavior was proved via pseudo linear kinetics, the molecular weight of polymers increasing with conversion and successful chain extension. The structure of polymers was characterized by ¹H NMR spectroscopy, tripe detection gel permeation chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry. The polymer composition was shown to be able to tune to vary the amount of ester repeat units in the polymer backbone, and hence determine the degree of branching. As expected, the degree of crystallinity was lower and the rate of degradation was faster in cases of increasing the number of branches.",Dipolar Glass Polymers Containing Polarizable Groups as Dielectric Materials for Energy Storage Applications. A Minireview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960301,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Materials that have high dielectric constants, high energy densities and minimum dielectric losses are highly desirable for use in capacitor devices. In this sense, polymers and polymer blends have several advantages over inorganic and composite materials, such as their flexibilities, high breakdown strengths, and low dielectric losses. Moreover, the dielectric performance of a polymer depends strongly on its electronic, atomic, dipolar, ionic, and interfacial polarizations. For these reasons, chemical modification and the introduction of specific functional groups (e.g., F, CN and R-S(=O)₂-R´) would improve the dielectric properties, e.g., by varying the dipolar polarization. These functional groups have been demonstrated to have large dipole moments. In this way, a high orientational polarization in the polymer can be achieved. However, the decrease in the polarization due to dielectric dissipation and the frequency dependency of the polarization are challenging tasks to date. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (Tg) that contain permanent dipoles can help to reduce dielectric losses due to conduction phenomena related to ionic mechanisms. Additionally, sub-Tg transitions (e.g., γ and β relaxations) attributed to the free rotational motions of the dipolar entities would increase the polarization of the material, resulting in polymers with high dielectric constants and, hopefully, dielectric losses that are as low as possible. Thus, polymer materials with high glass transition temperatures and considerable contributions from the dipolar polarization mechanisms of sub-Tg transitions are known as ""dipolar glass polymers"". Considering this, the main aspects of this combined strategy and the future prospects of these types of material were discussed.","Evaluation of the Spray Drying Conditions of Blueberry Juice-Maltodextrin on the Yield, Content, and Retention of Quercetin 3-d-Galactoside.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960300,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The influence of the processing conditions during the spray drying of mixtures of blueberry juice (BJ) and maltodextrin (MX) was determined quantitatively by the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and qualitatively by the surface response plots (SRP). The effect of two independent variables (inlet temperature, and MX concentration), and one categorical variable (type of MX), was determined on the yield (Y), content (Q), and retention (R) of the antioxidant quercetin 3-d-galactoside. From the ANOVA results, the concentration was the main variable affecting Y and Q, while temperature had a negligible effect, and the low molecular weight MXs exhibited a better response. The physicochemical characterization showed that the powder appearance and microstructure remained unaffected, but size and morphology of the particles varied with the processing conditions. This study established the optimal processing conditions for the spray drying of BJ-MX, and the application limits of the MXs based on the molecular weight distribution."

Contrary to commonly used biocide-based antifouling coatings, they do not release biocides into the marine environment, however, they suffer from poor antifouling efficacy during idle periods. To improve their antifouling performances in static conditions, various amounts of hydrolyzable polymers were incorporated within a silicone matrix. These hydrolyzable polymers were chosen for the well-known hydrolytic degradation mechanism of their main chain, e.g. poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), or of their ester pending groups, e.g. poly(bis(trimethylsilyloxy)methylsilyl methacrylate) (PMATM2). The degradation kinetics of such hydrolyzable silicone coatings were assessed by mass loss measurements during immersion in deionized water. Coatings containing PMATM2 exhibited a maximum mass loss after 12 weeks, whereas PCL-based coatings showed no significant mass loss after 24 weeks. Dynamic contact angle measurements revealed the modifications of the coatings surface chemistry with an amphiphilic behavior after water exposure. The attachment of macrofoulers on these coatings were evaluated by field tests in the Mediterranean Sea, demonstrating the short or long-term antifouling effect of these hydrolyzable polymers embedded in the silicone matrix. The settlement of A. amphitrite barnacles on the different coatings indicated inhospitable behaviors towards larval barnacles for coatings with at least 15 wt % of additives.",Chitosan-Modified PLGA Nanoparticles for Control-Released Drug Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960288,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) are well recognized as an ideal drug delivery carrier for their biocompatibility and biodegradability. In order to overcome the disadvantage of drug burst release, chitosan (CS) was used to modify the PLGA nanoparticles. In this work, CS-PLGA nanoparticles with different ratio of CS to PLGA were prepared using high-gravity rotating packed bed (RPB). With the increase of amount of CS, the particle size increased from 132.8 ± 1.5 nm to 172.7 ± 3.2 nm, zeta potential increased from -20.8 ± 1.1 mV to 25.6 ± 0.6 mV, and drug encapsulation efficiency increased from 65.8% to 87.1%. The initial burst release of PLGA NPs reduced after being modified by CS, and the cumulative release was 66.9%, 41.9%, 23.8%, and 14.3%, after 2 h, respectively. The drug release of CS-modified PLGA NPs was faster at pH5.5 than that at pH 7.4. The cellular uptake of CS-modified PLGA NPs increased compared with PLGA NPs, while cell viability was reduced. In conclusion, these results indicated that CS-modified, PTX-loaded PLGA NPs have the advantages of sustained drug release and enhanced drug toxicity, suggesting that CS-modified NPs can be used as carriers of anticancer drugs.","The Effect of Multilevel Carbon Reinforcements on the Fire Performance, Conductivity, and Mechanical Properties of Epoxy Composites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960287,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We studied the effect of a multilevel presence of carbon-based reinforcements-a combination of conventional load-bearing unidirectional carbon fiber (CF) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and conductive CNT-containing nonwoven carbon nanofabric (CNF(CNT))-on the fire performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties of reference and flame-retarded epoxy resin (EP) composites. The inclusion of carbon fibers and flame retardant reduced the peak heat release rate (pHRR) of the epoxy resins. The extent to which the nanoreinforcements reduced the pHRR depended on their influence on thermal conductivity. Specifically, high thermal conductivity is advantageous at the early stages of degradation, but after ignition it may lead to more intensive degradation and a higher pHRR; especially in the reference samples without flame retardant. The lowest pHRR (130 kW/m²) and self-extinguishing V-0 UL-94 rating was achieved in the flame-retarded composite containing all three levels of carbon reinforcement (EP + CNF(CNT) + CNT + CF FR). The plasticizing effect of the liquid flame retardant impaired both the tensile and flexural properties; however, it significantly enhanced the impact resistance of the epoxy resin and its composites.",Regenerated Antheraea pernyi Silk Fibroin/Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) Thermosensitive Composite Hydrogel with Improved Mechanical Strength.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960286,Polymers,2019 04 11,"At present, Antheraea pernyi silk fibroin (ASF) has attracted research efforts to investigate it as a raw material for fabrication of biomedical devices because of its superior cytocompatibility. Nevertheless, native ASF is not easily processed into a hydrogel without any crosslinking agent, and a single hydrogel shows poor mechanical properties. In this paper, a series of ASF/poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) composite hydrogels with different ASF contents were manufactured by a simple in situ polymerization method without any crosslinking agent. Meanwhile, the structures, morphologies and thermal properties of composite hydrogels were investigated by XRD, FTIR, SEM, DSC and TGA, respectively. The results indicate that the secondary structure of silk in the composite hydrogel can be controlled by changing the ASF content and the thermal stability of composite hydrogels is enhanced with an increase in crystalline structure. The composite hydrogels showed similar lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) at about 32 °C, which matched well with the LCST of PNIPAAm. Finally, the obtained thermosensitive composite hydrogels exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, which can be tuned by varying the content of ASF. This strategy to prepare an ASF-based responsive composite hydrogel with enhanced mechanical properties represents a valuable route for developing the fields of ASF, and, furthermore, their attractive applications can meet the needs of different biomaterial fields.",Maleinized Linseed Oil as Epoxy Resin Hardener for Composites with High Bio Content Obtained from Linen Byproducts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960285,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Green composites, with more than 78 wt.% of products obtained from linen linumusitatissimum, were developed in this research work. Epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) was used as bio-based resin, a mix of nadic methyl anhydride (MNA) and maleinized linseed oil (MLO) were used as cross-linkers and finally, flax fabrics were used to obtain composite laminates by resin transfer molding (RTM). The flax fibers were modified using amino-silane, glycidyl-silane and maleic anhydride treatment in order to increase the compatibility between lignocellulosic fibers and the polymeric matrix. Mechanical and thermal properties were studied by flexural, tensile and impact test, as well as dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) to study the viscoelastic behavior. Contrary to what could be expected, when fibers are previously treated in presence of MLO, a reduction of anchorage points is obtained causing a substantial increase in the ductile properties compared with composites without previous fiber treatment or without MLO.",Effect of Compatibility on the Foaming Behavior of Injection Molded Polypropylene and Polycarbonate Blend Parts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960284,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To improve the foaming behavior of a common linear polypropylene (PP) resin, polycarbonate (PC) was blended with PP, and three different grafted polymers were used as the compatibilizers. The solid and foamed samples of the PP/PC 3:1 blend with different compatibilizers were first fabricated by melt extrusion followed by injection molding (IM) with and without a blowing agent. The mechanical properties, thermal features, morphological structure, and relative rheological characterizations of these samples were studied using a tensile test, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and torque rheometer. It can be found from the experimental results that the influence of the compatibility between the PP and PC phases on the foaming behavior of PP/PC blends is substantial. The results suggest that PC coupling with an appropriate compatibilizer is a potential method to improve the foamability of PP resin. The comprehensive effect of PC and a suitable compatibilizer on the foamability of PP can be attributed to two possible mechanisms, i.e., the partial compatibility between phases that facilitates cell nucleation and the improved gas-melt viscosity that helps to form a fine foaming structure.",Ice-Binding Protein from Shewanella frigidimarinas Inhibits Ice Crystal Growth in Highly Alkaline Solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960283,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The ability of a natural ice-binding protein from Shewanella frigidimarina (SfIBP) to inhibit ice crystal growth in highly alkaline solutions with increasing pH and ionic strength was investigated in this work. The purity of isolated SfIBP was first confirmed via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and size-exclusion chromatography with an ultraviolet detector (SEC-UV). Protein stability was evaluated in the alkaline solutions using circular dichroism spectroscopy, SEC-UV, and SDS-PAGE. SfIBP ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity, a measure of ice crystal growth inhibition, was assessed using a modified splat assay. Statistical analysis of results substantiated that, despite partial denaturation and misfolding, SfIBP limited ice crystal growth in alkaline solutions (pH ≤ 12.7) with ionic strength I ≤ 0.05 mol/L, but did not exhibit IRI activity in alkaline solutions where pH ≥ 13.2 and I ≥ 0.16 mol/L. IRI activity of SfIBP in solutions with pH ≤ 12.7 and I ≤ 0.05 mol/L demonstrated up to ≈ 66% reduction in ice crystal size compared to neat solutions.","Grubbs' and Schrock's Catalysts, Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization and Molecular Brushes-Synthesis, Characterization, Properties and Applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960282,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this review, molecular brushes and other macromolecular architectures bearing a bottlebrush segment where the main chain is synthesized by ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) mediated by Mo or Ru metal complexes are considered.

The removal of EDTA was investigated by adsorption with commercially available, gel-type, anion-exchange resins (AERs), which are based on cross-linked polystyrene with positive tertiary amine groups. Because of the positive charge on AERs, they could adsorb EDTA effectively even in a solution mixed with ions of cesium (Cs) via electrostatic attraction. Because EDTA adsorption by cation-exchange resins (CERs) was not possible, it was concluded that the negative charges on CERs do not contribute to the interaction with EDTA. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of AER (2 g/L) for EDTA removal, calculated by the Langmuir isotherm model was 0.47 mmol/g for initial EDTA concentrations in the range of 0.01⁻1 mM in the EDTA/Cs mixed solution. The Langmuir isotherm model was found to be suitable for EDTA adsorption on AERs, indicative of monolayer adsorption. The results clearly suggested that the AERs could efficiently remove EDTA, regardless of the presence of nuclides, such as Cs ions in the aqueous solution.",Polyplexes of Functional PAMAM Dendrimer/Apoptin Gene Induce Apoptosis of Human Primary Glioma Cells In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960280,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Highly efficient and safe gene delivery has become an important aspect of neuronal gene therapy.

We performed a transfection assay using plasmids of luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and assessed cell viability. Both cell lines were treated with complexes of PAMAM-FHR and apoptin after which their intracellular uptake and localization were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Confocal microscopy showed that the PAMAM-FHR escaped from the endo-lysosome into the cytosol. Cell cycle phase distribution analysis, annexin V staining, and a tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) assay established that apoptin triggered apoptosis in the GBL-14 cell line but not in normal fibroblasts. These results indicated that the PAMAM-FHR/apoptin complex is an effective gene vehicle for cancer therapy in vitro."

Our simulation results clearly capture the structural transitions of the protein sample from helix to turn or random coil conformation induced by the increasing strength of the electric field. During our analysis, we found that the conformational stability is weakened, and the protein sample is stretched as an unfolded structure when it was exposed in a sufficiently high electric field. The characteristic time when the jump occurs in the time evolution curves of root mean square deviation (RMSD) and radius of gyration Rg decreases with increasing electric strength, which demonstrates the rapidly conformational transition that occurs. The number of intra-protein hydrogen bonds, which is the key factor for stabilizing the protein structure, is related to the overall size of the protein. The value of the dipole moment and characteristic time are both influenced by the strength, but are independent of the direction of the external field. The protein sample becomes rotated with the electric field direction. These conclusions provide a theoretical realization of understanding the protein conformational transition in an electric field and the guidance for anticipative applications.",Kinetic Analysis of the Thermal Degradation of Recycled Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene by non-Isothermal Thermogravimetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960265,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This work presents an in-depth kinetic study of the thermal degradation of recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates comprised between 2 and 30 K min-1 were used to obtain the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the thermal degradation process of ABS by isoconversional (differential and integral) model-free methods. Among others, the differential Friedman method was used. Regarding integral methods, several methods with different approximations of the temperature integral were used, which gave different accuracies in Ea. In particular, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and the Starink methods were used. The results obtained by these methods were compared to the Kissinger method based on peak temperature (Tm) measurements at the maximum degradation rate. Combined Kinetic Analysis (CKA) was also carried out by using a modified expression derived from the general Sestak-Berggren equation with excellent results compared with the previous methods. Isoconversional methods revealed negligible variation of Ea with the conversion. Furthermore, the reaction model was assessed by calculating the characteristic y ( α ) and z ( α ) functions and comparing them with some master plots, resulting in a nth order reaction model with n = 1.4950, which allowed calculating the pre-exponential factor (A) of the Arrhenius constant. The results showed that Ea of the thermal degradation of ABS was 163.3 kJ mol-1, while ln A was 27.5410 (A in min-1). The predicted values obtained by integration of the general kinetic expression with the calculated kinetic triplet were in full agreement with the experimental data, thus giving evidence of the accuracy of the obtained kinetic parameters.",Highly-Loaded Thermoplastic Polyurethane/Lead Zirconate Titanate Composite Foams with Low Permittivity Fabricated using Expandable Microspheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960264,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The sensitivity enhancement of piezocomposites can realize new applications. Introducing a cellular structure into these materials decreases the permittivity and thus increases their sensitivity. However, foaming of piezocomposites is challenging because of the high piezoceramic loading required. In this work, heat-expandable microspheres were used to fabricate thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/lead zirconate titanate (PZT) composite foams with a wide range of PZT content (0 vol % to 40 vol %) and expansion ratio (1⁻4). The microstructure, thermal behavior, and dielectric properties of the foams were investigated. Composite foams exhibited a fine dispersion of PZT particles in the solid phase and a uniform cellular structure with cell sizes of 50⁻100 μm; cell size decreased with an increase in the PZT content. The total crystallinity of the composites was also decreased as the foaming degree increased. The results showed that the relative permittivity (εr) can be effectively decreased by an increase in the expansion ratio. A maximum of 7.7 times decrease in εr was obtained. An extended Yamada model to a three-phase system was also established and compared against the experimental results with a relatively good agreement. This work demonstrates a method to foam highly loaded piezocomposites with a potential to enhance the voltage sensitivity.","Hydrogen Storage, Magnetism and Electrochromism of Silver Doped FAU Zeolite: First-Principles Calculations and Molecular Simulations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960263,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The complex configuration, H₂ adsorption binding energy, magnetic, and optical properties of FAU zeolites with Ag cations loaded by ion exchange in the vacant dielectric cavities were investigated by employing the first-principles calculations with all-electron-relativistic numerical atom-orbitals scheme and the Metropolis Monte Carlo molecular simulations. The visible absorption spectrum peaked at distinct wavelengths arranging from red or green to blue colors when changing the net charge load, due to the produced various redox states of Ag cations exchanging at multiple Li⁺-substituted sites. The spin population analyses indicate the ferrimagnetic coupling between Al⁻O⁻Si framework and Ag cations originates from the major ferromagnetic spin polarization in Ag cation cluster coordinating with sodalite cages, with the net spins appreciably depending on the Ag content and exchange site. The H₂ adsorption capacities and binding energies represent significant dependence on the content, location, and electronic property of Ag cations introduced into the FAU zeolites. The evident decrease of H₂ adsorption binding energy with increased loading concentration demonstrates repulsive interaction between H₂ molecules and heterogeneous adsorption configuration on Ag cations. The adsorption sites of H₂ sorted by the binding energy with different adsorption configurations were correlated with exchange sites of Ag cations under different Ag loading to comprehend the H₂ adsorption mechanism.",Preparation and Thermoelectric Properties Study of Bipyridine-Containing Polyfluorene Derivative/SWCNT Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960262,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polymer/inorganic thermoelectric composites have witnessed rapid progress in recent years, but most of the studies have focused on the traditional conducting polymers.

The value of the power factor around 12 μW m-1 K-2 was achieved for the composite F8bpy/SWCNTs with a mass ratio of 50/50, and the maximum value of 62.3 μW m-1 K-2 was obtained when the mass ratio reached 10/90. Moreover, taking advantage of the bipyridine unit could chelate various kinds of metal ions to form polymer complexes. The enhanced power factor of 87.3 μW m-1 K-2 was obtained for composite F8bpy-Ni/SWCNTs with a mass ratio of 50/50.

The OMPW was tested as a supercapacitor electrode and showed a specific capacitance of 453 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1. A sulfur/OMPW (S/OMPW) cathode was fabricated via a simple solution method and a heat-treatment process for lithium/sulfur batteries (LSBs). The S/OMPW composite delivered a large discharge capacity reaching 1601 mAh g-1 at the initial cycle, retaining 1014 mAh g-1 at the 100th cycle at 0.1 C. The great electrochemical performances of the OMPW capacitor electrode and S/OMPW composite were attributed to the large specific surface areas and interconnected mesopores that could supply more active sites for the electrochemical reaction and facilitate mass transfer.",Nanoparticle-Hydrogel Composites: From Molecular Interactions to Macroscopic Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960260,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Hydrogels are materials used in a variety of applications, ranging from tissue engineering to drug delivery.

Herein, a fully biodegradable adsorbent was synthesized by the crosslinking reaction of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and chitosan via glutaraldehyde (CGC). The as-prepared CGC showed large adsorption capacities for gaseous formaldehyde. To clarify the adsorption performance of the as-synthesized HCHO adsorbents, changing the adsorption parameters performed various continuous flow adsorption tests. It was found that the adsorption data agreed best with the Freundlich isotherm, and the HCHO adsorption kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo second order model. The breakthrough curves indicated that the HCHO adsorbing capacity of CGC was up to 15.5 mg/g, with the inlet HCHO concentration of 46.1 mg/m³, GHSV of 28 mL/min, and temperature of 20 °C. The regeneration and reusability of the adsorbent were evaluated and CGC was found to retain its adsorptive capacity after four cycles. The introduction of β-CD was a key factor for the satisfied HCHO adsorption performance of CGC. A plausible HCHO adsorption mechanism by CGC with the consideration of the synergistic effects of Schiff base reaction and the hydrogen bonding interaction was proposed based on in situ DRIFTS studies. The present study suggests that CGC is a promising adsorbent for the indoor formaldehyde treatment.",Helix-Sense-Selective Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes Having a Porphyrin and a Zinc-Porphyrin Group: One-Handed Helical Arrangement of Porphyrin Pendants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960258,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Newly synthesized two kinds of achiral phenylacetylenes having a free-base- or a zinc-porphyrin (1 and Zn1, respectively) were polymerized by using a chiral rhodium catalyst system, Rh⁺(nbd)[(η⁶-C₆H₅)B⁻(C₆H₅)₃] catalyst and (R)-(+)- or (S)-(⁻)-1-phenylethylamine ((R)- or (S)-PEA, respectively) cocatalyst. Poly(1) and poly(Zn1) in THF showed a Cotton signal at the absorption region of the porphyrin and the main chain in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This result suggests that poly(1) and poly(Zn1) exist in a conformation with an excess of one-handed helix sense and the porphyrin moiety arranged in chiral helical fashion. The one-handed helical structure of poly(1) could be sustained in a mixture of THF/HMPA (10/2, v/v) due to stabilizing by stacking effect of porphyrin moieties along the main chain. This is the first example about helix-sense-selective polymerization by using Rh⁺(nbd)[(η⁶-C₆H₅)B⁻(C₆H₅)₃] catalyst. Additionally, poly(Zn1) showed about 10 times larger CD intensity in comparison with poly(1). This result suggests the regularity of arrangement of the porphyrin in poly(Zn1) is higher compared with poly(1). Spatial arrangement of porphyrins was achieved by utilizing a one-handed helical poly(phenylacetylenes) as a template.","Transparent to Black Electrochromism-The ""Holy Grail"" of Organic Optoelectronics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960257,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In the rapidly developing field of conjugated polymer science, the attribute of electrochromism these materials exhibit provides for a multitude of innovative application opportunities.

A cylindrical micellar structure is maintained, as it is in the thin film with the doping of either 10% hydrophobic solvent or 10% hydrophilic solvent, whose structure consists of the hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell. Attributed to the hydrophobicity/hydrophilia nature of the solvents, different solvents play an obvious role on the self-assembled structure, i.e., the hydrophobic solvent presents as a swelling effect, conversely, the hydrophilic solvent presents as a shrinking effect. Further, the synergistic effect of the binary solvents on the self-assembly produces the lowest values in both the average volumetric size and free energy density when the quantity of hydrophobic solvent and hydrophilic solvent is equivalent. Interestingly, the solvent effect becomes more pronounced under the existent of a confinement. When a lateral-oriented confinement is introduced, a periodically fluctuating change in the cylindrical size occurs in two near-wall regions, but the further addition of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic solvent can effectively eliminate such resulting hierarchical-sized cylinders and generate uniform small-sized cylinders. However, with the introduction of a horizontal-orientated confinement, the copolymers self-assemble into the spherical micellar structure. Moreover, the further addition of hydrophobic solvent leads to a decrease in the average size of micelles via coalescence mechanism, in contrast, the further addition of hydrophilic solvent causes an increase in the average size of micelles via splitting mechanism. These findings enrich our knowledge of the potential for the solvent effect on the self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymer system, and then provide theoretical supports on improving and regulating the mesoscopic structure of nanomaterials.",Statistical Behaviors of Semiflexible Polymer Chains Stretched in Rectangular Tubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960244,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We investigated the statistical behaviors of semiflexible polymer chains, which were simultaneously subjected to force stretching and rectangular tube confinement. Based on the wormlike chain model and Odijk deflection theory, we derived a new deflection length, by using which new compact formulas were obtained for the confinement free energy and force⁻confinement⁻extension relations. These newly derived formulas were justified by numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem associated with the Fokker⁻Planck governing equation and extensive Brownian dynamics simulations based on the so-called generalized bead-rod (GBR) model. We found that, compared to classical deflection theory, these new formulas were valid for a much more extended range of the confinement size/persistence length ratio and had no adjustable fitting parameters for sufficiently long semiflexible chains in the whole deflection regime.",Operating Characteristics of High-Order Distributed Feedback Polymer Lasers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960243,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, high-order distributed-feedback (DFB) polymer lasers were comparatively investigated. Their performance relies on multiple lasing directions and their advantages include their high manufacturing tolerances due to the large grating periods. Nine laser cavities were fabricated by spin-coating the gain polymer films onto a grating structure, which was manufactured via interference lithography that operated at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th DFB orders. Low threshold lasing and high slope efficiency were achieved in high-order DFB polymer lasers due to the large grating groove depth and the large gain layer thickness. A high-order DFB configuration shows possible advantages, including the ability to control the lasing direction and to achieve multiple-wavelength lasers. Furthermore, our investigation demonstrates that the increase in threshold and decrease in slope efficiency with an increase in the feedback order can be limited by controlling the structural parameters.",Rheological Characterization of Hydrogels from Alginate-Based Nanodispersion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960242,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The interest toward alginate and nanoemulsion-based hydrogels is driven by the wide potential of application. These systems have been noticed in several areas, ranging from pharmaceutical, medical, coating, and food industries. In this investigation, hydrogels prepared through in situ calcium ion release, starting from lemongrass essential oil nanodispersions stabilized in alginate aqueous suspensions in the presence of the nonionic surfactant Tween 80, were evaluated. The hydrogels prepared at different concentrations of oil, alginate, and calcium were characterized through rheological tests. Flow curves demonstrate that the hydrogels share shear thinning behavior. Oscillatory tests showed that the strength of the hydrogel network increases with the crosslinker increase, and decreases at low polymer concentrations. The hydrogels were thixotropic materials with a slow time of structural restoration after breakage. Finally, by analyzing the creep recovery data, the hydrogel responses were all fitted to the Burger model. Overall, it was demonstrated that the presence of essential oil in the proposed hydrogels does not affect the mechanical characteristics of the materials, which are mainly influenced by the concentration of polymer and calcium as a crosslinker.","An Easy Route to Wettability Changes of Polyethylene Terephthalate⁻Silicon Oxide Substrate Films for High Barrier Applications, Surface-Modified with a Self-Assembled Monolayer of Fluoroalkylsilanes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960241,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Inorganic⁻organic multilayer films consisting of polymers coated with thin inorganic oxidic layers (e.g., SiOx) ensure very high barrier performances against gas and vapor permeation, what makes them packaging materials suitable for sophisticated technical applications, including the encapsulation of photovoltaic devices or quantum dots, barrier films for optical displays, and transparent greenhouse screens. In these fields, surface coating or texturing of the multilayer protective films are effective technologies to improve their self-clean ability, thus reducing the required maintenance and ensuring longer durability and better performances. In this work, we used the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique to modify the surface and wetting properties of commercial polyethylene terephthalate-silicon oxide substrate (PET-SiOx) films developed for technical applications requiring a combined high barrier and transparency. The selected surface modifier was the 1H,1H,2H,2H-per-fluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS). The reagent mixture composition was optimized for the lowest water and oil wettability, as well as the highest self-cleaning capacity and performance stability. In particular, for the used PET-SiOx film the best FDTS/film surface for both the lowest water and oil wettability was found to be equal to 26.5 mM/dm², which changes the surface behavior from very hydrophilic (static water contact angle (CAw) = 21.5°) to hydrophobic (CAw = 101°), and gives a significant increment of the static oil contact angle (CAo) from 27° to 60°. Interestingly, the results demonstrated that the SAM reaction occurred also on the uncoated the PET side. After the SAM treatment, a small increase of the water vapor permeability is observed, probably due to a crack or defect onset of the SiOx coating of the SAM modified films. On this point, atomic force measurements demonstrated an increment of the SiOx coating layer roughness after the SAM treatment execution. Finally, the transparency changes of the SAM treated films, measured in the wavelength range 400⁻800 nm, were always small, so that the results were acceptable for the films' use in applications where high transparency is required.",Green Polyurethanes from Renewable Isocyanates and Biobased White Dextrins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960240,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyurethanes (PUs) are an important class of polymers due to their low density and thermal conductivity combined with their interesting mechanical properties-they are extensively used as thermal and sound insulators, as well as structural and comfort materials. Despite the broad range of applications, the production of PUs is still highly petroleum-dependent. The use of carbohydrates in PU synthesis has not yet been studied extensively, even though, as multihydroxyl compounds, they can easily serve as crosslinkers in PU synthesis. Partially or potentially biobased di-, tri- or poly-isocyanates can further be used to increase the renewable content of PUs. In our research, PU films could be easily produced using two bio-based isocyanates-ethyl ester L-lysine diisocyanate (LLDI] and ethyl ester l-lysine triisocyanate (LLTI)-, one commercial isocyanate-isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and a bio-based white dextrin (AVEDEX W80) as a crosslinker. The thermal and mechanical properties are evaluated and compared as well as the stability against solvents.",Hydrophobicity of Polyacrylate Emulsion Film Enhanced by Introduction of Nano-SiO₂ and Fluorine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960239,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study proposes to utilize modified Nano-SiO₂/fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion that was synthesized with a semi-continuous starved seed emulsion polymerization to improve the hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and UV-Vis absorption of polyacrylate emulsion film. To verify the proposed method, a series inspection had been conducted to investigate the features of the emulsion film. The morphological analysis indicated that Nano-SiO₂ was surrounded by a silane molecule after modification, which can efficiently prevent silica nanoparticles from aggregating. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed that modified SiO₂ and dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate (DFMA) were successfully introduced to the copolymer latex. The particle size of latex increased with the introduction of modified Nano-SiO₂ and DFMA. UV-Vis absorption spectra revealed that modified silicon nanoparticles can improve the ultraviolet shielding effect obviously. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrated that the film⁻air interface was richer in fluorine than film section and the glass side. The contact angle of modified Nano-SiO₂/fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion containing 3 wt % DFMA was 112°, slightly lower than double that of polyacrylate emulsion, indicating composite emulsion films possess better hydrophobicity. These results suggest that introducing modified Nano-SiO₂ and fluorine into polyacrylate emulsion can significantly enhance the thermal stability of emulsion films.",Influence of Tert-Butylthiol and Tetrahydrofuran on the Holographic Characteristics of a Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal: A Research Line Toward a Specific Sensor for Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960238,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Tert-Butylthiol (TBT) and tetrahydrothiophene (THT) are odorant substances added to natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to help their detection by the human smell.

Thereafter, the imprinted SiO₂ microspheres were modified with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA@SiO₂), followed by introducing the double bond. In the presence of TMSPMA@SiO₂, using N-isopropylacrylamide as monomer, and potassium persulfate as initiator, polymer/inorganic hybrid particles (PNIPAM/SiO₂) were prepared. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, nitrogen adsorption-desorption test, and transmission electron microscope were employed for the characterization of molecular imprinted SiO₂ microspheres and PNIPAM/SiO₂ hybrid particles. The effects of phosphate concentration, pH value, and adsorption temperature on the phosphate binding properties of PNIPAM/SiO₂ hybrid particles were studied by UV-vis spectrophotometer. The experimental results shed light on the fact that the PNIPAM structure is beneficial for the improvement of the adsorption ability of phosphate-imprinted SiO₂ microspheres. With the increase in the initial phosphate concentration, the adsorption capacity of hybrid particles to phosphate ions increased to 274 mg/g at pH = 7 and 15 °C. The acid condition and the temperature below the low critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM are favorable to the adsorption of phosphate ions by PNIPAM/SiO₂ hybrid particles, and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 287 mg/g (at pH = 5 and 15 °C). The phosphate imprinted polymer/inorganic hybrid material is expected to be put to use in the fields of phosphate ions adsorption, separation, and recovery.",Adsorption Properties of β- and Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrins Cross-Linked with Epichlorohydrin in Aqueous Solution. A Sustainable Recycling Strategy in Textile Dyeing Process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960236,Polymers,2019 04 11,"β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) were used to prepare insoluble polymers using epichlorohydrin as a cross-linking agent and the azo dye Direct Red 83:1 was used as target adsorbate. The preliminary study related to adsorbent dosage, pH, agitation or dye concentration allowed us to select the best conditions to carry out the rest of experiments. The kinetics was evaluated by Elovich, pseudo first order, pseudo second order, and intra-particle diffusion models. The results indicated that the pseudo second order model presented the best fit to the experimental data, indicating that chemisorption is controlling the process. The results were also evaluated by Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. According to the determination coefficient (R²), Freunlich gave the best results, which indicates that the adsorption process is happening on heterogeneous surfaces. One interesting parameter obtained from Langmuir isotherm is qmax (maximum adsorption capacity). This value was six times higher when a β-CDs-EPI polymer was employed. The cross-linked polymers were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Also, morphology and particle size distribution were both assessed. Under optimized conditions, the β-CDs-EPI polymer seems to be a useful device for removing Direct Red 83:1 (close 90%), from aqueous solutions and industrial effluents. Complementarily, non-adsorbed dye was photolyzed by a pulsed light driven advanced oxidation process. The proposed methodology is environmental and economically advantageous, considering the point of view of a sustainable recycling economy in the textile dyeing process."

Benefiting from the dilute GO aqueous solution and repeated deposition procedures, CF/GO (0.5%) shows a homogeneous distribution of GO on the hybrid fibre surface, which is confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thereby ensuring that its PPBES composite possesses the highest interlaminar shear strength (91.5 MPa) and flexural strength (1886 MPa) with 16.0% and 24.1% enhancements, respectively, compared to its non-reinforced counterpart. Moreover, the incorporation of GO into the interface is beneficial for the hydrothermal ageing resistance and thermo-mechanical properties of the hierarchical composite.

The LC-MS analysis of the oligodiol enabled us to identify 67 chemical homologous structures that were composed of zero to four terephthalate (T) ester units and two to twelve monoethylene glycol (M) ether units. The flame retardant, morphological, compression, and thermal properties of rigid PUFs with and without triphenyl phosphate (TPP) were determined. The Tg values showed that TPP played a role of not only being a flame retardant, but also a plasticizer. PUF with a rather low TPP loading had an excellent flame retardancy and high thermal stability. A loading of 10 wt % TPP not only achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating, but also obtained an LOI value of 21%. Meanwhile, the PUF without a flame retardant did not achieve a UL-94 HB rating; the sample completely burned to the holder clamp and yielded a low LOI value (17%). The fire properties measured with the cone calorimeter were also discussed, and the results further proved that the flame retardancy of the PUF with the addition of TPP was improved significantly. The polymeric material meets the demands of density and compression strength for commercial PUF, as well as the needs of environmental development. The current study may help overcome the drawback of intrinsic high flammability and enlarge the fire safety applications of materials with a high percentage of recycled PET.",Insights into Nano-Scale Physical and Mechanical Properties of Epoxy/Boehmite Nanocomposite Using Different AFM Modes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960219,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Understanding the interaction between nanoparticles and the matrix and the properties of interphase is crucial to predict the macroscopic properties of a nanocomposite system. Here, we investigate the interaction between boehmite nanoparticles (BNPs) and epoxy using different atomic force microscopy (AFM) approaches. We demonstrate benefits of using multifrequency intermodulation AFM (ImAFM) to obtain information about conservative, dissipative and van der Waals tip-surface forces and probing local properties of nanoparticles, matrix and the interphase. We utilize scanning kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) to probe surface potential as a tool to visualize material contrast with a physical parameter, which is independent from the mechanics of the surface. Combining the information from ImAFM stiffness and SKPM surface potential results in a precise characterization of interfacial region, demonstrating that the interphase is softer than epoxy and boehmite nanoparticles. Further, we investigated the effect of boehmite nanoparticles on the bulk properties of epoxy matrix. ImAFM stiffness maps revealed the significant stiffening effect of boehmite nanoparticles on anhydride-cured epoxy matrix. The energy dissipation of epoxy matrix locally measured by ImAFM shows a considerable increase compared to that of neat epoxy.

During the development of the material, by varying the FR content, the ratio and the type of MMTs, rheological, morphological, mechanical and flammability properties of the nanocomposites were comprehensively investigated. Related to the differences between the dispersion and nucleation effect of MMT and organo-modified MMT (oMMT) in rPET matrix, analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), mechanical properties of the nanocomposites changed differently. The flexural strength and modulus were increased more significantly by adding untreated MMT than by the oMMT, however the impact strength was decreased by both types of nanofillers. The use of different type of MMTs resulted in contradictory flammability test result; time-to-ignition (TTI) during cone calorimeter tests decreased when oMMT was added to the rPET, however MMT addition resulted in an increase of the TTI also when combined with 4% FR. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of the oMMT containing composites decreased independently from the FR content, however, the MMT increased it noticeably. V0 classification according to the UL-94 standard was achieved with as low as 4% FR and 1% MMT content. The applicability of the upgraded recycled material was proved by a pilot experiment, where large-scale electronic parts were produced by injection molding and characterized with respect to the commercially available counterparts.",Comparative Studies on Two-Electrode Symmetric Supercapacitors Based on Polypyrrole:Poly(4-styrenesulfonate) with Different Molecular Weights of Poly(4-styrenesulfonate).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960216,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Poly(4-styrenesulfonate)-conducting polymer (PSS-CP) is advantageous for thin-film electrode manufacturing due to its high conductivity, high charge storage, structural stability, and excellent ink dispersion. In this work, comparative studies of two-electrode symmetric supercapacitors using Polypyrrole:Poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PPy:PSS), with different molecular weights (Mw's) of Poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as the electrodes, were performed. PPy:PSS can be easily prepared using a simple solution process that enables the mass production of thin-film electrodes with improved electrical and electrochemical properties. As-prepared PPy:PSS, with different PSS molecular weights, were assembled into two-electrode supercapacitors based on coin cell structures. It was confirmed that the electrical and electrochemical properties of PPy:PSS were improved with increasing PSS molecular weight. The coin cell, using PPy:PSS with a PSS molecular weight of 1.0 × 10⁶ g/mol, exhibited higher areal capacitance (175.3 mF/cm²), higher volumetric capacitance (584.2 F/cm³), and longer cycling stability (86.3% after 5000 cycles) compared to those of PPy:PSS with PSS molecular weights of 2.0 × 10⁵ and 7.0 × 10⁴ g/mol. This work provides an efficient approach for producing cost-effective and miniaturized supercapacitors with high conductivity and high specific capacitance for practical applications in a variety of electronic devices."

Although the thermal mechanism in porous media has been vigorously studied for polymeric/ceramic/metallic foams, less information is available on its application with intumescent-type polymers. This examination demonstrates the procedure of (1) the optimisation of the coating's internal multicellular structure for numerical modelling, based on topological analyses; (2) the finite element simulation for the coating-sample tested with cone calorimetry; and (3) the quantitative evaluation of the thermal insulation performance of its porous structure by adopting effective thermal conductivity. The modelling technique was verified using measurable data from the cone calorimeter tests. Consistent agreement between the numerical predictions and experimental measurements was achieved over the whole steel-substrate temperature history, based on the clarified thermal boundaries of the specimen and modelling of the combined conduction-radiation transfer. This numerical approach exhibits the impacts of porosity, pore-size, and external thermal load on the medium's performance, as well as the individual contributions of the component heat transfer modes to the overall process. The full understanding of this thermal mechanism can contribute to the enhancement and optimisation of the thermal insulation performance of a porous-type refractory polymer.",Fabrication and Application of Dual-Modality Polymer Nanoparticles Based on an Aggregation-Induced Emission-Active Fluorescent Molecule and Magnetic Fe₃O₄.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960204,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) utilized for imaging hold great promise for biomedical applications, but it remains a challenging task. Here, we report novel dual-modality NPs using an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active and near-infrared (NIR) emissive dye (TPAS) and magnetic Fe₃O₄ as the core, and biocompatible polymer Pluronic F-127 as the encapsulation matrix by self-assembly procedures. The obtained fluorescent-magnetic AIE NPs have both high fluorescence quantum yield (13.8%) at 700 nm and high magnetic saturation value.

The chemical structure and morphology of core-shell nanoparticles were identified by FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and elemental analyzer. Pycnometer and vibrating sample magnetometer showed that the magnetic saturation and density of the Fe₃O₄/POA particles were reduced by the POA shell coatings. The rheological properties of the MR suspension dispersed in a silicone oil at various magnetic field strengths were investigated using a rotating rheometer under a magnetic field. The resulting MR suspension showed a typical Newtonian fluid behavior in the absence of external stimuli. When an external magnetic field was applied, it formed a strong chain structure, acting like a solid with a yield stress. Further solid-like behaviors were observed from storage shear relaxation and viscoelastic tests. Finally, the Fe₃O₄/POA nanoparticles showed better dispersion stability than pure Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with 50% improvement.",New Triphenylamine-Based Oligomeric Schiff Bases Containing Tetraphenylsilane Moieties in the Backbone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960202,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Three new triphenylamine-based oligomeric Schiff bases (polySB1, polySB2 and polySB3) containing tetraphenylsilane core (TPS-core) in the main chain were obtained from TPS-core-based diamines and bis(4-formylphenyl)phenylamine by a high-temperature polycondensation reaction. These new oligomers were structurally characterized by FT-IR, NMR and elemental analysis. All polySBs were highly soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene. Samples showed moderate molecular average molecular weight (Mw) and a high thermal stability above 410 °C. Likewise, polySBs showed absorption near 400 nm in the UV-vis range and photoluminescence. The HOMO levels and band-gap values were found in the ranges of -6.06 to -6.18 eV and 2.65⁻2.72 eV, respectively. The lowest band-gap value was observed for polySB2, which could be attributed to a more effective π-conjugation across the main chain. The results suggest that silicon-containing polySBs are promising wide-band-gap semiconductors materials for optoelectronic applications.",Modeling the Optimal Conditions for Improved Efficacy and Crosslink Depth of Photo-Initiated Polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960200,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Optimal conditions for maximum efficacy of photoinitiated polymerization are theoretically presented. Analytic formulas are shown for the crosslink time, crosslink depth, and efficacy function. The roles of photoinitiator (PI) concentration, diffusion depth, and light intensity on the polymerization spatial and temporal profiles are presented for both uniform and non-uniform cases. For the type I mechanism, higher intensity may accelerate the polymer action process, but it suffers a lower steady-state efficacy. This may be overcome by a controlled re-supply of PI concentration during the light exposure. In challenging the conventional Beer⁻Lambert law (BLL), a generalized, time-dependent BLL (a Lin-law) is derived. This study, for the first time, presents analytic formulas for curing depth and crosslink time without the assumption of thin-film or spatial average. Various optimal conditions are developed for maximum efficacy based on a numerically-fit A-factor.

Polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) formed between cationic chitosan (CHT) and anionic polymers of cyclodextrin (PCD) render a hydrogel of great interest. Given the difference between water-soluble (PCDs) and water-insoluble PCD (PCDi) in the extension of polymerization, the present study aims to explore their impact on the formation and properties of CHT/PCD hydrogel obtained from the variable ratios of PCDi and PCDs in the formulation. Hydrogels CHT/PCDi/PCDs at weight ratios of 3:0:3, 3:1.5:1.5, and 3:3:0 were elaborated in a double⁻syringe system. The chemical composition, microstructure, viscoelastic properties, injectability, and structural integrity of the hydrogels were investigated. The cytotoxicity of the hydrogel was also evaluated by indirect contact with pre-osteoblast cells. Despite having similar shear⁻thinning and self-healing behaviors, the three hydrogels showed a marked difference in their rheological characteristics, injectability, structural stability, etc., depending on their PCDi and PCDs contents. Among the three, all the best above-mentioned properties, in addition to a high cytocompatibility, were found in the hydrogel 3:1.5:1.5. For the first time, we gained a deeper understanding of the role of the PCDi/PCDs in the injectable pre-formed hydrogels (CHT/PCDi/PCDs), which could be further fine-tuned to enhance their performance in biomedical applications.",Correlation of Montmorillonite Sheet Thickness and Flame Retardant Behavior of a Chitosan⁻Montmorillonite Nanosheet Membrane Assembled on Flexible Polyurethane Foam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960197,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polymer⁻clay membranes constructed via the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, with a nanobrick wall structure, are known to exhibit high flame retardancy. In this work, chitosan⁻montmorillonite nanosheet (CH⁻MMTNS) membranes with different thickness of MMTNS were constructed to suppress the flammability of flexible polyurethane (FPU) foam. It was found that a thinner MMTNS membrane was more efficient in terms of reducing the flammability of the FPU foam. This was because such MMTNS membrane could deposit cheek by jowl and form a dense CH⁻MMTNS membrane on the foam surface, thus greatly limiting the translation of heat, oxygen, and volatile gases. In contrast, a thicker MMTNS constructed a fragmentary CH⁻MMTNS membrane on the coated foam surface, due to its greater gravity and weaker electrostatic attraction of chitosan; thus, the flame retardancy of a thick MMTNS membrane was lower. Moreover, the finding of different deposition behaviors of MMTNS membranes with different thickness may suggest improvements for the application of clay with the LbL assembly technology.",Enhanced Foamability with Shrinking Microfibers in Linear Polymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960196,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Strain hardening has important roles in understanding material structures and polymer processing methods, such as foaming, film forming, and fiber extruding. A common method to improve strain hardening behavior is to chemically branch polymer structures, which is costly, thus preventing users from controlling the degree of behavior. A smart microfiber blending technology, however, would allow cost-efficient tuning of the degree of strain hardening. In this study, we investigated the effects of compounding polymers with microfibers for both shear and extensional rheological behaviors and characteristics and thus for the final foam morphologies formed by batch physical foaming with carbon dioxide. Extensional rheometry showed that compounding of in situ shrinking microfibers significantly enhanced strain hardening compared to compounding of nonshrinking microfibers. Shear rheometry with linear viscoelastic data showed a greater increase in both the loss and storage modulus in composites with shrinking microfibers than in those with nonshrinking microfibers at low frequencies. The batch physical foaming results demonstrated a greater increase in the cell population density and expansion ratio with in situ shrinking microfibers than with nonshrinking microfibers. The enhancement due to the shrinkage of compounded microfibers decreasing with temperature implies that the strain hardening can be tailored by changing processing conditions.",Chiral MnIII (Salen) Immobilized on Organic Polymer/Inorganic Zirconium Hydrogen Phosphate Functionalized with 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane as an Efficient and Recyclable Catalyst for Enantioselective Epoxidation of Styrene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960195,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Organic polymers/inorganic zirconium hydrogen phosphate (ZSPP, ZPS-IPPA, and ZPS-PVPA) functionalized with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane were prepared and used to support chiral MnIII (salen) complexes (Jacobsen's catalyst). Different characterization methods demonstrated that the chiral MnIII (salen) complexes was successfully supported on the surface of the carrier (ZSPP, ZPS-IPPA, or ZPS-PVPA) through a 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane group spacer. The supported catalysts effectively catalyzed epoxidation of styrene with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) as an oxidant in the presence of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) as an axial base. These results (ee%, 53.3⁻63.9) were significantly better than those achieved under a homogeneous counterpart (ee%, 46.2). Moreover, it is obvious that there was no significant decrease in catalytic activity after the catalyst 3 was recycled four times (cons%: from 95.0 to 92.6; ee%: from 64.7 to 60.1). Further recycles of catalyst 3 resulted in poor conversions, although the enantioselectivity obtained was still higher than that of corresponding homogeneous catalyst even after eight times. After the end of the eighth reaction, the solid catalyst was allowed to stand in 2 mol/L of dilute hydrochloric acid overnight, prompting an unexpected discovery that the catalytic activity of the catalyst was recovered again at the 9th and 10th cycles of the catalyst.",Enhancement in the Physico-Mechanical Functions of Seaweed Biopolymer Film via Embedding Fillers for Plasticulture Application-A Comparison with Conventional Biodegradable Mulch Film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960194,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study aimed to compare the performance of fabricated microbially induced precipitated calcium carbonate⁻ (MB⁻CaCO₃) based red seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) bio-polymer film and commercial calcium carbonate⁻ (C⁻CaCO₃) based red seaweed bio-film with the conventional biodegradable mulch film. To the best of our knowledge, there has been limited research on the application of commercial CaCO₃ (C⁻CaCO₃) and microbially induced CaCO₃ (MB⁻CaCO₃) as fillers for the preparation of films from seaweed bio-polymer and comparison with biodegradable commercial plasticulture packaging. The results revealed that the mechanical, contact angle, and biodegradability properties of the polymer composite films incorporated with C⁻CaCO₃ and MB⁻CaCO₃ fillers were comparable or even superior than the conventional biodegradable mulch film. The seaweed polymer film incorporated with MB⁻CaCO₃ showed the highest contact angle of 100.94°, whereas conventional biodegradable mulch film showed a contact angle of 90.25°. The enhanced contact angle of MB⁻CaCO₃ resulted in high barrier properties, which is highly desired in the current scenario for plasticulture packaging application. The water vapor permeability of MB⁻CaCO₃ based seaweed films was low (2.05 ± 1.06 g·m/m²·s·Pa) when compared to conventional mulch film (2.68 ± 0.35 g·m/m²·s·Pa), which makes the fabricated film an ideal candidate for plasticulture application. The highest tensile strength (TS) was achieved by seaweed-based film filled with commercial CaCO₃ (84.92% higher than conventional mulch film). SEM images of the fractured surfaces of the fabricated films revealed the strong interaction between seaweed and fillers. Furthermore, composite films incorporated with MB⁻CaCO₃ promote brighter film, better water barrier, hydrophobicity, and biodegradability compared to C⁻CaCO₃ based seaweed polymer film and conventional mulch film. From this demonstrated work, it can be concluded that the fabricated MB⁻CaCO₃ based seaweed biopolymer film will be a promising candidate for plasticulture and agricultural application."

As demonstrating examples, n-hexadecane was selected as a liquid alkane and n-eicosane as a solid in our systems as core materials via in-situ polymerization, respectively. The under-cooling properties of capsules were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry, real-time optical observations with two polarizers, and molecular modeling. The n-hexadecane encapsulated capsules exhibited a large under-cooling temperature range of 20 °C between melt and crystallization, indicating potential applications for structure-transformation energy storage. In addition, molecular modeling calculations confirmed that the solid forms of n-hexadecane and n-eicosane are more stable than their liquid forms. From liquid to solid form, the n-hexadecane and n-eicosane release energies were 4.63 × 10³ and 4.95 × 10³ J·g-1, respectively.",Effect of Panel Construction on the Ballistic Performance of Multiply 3D through-the-Thickness Angle-Interlock fabrIc Reinforced Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960182,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This paper studied the ballistic performance of 3D woven angle-interlock fabric reinforced composites with different types of panel construction. Two types of composites P10B and P17C were designed to have the same areal density of around 12 kg/m² although they both had different ply areal densities and consisted of different numbers of plies. Non-perforated ballistic impacts were conducted on the two types of panels under the same level of impact energy. Post-mortem examination on the non-perforated panels was conducted through the cross-sectional images, planar projected delamination and 3D damage volume extracted from the non-destructive tests. Three distinctive sections of damage were segmented from the non-perforated panels, each indicating different material failure modes upon impact. Under the same areal density, the coarser composite panel P10B with a larger ply areal density and fewer reinforcement plies would result in less damage. The damage volume of P10B is nearly one-third that of the P17C. The findings are instructive for the design of 3D woven fabric continuously reinforced composites with doubly-curved shapes.","An Eco-Friendly Method to Get a Bio-Based Dicarboxylic Acid Monomer 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid and Its Application in the Synthesis of Poly(hexylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PHF).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960181,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Recently, we have developed an eco-friendly method for the preparation of a renewable dicarboxylic acid 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from biomass-based 5-hydroxymethylfrufural (HMF). In the present work, we optimized our reported method, which used phosphate buffer and Fe(OH)₃ as the stabilizer to improve the stability of potassium ferrate, then got a purified FDCA (up to 99%) in high yield (91.7 wt %) under mild conditions (25 °C, 15 min, air atmosphere). Subsequently, the obtained FDCA, along with 1,6-hexanediol (HDO), which was also made from HMF, were used as monomers for the synthesis of poly(hexylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PHF) via direct esterification, and triphenyl phosphite was used as the antioxidant to alleviate the discoloration problem during the esterification.

The results exhibit that the thermal stability of PVC is positively enhanced after the addition of ZnOr₂. In contrast with a commercial thermal stabilizer, zinc stearate (ZnSt₂), a noteworthy improvement was observed that ZnOr₂ could postpone the ""zinc burning"" of PVC. This is principally ascribed to the Or anion in the structure of ZnOr₂ being able to absorb the HCl released by PVC, and to supersede unstable chlorine atoms in the structure of PVC. In addition, blending ZnOr₂ with calcium stearate (CaSt₂) in diverse mass ratios can significantly accelerate the thermal stability of PVC. Optimum performance was achieved with a CaSt₂:ZnOr₂ ratio of 1.8:1.2. Moreover, an outstanding synergistic effect can be observed when CaSt₂/ZnOr₂ is coupled with other commercial auxiliary stabilizers. The initial color and long-term stability of PVC including CaSt₂/ZnOr₂ is significantly increased when pentaerythritol (PER) is added, while dibenzoylmethane (DBM) can only improve its long-term thermal stability.","A New Synthesis Strategy on Styrene-Butadiene Di-Block Copolymer Containing High cis-1,4 Unit Via Transfer of Anionic to Coordination Polymerization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960178,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A novel synthesis strategy on styrene-butadiene di-block copolymer (PS-b-PB) with high cis-1,4 unit content was developed, based on a transfer technique from anionic to coordination polymerization. Firstly, the styrene monomer was initiated by n-butyllithium (Li) utilizing anionic polymerization at 50 °C, which resulted in a macromolecular alkylating initiator (PSLi). Secondly, PSLi was aged with nickel naphthenate (Ni) and boron trifluoride etherate (B) for obtaining a complex catalyst system (Ni/PSLi/B). Then, Ni/PSLi/B was applied to initiate the butadiene (Bd) polymerization. Following this new strategy, a series of PS-b-PBs were successfully synthesized.

Black phosphorene (BP) has outstanding flame retardant properties, however, it causes the mechanical degradation of waterborne polyurethane (WPU). In order to solve this problem, the graphene is introduced to fabricate the black phosphorene/graphene (BP/G) composite material by high-pressure nano-homogenizer machine (HNHM). The structure, thermo-stability, flame retardant properties, and mechanical performance of composites are analyzed by a series of tests. The structure characterization results show that the BP/G composite material can distribute uniformly into the WPU. The addition of BP/G significantly improves the residues of WPU in both of TG analysis (5.64%) and cone calorimeter (CC) test (12.50%), which indicate that the BP/G can effectively restrict the degradation of WPU under high temperature. The CC test indicates that BP/G/WPU has a lower peak release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR), which decrease by 48.18% and 38.63%, respectively, than that of the pure WPU, respectively. The mechanical analysis presents that the Young's modulus of the BP/G/WPU has an increase of seven times more than that of the BP/WPU, which indicates that the introduce of graphene can effectively improve the mechanical properties of BP/WPU.",Synthesis of Zwitterionic Copolymers via Copper-Mediated Aqueous Living Radical Grafting Polymerization on Starch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960176,Polymers,2019 04 11,"[2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (SBMA) is a well-studied sulfobetaine-methacrylate as its zwitterionic structure allows the synthesis of polymers with attractive properties like antifouling and anti-polyelectrolyte behavior.

Monomer conversion was monitored by ¹H-NMR, on the basis of which the reaction kinetics were determined. Both kinetic study and GPC results indicate reasonable controlled polymerization. Furthermore, a preliminary study of the thermal response behavior was also carried through rheological tests performed on aqueous solutions of the prepared materials. Results show that branched zwitterionic polymers are more thermal-sensitive than linear ones.",Effect of Operational Conditions on the Behaviour and Associated Costs of Mixed Microbial Cultures for PHA Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960175,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Massive production and disposal of petrochemical derived plastics represent relevant environmental problems. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a renewable alternative that can even be produced from wastes. The production of PHA from acetate using mixed microbial cultures was studied. The effect of two key operational conditions was evaluated, i.e., substrate concentration and cycle length. The effects of these factors on several responses were studied using a surface response methodology. Several reactors were operated under selected conditions for at least 10 solids retention times to ensure stable operation. Results show that conditions providing higher PHA content involve lower biomass productivities. This has a great impact on biomass production costs. Results suggest then that PHA content alone may not be a reasonable criterion for determining optimal conditions for PHB production. If production costs need to be reduced, conditions that provide a lower PHA content in the selection reactor, but a higher biomass productivity may be of interest.",Synergistic Effect of Fullerenes on the Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structuring of Poly(3-Hexyl Thiophene).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960174,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Ordered and homogeneous laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) could be fabricated in poly(3-hexyl thiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC71BM) blends by using wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) range (266 nm). The absorption coefficient of PC71BM, which is maximum in its UV⁻Visible absorption spectrum around 266 nm, enhanced the overall absorption of the blend. In addition, PC71BM itself was capable of developing homogeneous LIPSS by laser irradiation at λlaser = 266 nm. Therefore, we proposed that the synergistic effect of PC71BM on the LIPSS formation in P3HT:PC71BM (1:1) was due to a templating effect for the LIPSS formation of the PC71BM itself, which added to the overall increment of the absorption of the blend. LIPSS formation at ambient conditions in this wavelength range led to chemical modification of both P3HT and PC71BM, which rendered to non-conducting samples. Irradiation in vacuum significantly reduced radiation damage, rendering to the characteristic electrical conductivity pattern observed in P3HT LIPSS samples irradiated in the visible range. This effect could be of potential interest in order to obtain LIPSS in low absorbing polymers."

Characterizations of symmetrical EC devices, built on combinations of PEDOT thin films, deposited with a bar coater from commercial inks, and separated by a lithium-based ionic membrane, show highest performance for 800 nm thickness. Tuning of the color is further achieved by mixing the PEDOT film with oxides. Taking, in particular, the example of optically inactive iron oxide Fe₂O₃, a dark blue to reddish switch, of which intensity depends on the oxide content, is reported.

Herein, an all-solid-state supercapacitor is prepared through an in situ growth method. The electrode contains polyaniline deposited on a carbon nanotube and a poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) film. The hybrid electrode exhibits excellent mechanical and electrochemical performance. The optimized few-layer polyaniline wrapping layer provides a conductive network that effectively enhances the cycling stability, as 66.4% of the starting capacitance is maintained after 3000 charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, the polyaniline (PANI)-50 displays the highest areal energy density of 83.6 mWh·cm-2, with an areal power density of 1000 mW·cm-2, and a high areal capacity of 620 mF cm-2. The assembled device delivers a high areal capacity (192.3 mF·cm-2) at the current density of 0.1 mA·cm-2, a high areal energy (26.7 mWh·cm-2) at the power density of 100 mW·cm-2, and shows no significant decrease in the performance with a bending angle of 180°. This unique flexible supercapacitor thus exhibits great potential for wearable electronics.",Investigation of Chitosan Nanoparticles Loaded with Protocatechuic Acid (PCA) for the Resistance of Pyricularia oryzae Fungus against Rice Blast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960161,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, chitosan nanoparticles were used as a carrier for Protocatechuic acid (PCA) to resist Pyricularia oryzae against rice blast. The final compound was characterized using zeta potentials for its surface electricity, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted for functional groups and for particle sizes and shape, respectively. The zeta potential results showed that loading PCA causes chitosan nanoparticle (CSNP) to decrease in surface electrons. The TEM images revealed that the particle size of chitosan (CS), although increasing in size when carrying PCA molecules, showed sufficient size for reasonable penetration into fungal cells. The FT-IR analysis showed that all functional group in CSNP carried PCA matched with previous studies. The antifungal test showed that diameters of inhibition zone of CS increases significantly after loading PCA, exhibiting the strongest antimicrobial effect on the Pyricularia oryzae fungus compared with weaker effects exhibited by CSNP alone or PCA. Our results suggested that CSNP loaded with PCA could be a potential compound for eradication of Pyricularia oryzae and that further testing on in vitro rice plants is recommended to reaffirm this possibility.",Use of Grafted Voltage Stabilizer to Enhance Dielectric Strength of Cross-Linked Polyethylene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960160,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Aromatic voltage stabilizers can improve the dielectric properties of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE); however, their poor compatibility with XLPE hinders their practical application. Improving the compatibility of aromatic voltage stabilizers with XLPE has, therefore, become a new research goal. Herein 1-(4-vinyloxy)phenylethenone (VPE) was prepared and characterized. It can be grafted onto polyethylene molecules during the cross-linking processes to promote stability of the aromatic voltage stabilizers in XLPE. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that VPE was successfully grafted onto XLPE, and effectively inhibited thermal migration. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the grafted VPE/XLPE composite exhibits a better thermal stability than a VPE/PE blend composite. Evaluation of the electrical properties showed that the breakdown strength and electrical tree initiation voltage of the VPE/XLPE composite were increased by 15.5% and 39.6%, respectively, when compared to those of bare XLPE. After thermal aging, the breakdown strength and electrical tree initiation voltage of the VPE/XLPE composite were increased by 9.4% and 25.8%, respectively, in comparison to those of bare XLPE, which indicates that the grafted voltage stabilizer can effectively inhibit its migration and enhance the stability of the composite material.",Morphology Evolution and Rheological Behaviors of PP/SR Thermoplastic Vulcanizate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960159,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) of polypropylene (PP)/silicone rubber (SR) were prepared by dynamic vulcanization (DV) technology. The mixing torque, morphology, viscoelasticity, and creep response of PP/SR TPVs were investigated by torque rheometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), rotational rheometer, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). A mixing-torque study showed that torque change and dynamic-vulcanization time increased with SR content increasing in the DV process, but DV rate was independent of SR content. TEM images indicated that the phase inversion of PP/SR-60 TPV from bicontinuous to a sea⁻island structure took place in the DV process, and a hot press would break the rubber aggregates and shrink a large SR phase. Dynamic-strain measurement demonstrated that PP/SR TPVs exhibit a distinct ""Payne effect"", which can be attributed to the destruction and reconstruction of SR physical networks. Complex viscosity indicated that SR content did not affect the processability of PP/SR TPVs at high shear rates. Furthermore, the creep deformation and recovery of PP/SR TPVs at solid and melt states were studied, respectively.",Biocompatibility of Small-Diameter Vascular Grafts in Different Modes of RGD Modification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960158,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Modification with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides is a promising approach to improve biocompatibility of small-calibre vascular grafts but it is unknown how different RGD sequence composition impacts graft performance. Here we manufactured 1.5 mm poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)/poly(ε-caprolactone) grafts modified by distinct linear or cyclic RGD peptides immobilized by short or long amine linker arms. Modified vascular prostheses were tested in vitro to assess their mechanical properties, hemocompatibility, thrombogenicity and endothelialisation. We also implanted these grafts into rat abdominal aortas with the following histological examination at 1 and 3 months to evaluate their primary patency, cellular composition and detect possible calcification. Our results demonstrated that all modes of RGD modification reduce ultimate tensile strength of the grafts. Modification of prostheses does not cause haemolysis upon the contact with modified grafts, yet all the RGD-treated grafts display a tendency to promote platelet aggregation in comparison with unmodified counterparts. In vivo findings identify that cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys peptide in combination with trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine linker group substantially improve graft biocompatibility. To conclude, here we for the first time compared synthetic small-diameter vascular prostheses with different modes of RGD modification. We suggest our graft modification regimen as enhancing graft performance and thus recommend it for future use in tissue engineering.",Towards Detection of Glycoproteins Using Molecularly Imprinted Nanoparticles and Boronic Acid-Modified Fluorescent Probe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960157,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Glycoproteins represent a group of important biomarkers for cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Selective detection of specific glycoproteins is an important step for early diagnosis. Traditional glycoprotein assays are mostly based on lectins, antibodies, and enzymes, biochemical reagents that are costly and require special cold chain storage and distribution. To address the shortcomings of the existing glycoprotein assays, we propose a new approach using protein-imprinted nanoparticles to replace the traditional lectins and antibodies. Protein-imprinted binding sites were created on the surface of silica nanoparticles by copolymerization of dopamine and aminophenylboronic acid. The imprinted nanoparticles were systematically characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. A boronic acid-modified fluorescent probe was used to detect the target glycoprotein captured by the imprinted nanoparticles. Using horseradish peroxidase as a model glycoprotein, we demonstrated that the proposed method can be applied to detect target protein containing multiple glycosylation sites. Because of their outstanding stability and low cost, imprinted nanoparticles and synthetic probes are attractive replacements of traditional biochemical reagents to develop simpler, faster, and more cost-effective analytical methods for glycoproteins.",Controllable Crimpness of Animal Hairs via Water-Stimulated Shape Fixation for Regulation of Thermal Insulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960156,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Animals living in extremely cold plateau areas have shown amazing ability to maintain their bodies warmth, a benefit of their hair's unique structures and crimps. Investigation of hair crimps using a water-stimulated shape fixation effect would control the hair's crimpness with a specific wetting-drying process thereafter, in order to achieve the regulation of hair thermal insulation. The mechanism of hair's temporary shape fixation was revealed through FTIR and XRD characterizations for switching on and off the hydrogen bonds between macromolecules via penetration into and removal of aqueous molecules. The thermal insulation of hairs was regulated by managing the hair temporary crimps, that is, through managing the multiple reflectance of infrared light by hair hierarchical crimps from hair root to head.",Patterned Polyvinyl Alcohol Hydrogel Dressings with Stem Cells Seeded for Wound Healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960155,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel and stem cell therapy have been widely used in wound healing. However, the lack of bioactivity for PVA and security of stem therapy limited their application. In this study, an adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)-seeded PVA dressing (ADSCs/PVA) was prepared for wound healing. One side of the PVA dressing was modified with photo-reactive gelatin (Az-Gel) via ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (Az-Gel@PVA), and thus ADSCs could adhere, proliferate on the PVA dressings and keep the other side of the dressings without adhering to the wound. The structure and mechanics of Az-Gel@PVA were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and material testing instruments. Then, the adhesion and proliferation of ADSCs were observed via cell counts and live-dead staining. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments were utilized to confirm the effect of ADSCs/PVA dressing for wound healing. The results showed that Az-Gel was immobilized on the PVA and showed little effect on the mechanical properties of PVA hydrogels. The surface-modified PVA could facilitate ADSCs adhesion and proliferation. Protein released tests indicated that the bioactive factors secreted from ADSCs could penetrated to the wound. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments both suggested the ADSCs/PVA could promote the wound healing via secreting bioactive factors from ADSCs. It was speculated that the ADSCs/PVA dressing could not only promote the wound healing, but also provide a new way for the safe application of stem cells, which would be of great potential for skin tissue engineering.",Analysis and Identification of the Mechanism of Damage and Fracture of High-Filled Wood Fiber/Recycled High-Density Polyethylene Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960154,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The damage and fracture of fiber reinforced polymer composites are vital constraints in their applications. To understand the mechanism of damage of wood fiber (WF) reinforced high density polyethylene (HDPE) composites, we used waste WF and recycled HDPE (Re-HDPE) as the raw materials and prepared high-filled WF/Re-HDPE composites via extrusion. The damage and fracture mode and failure mechanism of the composites with different WF contents (50%, 60%, and 70%) was studied under a three-point bending test by combining the acoustic emission (AE) technique and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The results show that AE technology can better assist in understanding the progress of damage and fracture process of WF/Re-HDPE composites, and determine the damage degree, damage accumulation, and damage mode. The damage and fracture process of the composites presents three main stages: the appearance of initial damage, damage accumulation, and destructive damage to fracture. The matrix deformation, fiber breakage, interface delamination, fiber-matrix debonding, fiber pull-out, and matrix cracking were the dominant modes for the damage of high-filled WF/Re-HDPE composites under bending load, and the AE signal changed in different damage stages and damage modes. In addition, the WF content and repeated loading had a significant influence on the composite's damage and fracture. The 50% and 60% WF/Re-HDPE composites produced irreversible damage when repeated load exceeded 75% of the maximum load, while 25% of the maximum load could cause irreversible damage for 70% WF/Re-HDPE composites. The damage was accumulated owing to repeated loading and the mechanical properties of the composites were seriously affected."

Fractions were confirmed to be nonstarch, nonreducing sugars, nonpolyphenols and protein-unbounded acidic polysaccharides. Interestingly, a significant difference in solubility was found between WEP-0.3 (higher solubility than WEP) and WEP-0.4 (remarkably insoluble), which was consistent with the amorphous and porous sponge-like structure of WEP-0.3 as well as the crystalline and dense rod-like state of WEP-0.4. However, the result of the FT-IR spectra was contradicted by the solubility of WEP-0.4, which possessed the lowest degree of methoxylation and ought to possess the highest solubility. Through mineral analysis, a considerably high content of Ca2+ was found in WEP-0.4, suggesting that the low solubility of WEP-0.4 was probably attributable to the formation of microgels during dialysis. Therefore, metal divalent cations in the dialysate were suggested to be depleted for the dialysis of low methoxyl pectin.",Sol⁻Gel-Processed Organic⁻Inorganic Hybrid for Flexible Conductive Substrates Based on Gravure-Printed Silver Nanowires and Graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960142,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, an organic⁻inorganic (O⁻I) nanohybrid obtained by incorporating an alkoxysilane-functionalized amphiphilic polymer precursor into a SiO₂⁻TiO₂ hybrid network was successfully utilized as a buffer layer to fabricate a flexible, transparent, and stable conductive substrate for solution-processed silver nanowires (AgNWs) and graphene under ambient conditions. The resulting O⁻I nanohybrid sol (denoted as AGPTi) provided a transmittance of the spin-coated AgNWs on an AGPTi-coated glass of 99.4% and high adhesion strength after a 3M tape test, with no visible changes in the AgNWs. In addition, AGPTi acted as a highly functional buffer layer, absorbing the applied pressure between the conductive materials, AgNWs and graphene, and rigid substrate, leading to a significant reduction in sheet resistance. Furthermore, gravure-printed AgNWs and graphene on the AGPTi-based flexible substrate had uniform line widths of 490 ± 15 and 470 ± 12 µm, with 1000-cycle bending durabilities, respectively.",Synthesis of Propylene-co-Styrenic Monomer Copolymers via Arylation of Chlorinated PP and Their Compatibilization for PP/PS Blend.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960141,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A series of propylene-co-styrenic monomer copolymers were synthesized using the Friedel⁻Crafts alkylation reaction between chlorinated PP and substituted benzene, and the effects of these copolymers on a PP/PS (80/20) blend were investigated by using the impact test, morphology observation, thermo- and dynamic mechanical analysis, and rheology measurements. The results showed that the compatibilization efficiency varied as the variation of the substitute on the benzene ring of the styrenic monomer unit was incorporated in the PP chain in an order of methyl > ethyl > methoxyl. The copolymers bearing a crystalline isotactic polypropylene chain sequence and rubbery propylene-co-styrene-like unit chain segments may prepossess imaginable applications, giving an example for the synthesis and applications of PP-based copolymers, initiating a new way to broaden the polyolefin-based material family.",Preparation of PVDF/Hyperbranched-Nano-Palygorskite Composite Membrane for Efficient Removal of Heavy Metal Ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960140,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, three kinds of hyperbranched polyamidoamine-palygorskite (PAMAM-Pal) were designed and synthesized by grafting the first generation polyamidoamine (G1.0 PAMAM), G2.0 PAMAM and G3.0 PAMAM onto Pal surfaces, respectively. Then, these PAMAM-Pals were used as additives to prepare polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/hyperbranched polyamidoamine-palygorskite bicomponent composite membranes. The structures of the composite membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermo gravimetric analysis (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption properties of composite membranes to heavy metal ions was studied, and the results found that the maximum adsorption capacities for Cu(II), Ni(II) and Cd(II) could reach 155.19 mg/g, 124.28 mg/g and 125.55 mg/g, respectively, for the PVDF/G3.0 PAMAM-Pal membrane, while only 23.70 mg/g, 17.74 mg/g and 14.87 mg/g could be obtained for unmodified membranes in the same conditions. The high adsorption capacity can be ascribed to the large number of amine-terminated groups, amide groups and carbonyl groups of the composite membrane. The above results indicated that the prepared composite membrane has a high adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions removal in water treatment.",Hierarchical Ag Nanostructures Fabricated from Silver Coordination Polymers for Antibacterial Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960139,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A hierarchical silver nanostructure with improved antibacterial property was fabricated utilizing silver coordination polymer. Octadecanethiolate⁻silver polymer was synthesized to have a layered structure and was coated on silicon wafer by drop-casting method utilizing hydrophobic⁻hydrophobic interaction. Thus, the silver coordination polymer was calcined under reductive condition to produce zero-valent silver with a hierarchical nanostructure. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that layered silver coordination polymer successfully transformed to hexagonal silver upon calcination. According to scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, silver coordination polymer with ~145.5 nm size was homogeneously coated on the surface before calcination, and it evolved micrometer-sized lumps and grooves which were composed of ~58.8 nm sized Ag nanoparticles. The hierarchical structure-micrometer lump/groove consisting of Ag nanoparticles-would be advantageous to kill bacteria; micrometer-grooves provide physical condition (pocket for bacteria capture) and the Ag nanoparticles from the neighboring lump endow chemical condition (antibacterial property of released Ag⁺). The antibacterial activity test on Escherichia coli via colony forming inhibitory assay indeed exhibited an improved antibacterial activity of hierarchical Ag nanostructure compared with the surface simply coated with Ag nanoparticles. From the line profile of atomic force microscopy, the bacterium trapped in the hierarchical Ag nanostructure was shown to interact intimately with Ag surface.",Orientation and Dispersion Evolution of Carbon Nanotubes in Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene Composites under Extensional-Shear Coupled Flow: A Dissipative Particle Dynamics Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960138,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The property of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based composites are significantly dependent on the orientation and dispersion evolution of CNTs in the polymer matrix. In this work, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to discover the orientation and dispersion evolution of CNTs in ultra⁻high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) under extensional⁻shear coupled flow conditions for the first time. In this paper, we investigate the roles of the increasing extensional-shear coupled rate in morphology of CNTs/UHMWPE composites by varying CNTs concentration and observe that the system under consideration lies in the same evolution morphologies. When comparing our results for various morphologies, we notice that the orientation is affected more significantly by changing the extensional-shear coupled rates. A good alignment appears with an increase of extensional-shear coupled rates, which transform it into ordered morphology. In addition, a higher extensional-shear coupled rate does not necessarily contribute to better dispersion even though CNTs concentration varies, as shown by the mean square displacement (MSD) and the relative concentration distribution functions of CNTs in CNTs/UHMWPE composites.","A Comparative Study on the Characterization of Nanofibers with Cellulose I, I/II, and II Polymorphs from Wood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960137,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polymorphic changes in cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are closely related to their properties and applications, and it is of interest to investigate how polymorphic changes influence their properties. A comparative study on the properties of CNFs with cellulose I, I/II, and II polymorphs from wood was conducted herein. CNFs were obtained by chemical extraction combined with a simple and efficient mechanical treatment (one pass through a grinder). This process resulted in a relatively high yield of 80⁻85% after a simple grinding treatment. The polymorphic changes in the CNFs and the chemical composition, morphology, tensile performances, and thermal properties were systematically characterized and compared. The X-ray diffraction and FTIR analyses verified the existence of three types of purified pulps and CNFs with cellulose I, cellulose I/II, and cellulose II polymorphs (CNF-I, CNF-I/II, CNF-II). Morphological observations presented that these three types of CNFs all exhibited high aspect ratios and entangled structures. Tensile testing showed that the CNF films all exhibited high tensile strengths, and the fracture strains of the CNF-I/II (11.8%) and CNF-II (13.0%) films were noticeably increased compared to those of the CNF-I film (6.0%). If CNF-II is used as reinforcing material, its larger fracture strain can improve the mechanical performance of the CNF composites, such as fracture toughness and impact strength. In addition, CNF-I, CNF-I/II, and CNF-II films showed very low thermal expansion in the range 20⁻150 °C, with the coefficient of thermal expansion values of 9.4, 17.1, and 17.3 ppm/K, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the degradation temperature of CNF-I and CNF-II was greater than that of CNF-I/II, which was likely due to increased α-cellulose content. This comparative study of the characterization of CNF-I, CNF-I/II, and CNF-II provides a theoretical basis for the application of CNFs with different polymorphs and could broaden the applications of CNFs.",Resistance to Cleavage of Core⁻Shell Rubber/Epoxy Composite Foam Adhesive under Impact Wedge⁻Peel Condition for Automobile Structural Adhesive.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960136,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Epoxy foam adhesives are widely used for weight reduction, watertight property, and mechanical reinforcement effects. However, epoxy foam adhesives have poor impact resistance at higher expansion ratios. Hence, we prepared an epoxy composite foam adhesive with core⁻shell rubber (CSR) particles to improve the impact resistance and applied it to automotive structural adhesives. The curing behavior and pore structure were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray computed tomography (CT), respectively, and impact wedge⁻peel tests were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the resistance to cleavage of the CSR/epoxy composite foam adhesives under impact. At 5 and 10 phr CSR contents, the pore size and expansion ratio increased sufficiently due to the decrease in curing rate. However, at 20 phr CSR content, the pore size decreased, which might be due to the steric hindrance effect of the CSR particles. Notably, at 0 and 0.1 phr foaming agent contents, the resistance to cleavage of the adhesives under the impact wedge⁻peel condition significantly improved with increasing CSR content. Thus, the CSR/epoxy composite foam adhesive containing 0.1 phr foaming agent and 20 phr CSR particles showed high impact resistance (EC = 34,000 mJ/cm²) and sufficient expansion ratio (~148%).",The Improvement Effect and Mechanism of Longitudinal Ultrasonic Vibration on the Injection Molding Quality of a Polymeric Micro-Needle Array.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960135,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A polymeric micro-needle array with high quality has been fabricated using a longitudinal ultrasonic-assisted micro-injection molding (LUμIM) method. To realize the practicability and stability in actual industrial processing, this paper is aimed at studying the improvement mechanism of ultrasonic vibration on the molding quality. The melt-filling process in the micro-needle array cavity is simulated, and the improvement effect of ultrasonic vibration is discussed. The enhancement effect of ultrasonic vibration on material properties of polypropylene and polymethylmethacrylate parts are experimentally investigated. The results show that in the manufacturing of the micro-needle array part using LUμIM, the mold-filling quality is improved by the enhanced melt filling capability and pressure compensation effect, which are caused by the increased corner viscosity gradient, reduced the filling time and melt viscosity under ultrasonic vibration. Material properties of both the semi-crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer could be enhanced by the transformation of micromorphology. It is proved that for a semi-crystalline polymer, this novel method could be employed as a material properties enhancement method, and an optimal excitation voltage of ultrasonic vibration is obtained to achieve the best material properties.",Impact Energy Release Characteristics of PTFE/Al/CuO Reactive Materials Measured by a New Energy Release Testing Device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960133,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Metal/polymer reactive materials have been studied and applied in a wide range of ways in recent years. This type of material is insensitive under normal conditions but reacts violently and releases a large amount of chemical energy under high-speed impact or high strain rate loading conditions. Compared with conventional explosives, it has better mechanical properties, and its unit mass energy is several times that of TNT. In this paper, PTFE/Al/CuO reactive materials are the main research objects, and we assess the impact energy release abilities of this type of reactive material through experimental research. To this end, eight sets of material formulations are designed, and the effects of particle size, the ratio of PTFE/Al and Al/CuO materials, and sintering on the energy release ability of the reactive materials are investigated. All experiments are carried out based on a self-designed new energy release testing device. The experimental device can measure the pressure time history curve generated by the reactive materials, and the rationality of the pressure time history curve can also be verified by the displacement time curve of the piston. The results show that with an increase in the Al/CuO thermite content, the energy release rate of the reactive material clearly increases, which is attributed to the reaction threshold of Al/CuO being low and because the heat generated can promote the reaction of PTFE/Al. The energy release rate of the nano-scale reactive materials is higher than that of the micron-scale reactive materials because the reduction in particle size results in a larger specific surface area. Thus, the energy required for ignition is lower. The energy release rate of sintered reactive materials is higher than that of unsintered reactive materials, which can be explained by the interfacial area between Al particles and PTFE particles in sintered reactive materials being larger, which makes the reaction more sufficient. The self-designed energy release testing device for the reactive materials and the conclusions obtained in this paper have clear significance for guiding engineering applications."

In particular, the tensile characteristic of rubber composites is important for the stability of industrial equipment because it determines the energy absorption rates and vibration damping. However, when a product is used for a long period of time, polymers become hardened owing to the changes in characteristics because of aging, thereby reducing the performance and increasing the possibility of accidents. Therefore, accurately predicting the mechanical properties of polymers is important for preventing industrial accidents while operating a machine. In general reactions, the linear Arrhenius equation is used to predict the aging characteristics; however, for rubber composites, it is more accurate to predict the aging characteristics using nonlinear equations rather than linear equations. However, the reason that the characteristic equation of the polymer appears nonlinear is not well known, and studies on the change in the characteristics of the natural and butadiene rubber owing to degradation are still lacking. In this study, a tensile test is performed with different aging temperatures and aging time to evaluate the aging characteristics of rubber composites using strain energy density. We propose a block effect of crosslink structure to express the nonlinear aging characteristics, assuming that a limited reaction can occur owing to the blocking of reactants in the rubber composites. Consequently, we found that a relationship exists between the crosslink structure and aging characteristics when the reduction in crosslink space owing to aging is represented stochastically. In addition, a modified Arrhenius equation, which is expressed as a function of time, is proposed to predict the degradation rate for all aging temperatures and aging times, and the formula is validated by comparing the degradation rate obtained experimentally with the degradation rate predicted by the modified Arrhenius equation.",Glass Fiber-Reinforced Phenol Formaldehyde Resin-Based Electrical Insulating Composites Fabricated by Selective Laser Sintering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960119,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, glass fiber (GF)/phenol formaldehyde resin (PF)/epoxy resin (EP) three-phase electrical insulating composites were fabricated by selective laser sintering (SLS) additive manufacturing technology and subsequent infiltration. In the three-phase composites, glass fibers modified by a silane coupling agent (KH-550) were used as reinforcements, phenol formaldehyde resin acted as the binder and matrix, and infiltrated epoxy resin was the filler. Mechanical and electrical properties such as tensile strength, bending strength, dielectric constant, electrical conductivity, and electric breakdown strength of the GF/PF/EP three-phase composite parts were investigated. The results indicated that after being infiltrated with EP, the bending strength and tensile strength of the GF/PF/EP composites increased by 30% and 42.8%, respectively. Moreover, the flexural strength and tensile strength of the GF/PF/EP composite increased with the increase of the glass fiber content. More importantly, the three-phase composites showed high electrical properties. Significant improvement in the dielectric constant, electric breakdown strength, and resistivity with the increase in the content of glass fiber was observed. This enables the prepared GF/PF/EP composites to form complex structural electrical insulation devices by SLS, which expands the materials and applications of additive manufacturing technology.",Characterization of Solvent-Treated PEDOT:PSS Thin Films with Enhanced Conductivities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960118,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The conducting polymer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the most important and intensively investigated organic conducting materials. The PEDOT:PSS water dispersions with various concentrations of poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid) solution (PSSAS) were synthesized by 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the presence of water. The fabrication of the solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films through spin coating and solvent treatment processes was achieved with a solvent of pure water mixed with acetone (or MeOH, EtOH) in a ratio of 50:50. Moreover, both the organic solvent and water have synergetic effects while the PSS and PEDOT-attached PSS segments will form a coil-like and a linear (or extended-coil) structure, respectively. That may induce a stacking of the linear and planar PEDOT-attached PSS segments, which favors the formation of a crystalline phase. Finally, the maximum electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS thin films with solvent treatment was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Furthermore, we aimed to explain the synergetic effects of phase separation of the PEDOT:PSS thin films by both the organic solvent and water.",β-Cyclodextrin⁻Hyaluronic Acid Polymer Functionalized Magnetic Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites for Targeted Photo-Chemotherapy of Tumor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960117,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A multifunctional targeted drug delivery platform (CDHA⁻MGO) has been successfully constructed by grafting β-cyclodextrin⁻hyaluronic acid polymers (CDHA) to Fe₃O₄⁻graphene oxide (MGO). The obtained CDHA⁻MGO nanocomposite has good water-dispersibility, easy magnetic separation, high near-infrared (NIR) photothermal heating, and excellent biocompatibility. The β-cyclodextrin-hyaluronic acid polymers efficaciously enhance the doxorubicin (DOX) loading amount up to 485.43 mg·g-1. Meanwhile, the Fe₃O₄⁻graphene oxide provides a facile photothermal response mechanism to handle the NIR-triggered release of DOX in weak acidic solvent environments.

Reflectance curves and calibration curves exhibited no chromatic change and maintained high linearity in both dyeing systems. The linearity of water-dyed calibration curves was slightly higher than that of the reverse-micellar dyed curves. The color yield, in term of K/Ssum values, of solvent-dyed samples was found to be generally higher than that of water-based dyed samples at various calibrated dye concentrations. The concentrations predicted by CCM were close to the theoretical concentrations for both dyeing methods. This indicates that octane- and nonane-assisted reverse-micellar dyeing of wool is able to generate color recipes comparable to the conventional water-based dyeing system. The solvent-dyed samples, measured by the relative unlevelness indices (RUI), exhibit good-to-excellent levelness, which is highly comparable with the water-dyed samples.",Synchronized Molecular-Dynamics Simulation of the Thermal Lubrication of an Entangled Polymeric Liquid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960115,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The thermal lubrication of an entangled polymeric liquid in wall-driven shear flows between parallel plates is investigated by using a multiscale hybrid method, coupling molecular dynamics and hydrodynamics (i.e., the synchronized molecular dynamics method). The temperature of the polymeric liquid rapidly increases due to viscous heating once the drive force exceeds a certain threshold value, and the rheological properties drastically change at around the critical drive force. In the weak viscous-heating regime, the conformation of polymer chains is dominated by the flow field so that the polymers are more elongated as the drive force increases. However, in the large viscous-heating regime, the conformation dynamics is dominated by the thermal agitation of polymer chains so that the conformation of polymers recovers more uniform and random structures as the drive force increases, even though the local shear flows are further enhanced. Remarkably, this counter-intuitive transitional behavior gives an interesting re-entrant transition in the stress⁻optical relation, where the linear stress⁻optical relation approximately holds even though each of the macroscopic quantities behaves nonlinearly. Furthermore, the shear thickening behavior is also observed in the large viscous-heating regime-this was not observed in a series of previous studies on an unentangled polymer fluid. This qualitative difference of the thermo-rheological property between the entangled and unentangled polymer fluids gives completely different velocity profiles in the thermal lubrication system.",Fatigue Life Prediction of Reinforced Concrete Beams Strengthened with CFRP: Study Based on an Accumulative Damage Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960114,Polymers,2019 04 11,"With the prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strengthening technique widely used in reinforced concrete (RC) structures, it is more and more important to study the fatigue performance of RC structures. Since the fracture of a tensile steel bar at the main cracked section is the leading reason for the failure of RC beams reinforced by prestressed CFRP, a fatigue life prediction model of RC beams reinforced by prestressed CFRP was developed based on an accumulative damage model. Moreover, gradual degradation of the performance of the concrete was considered in the fatigue life prediction model. An experimental study was also conducted to research the fatigue behavior of RC beams reinforced by prestressed or non-prestressed carbon fiber laminate (CFL). During the tests, fatigue crack patterns were captured using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and the fatigue lives of a total of 30 beams were recorded. The results showed that the predicted main crack propagation curves and the fatigue lives were close to the experimental data. This study also exhibited that the prestressed CFRP could reduce the stress of main steel bars in RC beams and effectively improve the fatigue performance of the RC beams.",Composite Aerogels of Carbon Nanocellulose Fibers and Mixed-Valent Manganese Oxides as Renewable Supercapacitor Electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960113,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Bio-waste derived nanocelluloses show excellent mechanical flexibility and self-aggregated capability, which enable them to be good supporting substrates for the synthesis of electroactive materials.

Melting of the polymer films took place during the transient annealing process, so that a solid-liquid-solid phase transition process was observed. Ultrafast cooling of the melting polymer produced solidified droplets. Microscopic and spectroscopic characterization revealed that the polymer molecules were rearranged with preferable H-aggregation to reach the lowest formation energy during the melting process. Intermolecular coupling was enhanced due to the modified molecular arrangement. This observation of melting of polymeric semiconductors due to the interaction with femtosecond light pulses is potentially important for better understanding laser-matter interactions and for exploring organic optoelectronic devices through special material processing.",Description of the Resin Curing Process-Formulation and Optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960111,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The paper gives a set of basic relations characterizing the phenomena of viscous polymer resin flow through fiber reinforcement and the resin curing process.

For cases of 2-D structures, the method of formulating such tasks has been demonstrated. The types of design variables appearing in the optimization problems in this area are also presented. The 2-D optimization problems have been formulated. Various optimization problems are solved in order to demonstrate the influence of discussed relations on values of residual stresses and curing processes of thermosetting resins."

The effect of crosslinker content and pectin to acrylic acid ratio on the swelling properties of hydrogels was investigated. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristic of hydrogels was obtained by DSC. Furthermore, the structure of pectin-based hydrogels was characterized by FTIR and GPC.

Evaluation of four processing additives (1,8-octanedithiol (ODT), diphenyl ether (DPE), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), which are commonly used for the fabrication of organic solar cells, revealed that the nanoscale molecular ordering and, therefore, the charge-carrier mobility, are largely affected by the additives, as demonstrated by spectral absorption, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. Thermal annealing selectively influenced the morphological changes, depending on the solubility of P3HT in the additive at high temperature. In the case of CN, in which P3HT can be dissolved at moderate temperature, significant molecular ordering was observed even without thermal annealing. For DIO, in which P3HT is only soluble at elevated temperature, the mobility reached 1.14 × 10-1 cm² V-1 s-1 only after annealing.

The in vitro antibacterial activity of MHASt-emulsions against S. aureus was confirmed and their therapeutic efficacy was assessed using an in vitro skin-adapted agar diffusion test. In vivo antibacterial activity, evaluated using the tape-stripping infection model in mice, showed the topical administration of MH was effective against superficial infections caused by S. aureus.

In order to process an industrial product, a series of polystyrene (PS) composite foams were prepared by continuous extrusion foaming assisted by supercritical CO₂. Because the cell size and cell density were the key to determine the sound absorption coefficient at normal incidence, the bio-resource lignin was employed for the first time to control the cellular structure on basis of hetero-nucleation effect. The sound absorption range of the PS/lignin composite foams was corresponding to the cellular structure and lignin content. As a result, the maximum sound absorption coefficient at normal incidence was higher than 0.90. For a comparison, multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and micro graphite (mGr) particles were also used as the nucleation agent during the foaming process, respectively, which were more effective on the hetero-nucleation effect.

In particular, POPs featuring the normal oxyethylene chain in the side-chain exhibit excellent yields and high molecular weights in methanol and N,N-dimethylformamide at 40 °C, compared with poly(n-alkyl propiolate)s (PnAP)s. The high reactivity of the oxyethyl propiolate (OP) monomers is clarified by considering the time dependences of the polymerization yields of OPs and alkyl propiolates (Aps). Furthermore, the monomer structure and intermediate conformation of the Rh complex are optimized using Density Function theory (DFT) methods (B3LYP/6-31G** and B3LYP/LANL2DZ) and a polymerization mechanism is proposed.","Nanocrystalline Hydroxyapatite Loaded with Resveratrol in Colloidal Suspension Improves Viability, Metabolic Activity and Mitochondrial Potential in Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Stem Cells (hASCs).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960076,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In response to the demand for new multifunctional materials characterized by high biocompatibility, hydrogel (HG) nanocomposites as a platform for bioactive compound delivery have been developed and fabricated. A specific crosslinking/copolymerization chemistry was used to construct hydrogels with a controlled network organization. The hydrogels were prepared using 3,6-anhydro-α-l-galacto-β-d-galactan (galactose hydrogel) together with resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and calcium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The resveratrol was introduced in three different concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM. Nanosized calcium hydroxyapatite was synthesized by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique, annealed at 500 °C for 3 h, and introduced at a concentration 10% (m/v). The morphology and structural properties of Ca10(PO₄)₆(OH)₂ and its composite were determined by using XRPD (X-ray powder diffraction) techniques, as well as the absorption and IR (infrared) spectroscopy. The average nanoparticle size was 35 nm. The water affinity, morphology, organic compound release profile, and cytocompatibility of the obtained materials were studied in detail. The designed hydrogels were shown to be materials of biological relevance and of great pharmacological potential as carriers for bioactive compound delivery. Their cytocompatibility was tested using a model of human multipotent stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue (hASCs). The biomaterials increased the proliferative activity and viability of hASCs, as well as reduced markers of oxidative stress. In light of the obtained results, it has been thought that the designed materials meet the requirements of the tissue engineering triad, and may find application in regenerative medicine, especially for personalized therapies.",Foaming Behavior and Microcellular Morphologies of Incompatible SAN/CPE Blends with Supercritical Carbon Dioxide as a Physical Blowing Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960075,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The foaming process and cellular morphologies of poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN)/chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) blends with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO₂) as a blowing agent were investigated in this study. As compared to pure SAN foam in the same batch, the foamed blends with various CPE elastomer content had smaller average pore size and larger cell density. This is probably related to the inhibition of bubble growth by elastomer, resulting in poor melt flowability and strong viscoelasticity, and the efficient bubble heterogeneous nucleation caused by numerous phase interfaces inside the incompletely compatible blend system. In addition, many tiny interconnected holes through the pore walls were formed to connect adjacent micropores in foamed blend samples. The formation mechanism of such interconnected pores is probably due to the fracture of stretched melt around the bubble from phase interfaces with weak interactions. These facts suggest an effective path to control pore size, cell density and even interconnected pores of blend foams depends on the compatibility of the blend system and difference in foamability of individual components in supercritical CO₂.",Characterization and Actuation of Ionic Polymer Metal Composites with Various Thicknesses and Lengths.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960074,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) with various thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, and 6 nafion films (denoted as 1-film, 2-film, 4-film and 6-film, respectively) are fabricated, and their characterization and actuation performances are then investigated. The effects of the thickness of the IPMCs on their morphology, surface resistance, and water uptake capability are studied. Their actuation performances are further evaluated by examining the tip force and displacement in terms of the length and the thickness of the IPMCs, under a direct current (DC) power of 3.0 or 4.5 V. In comparison with the 1-film, the 2-film shows a six-fold increase in the maximum tip force, but the response time increases from 2 to 9 s. The 4-film doubles the maximum tip force of the 2-film at 21 s. On the other hand, a reduction of the length of the IPMC from 30 to 15 mm also results in a double-maximum tip force, but this never increases the response time. Repeated actuations of the IPMCs with various thicknesses are performed by three actuation methods of no treatment, treatment in deionized water, and treatment in a NaCl solution. The relationships between the repeated actuation methods and actuations of the IPMCs with various thicknesses are also investigated.","Experimental Investigation of the Compactability and Cracking Behavior of Polyacrylamide-Treated Saline Soil in Gansu Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960073,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polyacrylamide (PAM) is a water-soluble polymer with the ability to enhance a soil's stability. PAM is currently being used to prevent irrigation-induced erosion and enhance the infiltration in farmland soil. To improve the compaction properties of the saline-soil-based filling material that is used in highway subgrade and the cracking resistance capacity of a saline soil's crust, the consistency limits, compactability, microstructure, and cracking morphology of untreated and PAM-treated saline soil were investigated. The saline soils were sampled from the soil crust and a depth of 2.0⁻3.0 m in Gansu Province, China. Two PAM concentrations (0.1% and 0.5% in mass ratio) were selected. The liquid limits and plastic limits of the saline soil samples from the surface (0⁻0.05 m) and a depth of 2.0⁻3.0 m noticeably increased as PAM concentration increased. The maximum dry densities decreased as PAM concentration and plasticity increased, and the optimum water contents of the two saline soil types did not significantly change. These results suggest that a higher shearing resistance between particles partially prevented compression from occurring during compaction. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test results showed that the PAM agent dispersed the bulky pellets, and the soil's structure was formed by flaky and acicular platelets that filled the micropores. A quantitative analysis of crack patterns showed that the cross-points of the crack network and the crack length decreased as the PAM concentration increased. These results indicate that an increase in PAM reduces the shrinkage strain and the flaws or pores within saline soils. Therefore, PAM's stabilizing effect on saline soil under a wetting⁻drying cycle was proven.",An Industrial Scale Synthesis of Adipicdihydrazide (ADH)/Polyacrylate Hybrid with Excellent Formaldehyde Degradation Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960072,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A simple and versatile route for industrial scale synthesis of adipicdihydrazide (ADH)/polymer hybrids with excellent performance of formaldehyde degradation is proposed in this paper. The ADH compound is uniformly dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate-methacrylic acid) (P(MMA-BA-MAA)) latex, which is validated by UV and dispersibility tests. The results illustrate that ADH has excellent compatibility and dispersion stability without affecting the film formation of the polymer latex. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and mapping analysis of the hybrid films also demonstrate that ADH is homogenously dispersed in the polymer matrix. Compared with neat polymers, the thermal properties of hybrid films are improved, for example, T0.5 increases by 8.3 °C. According to qualitative tests of the 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazol-red/green/blue (AHMT-RGB) method, the hybrid films demonstrate high formaldehyde removal efficiency. On the basis of the semi-quantitative test of Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements, the rate of formaldehyde degradation can reach 1.034 × 10² mol/(h·m³) for the hybrid film with 5 wt% ADH.",Comparison of Fire Behaviors of Thermally Thin and Thick Rubber Latex Foam under Bottom Ventilation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960071,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Fire behaviors of rubber latex foam under different thickness conditions (d = 1, 2, and 5 cm) were explored by using a self-built small-scale experimental platform. It can be shown that the flame spread menchanism of thermally thin and thermally thick rubber latex foam is different. Rubber latex foam with a thickness of 2 cm shows higher fire risk, whose value of flame spread rate, maximum flame height, maximum mass loss rate, and maximum temperature are 2.93 × 10-3 m/s, 851.88 mm, and 1.83 g/s, 948.00 °C, respectively. On the one hand, this may due to the different mechanisms of flame spread, resulting in different preheating zones on the surface. On the other hand, this may because the thickness of residue formed by thermally thick materials is larger than the thin ones, obstructing the contact of the rubber latex foam with fresh air. In addition, a special phenomenon is noticed during the stage II, where the bottom unburned zone is located in the four edges (thermally thin material) and middle player (thermally thick material).",Effect of Matrix and Graphite Filler on Thermal Conductivity of Industrially Feasible Injection Molded Thermoplastic Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960070,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To understand how the thermal conductivity (TC) of virgin commercial polymers and their composites with low graphite filler amounts can be improved, the effect of material choice, annealing and moisture content is investigated, all with feasible industrial applicability in mind focusing on injection molding. Comparison of commercial HDPE, PP, PLA, ABS, PS, and PA6 based composites under conditions minimizing the effect of the skin-core layer (measurement at half the sample thickness) allows to deduce that at 20 m% of filler, both the (overall) in- and through-plane TC can be significantly improved. The most promising results are for HDPE and PA6 (through/in-plane TC near 0.7/4.3 W·m-1K-1 for HDPE and 0.47/4.3 W·m-1K-1 for PA6 or an increase of 50/825% and 45/1200% respectively, compared to the virgin polymer). Testing with annealed and nucleated PA6 and PLA samples shows that further increasing the crystallinity has a limited effect. A variation of the average molar mass and moisture content is also almost without impact. Intriguingly, the variation of the measuring depth allows to control the relative importance of the TC of the core and skin layer. An increased measurement depth, hence, a higher core-to-skin ratio measurement specifically indicates a clear increase in the through-plane TC (e.g., factor 2). Therefore, for basic shapes, the removal of the skin layer is recommendable to increase the TC.",Dissolved Gases Forecasting Based on Wavelet Least Squares Support Vector Regression and Imperialist Competition Algorithm for Assessing Incipient Faults of Transformer Polymer Insulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960069,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A solution for forecasting the dissolved gases in oil-immersed transformers has been proposed based on the wavelet technique and least squares support vector machine. In order to optimize the hyper-parameters of the constructed wavelet LS-SVM regression, the imperialist competition algorithm was then applied. In this study, the assessment of prediction performance is based on the squared correlation coefficient and mean absolute percentage error methods. According to the proposed method, this novel procedure was applied to a simulated case and the experimental results show that the dissolved gas contents could be accurately predicted using this method. Besides, the proposed approach was compared to other prediction methods such as the back propagation neural network, the radial basis function neural network, and generalized regression neural network. By comparison, it was inferred that this method is more effective than previous forecasting methods.","Clog and Release, and Reverse Motions of DNA in a Nanopore.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960068,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Motions of circular and linear DNA molecules of various lengths near a nanopore of 100 or 200 nm diameter were experimentally observed and investigated by fluorescence microscopy. The movement of DNA molecules through nanopores, known as translocation, is mainly driven by electric fields near and inside the pores. We found significant clogging of nanopores by DNA molecules, particularly by circular DNA and linear T4 DNA (165.65 kbp). Here, the probabilities of DNA clogging events, depending on the DNA length and shape-linear or circular-were determined. Furthermore, two distinct DNA motions were observed: clog and release by linear T4 DNA, and a reverse direction motion at the pore entrance by circular DNA, after which both molecules moved away from the pore. Finite element method-based numerical simulations were performed. The results indicated that DNA molecules with pores 100⁻200 nm in diameter were strongly influenced by opposing hydrodynamic streaming flow, which was further enhanced by bulky DNA configurations."

The structure and properties of IC were characterized by Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR), scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). ¹H NMR and SEM-EDS were also used to identify the molar ratio of β-CD/DBPDA in IC and the results from the analyses indicated that their molar ratio was 1:1. In order to test the flame retardant effect of IC, it was added to epoxy (EP). IC was proposed to be able to act as an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system in EP through a combination of β-CD and DBPDA properties during the combustion process. β-CD is a biomass carbon source, which has the advantages of environmental protection and low cost. Furthermore, DBPDA is both a source of acid and gas. When IC was heated, IC had the advantage of acting as both a carbon source and foam forming agent, while the DBPDA component were able to directly generate phosphoric acid and NH₃ in situ. The impact of IC in low additive amounts on flame retardancy of EP was studied by the cone calorimeter test. When only 3 wt % IC was incorporated, the peak values of heat release rate (pHRR) and smoke production rate (pSPR) of EP were reduced by 22.9% and 33.3% respectively, which suggested that IC could suppress the heat and smoke release efficiently.",The First Synthesis of Periodic and Alternating Glycopolymers by RAFT Polymerization: A Novel Synthetic Pathway for Glycosaminoglycan Mimics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960054,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study concerned the controlled synthesis of periodic glycopolymers by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. To this end, maltose- and lactose-substituted vinyl ethers (MalVE and LacVE, respectively) and maltose-substituted maleimide (MalMI) were newly synthesized. RAFT copolymerization of MalVE and ethyl maleimide (EtMI) (monomer feed ratio: MalVE:EtMI = 1:1) afforded periodic glycopolymers (poly(MalVE-co-EtMI)) consisting of major parts of alternating structure (-(MalVE-EtMI)n-) and a small part of consecutive sequences of EtMI (⁻EtMI-EtMI-). Occurrence of the latter sequences was caused by the homopolymerizability of maleimide under the present polymerization condition, and the formation of the consecutive sequences of EtMI was successfully suppressed by varying the monomer feed ratio. RAFT copolymerization of LacVE and EtMI was also found to proceed and similarly yielded periodic glycopolymers (poly(LacVE-co-EtMI)). Moreover, RAFT copolymerization of LacVE and MalMI (monomer feed ratio: LacVE:MalMI = 1:1) was performed to give copolymers (poly(LacVE-co-MalMI)) having composition ratio of LacVE/MalMI ≈ 36/64. The resultant periodic glycopolymers poly(MalVE-co-EtMI) and poly(LacVE-co-EtMI) were subjected to lectin binding assay using concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin, exhibiting the glycocluster effect. Moreover, these glycopolymers obtained from the copolymerization of VE and MI were found to be non-cytotoxic.",Composition of Plastic Fractions in Waste Streams: Toward More Efficient Recycling and Utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960053,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Reuse of materials is a significant global goal that contributes to sustainable development. Polymer-specific plastic identification from the waste stream is examined in this study to achieve environmentally optimistic reuse of plastic material in secondary applications. Two diverse waste streams, 86.11 kg of construction and demolition waste (CDW) plastic and 57.74 kg of mechanically sorted plastic, were analyzed by using a handheld tool whose identification technology was based on the near-infrared spectrum. The study indicates a significant effect of human and single fraction on manual separation. The polymer composition in the plastic waste stream varied depending on the source, but the most common plastic grades, polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), were represented in every waste stream.

Among numerous available antimicrobial agents, essential oils stand out for their renowned efficiency, and their use is beneficial due to their sustainability compared to other oil-based antimicrobials. In this work, we report on the use of photo-responsive nanocapsules containing thyme essential oil as functional coatings for polyethylene and polylactic acid films to obtain antimicrobial active packaging. Polymer surface activation treatment enhanced compatibility with nanocapsules solution. The films were analyzed to assess the structural and functional properties of the coating, evaluate morphological changes due to their photo-responsive behavior, and monitor the light-induced release of volatile thyme oil. It was found that 24 h after a 15-min UV exposure of the coated films, the concentration of thyme oil in the headspace was eight times higher with respect to un-irradiated films, thus confirming the efficiency of the light-triggered release system. Therefore, the manufactured films are proposed as on-demand release devices for application in non-contact antimicrobial active packaging.",The Synergistic Effects of Gold Particles and Dexamethasone on the Electrochemical and Biological Performance of PEDOT Neural Interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960051,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Although neural devices have shown efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, their functionality is limited by the inflammatory state and glial scar formation associated with chronic implantation. The aim of this study was to investigate neural electrode performance following functionalization with an anti-inflammatory coating derived from a conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) matrix doped with dexamethasone (Dex) and decorated with Au particles. Pristine PEDOT, PEDOT-Dex and their gold-decorated analogues (PEDOT/Au and PEDOT-Dex/Au) were formulated by electrochemical deposition and characterized with respect to electrode electrochemical properties, surface morphology and biocompatibility towards primary neural cells. Through a process of gold deposition, it was possible to eliminate the initial burst release observed in PEDOT-Dex and maintain a stable, stepwise increase in Dex elution over 7 days. The released amounts of Dex exceeded the concentrations considered as therapeutic for both PEDOT-Dex and PEDOT-Dex/Au. The results clearly indicated that the presence of either Dex or Au particles facilitated the outgrowth of neurites.

Moreover, to evaluate the effect of cellulose particle size and surface chemistry on the process yield, unbleached eucalypt kraft pulp and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), both unmodified and physically or chemically modified were used. PLA/cellulose spheres were characterized regarding its physical properties. It was found that the spheres yield is essentially determined by the PVA/PLA ratio and the percentage of cellulose incorporation is greatly affected by the surface chemistry of cellulose. Regarding the films, DSC runs showed a significant effect of the cellulose type incorporated into PLA matrix on the cold crystallization temperature and on the degree of crystallinity of the biocomposite films. The measurement of tensile properties of the biocomposite films revealed that the strength, elongation at break and toughness (tensile energy absorption at break) of the films incorporating unmodified and chemically modified MCC were substantially improved.",Manufacture and Property of Warp-Knitted Fabrics with Polylactic Acid Multifilament.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960049,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study investigates the properties of polylactic acid (PLA) multifilament and its warp-knitted fabrics.

Results showed that the mechanical properties of PLA multifilament were comparable to those of PET. However, PLA had a higher heat shrinkage rate. The dyed PLA warp-knitted fabric has excellent color fastness. Due to the influence of temperature and dye particles during the dyeing process, the breaking strength, air permeability and moisture permeability of the fabric were decreased.

Small angle neutron scattering measurements showed that the vesicular structure had diameters of empty cores from 13.6 nm to 79.6 nm, and thicknesses of the bilayers from 2.2 nm to 8.7 nm when the hydrophobic interaction was changed.

A core use of these materials is in mixtures with surfactants, where a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions drives unique solution behavior and structure formation. In this review, we apply a molecular level perspective to the broad literature on polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes, discussing explicitly the hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction contributions to polyelectrolyte surfactant complexes (PESCs), as well as the interplay between the two molecular interaction types. These interactions are sensitive to a variety of solution conditions, such as pH, ionic strength, mixing procedure, charge density, etc. and these parameters can readily be used to control the concentration at which structures form as well as the type of structure in the bulk solution.","Novel Intumescent Flame Retardant Masterbatch Prepared through Different Processes and Its Application in EPDM/PP Thermoplastic Elastomer: Thermal Stability, Flame Retardancy, and Mechanical Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960034,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this work, the ethylene-propylene-diene monomer/polypropylene (EPDM/PP) thermoplastic elastomer filled with intumescent flame retardants (IFR) is fabricated by melting blend. The IFR are constituted with melamine phosphate-pentaerythritol (MP/PER) by compounding and reactive extruding, respectively. The effects of two kinds of MP/PER with different contents on the thermal stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties of materials are investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94, cone calorimeter test (CCT), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR results show that the reactive extruded MP/PER partly generates melamine pyrophosphate (MPP) compared with compound masterbatches. TGA data indicate that the best thermal stability is achieved when the molar ratio of MP/PER reaches 1.8. All the reactive samples show a higher flame retardancy than compound ones. The CCT results also exhibit the same trend as above in heat release and smoke production rate. The EPDM/PP composites filled with 30 and 35% reactive MP/PER exhibit the improved flame retardancy but become stiffer and more brittle. SEM photos display that better dispersion and smaller particle size are obtained for reactive samples.",Investigation of the Flammability and Thermal Stability of Halogen-Free Intumescent System in Biopolymer Composites Containing Biobased Carbonization Agent and Mechanism of Their Char Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960033,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Starch, being a polyhydric compound with its natural charring ability, is an ideal candidate to serve as a carbonization agent in an intumescent system. This charring ability of starch, if accompanied by an acidic source, can generate an effective intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system, but the performance of starch-based composites in an IFR system has not been tested in detail. Here, we describe a PLA-based IFR system consisting of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as acidic source and cornstarch as carbon source. We prepared different formulations by melt compounding followed by molding into sheets by hot pressing. The thermal behavior and surface morphology of the composites was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy respectively. We also conducted limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94, and cone calorimetry tests to characterize the flame-retardant properties. Cone calorimetry revealed a 66% reduction in the peak heat release rate of the IFR composites compared to pure PLA and indicated the development of an intumescent structure by leaving a residual mass of 43% relative to the initial mass of the sample. A mechanism of char formation has also been discussed in detail.",Synthesis of Diblock Polyampholyte PAMPS-b-PMAPTAC and Its Adsorption on Bentonite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960032,Polymers,2019 04 11,"To study the adsorption of polyampholyte on bentonite (Bent), a block polyampholyte, PAMPS-b-PMAPTAC, comprised of 2-Acrylamido-2-Methylpropane Sulfonic Acid (AMPS) units and Methacrylamido Propyl Trimethyl Ammonium Chloride (MAPTAC) units, was synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) method. The block polyampholyte samples were characterized by FTIR, ¹H NMR and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The microstructure of block polyampholyte and random polyampholyte in deionized water indicated that uneven distribution of charged groups increased the entanglement of polymer chains. Addition of salt weakened the electrostatic interactions among charged groups, and, therefore, increased the zeta potential of polyampholyte in aqueous solutions. The adsorptive behaviors of PAMPS-b-PMAPTAC on Bent were studied using elemental analysis, and the effects of external factors were considered. The adsorption equilibrium of polymers on Bent was reached after 12 h. Increased temperature and increased salinity exerted a positive and negative effect on the adsorption of polyampholyte, respectively. The molecular weight played as the decisive factor for the adsorption of polyampholyte in the absence of NaCl, while the content of cationic groups acted as the main factor in the presence of NaCl. Block polyampholyte exhibited higher adsorption than random polyampholyte in the absence of salt. XRD results also indicated that block polyampholyte had a better intercalation effect than random polyampholyte.","Developing a Polypropylene Fabric, Silica Fume, and Redispersible Emulsion Powder Cementitious Composite for Dynamic Water Environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960031,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In the dynamic water environment, grouting requires a material with higher strength and anti-washout performance to prevent groundwater inrush. This study aims to develop a dynamic water slurry by mixing polypropylene fiber (PP fiber), silica fume (SF) and the polymer material of redispersible emulsion powder (REP) to the Portland cement. Towards this aim, a series of tests, including strength, gel time, bleeding rate, fluidity, and anti-washout, were conducted to evaluate the effects of SF, PP fiber, and REP on the slurry properties. The test results show that: (1) SF displays significant effects on strength, gel time, fluidity, and bleeding rate of cement slurry. Differently, PP fiber mainly affects the stress⁻strain behavior of the slurry and can improve the ductility significantly. (2) By mixing SF and fiber simultaneously, the slurry strength can increase by about 30%, and its strain can extend by more than 70%. Meanwhile, the composite slurry possesses great anti-washout properties at a low flow velocity (v ≤ 0.4 m/s), and the grouting retention rate (GRR) can reach up to 98.7%. However, the GRR decreases to a maximum value of 31.3% when v = 0.6 m/s. (3) By mixing the REP into the fiber-SF composite slurry, the GRR can further increase, reaching more than 60% even when v = 0.6 m/s. As a result, the developed fiber-SF cementitious composite slurry, which when mixed with REP, presents a favorable performance in the dynamic water environment.","Effects of Tung Oil-Based Polyols on the Thermal Stability, Flame Retardancy, and Mechanical Properties of Rigid Polyurethane Foam.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960030,Polymers,2019 04 11,"A phosphorus-containing tung oil-based polyol (PTOP) and a silicon-containing tung oil-based polyol (PTOSi) were each efficiently prepared by attaching 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene (DOPO) and dihydroxydiphenylsilane (DPSD) directly, respectively, to the epoxidized monoglyceride of tung oil (EGTO) through a ring-opening reaction. The two new polyols were used in the formation of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF), which displayed great thermal stability and excellent flame retardancy performance. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of RPUF containing 80 wt % PTOP and 80 wt % PTOSi was 24.0% and 23.4%, respectively. Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis revealed that DOPO and DPSD are linked to EGTO by a covalent bond. Interestingly, PTOP and PTOSi had opposite effects on Tg and the compressive strength of RPUF, where, with the appropriate loading, the compressive strengths were 0.82 MPa and 0.25 MPa, respectively. At a higher loading of PTOP and PTOSi, the thermal conductivity of RPUF increased while the RPUF density decreased. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs showed that the size and closed areas of the RPUF cells were regular. SEM micrographs of the char after combustion showed that the char layer was compact and dense. The enhanced flame retardancy of RPUF resulted from the barrier effect of the char layer, which was covered with incombustible substance.",Highly Permeable Matrimid®/PIM-EA(H₂)-TB Blend Membrane for Gas Separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960029,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The effect on the gas transport properties of Matrimid®5218 of blending with the polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM-EA(H₂)-TB was studied by pure and mixed gas permeation measurements. Membranes of the two neat polymers and their 50/50 wt % blend were prepared by solution casting from a dilute solution in dichloromethane. The pure gas permeability and diffusion coefficients of H₂, He, O₂, N₂, CO₂ and CH₄ were determined by the time lag method in a traditional fixed volume gas permeation setup. Mixed gas permeability measurements with a 35/65 vol % CO₂/CH₄ mixture and a 15/85 vol % CO₂/N₂ mixture were performed on a novel variable volume setup with on-line mass spectrometric analysis of the permeate composition, with the unique feature that it is also able to determine the mixed gas diffusion coefficients. It was found that the permeability of Matrimid increased approximately 20-fold with the addition of 50 wt % PIM-EA(H₂)-TB. Mixed gas permeation measurements showed a slightly stronger pressure dependence for selectivity of separation of the CO₂/CH₄ mixture as compared to the CO₂/N₂ mixture, particularly for both the blended membrane and the pure PIM. The mixed gas selectivity was slightly higher than for pure gases, and although N₂ and CH₄ diffusion coefficients strongly increase in the presence of CO₂, their solubility is dramatically reduced as a result of competitive sorption. A full analysis is provided of the difference between the pure and mixed gas transport parameters of PIM-EA(H₂)-TB, Matrimid®5218 and their 50:50 wt % blend, including unique mixed gas diffusion coefficients.","Optical, Electrical and Thermal Properties of Organic⁻Inorganic Hybrids with Conjugated Polymers Based on POSS Having Heterogeneous Substituents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960028,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Preparation of organic⁻inorganic hybrids with conventional conjugated polymers such as polyfluorene (PF) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were demonstrated via the facile blending in solution by employing polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) having heterogeneous alkyl substituents. From the optical measurements, it was shown that the modified POSS derivatives played a critical role in facilitating amorphous state of polymer matrices. Interestingly, although inter-strand interaction decreased after POSS addition in the hybrid films, thermal stability can be enhanced in the presence of the modified POSS with long alkyl chains. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that carrier mobilities through the hybrid film was minimally reduced by POSS. These results suggest that POSS should be a versatile building block to form hybrid with various types of polymers for enhancing durability without loss of electronic properties of organic components.",Aluminum-Magnesium Hydroxycarbonate/Azo Dye Hybrids as Novel Multifunctional Colorants for Elastomer Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960027,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study presents the preparation and characterization of new organic-inorganic pigments based on aluminum-magnesium hydroxycarbonate (LH) and azo dyes. Solvent resistance studies, XRD, SEM, and TGA confirmed the successful formation of hybrid pigments, which were characterized in terms of their physicochemical properties. The new hybrid pigments were applied in acrylonitrile-butadiene (NBR) and ethylene-propylene (EPM) rubber composites and cured with sulfur and peroxide curing systems, respectively. The mechanical properties, dispersion quality, and flame-retardant properties of the NBR/hybrid and EPM/hybrid pigment composites were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), SEM, and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC). Complex experimental investigations revealed that the layered nature of hybrid pigments could improve the barrier ability and flame retardancy of elastomer composites. In comparison to unmodified aluminum-magnesium hydroxycarbonate, the modified LH dye structures contributed to significantly decrease the heat release rate and the total heat release of the NBR and EPM composites, offering a new approach to imparting low flammability to elastomer materials.",Synthesis and Evaluation of Thermoresponsive Boron-Containing Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) Diblock Copolymers for Self-Assembling Nanomicellar Boron Carriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960026,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Development of new boron nanocarriers has been a crucial issue to be solved for advancing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) as an effective radiation treatment for cancers. The present study aimed to create a novel double-thermoresponsive boron-containing diblock copolymer based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [poly(NIPAAm)], which exhibits two-step phase transitions (morphological transitions) at the temperature region below human body temperature. The boronated diblock copolymer considerably concentrates boron atoms into the water-dispersible (i.e., intravenous-administration possible) nanomicelles self-assembled by the first phase transition, and furthermore the properly controlled size and hydrophobicity of the second phase-transitioned nanoparticles are expected to make a significant contribution to the selective delivery and long-term retention of boron atoms into tumor tissues. Here we present the detailed synthesis of the strategic NIPAAm-based diblock copolymer with 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (PBA), i.e., poly(NIPAAm-block-NIPAAm-co-PBA), through a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. Furthermore, the stepwise phase transition behavior of the obtained boronic-acid diblock copolymers was characterized in detail by temperature-variable ¹H and 11B-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The phase-transition-induced molecular structural changes, including the structural compositions and sizes of nanomicelles and nanoparticles, are also discussed here."

Owing to the strong linkage of triazine, the most important advantage of CTFs lies in their high chemical and thermal stabilities and high nitrogen content as compared to other porous organic polymers (POPs). Therefore, CTFs are one of the most promising materials for practical applications. Much research has been devoted to developing new methods to synthesize CTFs and explore their potential applications. Nowadays, energy and environmental issues have attracted enormous attention. CTFs are particular promising for energy- and environment-related applications, due to their nitrogen-rich scaffold and robust structure. Here, we selected some typical examples and reviewed recent advancements in the synthesis of CTFs and their applications in gas adsorption, separation, and catalysis in relation to environment and energy issues.",Effects of a Phosphorus Flame Retardant System on the Mechanical and Fire Behavior of Microcellular ABS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960014,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The present work deals with the study of phosphorus flame retardant microcellular acrylonitrile⁻butadiene⁻styrene (ABS) parts and the effects of weight reduction on the fire and mechanical performance. Phosphorus-based flame retardant additives (PFR), aluminum diethylphosphinate and ammonium polyphosphate, were used as a more environmentally friendly alternative to halogenated flame retardants. A 25 wt % of such PFR system was added to the polymer using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Subsequently, microcellular parts with 10, 15, and 20% of nominal weight reduction were prepared using a MuCell® injection-molding process. The results indicate that the presence of PFR particles increased the storage modulus and decreased the impact energy determined by means of dynamic-mechanical-thermal analysis and falling weight impact tests respectively. Nevertheless, the reduction of impact energy was found to be lower in ABS/PFR samples than in neat ABS with increasing weight reduction. This effect was attributed to the lower cell sizes and higher cell densities of the microcellular core of ABS/PFR parts. All ABS/PFR foams showed a self-extinguishing behavior under UL-94 burning vertical tests, independently of the weight reduction. Gradual decreases of the second peak of heat release rate and time of combustion with similar intumescent effect were observed with increasing weight reduction under cone calorimeter tests.",Synergetic Toughening Effect of Carbon Nanotubes and β-Nucleating Agents on the Polypropylene Random Copolymer/Styrene-Ethylene-Butylene- Styrene Block Copolymer Blends.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960013,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Polypropylene random co-polymer (PPR)/styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer blends with high toughness and favorable tensile properties were successfully obtained by blending with traces of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and β-nucleating agents (β-NAs). β-NAs can effectively induce the ductile β-form crystal in the PPR matrix. Although the addition of MWCNTs was reported to be only benefit for the tensile strength of PPR and relatively disadvantageous for the toughness, the obviously synergistic toughening effect in PPR/SBS blends was found when MWCNTs and β-NAs coexisted. The notched izod impact strength of PPR/30 wt % SBS blend with MWCNTs and β-NAs increased from 11.3 to 58.9 kJ/m²; more than 5-fold increment compared with pure PPR. Meanwhile, the tensile strength retention of this PPR blend is still above 72.2%. The micro-morphology indicated that the MWCNTs can act as bridges between SBS particle and PPR matrix, effectively transferring the stress and absorbing impact energy among SBS particles.",Synthesis and Characterization of an Antioxidative Galactomannan⁻Iron(III) Complex from Sesbania Seed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960012,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Galactomannan, a water-soluble polymer in the cell wall of leguminous plants, has been proven to possess anticancer and antioxidative activity. In this work, galactomannan with different molecular weights (GM-40 and GM-65) was obtained from Sesbania seeds and synthesized into galactomannan⁻iron(III) complexes, which are termed as GM-40-Fe and GM-65-Fe, respectively. These galactomannan⁻iron(III) complexes are intended to function as organic iron supplements to treat iron deficiency with the added benefit of antioxidative activity. The prepared galactomannan⁻iron(III) complexes were characterized for chemical composition, morphology, antioxidant capacity, and bioavailability in vitro. The results showed that galactomannan⁻iron(III) complexes could be produced with iron contents as high as 65.4 mg/g. Antioxidant assays indicated that both GM-40-Fe and GM-65-Fe exhibited antioxidant activities for scavenging radicals in vitro. The iron release/bioavailability assays showed that the iron was easily released into artificial gastric and intestinal juices, resulting in iron release rates of 88⁻94% over 300 min.

However, the instability in the aqueous acidic environment and difficulty of recovery has limited their practical applications in some cases. In this study, catalase/ZIF-8 composites with a protective nanocoating were prepared by the controlled self-assembly of silanes or coordination complexes (tannic acid (TA) and Fe3+). The properties of the catalase (CAT)/ZIF-8 composites with a protective nanocoating were also determined. The recovered activity of CAT/ZIF-8 and CAT/ZIF-8 with protective nanocoating was 70% and 65%, respectively. Compared with the conventional CAT/ZIF-8 composites, CAT/ZIF-8 with protective nanocoating exhibited excellent acid resistance. For example, after treatment for 60 min in phosphate buffer solution (pH 3.0), CAT/ZIF-8 composites only maintained 20% of their initial activity (about 12 U/mg). However, CAT/ZIF-8 with a protective nanocoating could still retain about 50% of its initial activity (about 10 U/mg). Meanwhile, the thermostability and storage stability of the CAT/ZIF-8 composites was enhanced significantly due to the presence of nanocoating compared with conventional CAT/ZIF-8. More importantly, the CAT/ZIF-8 with a protective nanocoating retained 40% of its initial activity after 7 cycles, whereas CAT/ZIF-8 only retained 8% of the initial activity. The approach in this study could be an efficient strategy to prepare enzyme/ZIF-8 composites with both high acid resistance and excellent recyclability.",Functional Polyimide/Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane Nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960010,Polymers,2019 04 11,"The preparation of hybrid nanocomposite materials derived from polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles and polyimide (PI) has recently attracted much attention from both academia and industry, because such materials can display low water absorption, high thermal stability, good mechanical characteristics, low dielectric constant, flame retardance, chemical resistance, thermo-redox stability, surface hydrophobicity, and excellent electrical properties.

Predictive equations are constructed, with a focus on three commercial AOs (two primary: Irganox 1076 and 245; and one secondary: Irgafos 168) and two commercial ABS types (mass- and emulsion-polymerized). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicate that the nitrile absorption peak at 2237 cm-1 is recommended as reference peak to identify chemical changes in the PB content. The melt processing of unmodified ABSs promotes a reduction in OOT and OP, and promotes an increase in the YI. ABS obtained by mass polymerization shows a higher thermal-oxidative stability. The addition of a primary AO increases the thermal-oxidative stability, whereas the secondary AO only increases OP. The addition of the two primary AOs has a synergetic effect resulting in higher OOT and OP values. Statistical analysis shows that OP data are influenced by all three AO types, but 0.2 m% of Irganox 1076 displays high potential in an industrial context.",Polyethylene Nanocomposites for Power Cable Insulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960008,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This review represents a comprehensive study of nanocomposites for power cables insulations based on thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene congeners like LDPE, HDPE and XLPE, which is complemented by original results.

Here, we report a facile method to fabricate bidirectional strain sensors through the integration of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and multimaterial additive manufacturing. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/MWCNT filaments were first made using a two-step extrusion process. TPU as the platform and TPU/MWCNT as the conducting traces were then 3D printed in tandem using multimaterial fused filament fabrication to generate uniaxial and biaxial sensors with several conductive pattern designs. The sensors were subjected to a series of cyclic strain loads. The results revealed excellent piezoresistive responses with cyclic repeatability in both the axial and transverse directions and in response to strains as high as 50%. It was shown that the directional sensitivity could be tailored by the type of pattern design. A wearable glove, with built-in sensors, capable of measuring finger flexure was also successfully demonstrated where the sensors are an integral part of the system. These sensors have potential applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and prosthetics, where complex design, multi-directionality, embedding, and customizability are demanded.",Phase-Field Modeling of Freeze Concentration of Protein Solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959994,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Bulk solutions of therapeutic proteins are often frozen for long-term storage. During the freezing process, proteins in liquid solution redistribute and segregate in the interstitial space between ice crystals. This is due to solute exclusion from ice crystals, higher viscosity of the concentrated solution, and space confinement between crystals. Such segregation may have a negative impact on the native conformation of protein molecules. To better understand the mechanisms, we developed a phase-field model to describe the growth of ice crystals and the dynamics of freeze concentration at the mesoscale based on mean field approximation of solute concentration and the underlying heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. The model focuses on evolution of the interfaces between liquid solution and ice crystals, and the degree of solute concentration due to partition, diffusive, and convective effects. The growth of crystals is driven by cooling of the bulk solution, but suppressed by a higher solute concentration due to increase of solution viscosity, decrease of freezing point, and the release of latent heat. The results demonstrate the interplay of solute exclusion, space confinement, heat transfer, coalescence of crystals, and the dynamic formation of narrow gaps between crystals and Plateau border areas along with correlations of thermophysical properties in the supercooled regime.",Internal Status of Visibly Opaque Black Rubbers Investigated by Terahertz Polarization Spectroscopy: Fundamentals and Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959993,Polymers,2019 04 11,"We discuss the internal status of rubber composites consisting of an insulating rubber matrix and conductive carbon black (CB) fillers (""black rubber"") using polarization-sensitive terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The black rubber composites under stretched conditions exhibit a large optical anisotropy or birefringence in the terahertz regime. From systematic studies, it is revealed that the large birefringence of black rubbers is due to the orientation distribution of anisotropically shaped CB aggregates in the rubber matrix and the orientation distribution is strongly linked to the mechanical deformation of the black rubber. A model simulation based on this relation between deformation and reorientation allows conversion of the birefringence (optical) information into strain (mechanical) information. In addition, the spectroscopic information obtained using the THz-TDS technique is useful to evaluate the changes in the internal conductive filler network caused by the mechanical deformation. Our findings demonstrate that the terahertz polarization spectroscopy is a promising nondestructive inspection method for contactless investigation of the internal condition of black rubber composites.",Effect of an Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet on the Structure and Physicochemical Properties of Waxy and Normal Maize Starch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959992,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In present study, a novel physical modification of waxy maize starch (WMS) and normal maize starch (NMS) was investigated by using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) treatment. The effect on the structure and physicochemical properties of both starches was demonstrated by treatment with a 5% starch suspension (w/w) with APPJ for short periods of time (1, 3, 5, or 7 min). The pH of WMS and NMS was decreased after APPJ treatment from 5.42 to 4.94, and 5.09 to 4.75, respectively. The water-binding capacity (WBC) (WMS: 105.19%⁻131.27%, NMS: 83.56%⁻95.61%) and swelling volume (SV) (WMS: 2.96 g/mL⁻3.33 g/mL, NMS: 2.75 g/mL⁻3.05 g/mL) of the starches were obviously increased by APPJ treatment. The surfaces of starch granules were wrecked, due to plasma etching. No changes in the crystalline types of both starches were observed. However, the relative crystallinities (RCs) of WMS and NMS were reduced from 46.7% to 42.0%, and 40.1% to 35.7%, respectively. Moreover, the short-range molecular orders of both starches were slightly reduced. In addition, APPJ treatment resulted in lower gelatinization temperature and enthalpies. Therefore, APPJ provides a mild and green approach to starch modification, showing great potential for applications in the food and non-food industry.",Synthesis and Characterization of Konjac Glucomannan/Carrageenan/Nano-silica Films for the Preservation of Postharvest White Mushrooms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959991,Polymers,2019 04 11,"In this study, the konjac glucomannan (KGM)/carrageenan (KC)/nano-silica film was prepared and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The preservation quality of white mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) packed using the films was also determined. The nano-silica dosage was found to affect the properties of the nanocomposite KGM/KC films. The results indicated that the properties of the films were significantly improved with the addition of nano-silica. The water vapor permeability, water solubility, moisture absorption, and light transmittance of KGM/KC/nano-silica films were significantly affected by the nano-silica dosage. In this study, the optimal nano-silica dosage to incorporate into the film in order to achieve excellent performance was 0.3%. Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds were also observed between KGM/KC and nano-silica in the KGM/KC/nano-silica film by FTIR. In addition, the KGM/KC/nano-silica film markedly reduced the browning index, delayed the weight loss and softening, and extended the shelf life of mushrooms during storage at 4 °C. The KGM/KC film modified using nano-silica can provide a potential method for improving the preservation quality of white mushrooms during storage.",Sulfonated Poly(ether ether ketone) Doped with Ammonium Ionic Liquids and Nano-Silicon Dioxide for Polymer Electrolyte Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959990,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Nano-silicon dioxide (SiO₂) was incorporated into the matrix of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK)/ammonium ionic liquid (AIL) membranes by solution casting, with the aim of reducing ionic liquid leaching and any consequent decrease in proton conductivity. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra results indicate incorporation of the SPEEK matrix with AIL and nano-SiO₂. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X⁻ray diffraction (XRD) images revealed that incorporation of nano-SiO₂ make the ternary composite membranes more flexible. The maximum ion exchange capacity (IEC) value was 3.25 meq/g, and the net structure formed by the nano-SiO₂ not only retarded AIL leaching, but also increased the proton conductivity of the composite membranes. AIL leaching from the membranes was between 20% and 30%, which was lower than that of the SPEEK/AIL membrane. The maximum proton conductivity for the SPEEK/AIL/SiO₂ membranes reached 10.73 mS/cm at 393 K.",Analysis of Network Structures in Thiol-Ene UV Curing System Using Reworkable Resins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959989,Polymers,2019 04 11,"An analysis of the network structures in thiol-ene UV curing resins was carried out using reworkable resins composed of di(meth)acrylate monomers having tertiary ester linkages. The effect of the functionality of the thiols, the functional ratio of the thiol and ene functions, their conversions and curing atmosphere on the chain lengths was discussed. A mixture of (meth)acrylates, thiol compounds, a photoradical initiator, and a photoacid generator was cured by irradiation at 365 nm. The cured samples were degraded by heating after irradiation at 254 nm. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ¹H NMR analyses of the degraded samples were carried out after the methylation. The crosslinking conditions strongly affected the network structures. The degraded samples have molecular weights between 250 and 2700. The molecular weights of the degraded resins increased with the functionality of the thiol compounds. The chain length dependence suggests that thiol compounds with a high functionality have a low reactivity due to steric hindrance. The chain lengths of the degraded networks were nearly proportional to the concentration of the (meth)acrylate monomers. The addition of reactive diluents enhanced the reactivity and increased the chain length.",Effect of Cinnamon Extraction Oil (CEO) for Algae Biofilm Shelf-Life Prolongation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959988,Polymers,2019 04 11,"This study was conducted to improve the life-span of the biofilm produced from algae by evaluating the decomposition rate with the effect of cinnamon extraction oil (CEO). The biofilm was fabricated using the solution casting technique. The soil burying analysis demonstrated low moisture absorption of the biofilm, thus decelerating the degradation due to low swelling rate and micro-organism activity, prolonging the shelf-life of the biofilm. Hence, the addition of CEO also affects the strength properties of the biofilm. The maximum tensile strength was achieved with the addition of 5% CEO, which indicated a good intermolecular interaction between the biopolymer (algae) and cinnamon molecules. The tensile strength, which was measured at 4.80 MPa, correlated with the morphological structure. The latter was performed using SEM, where the surface showed the absence of a separating phase between the biofilm and cinnamon blend. This was evidenced by FTIR analysis, which confirmed the occurrence of no chemical reaction between the biofilm and CEO during processing. The prolongation shelf-life rate of biofilm with good tensile properties are achievable with the addition of 5% of CEO.",Charge Separating Microfiltration Membrane with pH-Dependent Selectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959987,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Membrane filters are designed for selective separation of components from a mixture. While separation by size might be the most common approach, other characteristics like charge can also be used for separation as presented in this study. Here, a polyether sulfone membrane was modified to create a zwitterionic surface. Depending on the pH value of the surrounding solution the membrane surface will be either negatively or positively charged. Thus, the charged state can be easily adjusted even by small changes of the pH value of the solution. Charged polystyrene beads were used as model reagent to investigate the pH dependent selectivity of the membrane. It was found that electrostatic forces are dominating the interactions between polystyrene beads and membrane surface during the filtration. This enables a complete control of the membrane's selectivity according to the electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, differently charged beads marked with fluorescent dyes were used to investigate the selectivity of mixtures of charged components. These different components were successfully separated according to their charged state proving the selectivity of the invented membrane.",Inferring Active Noise Characteristics from the Paired Observations of Anomalous Diffusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959986,Polymers,2019 04 11,"Anomalous diffusion has been most often argued in terms of a position fluctuation of a tracer. We here propose the other fluctuating observable, i.e., momentum transfer defined as the time integral of applied force to hold a tracer's position. Being a conjugated variable, the momentum transfer is thought of as generating the anomalous diffusion paired with the position's one. By putting together the paired anomalous diffusions, we aim to extract useful information in complex systems, which can be applied to experiments like tagged monomer observations in chromatin. The polymer being in the equilibrium, the mean square displacement (or variance) of position displacement or momentum transfer exhibits the sub- or superdiffusion, respectively, in which the sum of the anomalous diffusion indices is conserved quite generally, but the nonequilibrium media that generate the active noise may manifest the derivations from the equilibrium relation. We discuss the deviations that reflect the characteristics of the active noise."

These plants are rich in essential oils, which can be found in their fruits, seeds, leaves, branches, roots and stems. Some Piper species have simple chemical profiles, while others, such as Piper nigrum, Piper betle, and Piper auritum, contain very diverse suites of secondary metabolites. In traditional medicine, Piper species have been used worldwide to treat several diseases such as urological problems, skin, liver and stomach ailments, for wound healing, and as antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, Piper species could be used as natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agents in food preservation. The phytochemicals and essential oils of Piper species have shown strong antioxidant activity, in comparison with synthetic antioxidants, and demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activities against human pathogens. Moreover, Piper species possess therapeutic and preventive potential against several chronic disorders. Among the functional properties of Piper plants/extracts/active components the antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and neuropharmacological activities of the extracts and extract-derived bioactive constituents are thought to be key effects for the protection against chronic conditions, based on preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, besides clinical studies.

Apicomplexan parasites can infect one or more hosts, in which they differentiate into several morphologically and metabolically distinct life cycle stages. These developmental transitions rely on changes in gene expression. In the last few years, the important roles of different members of the ApiAP2 transcription factor family in regulating life cycle transitions and other aspects of parasite biology have become apparent.

Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the characteristics of drivers' eye movements to promote road safety. This study focuses on analyzing the changes of drivers' eye-movement characteristics in anxiety. We used various materials to induce drivers' anxiety, and then conducted the real driving experiments and driving simulations to collect drivers' eye-movement data. Then, we compared the differences between calm and anxiety on drivers' eye-movement characteristics, in order to extract the key eye-movement features. The least squares method of change point analysis was carried out to detect the time and locations of sudden changes in eye movement characteristics. The results show that the least squares method is effective for identifying eye-movement changes of female drivers in anxiety. It was also found that changes in road environments could cause a significant increase in fixation count and fixation duration for female drivers, such as in scenes with traffic accidents or sharp curves. The findings of this study can be used to recognize unexpected events in road environment and improve the geometric design of curved roads. This study can also be used to develop active driving warning systems and intelligent human⁻machine interactions in vehicles.

In the present study, we investigated its effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth and the underlying mechanisms. Toward SK-Hep-1 and SNU-423 cells, ponatinib induces apoptosis by upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 and -7 and promotes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by inhibiting CDK4/6/CyclinD1 complex and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. It inhibits the growth-stimulating mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, the phosphorylation of Src on both negative and positive regulation sites, and Jak2 and Stat3 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, it also activates the PDK1, the protein kinase B (Akt), and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Blocking mTOR signaling strongly sensitizes cells to inhibition by ponatinib and makes ponatinib a much more potent inhibitor of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that ponatinib exerts both positive and negative effects on hepatocellular cell proliferation, and eliminating its growth-stimulating effects by drug combination or potentially by chemical medication can significantly improve its efficacy as an anti-cancer drug.",Compounding Plasmon⁻Exciton Strong Coupling System with Gold Nanofilm to Boost Rabi Splitting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959968,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Various plasmonic nanocavities possessing an extremely small mode volume have been developed and applied successfully in the study of strong light-matter coupling. Driven by the desire of constructing quantum networks and other functional quantum devices, a growing trend of strong coupling research is to explore the possibility of fabricating simple strong coupling nanosystems as the building blocks to construct complex systems or devices. Herein, we investigate such a nanocube-exciton building block (i.e. AuNC@J-agg), which is fabricated by coating Au nanocubes with excitonic J-aggregate molecules. The extinction spectra of AuNC@J-agg assembly, as well as the dark field scattering spectra of the individual nanocube-exciton, exhibit Rabi splitting of 100⁻140 meV, which signifies strong plasmon⁻exciton coupling. We further demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a more complex system of AuNC@J-agg on Au film, which achieves a much stronger coupling, with Rabi splitting of 377 meV. This work provides a practical pathway of building complex systems from building blocks, which are simple strong coupling systems, which lays the foundation for exploring further fundamental studies or inventing novel quantum devices.",Genetic Susceptibility in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma in a Spanish Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959967,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Despite classical environmental risk factors like tobacco, alcohol or viral infection, not all individuals develop head and neck cancer. Therefore, identification of the genetic susceptibility produced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is an important task. A total of 296 human papillomavirus negative head and neck cancer (HNC) patients (126 laryngeal, 100 pharyngeal and 70 oral cavity) were included in the study, involving 29 candidate SNPs in genes within important carcinogenic pathways (oncogenesis and tumour suppression, DNA repair, inflammation, oxidation and apoptosis). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan probes or restriction fragment length assays in peripheral blood DNA. In addition, 259 paired controls were also evaluated with the same risk factors for each specific location. Nine SNPs in DNA repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181), inflammatory (IL2 rs2069762, IL6 rs1800795), oxidative (NFE2L2 rs13035806 and rs2706110) and apoptotic genes (TP53 rs1042522, MDM2 rs2279744, BCL2 rs2279115) were differently associated with HNSCC susceptibility by location.

However, there are few applications of this technology to cancer genomics. We aim to develop DL models to extract deep features from the breast cancer gene expression data and copy number alteration (CNA) data separately and jointly. We hypothesize that the deep features are associated with patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes. Two unsupervised denoising autoencoders (DAs) were developed to extract deep features from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) breast cancer gene expression and CNA data separately and jointly. A heat map was used to view and cluster patients into subgroups based on these DL features. Fisher's exact test and Pearson' Chi-square test were applied to test the associations of patients' groups and clinical information. Survival differences between the groups were evaluated by Kaplan⁻Meier (KM) curves. Associations between each of the features and patient's overall survival were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards (COX-PH) model and a risk score for each feature set from the different omics data sets was generated from the survival regression coefficients. The risk scores for each feature set were binarized into high- and low-risk patient groups to evaluate survival differences using KM curves. Furthermore, the risk scores were traced back to their gene level DAs weights so that the three gene lists for each of the genomic data points were generated to perform gene set enrichment analysis. Patients were clustered into two groups based on concatenated features from the gene expression and CNA data and these two groups showed different overall survival rates (p-value = 0.049) and different ER (Estrogen receptor) statuses (p-value = 0.002, OR (odds ratio) = 0.626). All the risk scores from the gene expression and CNA data and their concatenated one were significantly associated with breast cancer survival. The patients with the high-risk group were significantly associated with patients' worse outcomes (p-values ≤ 0.0023). The concatenated risk score was enriched by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, the regulation of nucleic acid-templated transcription, the regulation of apoptotic process, the positive regulation of gene expression, the positive regulation of cell proliferation, heart morphogenesis, the regulation of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process, with FDR (false discovery rate) less than 0.05. We confirmed DAs can effectively extract meaningful genomic features from genomic data and concatenating multiple data sources can improve the significance of the features associated with breast cancer patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes.","Physico-Chemical Analysis of Wastewater Discharge from Selected Paint Industries in Lagos, Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959965,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Effluents from the paint industry have been a major source of environmental pollution. There is a need to investigate the compliance of wastewater discharged from paint industries with regulatory standards. In response, this study evaluates the physicochemical parameters of both raw and treated wastewater, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) efficiencies as well as the compliance level of five selected paint manufacturing companies in Lagos, Nigeria with some regulatory standards: Federal Ministry of Environment (FME) in Nigeria, World Health Organization (WHO) and Department of Water Affairs (DWA) in South Africa. All parameters investigated were analysed using standard methods. The values of pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) levels were in the range of 4⁻12.2, 149.1⁻881.3 mS/m and 1100⁻6510 mg/L, respectively. The range of other parameters include total suspended solids (TSS); 0⁻2470 mg/L, TS; 1920⁻6510 mg/L, chloride; 63.8⁻733.8 mg/L, dissolved oxygen (DO); 0⁻6.7 mg/L, oil and grease (O &amp; G); 44⁻100 mg/L, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); 162.8⁻974.7 mg/L, chemical oxygen demand (COD); 543⁻1231 mg/L, nitrates;12.89⁻211.2 mg/L, phosphate; below detection limit (bdl)⁻0.02 mg/L, sulphate; 195⁻1434 mg/L, nickel; bdl⁻1.9 mg/L while copper, lead and chromium were below detection limits. The results indicated that the WWTPs of the studied paint companies were ineffective in reducing the TS, TSS, BOD, COD and (O &amp; G) to acceptable limits. Routine monitoring of wastewater from paint industries is therefore recommended to prevent the risk of contamination to the receiving watershed which many communities rely on as source for domestic water."

Patients with CKD have high rates of complications and comorbidities. Thus, they require the prescription of numerous medications, making the management of patients very complex. The prescription of numerous drugs associated with an altered renal- and non-renal clearance makes dose adjustment challenging in these patients, with frequent drug-related adverse events. However, the mechanisms involved in this abnormal drug clearance during CKD are not still well identified. We propose here that the transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is the cellular receptor for indolic uremic toxins, could worsen the metabolism and the excretion of drugs in CKD patients.",Opto-thermally Excited Fabry-Perot Resonance Frequency Behaviors of Clamped Circular Graphene Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959952,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"An opto-thermally excited optical fiber Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonant probe with suspended clamped circular graphene diaphragm is presented in this paper. Then, the dependence of resonance frequency behaviors of graphene diaphragm upon opto-mechanical factors including membrane properties, laser excitation parameters and film boundary conditions are investigated via COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. The results show that the radius and thickness of membrane will linearly affect the optical fiber light-induced temperature distribution, thus resulting in rapidly decreasing resonance frequency changes with the radius-to-thickness ratio. Moreover, the prestress can be regulated in the range of 108 Pa to 10⁸ Pa by altering the environmental temperature with a scale factor of 14.2 MPa/K. It is important to note that the availability of F-P resonant probe with a defective clamped circular graphene membrane can be improved notably by fabricating the defected circular membrane to a double-end clamped beam, which gives a broader perspective to characterize the resonance performance of opto-thermally excited F-P resonators.","Structural and Functional Characterization of the Human Thymidylate Synthase (hTS) Interface Variant R175C, New Perspectives for the Development of hTS Inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959951,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Human thymidylate synthase (hTS) is pivotal for cell survival and proliferation, indeed it provides the only synthetic source of dTMP, required for DNA biosynthesis. hTS represents a validated target for anticancer chemotherapy. However, active site-targeting drugs towards hTS have limitations connected to the onset of resistance. Thus, new strategies have to be applied to effectively target hTS without inducing resistance in cancer cells. Here, we report the generation and the functional and structural characterization of a new hTS interface variant in which Arg175 is replaced by a cysteine. Arg175 is located at the interface of the hTS obligate homodimer and protrudes inside the active site of the partner subunit, in which it provides a fundamental contribution for substrate binding. Indeed, the R175C variant results catalytically inactive. The introduction of a cysteine at the dimer interface is functional for development of new hTS inhibitors through innovative strategies, such as the tethering approach. Structural analysis, performed through X-ray crystallography, has revealed that a cofactor derivative is entrapped inside the catalytic cavity of the hTS R175C variant. The peculiar binding mode of the cofactor analogue suggests new clues exploitable for the design of new hTS inhibitors.","Serum iron, Magnesium, Copper, and Manganese Levels in Alcoholism: A Systematic Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959950,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"The aim of this paper was to review recent literature (from 2000 onwards) and summarize the newest findings on fluctuations in the concentration of some essential macro- and microelements in those patients with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. The focus was mainly on four elements which the authors found of particular interest: Iron, magnesium, copper, and manganese. After independently reviewing over 50 articles, the results were consistent with regard to iron and magnesium. On the other hand, data were limited, and in some cases contradictory, as far as copper and manganese were concerned. Iron overload and magnesium deficiency are two common results of an excessive and prolonged consumption of alcohol. An increase in the levels of iron can be seen both in the serum and within the cells, hepatocytes in particular. This is due to a number of factors: Increased ferritin levels, lower hepcidin levels, as well as some fluctuations in the concentration of the TfR receptor for transferrin, among others. Hypomagnesemia is universally observed among those suffering from alcoholism. Again, the causes for this are numerous and include malnutrition, drug abuse, respiratory alkalosis, and gastrointestinal problems, apart from the direct influence of excessive alcohol intake. Unfortunately, studies regarding the levels of both copper and manganese in the case of (alcoholic) liver disease are scarce and often contradictory. Still, the authors have attempted to summarize and give a thorough insight into the literature available, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in the studies. Frequent comorbidities and mutual relationships between the elements in question are just some of the complications in the study of this topic.",Organellar DNA Polymerases in Complex Plastid-Bearing Algae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959949,Biomolecules,2019 06 10,"DNA replication in plastids and mitochondria is generally regulated by nucleus-encoded proteins. In plants and red algae, a nucleus-encoded enzyme called POP (plant and protist organellar DNA polymerase) is involved in DNA replication in both organelles by virtue of its dual localization. POPs are family A DNA polymerases, which include bacterial DNA polymerase I (PolI). POP homologs have been found in a wide range of eukaryotes, including plants, algae, and non-photosynthetic protists. However, the phylogeny and subcellular localizations of POPs remain unclear in many algae, especially in secondary and tertiary plastid-bearing groups. In this study, we report that chlorarachniophytes possess two evolutionarily distinct POPs, and fluorescent protein-tagging experiments demonstrate that they are targeted to the secondary plastids and mitochondria, respectively. The timing of DNA replication is different between the two organelles in the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans, and this seems to be correlated to the transcription of respective POP genes. Dinoflagellates also carry two distinct POP genes, possibly for their plastids and mitochondria, whereas haptophytes and ochrophytes have only one. Therefore, unlike plants, some algal groups are likely to have evolved multiple DNA polymerases for various organelles. This study provides a new insight into the evolution of organellar DNA replication in complex plastid-bearing organisms.",Association between Polymorphisms of OCT1 and Metabolic Response to Metformin in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959948,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Insulin-sensitizer treatment with metformin is widely used in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the treatment effectiveness shows individual differences in PCOS patients. Organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and 2 have been reported to mediate metformin transport in the liver and kidney, respectively. In this study, we investigated the association between the polymorphisms of OCT1 and OCT2 and the treatment effectiveness of metformin in PCOS patients. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OCT1 (rs683369 and rs628031) and OCT2 (rs316019) were analyzed in 87 PCOS and 113 control women. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), which represented metformin treatment response, were conducted at the start of treatment and after six-month treatment. The results demonstrated that the SNP frequencies of OCT1 and OCT2 were not associated with PCOS pathophysiology, and that the polymorphisms of OCT1 and OCT2 were not associated with the OGTT parameters at baseline. However, PCOS patients with the G allele of OCT1 rs683369 and/or with the A allele of OCT1 rs628031 had increased insulin sensitivity compared to those with wild-type genotype after receiving metformin treatment. Moreover, the interactions of metformin*SNP were significant in both OCT1 rs683369 (p < 0.001) and rs628031 (p = 0.001) during the treatment period. Taken together, genetic polymorphisms of OCT1 contributed to different metformin treatment responses, and further study is needed to establish personalized treatment programs using a pharmacogenomic algorithm approach in PCOS patients.",Influences of Stored Product Insect Movements on Integrated Pest Management Decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959947,Insects,2019 06 10,"Insect movement inside and outside grain bulks and processed products influences pest management decisions. Movement allows insects to find essential food resources, shelters (refuges), warmer and/or humid locations, mating and egg-laying sites, even when they are rare in fields, buildings, mills, warehouses, and inside grain masses. This review discussed the advantages and disadvantages of stored product insect movements, and the influence of insect mobility on some integrated pest management practices. Insect movement (1) results in clumped insect spatial distributions and thus makes large sample sizes necessary for monitoring; (2) makes trapping more efficient, but is influenced by many factors; (3) allows control methods to be effective, but requires pest management programs to be area-wide; (4) makes eradication of quarantine pests difficult and commodities are quickly re-infested; and (5) results in a diverse genetic pool and speeds the development of resistance to pesticides. Any element of an IPM approach should use the knowledge of insect movement. Reasons for the difficult interpretation of cryptic movement behaviours of insects were provided and future research areas were suggested.",Microencapsulation of Thymol in Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA): Physical and Antibacterial Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959946,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Thymol has been shown to be a safe and effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that can be used as a food preservative. However, its volatile characteristics and strong odor limit its use in food products. The microencapsulation of this essential oil in biopolymers could overcome these disadvantages. In this work, thymol-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles were successfully prepared and the optimal encapsulation efficiency was obtained at 20% (w/w) thymol. Microparticles containing thymol presented a spherical shape and smooth surface. Microencapsulation significantly improved the thermal and storage stability of thymol. In vitro release profiles demonstrated an initial fast release followed by a slow and sustained release. Thymol-loaded microparticles had strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the effectiveness of their antibacterial properties was confirmed in a milk test. Therefore, the thymol-loaded microparticles show great potential for use as an antimicrobial and as preservation additives in food.",Shape Programming Using Triangular and Rectangular Soft Robot Primitives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959945,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"This paper presents fabric-based soft robotic modules with primitive morphologies, which are analogous to basic geometrical polygons-trilateral and quadrilateral. The two modules are the inflatable beam (IB) and fabric-based rotary actuator (FRA). The FRA module is designed with origami-inspired V-shaped pleats, which creates a trilateral outline. Upon pressurization, the pleats unfold, which enables propagation of angular displacement of the FRA module. This allows the FRA module to be implemented as a mobility unit in the larger assembly of pneumatic structures. In the following, we examine various ways by which FRA modules can be connected to IB modules. We studied how different ranges of motion can be achieved by varying the design of the rotary joint of the assemblies. Using a state transition-based position control system, movement of the assembled modules could be controlled by regulating the pneumatic pressurization of the FRA module at the joint. These basic modules allow us to build different types of pneumatic structures. In this paper, using IB and FRA modules of various dimensions, we constructed a soft robotic limb with an end effector, which can be attached to wheelchairs to provide assistive grasping functions for users with disabilities.",Surgical Management of Chronic Rhinosinusitis in Cystic Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959944,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Cystic fibrosis patients frequently develop chronic rhinosinusitis as a result of their propensity to form inspissated mucus and impairment of mucociliary clearance. They exhibit variable symptom burden even in the setting of positive radiographic and endoscopic findings. Current evidence suggests a positive effect of managing sinonasal disease on pulmonary health. Topical antimicrobial and mucolytic therapies are frequently required to manage the disease with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Endoscopic sinus surgery has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in controlling symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with comorbid cystic fibrosis. However, the impact of surgery on pulmonary health remains an active area of investigation. In addition, a growing body of research has suggested a more extended surgical approach creating large sinonasal cavities with gravity-dependent drainage pathways, followed by adjuvant medical therapies, as an ideal strategy to optimally control disease and prevent pulmonary exacerbations. In this manuscript, we provide an up-to-date review of current evidence in the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis patients."

Further development and a better understanding of this versatile platform will lead to an expansion of potential applications. In this study, we propose a facile synthesis of AuNPs using hydrogen peroxide as a reducing agent and collagen as a stabilizing agent. Our synthetic approach results in ""raspberry""-like AuNPs with a mean diameter of 60 nm, as revealed by electron microscopy. The optical properties of the AuNPs were assessed by UV-Vis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and their stability and in vitro cytotoxicity were evaluated as well. HeLa cell viability values were only modestly affected compared to control, with the highest concentration tested displaying a 20% decrease in cellular viability. The dose-dependent cellular internalization in the 20⁻60 nM range indicate the highest internalization rate at 60 nM and uptake values as high as 35%. This result correlated well with the viability results. These type of anisotropic AuNPs are proposed for biomedical applications such as hyperthermia, contrast agents or imaging.

Chen (Fabaceae) is a woody tree species indigenous to Hainan Island in China. Due to its high medicinal and commercial value, this tree species has been planted over 3500 ha² in southern China. There is an urgent need for improvement of the D. odorifera germplasm, however, limited information on germplasm collection, conservation, and assessment of genetic resources is available. Therefore, we have built a database of 251 individuals collected across the whole of southern China, which included 42 wild trees and 210 cultivated trees, with the following objectives. (1) Evaluate genetic diversity and population structure of the database using 19 microsatellite markers and (2) develop a core collection for improvement and breeding programs. Totally, the 19 microsatellite markers harbored 77 alleles across the database with the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranging from 0.03 to 0.66. Medium genetic diversity level was inferred by Nei's gene diversity (0.38), Shannon's information index (0.65), and observed (0.33) and expected heterozygosity (0.38). Structure analysis showed that four was the optimum cluster size using the model-based Bayesian procedure, and the 251 D. odorifera individuals were grouped into five populations including four pure ones (RP1-4) and one mixed one (MIX) based on their maximum membership coefficients. Among these populations, the expected heterozygosity varied from 0.30 (RP3) to 0.38 (RP4). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed 11% genetic variation existed among populations, and moderate population differentiation was inferred by the matrix of pairwise Fst (genetic differentiation among populations), which was in the range of 0.031 to 0.095. Moreover, a core collection of 31 D. odorifera individuals including six wild and 25 cultivated trees was developed, which was only 12.4% of the database but conserved the whole genetic diversity. The results of this study provided additional insight into the genetic structure of the large D. odorifera germplasm, and the core collection will be useful for the efficient and sustainable utilization of genetic resources, as well as efficient improvement in breeding programs.",Measurement of Radial Elasticity and Original Height of DNA Duplex Using Tapping-Mode Atomic Force Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959929,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can characterize nanomaterial elasticity. However, some one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as DNA, are too small to locate with an AFM tip because of thermal drift and the nonlinearity of piezoelectric actuators. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address the shortcomings of AFM and obtain the radial Young's modulus of a DNA duplex. The elastic properties are evaluated by combining physical calculations and measured experimental results. The initial elasticity of the DNA is first assumed; based on tapping-mode scanning images and tip⁻sample interaction force simulations, the calculated elastic modulus is extracted. By minimizing the error between the assumed and experimental values, the extracted elasticity is assigned as the actual modulus for the material. Furthermore, tapping-mode image scanning avoids the necessity of locating the probe exactly on the target sample. In addition to elasticity measurements, the deformation caused by the tapping force from the AFM tip is compensated and the original height of the DNA is calculated. The results show that the radial compressive Young's modulus of DNA is 125⁻150 MPa under a tapping force of 0.5⁻1.3 nN; its original height is 1.9 nm. This approach can be applied to the measurement of other nanomaterials.",The Importance of the Knee Joint Meniscal Fibrocartilages as Stabilizing Weight Bearing Structures Providing Global Protection to Human Knee-Joint Tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959928,Cells,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to review aspects of the pathobiology of the meniscus in health and disease and show how degeneration of the meniscus can contribute to deleterious changes in other knee joint components. The menisci, distinctive semilunar weight bearing fibrocartilages, provide knee joint stability, co-ordinating functional contributions from articular cartilage, ligaments/tendons, synovium, subchondral bone and infra-patellar fat pad during knee joint articulation. The meniscus contains metabolically active cell populations responsive to growth factors, chemokines and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, resulting in the synthesis of matrix metalloproteases and A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats (ADAMTS)-4 and 5 which can degrade structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans leading to function-limiting changes in meniscal and other knee joint tissues. Such degradative changes are hall-marks of osteoarthritis (OA). No drugs are currently approved that change the natural course of OA and translate to long-term, clinically relevant benefits. For any pharmaceutical therapeutic intervention in OA to be effective, disease modifying drugs will have to be developed which actively modulate the many different cell types present in the knee to provide a global therapeutic. Many individual and combinatorial approaches are being developed to treat or replace degenerate menisci using 3D printing, bioscaffolds and hydrogel delivery systems for therapeutic drugs, growth factors and replacement progenitor cell populations recognising the central role the menisci play in knee joint health.",Sb₂S₃@PPy Coaxial Nanorods: A Versatile and Robust Host Material for Reversible Storage of Alkali Metal Ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959927,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Chalcogenides have attracted great attention as functional materials in optics, electronics, and energy-related applications due to their typical semiconductor properties.

In this work, a one-dimensional coaxial Sb₂S₃@PPy is investigated as a versatile and robust anode in three kinds of alkali metal batteries for the first time, and the energy storage mechanism of these batteries is systematically discussed. As an anode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (KIBs), Sb₂S₃@PPy exhibits high reversible capacity and impressive cycle lifespan.

The hospital length of stay (LOS) for hip replacement admissions is therefore important to be controlled, contributing to savings for hospitals. This study combined medical claims and hospital structure and service data to examine LOS fluctuations and trends, and admission distribution patterns, during weekdays, for hip replacement cases. The study furthermore examined associations of these patterns with the LOS performance. Most hospitals were found to admit hip replacement cases at the start of the week (Monday through Wednesday). There is an upward LOS trend as we approach late weekday admissions. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that LOS weekday inconsistencies, a large proportion of hip replacement admissions on Thursday and Friday, the government ownership status, the bed size, and the critical access status are associated with an increased LOS. On the other hand, the rate of hip replacement admissions over total ones, and the hospital being accredited, are associated with a lower LOS. Findings stress out the need for hospitals to maintain an effective and balanced distribution of hip replacement admissions, evenly during the week, and the need for standardized case management, to avoid practice variability and, therefore, LOS fluctuations for their hip replacement cases.",Elucidation of Novel Therapeutic Targets for Acute Myeloid Leukemias with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 Fusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959925,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion is a frequent chromosomal alteration in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Although RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein has pivotal roles in the development of AMLs with the fusion, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, fusion protein is difficult to target, as it lacks kinase activities. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to elucidate targetable signaling pathways in AMLs with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion. After analysis of 93 AML cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found expression of 293 genes that correlated to the expression of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. Based on these 293 genes, the cyclooxygenase (COX), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathways were predicted to be specifically activated in AMLs with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion. Moreover, the in vitro proliferation of AML cells with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion decreased significantly more than that of AML cells without the fusion, when the pathways were inhibited pharmacologically. The results indicate that novel targetable signaling pathways could be identified by the analysis of the gene expression features of AMLs with non-targetable genetic alterations. The elucidation of specific molecular targets for AMLs that have a specific genetic alteration would promote personalized treatment of AMLs and improve clinical outcomes.",Ultrasonic Inspection of Localized Defects in Low-Porosity CFRP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959924,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"A preliminary backscattered signal model of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate was established. The backscattered signal model was composed of three sub models, which were concerned with structural signal, scattering signal, and non-acoustic noise. Resonance in structural signal and echoes excited by defects (porosity and rich-resin) were studied. The results showed that: resonance would occur when there was sufficient bandwidth; when the CFRP laminate contained voids, the center frequency of the backscattered signal decreased; and the localized defects, including rich-resin and localized porosity, tended to generate apparent echoes where they located. A simplified backscattered signal model was subsequently put forward, showing certain potential in revealing time-frequency properties of backscattered signals. The newly proposed variational mode decomposition was used for defect modes extraction, successfully avoiding the mode mixing and false modes which easily exist in empirical mode decomposition. Subsequently, the generalized Stockwell transform was adopted for the defects localization. The simulation and experiment denoted the coincidence between the backscattered signal model and the experimental signal, and showed the effectiveness of variational mode decomposition and generalized Stockwell transform in localized defects detection.",Technology to Produce High-Purity Anhydrous Rubidium Perrhenate on an Industrial Scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959923,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Technology used to produce high purity anhydrous rubidium perrhenate on an industrial scale from high purity perrhenic acid and rubidium nitrate by the ion-exchange method is described in this paper.

The averaging pixel current adjustment technique is composed of active pixel, reference pixel, and calibration circuit. Polysilicon resistors were used in each active pixel and reference pixel. Resistance deviation among active pixels integrated with the same resistance value cause FPN. The principle of the averaging pixel current adjustment technique for removing FPN is based on the subtraction of dark current of the active pixel from the dark current of the reference pixel. The subtracted current is converted into the voltage, which contains pixel calibration information. The calibration circuit is used to adjust the calibration current. After calibration, the nano-ampere current is output with small deviation. The proposed averaging pixel current adjustment technique is implemented by a chip composed of a pixel array, a calibration circuit, average current generators, and readout circuits. The chip was fabricated using a standard 0.35 μm CMOS process and its performance was evaluated."

In this work, we investigate mechanical properties of disordered paramagnetic fcc FeCr 10 ⁻ 16 Mn 12 ⁻ 32 alloys using density functional theory. The effects of composition and temperature changes on the magnetic state, elastic properties and stacking fault energies of the alloys are studied. Calculated dependencies of the lattice and elastic constants are used to evaluate the effect of the solid solution strengthening by Mn and Cr using a modified Labusch-Nabarro model and a model for concentrated alloys. The effect of Cr and Mn alloying on the stacking fault energies is calculated and discussed in connection to possible deformation mechanisms.",Bioreactor-Controlled Physoxia Regulates TGF-β Signaling to Alter Extracellular Matrix Synthesis by Human Chondrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959909,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Culturing articular chondrocytes under physiological oxygen tension exerts positive effects on their extracellular matrix synthesis. The underlying molecular mechanisms which enhance the chondrocytic phenotype are, however, still insufficiently elucidated. The TGF-β superfamily of growth factors, and the prototypic TGF-β isoforms in particular, are crucial in maintaining matrix homeostasis of these cells. We employed a feedback-controlled table-top bioreactor to investigate the role of TGF-β in microtissues of human chondrocytes over a wider range of physiological oxygen tensions (i.e., physoxia). We compared 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of partial oxygen pressure (pO₂) to the 'normoxic' 20%. We confirmed physoxic conditions through the induction of marker genes (PHD3, VEGF) and oxygen tension-dependent chondrocytic markers (SOX9, COL2A1). We identified 2.5% pO₂ as an oxygen tension optimally improving chondrocytic marker expression (ACAN, COL2A1), while suppressing de-differentiation markers (COL1A1,COL3A1). Expression of TGF-β isoform 2 (TGFB2) was, relatively, most responsive to 2.5% pO₂, while all three isoforms were induced by physoxia. We found TGF-β receptors ALK1 and ALK5 to be regulated by oxygen tension on the mRNA and protein level. In addition, expression of type III co-receptors betaglycan and endoglin appeared to be regulated by oxygen tension as well. R-Smad signaling confirmed that physoxia divergently regulated phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3. Pharmacological inhibition of canonical ALK5-mediated signaling abrogated physoxia-induced COL2A1 and PAI-1 expression. Physoxia altered expression of hypertrophy markers and that of matrix metalloproteases and their activity, as well as expression ratios of specific proteins (Sp)/Krüppel-like transcription factor family members SP1 and SP3, proving a molecular concept of ECM marker regulation. Keeping oxygen levels tightly balanced within a physiological range is important for optimal chondrocytic marker expression. Our study provides novel insights into transcriptional regulations in chondrocytes under physoxic in vitro conditions and may contribute to improving future cell-based articular cartilage repair strategies.",Improving Payload Capacity and Anti-Tumor Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using TAT Peptide Functionalized Polymeric Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959908,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) accumulate specifically in both primary tumors and metastases following systemic administration. However, the poor payload capacity of MSCs limits their use in small molecule drug delivery. To improve drug payload in MSCs, we explored polymeric nanoparticles that were functionalized with transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide. Paclitaxel loaded poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (15⁻16% w/w paclitaxel; diameter of 225 ± 7 nm; and zeta potential of -15 ± 4 mV) were fabricated by emulsion-solvent evaporation method, followed by TAT-conjugation to the surface of nanoparticles via maleimide-thiol chemistry. Our studies demonstrated that TAT functionalization improved the intracellular accumulation and retention of nanoparticles in MSCs. Further, nano-engineering of MSCs did not alter the migration and differentiation potential of MSCs. Treatment with nano-engineered MSCs resulted in significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of tumor growth and improved survival (p < 0.0001) in a mouse orthotopic model of lung cancer compared to that with free or nanoparticle encapsulated drug. In summary, our results demonstrated that MSCs engineered using TAT functionalized nanoparticles serve as an efficient carrier for tumor specific delivery of anticancer drugs, resulting in greatly improved therapeutic efficacy.",Phomaketide A Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis in Human Lymphatic Endothelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959907,Marine drugs,2019 06 10,"Lymphangiogenesis is an important biological process associated with cancer metastasis. The development of new drugs that block lymphangiogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Marine fungus-derived compound phomaketide A, isolated from the fermented broth of Phoma sp. NTOU4195, has been reported to exhibit anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its anti-lymphangiogenic activity has not been clarified to date. In this study, we showed that phomaketide A inhibited cell growth, migration, and tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) without an evidence of cytotoxicity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that phomaketide A reduced LECs-induced lymphangiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signalings. Furthermore, human proteome array analysis indicated that phomaketide A significantly enhanced the protein levels of various protease inhibitors, including cystatin A, serpin B6, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). Importantly, phomaketide A impeded tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the expression of LYVE-1, a specific marker for lymphatic vessels, in tumor xenograft animal model. These results suggest that phomaketide A may impair lymphangiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-3, PKCδ, and eNOS signaling cascades, while simultaneously activating protease inhibitors in human LECs. We document for the first time that phomaketide A inhibits lymphangiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that this natural product could potentially treat cancer metastasis.","Polyphenolic Composition of Rosa canina, Rosa sempervivens and Pyrocantha coccinea Extracts and Assessment of Their Antioxidant Activity in Human Endothelial Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959906,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The aim of the present study was the investigation of the antioxidant activity of plant extracts from Rosa canina, Rosa sempervivens and Pyrocantha coccinea. The results showed that the bioactive compounds found at higher concentrations were in the R. canina extract: hyperoside, astragalin, rutin, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin; in the R. sempervirens extract: quinic acid, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, astragalin and hyperoside; and in the P. coccinea extract: hyperoside, rutin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-catechin, astragalin, vanillin, syringic acid and chlorogenic acid. The total polyphenolic content was 290.00, 267.67 and 226.93 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/g dw, and the total flavonoid content 118.56, 65.78 and 99.16 mg Catechin Equivalent (CE)/g dw for R. caninna, R. sempervirens and P. coccinea extracts, respectively. The extracts exhibited radical scavenging activity in DPPH and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS)•⁺ assays and protection from ROO•-induced DNA damage in the following potency order: R. canina > R. sempervirens > P. coccinea. Finally, treatment with R. canina and P. coccinea extract significantly increased the levels of the antioxidant molecule glutathione, while R. canina extract significantly decreased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in endothelial cells. The results herein indicated that the R. canina extract in particular may be used for developing food supplements or biofunctional foods for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions of endothelium.",An Ensemble Classifier with Case-Based Reasoning System for Identifying Internet Addiction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959905,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 28,"Internet usage has increased dramatically in recent decades. With this growing usage trend, the negative impacts of Internet usage have also increased significantly. One recurring concern involves users with Internet addiction, whose Internet usage has become excessive and disrupted their lives. In order to detect users with Internet addiction and disabuse their inappropriate behavior early, a secure Web service-based EMBAR (ensemble classifier with case-based reasoning) system is proposed in this study. The EMBAR system monitors users in the background and can be used for Internet usage monitoring in the future. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed ensemble classifier with case-based reasoning (CBR) in the proposed EMBAR system for identifying users with potential Internet addiction offers better performance than other classifiers.",Cytotoxic Effect of Paclitaxel and Lapatinib Co-Delivered in Polylactide-co-Poly(ethylene glycol) Micelles on HER-2-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959904,Pharmaceutics,2019 06 10,"To find better strategies to enhance the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel (PTX) and lapatinib (LAP) against breast cancer cells, we analyzed the efficacy of a novel delivery system containing polylactide-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) filomicelles of over 100 nm in length and spherical micelles of approximately 20 nm in diameter. The ¹H NMR measurements confirmed the incorporation of PTX and LAP into micelles. Analysis of the drug release mechanism revealed the diffusion-controlled release of LAP and anomalous transport of PTX. Drug content analysis in lyophilized micelles and micellar solution showed their good storage stability for at least 6 weeks. Blank micelles, LAP-loaded micelles and free LAP did not affect MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of PTX-, PTX/LAP-loaded micelles, and the binary mixture of free PTX and LAP was solely caused by PTX. PTX/LAP-loaded micelles showed greater toxicity compared to the binary mixture of PTX and LAP after 48 h and 72 h. Only free PTX alone induced P-gp activity. This study showed the feasibility of using a LAP and PTX combination to overcome MDR in MCF-7 cells, particularly when co-loaded into micelles. We suggest that PTX/LAP micelles can be applicable not only for the therapy of HER-2-positive, but also HER-2-negative breast cancers.",Failure Analysis of a Humeral Shaft Locking Compression Plate-Surface Investigation and Simulation by Finite Element Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959903,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"A case study of a failed humeral shaft locking compression plate is presented, starting with a clinical case where failure occurred and an implant replacement was required. This study uses finite element method (FEM) in order to determine the failure modes for the clinical case. Four loading scenarios that simulate daily life activities were considered for determining the stress distribution in a humeral shaft locking compression plate (LCP). Referring to the simulation results, the failure analysis was performed on the explant. Using fracture surface investigation methods, stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a mixed mode failure was determined. An initial fatigue failure occurred followed by a sudden failure of the plate implant as a consequence of patient's fall. The fracture morphology was mostly masked by galling; the fractured components were in a sliding contact. Using information from simulations, the loading was inferred and correlated with fracture site and surface features.",Inorganic Polysulfides and Related Reactive Sulfur–Selenium Species from the Perspective of Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959902,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Polysulfides (H₂Sx) represent a class of reactive sulfur species (RSS) which includes molecules such as H₂S₂, H₂S₃, H₂S₄, and H₂S5, and whose presence and impact in biological systems, when compared to other sulfur compounds, has only recently attracted the wider attention of researchers. Studies in this field have revealed a facet-rich chemistry and biological activity associated with such chemically simple, still unusual inorganic molecules. Despite their chemical simplicity, these inorganic species, as reductants and oxidants, metal binders, surfactant-like ""cork screws"" for membranes, components of perthiol signalling and reservoirs for inorganic hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), are at the centre of complicated formation and transformation pathways which affect numerous cellular processes. Starting from their chemistry, the hidden presence and various roles of polysulfides in biology may become more apparent, despite their lack of clear analytical fingerprints and often murky biochemical footprints. Indeed, the biological chemistry of H₂Sx follows many unexplored paths and today, the relationship between H₂S and its oxidized H₂Sx species needs to be clarified as a matter of ""unmistaken identity"". Simultaneously, emerging species, such as HSSeSH and SenS8-n, also need to be considered in earnest.",Epidemiology and Mechanisms of Resistance of Extensively Drug Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959901,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 09,"Antibiotic resistance has increased markedly in gram-negative bacteria over the last two decades, and in many cases has been associated with increased mortality and healthcare costs. The adoption of genotyping and next generation whole genome sequencing of large sets of clinical bacterial isolates has greatly expanded our understanding of how antibiotic resistance develops and transmits among bacteria and between patients. Diverse mechanisms of resistance, including antibiotic degradation, antibiotic target modification, and modulation of permeability through the bacterial membrane have been demonstrated. These fundamental insights into the mechanisms of gram-negative antibiotic resistance have influenced the development of novel antibiotics and treatment practices in highly resistant infections. Here, we review the mechanisms and global epidemiology of antibiotic resistance in some of the most clinically important resistance phenotypes, including carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, extensively drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and XDR Acinetobacter baumannii. Understanding the resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of these pathogens is critical for the development of novel antibacterials and for individual treatment decisions, which often involve alternatives to β-lactam antibiotics."

The probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soils-sandy loam and two silt loams-with six water contents from air-dry to saturation. The conversion from S 11 parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and Roth gave results closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of about 8 cm³ in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.","Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Antihyperglycemic Activities of the Wild Lactarius deliciosus from China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959889,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"The wild mushroom Lactarius deliciosus from China was studied for the first time to obtain information about its chemical composition, antioxidant, and antihyperglycemic activities. Nutritional value, dietary fiber, fatty acids, metal elements, free sugars, free amino acids, organic acids, flavor 5'-nucleotides, and volatile aroma compounds were determined. Potential antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities were also tested by investigating 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals scavenging activities, ferric ion reducing activity, as well as α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities using ethanol and aqueous extracts. The results showed that L. deliciosus was a good wild mushroom with high protein, carbohydrate, and dietary fiber contents, while low in fat and calorie, extensive unsaturated fatty acids contents, with negligible health risks about harmful metal elements. Twenty kinds of free amino acids were detected with a total content 3389.45 mg per 100 g dw. Flavor 5'-nucleotides including 5'-CMP, 5'-UMP, 5'-IMP, and 5'-AMP were 929.85, 45.21, 311.75, and 14.49 mg per 100 g dw, respectively. Mannitol (7825.00 mg per 100 g dw) was the main free sugar, and quininic acid (729.84 mg per 100 g dw) was the main organic acid. Twenty-five kinds of volatile aroma compounds were identified, acids (84.23%) were the most abundant compounds based on content, while aldehydes (15 of 25) were the most abundant compounds based on variety. In addition, both ethanol and aqueous extracts from L. deliciosus exhibited excellent antioxidant activity.

Biological and Pharmacological Consequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959888,Cells,2019 06 10,"Copper, the highly toxic micronutrient, plays two essential roles: it is a catalytic and structural cofactor for Cu-dependent enzymes, and it acts as a secondary messenger. In the cells, copper is imported by CTR1 (high-affinity copper transporter 1), a transmembrane high-affinity copper importer, and DMT1 (divalent metal transporter). In cytosol, enzyme-specific chaperones receive copper from CTR1 C-terminus and deliver it to their apoenzymes. DMT1 cannot be a donor of catalytic copper because it does not have a cytosol domain which is required for copper transfer to the Cu-chaperons that assist the formation of cuproenzymes. Here, we assume that DMT1 can mediate copper way required for a regulatory copper pool. To verify this hypothesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate H1299 cell line with CTR1 or DMT1 single knockout (KO) and CTR1/DMT1 double knockout (DKO). To confirm KOs of the genes qRT-PCR were used. Two independent clones for each gene were selected for further studies. In CTR1 KO cells, expression of the DMT1 gene was significantly increased and vice versa. In subcellular compartments of the derived cells, copper concentration dropped, however, in nuclei basal level of copper did not change dramatically. CTR1 KO cells, but not DMT1 KO, demonstrated reduced sensitivity to cisplatin and silver ions, the agents that enter the cell through CTR1. Using single CTR1 and DMT1 KO, we were able to show that both, CTR1 and DMT1, provided the formation of vital intracellular cuproenzymes (SOD1, COX), but not secretory ceruloplasmin. The loss of CTR1 resulted in a decrease in the level of COMMD1, XIAP, and NF-κB. Differently, the DMT1 deficiency induced increase of the COMMD1, HIF1α, and XIAP levels. The possibility of using CTR1 KO and DMT1 KO cells to study homeodynamics of catalytic and signaling copper selectively is discussed.",Analysis of Association between Vitamin D Deficiency and Insulin Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959886,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Recent evidence revealed extra skeleton activity of vitamin D, including prevention from cardiometabolic diseases and cancer development as well as anti-inflammatory properties. It is worth noting that vitamin D deficiency is very common and may be associated with the pathogenesis of insulin-resistance-related diseases, including obesity and diabetes. This review aims to provide molecular mechanisms showing how vitamin D deficiency may be involved in the insulin resistance formation. The PUBMED database and published reference lists were searched to find studies published between 1980 and 2019. It was identified that molecular action of vitamin D is involved in maintaining the normal resting levels of ROS and Ca2+, not only in pancreatic β-cells, but also in insulin responsive tissues. Both genomic and non-genomic action of vitamin D is directed towards insulin signaling. Thereby, vitamin D reduces the extent of pathologies associated with insulin resistance such as oxidative stress and inflammation. More recently, it was also shown that vitamin D prevents epigenetic alterations associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is one of the factors accelerating insulin resistance formation. The results of basic and clinical research support beneficial action of vitamin D in the reduction of insulin resistance and related pathologies.",Transparent Electrothermal Heaters Based on Vertically-Oriented Graphene Glass Hybrid Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959885,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Transparent heating devices are widely used in daily life-related applications that can be achieved by various heating materials with suitable resistances. Herein, high-performance vertically-oriented graphene (VG) films are directly grown on soda-lime glass by a radio-frequency (rf) plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method, giving reasonable resistances for electrothermal heating. The optical and electrical properties of VG films are found to be tunable by optimizing the growth parameters such as growth time, carrier gas flow, etc. The electrothermal performances of the derived materials with different resistances are thus studied systematically. Specifically, the VG film on glass with a transmittance of ~73% at 550 nm and a sheet resistance of ~3.9 KΩ/□ is fabricated into a heating device, presenting a saturated temperature up to 55 °C by applying 80 V for 3 min. The VG film on the glass at a transmittance of ~43% and a sheet resistance of 0.76 KΩ/□ exhibits a highly steady temperature increase up to ~108 °C with a maximum heating rate of ~2.6 °C/s under a voltage of 60 V. Briefly, the tunable sheet resistance, good adhesion of VG to the growth substrate, relative high heating efficiency, and large heating temperature range make VG films on glass decent candidates for electrothermal related applications in defrosting and defogging devices.",Safety Assessment of Compounds after In Vitro Metabolic Conversion Using Zebrafish Eleuthero Embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959884,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Zebrafish-based platforms have recently emerged as a useful tool for toxicity testing as they combine the advantages of in vitro and in vivo methodologies. Nevertheless, the capacity to metabolically convert xenobiotics by zebrafish eleuthero embryos is supposedly low. To circumvent this concern, a comprehensive methodology was developed wherein test compounds (i.e., parathion, malathion and chloramphenicol) were first exposed in vitro to rat liver microsomes (RLM) for 1 h at 37 °C. After adding methanol, the mixture was ultrasonicated, placed for 2 h at -20 °C, centrifuged and the supernatant evaporated. The pellet was resuspended in water for the quantification of the metabolic conversion and the detection of the presence of metabolites using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet-Mass (UHPLC-UV-MS). Next, three days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish eleuthero embryos were exposed to the metabolic mix diluted in Danieau's medium for 48 h at 28 °C, followed by a stereomicroscopic examination of the adverse effects induced, if any. The novelty of our method relies in the possibility to quantify the rate of the in vitro metabolism of the parent compound and to co-incubate three dpf larvae and the diluted metabolic mix for 48 h without inducing major toxic effects. The results for parathion show an improved predictivity of the toxic potential of the compound.",Critical Role of an MHC Class I-Like/Innate-Like T Cell Immune Surveillance System in Host Defense against Ranavirus (Frog Virus 3) Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959883,Viruses,2019 06 10,"Besides the central role of classical Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class Ia-restricted conventional Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells in antiviral host immune response, the amphibian Xenopuslaevis critically rely on MHC class I-like (mhc1b10.1.L or XNC10)-restricted innate-like (i)T cells (iVα6 T cells) to control infection by the ranavirus Frog virus 3 (FV3). To complement and extend our previous reverse genetic studies showing that iVα6 T cells are required for tadpole survival, as well as for timely and effective adult viral clearance, we examined the conditions and kinetics of iVα6 T cell response against FV3. Using a FV3 knock-out (KO) growth-defective mutant, we found that upregulation of the XNC10 restricting class I-like gene and the rapid recruitment of iVα6 T cells depend on detectable viral replication and productive FV3 infection. In addition, by in vivo depletion with XNC10 tetramers, we demonstrated the direct antiviral effector function of iVα6 T cells. Notably, the transitory iV6 T cell defect delayed innate interferon and cytokine gene response, resulting in long-lasting negative inability to control FV3 infection. These findings suggest that in Xenopus and likely other amphibians, an immune surveillance system based on the early activation of iT cells by non-polymorphic MHC class-I like molecules is important for efficient antiviral immune response.",The Role of Motor Learning on Measures of Physical Requirements and Motor Variability During Repetitive Screwing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959882,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"We investigated whether physical requirements and motor variability decreased over days in novices during a repetitive screwing task. Fifty-seven subjects performed one hour of repetitive screwing and fastening on three days, separated by 2⁻7 days. The average physical requirement and relative cycle-to-cycle variability (coefficient of variation, i.e., CV) were calculated from continuous recordings of electromyography of four arm muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum), forearm acceleration, and electrocardiography. Muscle activity levels, heart rate, and forearm acceleration decreased from day 1 to day 2 (range: ~4% to ~20%) and/or 3 (range: ~4% to ~28%). Not all muscles showed a similar pattern. Activity of the extensor digitorum and biceps brachii decreased already between days 1 and 2 (range: ~6% to ~13%), whereas activity of the flexor carpi radialis and triceps brachii decreased between days 1 and 3 (range: ~13% to ~20%). No changes in physical requirement were detected between days 2 and 3. Relative motor variability did not change across days, except that variability of forearm acceleration increased from day 1 to 3 (~5%). This study found consistent changes in physical requirements and indicated that several arm muscles show earlier decreases of muscular activity, like the extensor digitorum, compared to other body parts, like the flexor carpi radialis. Moreover, movement strategies may develop differently than muscle activation strategies, based on the different developments of physical requirements and motor variability. The development of physical requirements in industrial tasks is part of daily living and starts at task onset, highlighting the importance of task familiarization and the randomization of experimental conditions in scientific studies.",MuCHLoc: Indoor ZigBee Localization System Utilizing Inter-Channel Characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959881,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The deployment of a large-scale indoor sensor network faces a sensor localization problem because we need to manually locate significantly large numbers of sensors when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable in an indoor environment. Fingerprinting localization is a popular indoor localization method relying on the received signal strength (RSS) of radio signals, which helps to solve the sensor localization problem. However, fingerprinting suffers from low accuracy because of an RSS instability, particularly in sensor localization, owing to low-power ZigBee modules used on sensor nodes. In this paper, we present MuCHLoc, a fingerprinting sensor localization system that improves the localization accuracy by utilizing channel diversity. The key idea of MuCHLoc is the extraction of channel diversity from the RSS of Wi-Fi access points (APs) measured on multiple ZigBee channels through fingerprinting localization. MuCHLoc overcomes the RSS instability by increasing the dimensions of the fingerprints using channel diversity. We conducted experiments collecting the RSS of Wi-Fi APs in a practical environment while switching the ZigBee channels, and evaluated the localization accuracy. The evaluations revealed that MuCHLoc improves the localization accuracy by approximately 15% compared to localization using a single channel. We also showed that MuCHLoc is effective in a dynamic radio environment where the radio propagation channel is unstable from the movement of objects including humans.",WHO Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Research Network (TPRN): Report of the Kobe Expert Meeting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959880,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"The WHO Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Research Network (TPRN) was established in 2016 in response to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015⁻2030.

Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9 should undergo pre-hospital intubation (PHI). There is controversy about whether PHI is beneficial. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of PHI in patients after sTBI. A multicenter, prospective cohort study was performed in Switzerland, including 832 adults with sTBI. Outcomes were death and impaired consciousness at 14 days. Associations between risk factors and outcomes were assessed with univariate and multivariate Cox models for survival, and univariate and multivariate regression models for impaired consciousness. Potential risk factors were age, GCS on scene, pupil reaction, Injury Severity Score (ISS), PHI, oxygen administration, and type of admission to trauma center. Age, GCS on scene < 9, abnormal pupil reaction and ISS ≥ 25 were associated with mortality. GCS < 9 and ISS ≥ 25 were correlated with impaired consciousness. PHI was overall not associated with short-term mortality and consciousness. However, there was a significative interaction with PHI and major trauma. PHI improves outcome from patients with sTBI and an ISS ≥ 25.",Regulation of Osteoclast Differentiation and Skeletal Maintenance by Histone Deacetylases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959867,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Bone is a dynamic tissue that must respond to developmental, repair, and remodeling cues in a rapid manner with changes in gene expression. Carefully-coordinated cycles of bone resorption and formation are essential for healthy skeletal growth and maintenance. Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells that are responsible for breaking down bone by secreting acids to dissolve the bone mineral and proteolytic enzymes that degrade the bone extracellular matrix. Increased osteoclast activity has a severe impact on skeletal health, and therefore, osteoclasts represent an important therapeutic target in skeletal diseases, such as osteoporosis. Progression from multipotent progenitors into specialized, terminally-differentiated cells involves carefully-regulated patterns of gene expression to control lineage specification and emergence of the cellular phenotype. This process requires coordinated action of transcription factors with co-activators and co-repressors to bring about proper activation and inhibition of gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are an important group of transcriptional co-repressors best known for reducing gene expression via removal of acetyl modifications from histones at HDAC target genes. This review will cover the progress that has been made recently to understand the role of HDACs and their targets in regulating osteoclast differentiation and activity and, thus, serve as potential therapeutic target.",LED-Cured Reflection Gratings Stored in an Acrylate-Based Photopolymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959866,Polymers,2019 06 10,"The storage of volume holographic reflection gratings in low-toxicity photopolymers represents a challenge at present since they can be used in many important applications such as biosensors and holographic optical elements. In this context, an acrylate-based photopolymer developed in our research group was employed to study the recording of unslanted holographic reflection gratings at high spatial frequencies. The optimal preparation conditions of the photopolymer layers were determinated. The diffraction efficiencies are measured in both recording and curing stage and a comparative study of these values was realized. In addition, a theoretical study using Kogelnik's coupled wave theory was carried out with the aim of understanding the diffraction efficiency behaviour of both processes. In this work, a maximum diffraction efficiency of 14.1% was reached after a curing process in 150 µm layers at a recording wavelength of 488 nm. This value represents a good result compared to that reported in the literature and opens the way to reflection mode holography research using low-toxicity material.",The Association between Health Conditions in World Trade Center Responders and Sleep-Related Quality of Life and Sleep Complaints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959865,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Background: World Trade Center (WTC) dust-exposed subjects have multiple comorbidities that affect sleep. These include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), gastroesophageal-reflux disorder (GERD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We examined the impact of these conditions to sleep-related outcomes. Methods: Demographics, co-morbidities and symptoms were obtained from 626 WTC (109F/517M), 33⁻87years, BMI = 29.96 ± 5.53 kg/m²) subjects. OSA diagnosis was from a 2-night home sleep test (ARESTM). Subjective sleep quality, sleep-related quality of life (QOL, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire), excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), sleep duration and sleep onset and maintenance complaints were assessed. Results: Poor sleep quality and complaints were reported by 19⁻70% of subjects and average sleep duration was 6.4 h. 74.8% of subjects had OSA. OSA diagnosis/severity was not associated with any sleep-related outcomes. Sleep duration was lower in subjects with all conditions (p < 0.05) except OSA. CRS was a significant risk factor for poor sleep-related QOL, sleepiness, sleep quality and insomnia; PTSD for poor sleep-related QOL and insomnia; GERD for poor sleep quality. These associations remained significant after adjustment for, age, BMI, gender, sleep duration and other comorbidities. Conclusions: Sleep complaints are common and related to several health conditions seen in WTC responders. Initial interventions in symptomatic patients with both OSA and comorbid conditions may need to be directed at sleep duration, insomnia or the comorbid condition itself, in combination with intervention for OSA.",The Association between Osteoporosis and Grip Strength and Skeletal Muscle Mass in Community-Dwelling Older Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959864,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"This cross-sectional study investigated the association between osteoporosis, grip strength, and skeletal muscle mass in community-dwelling older women. Data obtained from 265 older women who participated in a community-based health check survey (Tarumizu Study) were analyzed. Face-to-face interviews with participants revealed their history of osteoporosis. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was assessed through bioelectrical impedance analysis, and appendicular skeletal muscle index was calculated. Dominant grip strength was also assessed. Loss of skeletal muscle mass (appendicular skeletal muscle mass < 5.7 kg/m²) and muscle weakness (grip strength < 18 kg) were determined based on criteria for sarcopenia put forth by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The prevalence rates of osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and loss of skeletal muscle mass were 27.2%, 28.7%, and 50.2%, respectively. Loss of skeletal muscle mass was more prevalent in participants with osteoporosis than in those without (65.3% vs. 44.6%, p < 0.01). The association between osteoporosis and muscle strength was not significant (30.6% vs. 28.0%, p = 0.68). After covariate adjustment, loss of skeletal muscle mass was found to be independently associated with osteoporosis (odds ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval 1.33⁻4.91). In sum, osteoporosis was found to be associated with loss of skeletal muscle mass, but not with muscle weakness in community-dwelling older women.",Functional Effects of let-7g Expression in Colon Cancer Metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959863,Cancers,2019 06 10,"MicroRNA regulation is crucial for gene expression and cell functions. It has been linked to tumorigenesis, development and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, the let-7 family has been identified as a tumor suppressor in different types of cancers. However, the function of the let-7 family in CRC metastasis has not been fully investigated. Here, we focused on analyzing the role of let-7g in CRC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) genomic datasets of CRC and detailed data from a Taiwanese CRC cohort were applied to study the expression pattern of let-7g. In addition, in vitro as well as in vivo studies have been performed to uncover the effects of let-7g on CRC. We found that the expression of let-7g was significantly lower in CRC specimens. Our results further supported the inhibitory effects of let-7g on CRC cell migration, invasion and extracellular calcium influx through store-operated calcium channels. We report a critical role for let-7g in the pathogenesis of CRC and suggest let-7g as a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.",Association between Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution and Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959862,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Environmental factors may play roles in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and some studies have shown that air pollution was associated with the development of autoimmune disease. This study was designed to investigate the effect of air pollutants on the development of adult RA. A nested case-control cohort study was performed using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort during 2002⁻2014 in Korea. Air pollution data were collected from the National Ambient Air Monitoring System (NAMIS), and exposure levels were extrapolated using geographic information systems. The group with RA (n = 444) was compared with a propensity score-matched control group (n = 1776), and one-year average concentrations of air pollution were predicted at each patient's residence. The adjusted binary logistic regression analysis showed a positive association between O₃ exposure and the incidence risk of RA for the third (odds ratios (OR) = 1.45, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.08⁻1.96) and fourth (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00⁻1.83) quartiles in adults over 20 years of age. The third quartile CO exposure was also associated with an increased risk of RA (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.16⁻2.12). The results of this nationwide population-based study showed that a one-year exposure to CO and O₃ in adults was associated with an increased risk of RA.",In Vitro Evaluation of the Phytopharmacological Potential of Sargassum incisifolium for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959861,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 09,"Background: Comprised of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract, which often results in severe damage to the intestinal mucosa. This study investigated metabolites from the South African endemic alga, Sargassum incisifolium, as potential treatments for IBD. Phytochemical evaluation of S. incisifolium yielded prenylated toluhydroquinones and toluquinones, from which semi-synthetic analogs were derived, and a carotenoid metabolite. The bioactivities of S. incisifolium fractions, natural products, and semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated using various in vitro assays. Methods: Sargahydroquinoic acid isolated from S. incisifolium was converted to several structural derivatives by semi-synthetic modification. Potential modulation of IBD by S. incisifolium crude fractions, natural compounds, and sargahydroquinoic acid analogs was evaluated through in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, anti-oxidant activity, cytotoxicity against HT-29 and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells, and PPAR-γ activation. Results: Sargahydroquinoic acid acts on various therapeutic targets relevant to IBD treatment. Conclusions: Conversion of sargahydroquinoic acid to sarganaphthoquinoic acid increases peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activity, compromises anti-oxidant activity, and has no effect on cytotoxicity against the tested cell lines.",Effects of Exergaming on Preschoolers' Executive Functions and Perceived Competence: A Pilot Randomized Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959860,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a child-centered exergaming program and a traditional teacher-led physical activity (PA) program on preschoolers' executive functions and perceived competence. Methods: Sixty children aged 4⁻5 years from an urban childcare center in China completed an 8-week exergaming/traditional PA intervention. After baseline measurements of executive functions and perceived competence (i.e., perceived physical competence and social acceptance), children were randomly assigned to either an exergaming group or traditional PA group (30 children per group). Exergaming and traditional PA programs were offered 20 min/session by trained instructors for 8 weeks. Post-intervention measures were identical to baseline measures. Results: In general, children's executive functions, perceived physical competence, and perceived social acceptance were enhanced over time. Analysis of variance revealed significant time by group interaction effects for executive functions, F(1, 58) = 12.01, p = 0.01, and perceived social acceptance, F(1, 58) = 6.04, p = 0.02, indicating that the exergaming intervention group displayed significantly greater increases in executive functions and perceived social acceptance in comparison with traditional PA children. In addition, children's executive functions and perceived physical and social competence significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention. However, there was no significant difference in the increase of children's perceived physical competence across groups over time. Conclusion: The results suggested exergaming to be beneficial in enhancing young children's executive functions and perceived social acceptance compared to the traditional PA program. More diverse samples with a longer intervention duration in preschool children in urban areas are warranted.",Effect of the Pitot Tube on Measurements in Supersonic Axisymmetric Underexpanded Microjets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959859,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"This paper describes the results of methodical investigations of the effect of the Pitot tube on measurements of gas-dynamic parameters of supersonic axisymmetric underexpanded real and model microjets.

In the present study we compared ASAS HI between patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and those with nonradiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA). In addition, we identified predictors of ASAS HI. We designed this cross-sectional study using data from the Catholic Axial Spondyloarthritis COhort (CASCO), a prospective cohort from a single tertiary hospital. We compared baseline characteristics, including ASAS HI, between AS and nr-axSpA, and determined the frequency of each item constituting the ASAS HI. We used linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with ASAS HI. Total of 357 patients with axSpA-261 with AS and 96 with nr-axSpA-were included in analysis. AS patients were older and had higher ASAS HI than nr-axSpA. Among ASAS HI items, pain (item No. 1) and energy/drive (item No. 5) were the most common areas for which axSpA patients experienced discomfort. ASAS HI correlated with other SpA-related parameters such as BASDAI, ASDAS, and BASFI. Multivariable regression analysis of the axSpA group showed that high NSAID intake and mSASSS were positively associated with ASAS HI, whereas higher economic status and alcohol consumption were negatively associated with ASAS HI. Results were consistent in the AS group on subgroup analysis, whereas alcohol consumption was the only factor significantly associated with ASAS HI in the nr-axSpA group. In the present cohort study, patients with AS had poorer health status (higher ASAS HI) than those with nr-axSpA. Items proposed by AS patients (items No. 1 and 5) were the most frequently checked areas as axSpA patients feel discomfort, and this support that ASAS HI could practically assess actual discomfort of axSpA patient. ASAS HI was well correlated with known disease parameters, including activity, function, and quality of life; therefore, ASAS HI could be used in the future to represent the health status of SpA in a systematic way. Spinal structural damage (higher mSASSS), high NSAID intake, alcohol consumption, and economic status were predictors of ASAS HI in patients with axSpA, especially those with AS.",Polarimetric Sensitivity to Torsion in Spun Highly Birefringent Fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959845,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"We report on experimental studies of polarimetric sensitivity to torsion in spun highly birefringent fibers. Two classes of spun fibers were examined, namely spun side-hole fibers and birefringent microstructured fibers with different birefringence dispersion, spin pitches, and spin directions. The polarimetric sensitivity to torsion was determined by monitoring a displacement of the spectral interference fringes arising in the output signal because of interference of polarization modes and induced by an additional fiber twist. Both the experimental results and the analytical predictions showed that the sensitivity to torsion normalized to the fringe width in the spun highly birefringent fibers increased asymptotically with the twist rate to the value of 1/ π rad-1. We have also studied the polarimetric response to temperature in the spun side-hole fibers. We have found that, in contrast to the torsional sensitivity, the temperature sensitivity decays asymptotically to zero with increasing fiber twist rate. Therefore, the spun fibers with short spin pitches are especially well suited for torsion measurements because the torsional sensitivity and the range of linear response are both enhanced in such fibers, while at the same time, the cross-sensitivity to temperature is reduced.",The Primary Antisense Transcriptome of Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959844,Genes,2019 06 10,"Antisense RNAs (asRNAs) are present in diverse organisms and play important roles in gene regulation. In this work, we mapped the primary antisense transcriptome in the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. By reanalyzing publicly available data, we mapped antisense transcription start sites (aTSSs) and inferred the probable 3' ends of these transcripts. We analyzed the resulting asRNAs according to the size, location, function of genes on the opposite strand, expression levels and conservation. We show that at least 21% of the genes contain asRNAs in H. salinarum. Most of these asRNAs are expressed at low levels. They are located antisense to genes related to distinctive characteristics of H. salinarum, such as bacteriorhodopsin, gas vesicles, transposases and other important biological processes such as translation. We provide evidence to support asRNAs in type II toxin⁻antitoxin systems in archaea. We also analyzed public Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) data and found that ~10% of the asRNAs are ribosome-associated non-coding RNAs (rancRNAs), with asRNAs from transposases overrepresented. Using a comparative transcriptomics approach, we found that ~19% of the asRNAs annotated in H. salinarum belong to genes with an ortholog in Haloferax volcanii, in which an aTSS could be identified with positional equivalence. This shows that most asRNAs are not conserved between these halophilic archaea.",New Furanocembranoids from Briareum violaceum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959843,Marine drugs,2019 06 10,"Three new furanocembranoids-briaviodiol F (1) and briaviotriols A (2) and B (3)-along with a known analogue, briaviodiol A (4), were obtained from a cultured-type octocoral Briareum violaceum.

At 4 years of age chromosomal microarray confirmed monozygosity with both twins showing an XY sex complement. Normal size (30 CGG), PM (99 CGG) and FM (388–1632 CGGs) alleles were detected in Twin 1 (T1) by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot testing, while only PM (99 CGG) and FM (672–1025) alleles were identified in Twin 2 (T2). At ~5 years, T2 had greater intellectual impairments with a full scale IQ (FSIQ) of 55 and verbal IQ (VIQ) of 59, compared to FSIQ of 62 and VIQ of 78 for T1. This was consistent with the quantitative FMR1 methylation testing, revealing 10% higher methylation at 80% for T2; suggesting that less active unmethylated alleles were present in T2 as compared to T1. AmplideX methylation PCR also identified partial methylation, including an unmethylated NS allele in T2, undetected by standard testing. In conclusion, this report demonstrates significant differences in intellectual functioning between the MZ twins mosaic for NS, PM and FM alleles with partial FMR1 promoter methylation.",Juglone in Oxidative Stress and Cell Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959841,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Juglone (5-hydroxyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) is a phenolic compound found in walnuts. Because of the antioxidant capacities of phenolic compounds, juglone may serve to combat oxidative stress, thereby protecting against the development of various diseases and aging processes. However, being a quinone molecule, juglone could also act as a redox cycling agent and produce reactive oxygen species. Such prooxidant properties of juglone may confer health effects, such as by killing cancer cells. Further, recent studies revealed that juglone influences cell signaling. Notably, juglone is an inhibitor of Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase) that could regulate phosphorylation of Tau, implicating potential effects of juglone in Alzheimer's disease. Juglone also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases that could promote cell survival, thereby protecting against conditions such as cardiac injury.

Although molecular therapies have emerged as efficacious strategies for the treatment of lung cancer, surgical resection is still recommended as a radical therapeutic option. Currently, lobectomy is regarded as the most reliable radical treatment of primary lung cancer. Among the various complications after lobectomy, cerebral thromboembolism requires attention as a life-threatening complication during the early postoperative period. It occurs in 0.2⁻1.2% of surgical cases of lung cancer and typically develops following left upper lobectomy with a long pulmonary vein stump (PVS). PVS-associated thrombosis is known to cause cerebral thromboembolism after such procedures; however, distinguishing this specific complication from that caused by postoperative atrial fibrillation is challenging. We summarize herein the diagnostic pathology of thrombus formation in accordance with its thrombogenic mechanism. We focus on the potential utility of the pathological assessment of thrombectomy specimens. The morphological information obtained from these specimens enables the presumption of thrombogenic etiology and provides useful clues to both select an appropriate pharmacotherapy and determine a follow-up treatment for cerebral thromboembolism."

The increase in smartphone applications and the availability of low-cost wearable biosensors have further improved the potential of EMA and EMI, which, however, have not yet been applied in clinical practice. Here, we conducted a systematic review, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to explore the state of the art of technology-based EMA and EMI for major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 33 articles were included (EMA = 26; EMI = 7). First, we provide a detailed analysis of the included studies from technical (sampling methods, duration, prompts), clinical (fields of application, adherence rates, dropouts, intervention effectiveness), and technological (adopted devices) perspectives. Then, we identify the advantages of using information and communications technologies (ICTs) to extend the potential of these approaches to the understanding, assessment, and intervention in depression. Furthermore, we point out the relevant issues that still need to be addressed within this field, and we discuss how EMA and EMI could benefit from the use of sensors and biosensors, along with recent advances in machine learning for affective modelling.",Interpretation of Non-Clinical Data for Prediction of Human Pharmacokinetic Parameters: In Vitro-In Vivo Extrapolation and Allometric Scaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959827,Pharmaceutics,2019 06 10,"Extrapolation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters from in vitro or in vivo animal to human is one of the main tasks in the drug development process. Translational approaches provide evidence for go or no-go decision-making during drug discovery and the development process, and the prediction of human PKs prior to the first-in-human clinical trials. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation and allometric scaling are the choice of method for projection to human situations. Although these methods are useful tools for the estimation of PK parameters, it is a challenge to apply these methods since underlying biochemical, mathematical, physiological, and background knowledge of PKs are required. In addition, it is difficult to select an appropriate methodology depending on the data available. Therefore, this review covers the principles of PK parameters pertaining to the clearance, volume of distribution, elimination half-life, absorption rate constant, and prediction method from the original idea to recently developed models in order to introduce optimal models for the prediction of PK parameters.",Diameters of Arteries Supplying Horseshoe Kidneys and the Level They Branch off Their Parental Vessels: A CT-Angiographic Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959826,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"The most common renal fusion anomaly is horseshoe kidney (HSK), a condition associated with variable arterial blood supply.

Chronic HCV infection can lead to potentially fatal outcomes including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-specific immune responses play a major role in viral control and may explain why approximately 20% of infections are spontaneously cleared before the establishment of chronicity. Chronic infection, associated with prolonged antigen exposure, leads to immune exhaustion of HCV-specific T cells. These exhausted T cells are unable to control the viral infection. Before the introduction of direct acting antivirals (DAAs), interferon (IFN)-based therapies demonstrated successful clearance of viral infection in approximately 50% of treated patients. New effective and well-tolerated DAAs lead to a sustained virological response (SVR) in more than 95% of patients regardless of viral genotype. Researchers have investigated whether treatment, and the subsequent elimination of HCV antigen, can reverse this HCV-induced exhausted phenotype. Here we review literature exploring the restoration of HCV-specific immune responses following antiviral therapy, both IFN and DAA-based regimens. IFN treatment during acute HCV infection results in greater immune restoration than IFN treatment of chronically infected patients. Immune restoration data following DAA treatment in chronically HCV infected patients shows varied results but suggests that DAA treatment may lead to partial restoration that could be improved with earlier administration. Future research should investigate immune restoration following DAA therapies administered during acute HCV infection.",Three Polymethoxyflavones Purified from Ougan (Citrusreticulata Cv.

Suavissima), was selected, and three monomers, including nobiletin, tangeretin, and 5-demethylnobiletin, were purified by ultrasonic-assisted extraction, solid phase extraction, and high-speed countercurrent chromatography separation. UPLC-MS was used to identify the three monomers. UPLC determined purities of 99.87% to nobiletin, 99.76% to tangeretin, and 98.75% to 5-demethylnobiletin with the standard curve method. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO releasing model was performed in the mouse microglia BV-2 cell line. Results illustrated that PMF monomers inhibited the NO release and the inflammation-related cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα elevation. QRT-PCR revealed that PMFs alleviated LPS-induced upregulation of iNOS, IL-6, JAK2, TNFα, IL-1β, and NF-κB and LPS-induced downregulation of IκBα, while they did not affect TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6. STAT3 expression was repressed by tangeretin and 5-demethylnobiletin, but not by nobiletin. Western blot assay also showed a suppression of expression and phosphorylation of JAK2 by all three PMF monomers, while STAT3 phosphorylation was restrained by tangeretin and 5-demethylnobiletin. The mechanism was primarily verified by the JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib and the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic.",Are Adolescent Body Image Concerns Associated with Health-Compromising Physical Activity Behaviours?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959823,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"The present study aimed to assess the-prevalence of health-compromising eating and physical activity behaviours, and to test their associations with physical activity, internalisation of sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, and body image in a sample of adolescents of both genders. A total sample of 736 adolescents (437 or 59.4% were girls) participated in the study. The participants ranged in age from 16 to 19 years (x = 17.2, SD = 0.6). The sample completed a questionnaire measuring body mass index, the risk of eating disorders, body image, internalisation of sociocultural ideals of appearance, health-compromising eating behaviours (HCEB), and health-compromising weight control related to physical activity behaviours (HCPAB). Logistic regressions were used to assess the associations between the study variables and predictors of HCEB and HCPAB. The results of the study showed a relatively high prevalence of HCEB with a significantly higher prevalence in girls and participants with a higher BMI. The study also demonstrated that the prevalence of adolescent HCPAB was higher than HCEB. The internalisation of sociocultural attitudes towards appearance and body image concerns were higher in the HCEB and HCPAB groups. Female gender (OR = 1.88; 95% PI = 1.10⁻3.18), HCPAB (OR = 1.19; 95% PI = 1.10⁻1.28), a preoccupation with being overweight (OR = 3.43; 95% PI = 2.52⁻4.66), and body weight evaluation as too high (OR = 2.40; 95% PI = 1.57⁻3.68) were significant predictors of HCEB. More frequent physical activity (OR = 3.02; 95% PI = 1.76⁻5.17), HCEB (OR = 1.22; 95% PI = 1.11⁻1.32), and perceived pressures to conform to popular beauty ideals (OR = 1.51; 95% PI = 1.12⁻2.03) predicted higher HCPAB. HCPAB is an important variable associated with adolescents' body image, physical activity, and weight control. The results of the present study are important for health promotion and education programs addressing adolescents' healthy lifestyle, weight control, and body image concerns.","Transcriptomic Response to 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D in Human Fibroblasts with or without a Functional Vitamin D Receptor (VDR): Novel Target Genes and Insights into VDR Basal Transcriptional Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959822,Cells,2019 06 10,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates vitamin D actions beyond bone health. While VDR activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) leads to robust transcriptional regulation, less is known about VDR actions in the absence of 1,25D. We analyzed the transcriptomic response to 1,25D in fibroblasts bearing a severe homozygous hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets-related p.Arg30* VDR mutation (MUT) and in control fibroblasts (CO). Roughly 4.5% of the transcriptome was regulated by 1,25D in CO fibroblasts, while MUT cells without a functional VDR were insensitive to 1,25D. Novel VDR target genes identified in human fibroblasts included bone and cartilage factors CILP, EFNB2, and GALNT12. Vehicle-treated CO and MUT fibroblasts had strikingly different transcriptomes, suggesting basal VDR activity. Indeed, oppositional transcriptional effects in basal conditions versus after 1,25D activation were implied for a subset of target genes mostly involved with cell cycle. Cell proliferation assays corroborated this conjectured oppositional basal VDR activity, indicating that precise 1,25D dosage in target tissues might be essential for modulating vitamin D actions in human health.",CYFRA 21-1 in Lymph Node Fine Needle Aspiration Washout Improves Diagnostic Accuracy for Metastatic Lymph Nodes of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959821,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and washout thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements are the standard for evaluating a metastatic lymph node (LN) in thyroid cancer. However, patients rarely benefit from these procedures due to false results. This study aims to identify a reliable biomarker that significantly improves the diagnosis of metastatic LNs, in addition to FNAC and washout Tg. This study analyzed 130 LNs that were suspected to have metastases on thyroid ultrasonography, from June 2016 to December 2017. All subjects underwent FNAC, washout Tg measurements and a new biomarker, washout Cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (CYFRA 21-1) measurement. The final LN outcomes were confirmed by surgical histology, repeat FNAC, or follow-up image. The diagnostic values of the presence of washout CYFRA 21-1 for diagnosing metastatic LNs were evaluated according to final LN outcomes. Among the 130 LNs, 42 were metastatic lesions and 88 were benign. The washout CYFRA 21-1 levels were significantly higher in metastatic LNs than in benign LNs. In contrast to the findings of washout Tg, washout CYFRA 21-1 showed little overlap between benign and malignant LNs, and its diagnostic cutoff values were not affected by surgery. The combinations of FNAC and washout CYFRA 21-1 showed higher sensitivity (91.9%), specificity (96.5%), negative predictive value (98.8%), and diagnostic accuracy (94.2%) than FNAC with washout Tg. The combination of FNAC, washout Tg, and washout CYFRA 21-1 showed the best sensitivity (98.8%). When washout CYFRA 21-1 was applied to the discordant results that were observed between FNAC and washout Tg, 20 of 22 LNs were correctly diagnosed. Washout CYFRA 21-1 measurements in thyroid LNs provide a diagnostic modality.",Antioxidant Activities of Alkyl Substituted Pyrazine Derivatives of Chalcones-In Vitro and In Silico Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959820,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Chalcones are polyphenolic secondary metabolites of plants, many of which have antioxidant activity. Herein, a set of 26 synthetic chalcone derivatives with alkyl substituted pyrazine heterocycle A and four types of the monophenolic ring B, were evaluated for the potential radical scavenging and antioxidant cellular capacity influencing the growth of cells exposed to H₂O₂. Before that, compounds were screened for cytotoxicity on THP-1 and HepG2 cell lines. Most of them were not cytotoxic in an overnight MTS assay. However, three of them, 4a, 4c and 4e showed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH●) radical scavenging activity, through single electron transfer followed by a proton transfer (SET-PT) mechanism as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) modeling. DFT modeling of radical scavenging mechanisms was done at the SMD//(U)M052X/6-311++G** level. The in vitro effects of 4a, 4c and 4e on the growth of THP-1 cells during four days pre- or post-treatment with H₂O₂ were examined daily with the trypan blue exclusion assay. Their various cellular effects reflect differences in their radical scavenging capacity and molecular lipophilicity (clogP) and depend upon the cellular redox status. The applied simple in vitro-in silico screening cascade enables fast identification and initial characterization of potent radical scavengers.",Structure and Dynamics of the EGF Receptor as Revealed by Experiments and Simulations and Its Relevance to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959819,Cells,2019 06 10,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is historically the prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase, being the first cloned and the first where the importance of ligand-induced dimer activation was ascertained. However, many years of structure determination has shown that EGFR is not completely understood. One challenge is that the many structure fragments stored at the PDB only provide a partial view because full-length proteins are flexible entities and dynamics play a key role in their functionality. Another challenge is the shortage of high-resolution data on functionally important higher-order complexes. Still, the interest in the structure/function relationships of EGFR remains unabated because of the crucial role played by oncogenic EGFR mutants in driving non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite targeted therapies against EGFR setting a milestone in the treatment of this disease, ubiquitous drug resistance inevitably emerges after one year or so of treatment. The magnitude of the challenge has inspired novel strategies. Among these, the combination of multi-disciplinary experiments and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have been pivotal in revealing the basic nature of EGFR monomers, dimers and multimers, and the structure-function relationships that underpin the mechanisms by which EGFR dysregulation contributes to the onset of NSCLC and resistance to treatment."

We previously demonstrated that CA functions as an activator of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor in human and rodent cells. CA enhances the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and antioxidant genes, such as HO-1 in an Nrf2-dependent manner in U373MG human astrocytoma cells. However, CA also induces NGF gene expression in an Nrf2-independent manner, since 50 μM of CA administration showed striking NGF gene induction compared with the classical Nrf2 inducer tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) in U373MG cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis, we found that CA activates activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in addition to Nrf2 at high doses. CA activated ATF4 in phospho-eIF2α- and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI)-dependent manners, indicating that CA activates ATF4 through the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Furthermore, CA activated Nrf2 and ATF4 cooperatively enhanced the expression of NGF and many antioxidant genes while acting independently to certain client genes. Taken together, these results represent a novel mechanism of CA-mediated gene regulation evoked by Nrf2 and ATF4 cooperation.",Effects of High Temperature on Embryological Development and Hormone Profile in Flowers and Leaves of Common Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959807,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Common buckwheat is a valuable crop, mainly due to the beneficial chemical composition of its seeds. However, buckwheat cultivation is limited because of unstable seed yield. The most important reasons for the low yield include embryo and flower abortion. The aim of this work is to verify whether high temperature affects embryological development in this plant species. The experiment was conducted on plants of a Polish cultivar 'Panda' and strain PA15, in which the percentage of degenerating embryo sacs was previously determined and amounted to 32% and 10%, respectively. The plants were cultivated in phytotronic conditions at 20 °C (control), and 30 °C (thermal stress). The embryological processes and hormonal profiles in flowers at various developmental stages (buds, open flowers, and wilted flowers) and in donor leaves were analyzed in two-month-old plants. Significant effects of thermal stress on the defective development of female gametophytes and hormone content in flowers and leaves were observed. Ovules were much more sensitive to high temperature than pollen grains in both genotypes. Pollen viability remained unaffected at 30 °C in both genotypes. The effect of temperature on female gametophyte development was visible in cv. Panda but not in PA15 buds. A drastic reduction in the number of properly developed embryo sacs was clear in open flowers at 30 °C in both genotypes. A considerable increase in abscisic acid in open flowers ready for fertilization may serve as a signal inducing flower senescence observed in the next few days. Based on embryological analyses and hormone profiles in flowers, we conclude that cv. 'Panda' is more sensitive to thermal stress than strain PA15, mainly due to a much earlier response to thermal stress involving impairment of embryological processes already in the flower buds.",Improved Prediction of Regulatory Element Using Hybrid Abelian Complexity Features with DNA Sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959806,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Abstract: Deciphering the code of cis-regulatory element (CRE) is one of the core issues of current biology. As an important category of CRE, enhancers play crucial roles in gene transcriptional regulations in a distant manner. Further, the disruption of an enhancer can cause abnormal transcription and, thus, trigger human diseases, which means that its accurate identification is currently of broad interest. Here, we introduce an innovative concept, i.e., abelian complexity function (ACF), which is a more complex extension of the classic subword complexity function, for a new coding of DNA sequences. After feature selection by an upper bound estimation and integration with DNA composition features, we developed an enhancer prediction model with hybrid abelian complexity features (HACF). Compared with existing methods, HACF shows consistently superior performance on three sources of enhancer datasets. We tested the generalization ability of HACF by scanning human chromosome 22 to validate previously reported super-enhancers. Meanwhile, we identified novel candidate enhancers which have supports from enhancer-related ENCODE ChIP-seq signals. In summary, HACF improves current enhancer prediction and may be beneficial for further prioritization of functional noncoding variants.",Cell-Free Protein Synthesis: Chassis toward the Minimal Cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959805,Cells,2019 06 10,"The quest for a minimal cell not only sheds light on the fundamental principles of life but also brings great advances in related applied fields such as general biotechnology. Minimal cell projects came from the study of a plausible route to the origin of life. Later on, research extended and also referred to the construction of artificial cells, or even more broadly, as in vitro synthetic biology. The cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) techniques harness the central cellular activity of transcription/translation in an open environment, providing the framework for multiple cellular processes assembling. Therefore, CFPS systems have become the first choice in the construction of the minimal cell. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the quantitative analysis of CFPS and on its advantage for addressing the bottom-up assembly of a minimal cell and illustrate the importance of systemic chassis behavior, such as stochasticity under a compartmentalized micro-environment.",Insights into Actin-Myosin Interactions within Muscle from 3D Electron Microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959804,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Much has been learned about the interaction between myosin and actin through biochemistry, in vitro motility assays and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of F-actin, decorated with myosin heads. Comparatively less is known about actin-myosin interactions within the filament lattice of muscle, where myosin heads function as independent force generators and thus most measurements report an average signal from multiple biochemical and mechanical states. All of the 3D imaging by electron microscopy (EM) that has revealed the interplay of the regular array of actin subunits and myosin heads within the filament lattice has been accomplished using the flight muscle of the large water bug Lethocerus sp. The Lethocerus flight muscle possesses a particularly favorable filament arrangement that enables all the myosin cross-bridges contacting the actin filament to be visualized in a thin section. This review covers the history of this effort and the progress toward visualizing the complex set of conformational changes that myosin heads make when binding to actin in several static states, as well as the fast frozen actively contracting muscle. The efforts have revealed a consistent pattern of changes to the myosin head structures as determined by X-ray crystallography needed to explain the structure of the different actomyosin interactions observed in situ.",Metabolic Modeling of Pectobacterium parmentieri SCC3193 Provides Insights into Metabolic Pathways of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959803,Microorganisms,2019 06 10,"Understanding plant⁻microbe interactions is crucial for improving plants' productivity and protection. Constraint-based metabolic modeling is one of the possible ways to investigate the bacterial adaptation to different ecological niches and may give insights into the metabolic versatility of plant pathogenic bacteria. We reconstructed a raw metabolic model of the emerging plant pathogenic bacterium Pectobacterium parmentieri SCC3193 with the use of KBase. The model was curated by using inParanoind and phenotypic data generated with the use of the OmniLog system. Metabolic modeling was performed through COBRApy Toolbox v. 0.10.1. The curated metabolic model of P. parmentieri SCC3193 is highly reliable, as in silico obtained results overlapped up to 91% with experimental data on carbon utilization phenotypes. By mean of flux balance analysis (FBA), we predicted the metabolic adaptation of P. parmentieri SCC3193 to two different ecological niches, relevant for the persistence and plant colonization by this bacterium: soil and the rhizosphere. We performed in silico gene deletions to predict the set of essential core genes for this bacterium to grow in such environments. We anticipate that our metabolic model will be a valuable element for defining a set of metabolic targets to control infection and spreading of this plant pathogen.",Essential Oils and Isolated Terpenes in Nanosystems Designed for Topical Administration: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959802,Biomolecules,2019 06 10,"Essential oils are natural products with a complex composition. Terpenes are the most common class of chemical compounds present in essential oils. Terpenes and the essential oils containing them are widely used and investigated by their pharmacological properties and permeation-enhancing ability. However, many terpenes and essential oils are sensitive to environmental conditions, undergoing volatilization and chemical degradation. In order to overcome the chemical instability of some isolated terpenes and essential oils, the encapsulation of these compounds in nanostructured systems (polymeric, lipidic, or molecular complexes) has been employed. In addition, nanoencapsulation can be of interest for pharmaceutical applications due to its capacity to improve the bioavailability and allow the controlled release of drugs. Topical drug administration is a convenient and non-invasive administration route for both local and systemic drug delivery. The present review focuses on describing the current status of research concerning nanostructured delivery systems containing isolated terpenes and/or essential oils designed for topical administration and on discussing the use of terpenes and essential oils either for their biological activities or as permeation enhancers in pharmaceutic formulations.",Modification of Graphene Oxide Membranes by the Incorporation of Nafion Macromolecules and Conductive Scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959801,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Stable, reproducible and low-cost graphene oxide (GO)/Nafion (N) membranes were fabricated using electronically conductive carbon paper (CP) matts as a scaffold. The presence of polar groups in the Nafion molecule facilitates the strong interaction with functional groups in the GO, which increases GO dispersion and aids the retention of the composite into the CP scaffold. Distribution of GO/N was carefully characterized by X-ray diffraction work function measurements, Raman and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The performance of these membranes was tested with 1 M NaCl at standard conditions, finding 85% ion removal in the best membranes by a mixed ion rejection/retention mechanism. The Nafion provided mechanical stability and fixed negative charge to the membranes, and its micellar organization, segregation and confinement favored ion rejection in Nafion-rich areas. The good electronic conductivity of these membranes was also demonstrated, allowing for the application of a small potential bias to enhance membrane performance in future studies.",A Review of Biomonitoring of Phthalate Exposures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959800,Toxics,2019 04 09,"Phthalates (diesters of phthalic acid) are widely used as plasticizers and additives in many consumer products.

Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of high concern. Human exposure to phthalates occurs mainly via dietary sources, dermal absorption, and air inhalation. Phthalates are excreted as conjugated monoesters in urine, and some phthalates, such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), undergo secondary metabolism, including oxidative transformation, prior to urinary excretion. The occurrence of phthalates and their metabolites in urine, serum, breast milk, and semen has been widely reported. Urine has been the preferred matrix in human biomonitoring studies, and concentrations on the order of several tens to hundreds of nanograms per milliliter have been reported for several phthalate metabolites. Metabolites of diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl- (DBP) and diisobutyl- (DiBP) phthalates, and DEHP were the most abundant compounds measured in urine. Temporal trends in phthalate exposures varied among countries. In the United States (US), DEHP exposure has declined since 2005, whereas DiNP exposure has increased. In China, DEHP exposure has increased since 2000. For many phthalates, exposures in children are higher than those in adults. Human epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between phthalate exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in women and men, type II diabetes and insulin resistance, overweight/obesity, allergy, and asthma. This review compiles biomonitoring studies of phthalates and exposure doses to assess health risks from phthalate exposures in populations across the globe.",Delivering Combination Chemotherapies and Targeting Oncogenic Pathways via Polymeric Drug Delivery Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959799,Polymers,2019 06 10,"The side-effects associated with chemotherapy necessitates better delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumor. Nanoparticles can load higher amounts of drug and improve delivery to tumors, increasing the efficacy of treatment. Polymeric nanoparticles, in particular, have been used extensively for chemotherapeutic delivery. This review describes the efforts made to deliver combination chemotherapies and inhibit oncogenic pathways using polymeric drug delivery systems. Combinations of chemotherapeutics with other drugs or small interfering RNA (siRNA) combinations have been summarized. Special attention is given to the delivery of drug combinations that involve either paclitaxel or doxorubicin, two popular chemotherapeutics in clinic. Attempts to inhibit specific pathways for oncotherapy have also been described. These include inhibition of oncogenic pathways (including those involving HER2, EGFR, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, STAT3, and HIF-1α), augmentation of apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin), and targeting dysregulated pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog."

This importance at the cultural and economic level, advocates for the need for preservation of cultural heritage sites for the future generations. To this end, advanced monitoring systems harnessing the power of sensors are deployed near the sites to collect data which can fuel systems and processes aimed at protection and preservation. In this paper we present the use of acoustic sensors for safeguarding cultural sites located in rural or urban areas, based on a novel data flow framework. We developed and deployed Wireless Acoustic Sensors Networks that record audio signals, which are transferred to a modular cloud platform to be processed using an efficient deep learning algorithm (f1-score: 0.838) to identify audio sources of interest for each site, taking into account the materials the assets are made of. The extracted information is presented exploiting the designed STORM Audio Signal ontology and then fused with spatiotemporal information using semantic rules.

We evaluated all medium/large-sized public hospital restaurants (HRs) from the Brazilian Federal District (n = 9); a representative sample of 128 users). We evaluated the HRs' physical structures, their consumers' socio-demographic characteristics, their unhygienic practices, as well as the stages of behavioural change concerning unhygienic practices. All the HRs presented their menus for self-service distribution, so customers entered in lines to serve themselves. All the HRs had hand-wash sinks for customers; 77.8% offered antiseptic liquid soap; 33.3% offered alcohol gel; and 77.8% offered storage for professional accessories before serving food. Almost half (46.8%) of the customers did not sanitise their hands (with water and antiseptic soap and/or use of alcohol gel) immediately before serving, and 24.2% wore professional uniforms at HRs. Almost half (43.5%) of the customers spoke with each other in line while serving their plates and arranged the food on their plates with the serving utensils from the distribution counter. The declaration of behavioural change was inversely associated with the hygiene practices. Almost half of the individuals did not sanitize their hands; however, 90.4% declared ""changed behaviour"" when this contaminant practice was presented to them. We verified a high percentage of hygiene practices inconsistent with most of the customers´ answers about their stage of behaviour change. Based on the observations of this study, it is necessary for an awareness program to be developed that is focused on customers of HRs in order to reduce unhygienic practices. Also, it is important to promote new policies for proper hygiene practices in hospital restaurants.",The effects of High- versus Moderate-Intensity Exercise on Fatigue in Sarcoidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959786,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with sarcoidosis.

A novel method for cell opening was designed based on the anticipated reversibility of the urethane linkages formed by ISB with isocyanate. FPUFs containing various amounts of ISB (up to 5 wt%) were successfully prepared without any noticeable deterioration in the appearance and physical properties of the resulting foams. The air permeability of these resulting FPUFs was increased and this could be further improved by thermal treatment at 160 °C. The urethane units based on ISB enabled cell window opening, as anticipated, through the reversible urethane linkage. The ISB-containing FPUFs also demonstrated better antioxidant activity by impeding discoloration. Thus, ISB, a nontoxic, bio-based diol, can be a valuable raw material (or additive) for eco-friendly FPUFs without seriously compromising the physical properties of these FPUFs.",Characterizing Complex Mineral Structures in Thin Sections of Geological Samples with a Scanning Hall Effect Microscope.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959784,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,We improved a magnetic scanning microscope for measuring the magnetic properties of minerals in thin sections of geological samples at submillimeter scales. The microscope is comprised of a 200 µm diameter Hall sensor that is located at a distance of 142 µm from the sample; an electromagnet capable of applying up to 500 mT DC magnetic fields to the sample over a 40 mm diameter region; a second Hall sensor arranged in a gradiometric configuration to cancel the background signal applied by the electromagnet and reduce the overall noise in the system; a custom-designed electronics system to bias the sensors and allow adjustments to the background signal cancelation; and a scanning XY stage with micrometer resolution. Our system achieves a spatial resolution of 200 µm with a noise at 6.0 Hz of 300 nTrms/(Hz)1/2 in an unshielded environment. The magnetic moment sensitivity is 1.3 × 10-11 Am². We successfully measured the representative magnetization of a geological sample using an alternative model that takes the sample geometry into account and identified different micrometric characteristics in the sample slice.,Impacts of Road Traffic Network and Socioeconomic Factors on the Diffusion of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Mainland China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959783,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"The 2009 pandemic influenza virus caused the majority of the influenza A virus infections in China in 2009. It arrived in several Chinese cities from imported cases and then spread as people travelled domestically by all means of transportation, among which road traffic was the most commonly used for daily commuting. Spatial variation in socioeconomic status not only accelerates migration across regions but also partly induces the differences in epidemic processes and in responses to epidemics across regions. However, the roles of both road travel and socioeconomic factors have not received the attention they deserve. Here, we constructed a national highway network for and between 333 cities in mainland China and extracted epidemiological variables and socioeconomic factors for each city. We calculated classic centrality measures for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (SumRatio and Multicenter Distance). We evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features and conducted a spatial autoregression to quantify the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors during the outbreak. The results showed that epidemics had more significant relationships with both our new measures than the classic ones. Higher population density, higher per person income, larger SumRatio and Multicenter Distance, more hospitals and college students, and lower per person GDP were associated with higher cumulative incidence. Higher population density and number of slaughtered pigs were found to advance epidemic arrival time. Higher population density, more colleges and slaughtered pigs, and lower Multicenter Distance were associated with longer epidemic duration. In conclusion, road transport and socioeconomic status had significant impacts and should be considered for the prevention and control of future pandemics.",CRISPR/Cas9-Based Antiviral Strategy: Current Status and the Potential Challenge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959782,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"From its unexpected discovery as a bacterial adaptive immune system to its countless applications as one of the most versatile gene-editing tools, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized every field of life science. Virology is no exception to this ever-growing list of CRISPR/Cas9-based applications. Direct manipulation of a virus genome by CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled a systematic study of cis-elements and trans-elements encoded in a virus genome. In addition, this virus genome-specific mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 was further funneled into the development of a novel class of antiviral therapy targeting many incurable chronic viral infections. In this review, a general concept on the CRISPR/Cas9-based antiviral strategy will be described first. To understand the current status of the CRISPR/Cas9-based antiviral approach, a series of recently published antiviral studies involving CRISPR/Cas9-mediated control of several clinically-relevant viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, herpesviruses, human papillomavirus, and other viruses will be presented. Lastly, the potential challenge and future prospect for successful clinical translation of this CRISPR/Cas9-based antiviral method will be discussed.",An Adaptive Sliding-Mode Iterative Constant-force Control Method for Robotic Belt Grinding Based on a One-Dimensional Force Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959781,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"To improve the processing quality and efficiency of robotic belt grinding, an adaptive sliding-mode iterative constant-force control method for a 6-DOF robotic belt grinding platform is proposed based on a one-dimension force sensor. In the investigation, first, the relationship between the normal and the tangential forces of the grinding contact force is revealed, and a simplified grinding force mapping relationship is presented for the application to one-dimension force sensors. Next, the relationship between the deformation and the grinding depth during the grinding is discussed, and a deformation-based dynamic model describing robotic belt grinding is established. Then, aiming at an application scene of robot belt grinding, an adaptive iterative learning method is put forward, which is combined with sliding mode control to overcome the uncertainty of the grinding force and improve the stability of the control system. Finally, some experiments were carried out and the results show that, after ten times iterations, the grinding force fluctuation becomes less than 2N, the mean value, standard deviation and variance of the grinding force error's absolute value all significantly decrease, and that the surface quality of the machined parts significantly improves. All these demonstrate that the proposed force control method is effective and that the proposed algorithm is fast in convergence and strong in adaptability.",Dietary Assessment of Shared Plate Eating: A Missing Link.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959779,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Shared plate eating is a defining feature of the way food is consumed in some countries and cultures. Food may be portioned to another serving vessel or directly consumed into the mouth from a centralised dish rather than served individually onto a discrete plate for each person. Shared plate eating is common in some low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMIC). The aim of this narrative review was to synthesise research that has reported on the assessment of dietary intake from shared plate eating, investigate specific aspects such as individual portion size or consumption from shared plates and use of technology in order to guide future development work in this area. Variations of shared plate eating that were identified in this review included foods consumed directly from a central dish or shared plate food, served onto additional plates shared by two or more people. In some settings, a hierarchical sharing structure was reported whereby different family members eat in turn from the shared plate. A range of dietary assessment methods have been used in studies assessing shared plate eating with the most common being 24-h recalls. The tools reported as being used to assist in the quantification of food intake from shared plate eating included food photographs, portion size images, line drawings, and the carrying capacity of bread, which is often used rather than utensils. Overall few studies were identified that have assessed and reported on methods to assess shared plate eating, highlighting the identified gap in an area of research that is important in improving understanding of, and redressing dietary inadequacies in LLMIC.",2D Rotation-Angle Measurement Utilizing Least Iterative Region Segmentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959778,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"When geometric moments are used to measure the rotation-angle of plane workpieces, the same rotation angle would be obtained with dissimilar poses. Such a case would be shown as an error in an automatic sorting system. Here, we present an improved rotation-angle measurement method based on geometric moments, which is suitable for automatic sorting systems. The method can overcome this limitation to obtain accurate results. The accuracy, speed, and generality of this method are analyzed in detail. In addition, a rotation-angle measurement error model is established to study the effect of camera pose on the rotation-angle measurement accuracy. We find that a rotation-angle measurement error will occur with a non-ideal camera pose. Thus, a correction method is proposed to increase accuracy and reduce the measurement error caused by camera pose. Finally, an automatic sorting system is developed, and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our methods. The experimental results show that the rotation angles are accurately obtained and workpieces could be correctly placed by this system."

The analysis of CTCs in patients has recently received widespread attention because of its clinical implications, particularly for precision medicine. Accumulated evidence documents a large heterogeneity in CTCs across patients. Currently, the most accepted view is that tumor cells with an intermediate phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal have the highest plasticity. Indeed, the existence of a meta-stable or partial epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell state, with both epithelial and mesenchymal features, can be easily reconciled with the concept of a highly plastic stem-like state. A close connection between EMT and cancer stem cells (CSC) traits, with enhanced metastatic competence and drug resistance, has also been described. Accordingly, a subset of CTCs consisting of CSC, present a stemness profile, are able to survive chemotherapy, and generate metastases after xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. In the present review, we discuss the current evidence connecting CTCs, EMT, and stemness. An improved understanding of the CTC/EMT/CSC connections may uncover novel therapeutic targets, irrespective of the tumor type, since most cancers seem to harbor a pool of CSCs, and disclose important mechanisms underlying tumorigenicity.",Comparative Effectiveness of Gemcitabine plus Nab-Paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX in the First-Line Setting of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959763,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GEM-NAB) and the combination of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) are valid first-line options for advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). However, no randomized trials comparing the two schemes have been performed. This meta-analysis aims to compare GEM-NAB and FOLFIRINOX in terms of safety and effectiveness, taking into account data from real-life studies on mPC. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library up to November 2018 to identify retrospective or cohort studies on mPC comparing GEM-NAB and FOLFIRINOX. We included 16 retrospective studies, including 3813 patients (2123 treated with GEM-NAB and 1690 treated with FOLFIRINOX). Despite a median weighted overall survival (OS) difference in favor of FOLFIRINOX (mean difference: 1.15, 95% confidence interval CI 0.08⁻2.22, p = 0.03), in whole population OS was similar (hazard ratio (HR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.84⁻1.16; p = 0.9). PFS was also not different between the two arms (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.71⁻1.1; p = 0.26). The overall response rate was similar (25 vs. 24% with GEM-NAB and FOLFIRINOX). Among grade 3⁻4 toxicities, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and nausea were lower with GEM-NAB, while neurotoxicity and anemia were lower with FOLFIRINOX. In conclusion, despite a numerically longer median OS with FOLFIRINOX as compared to GEM-NAB, the overall risk of death and progression were similar. Their toxicity was different with less nausea, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia with GEM-NAB, as compared to less neurotoxicity and anemia with FOLFIRINOX. Therefore, analysis of non-randomized ""real world"" studies to date has not provided evidence of a major benefit of one regimen over the other.",Regulation of Noise-Induced Loss of Serotonin Transporters with Resveratrol in a Rat Model Using 4-[18F]-ADAM/Small-Animal Positron Emission Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959762,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Serotonin (5-HT) plays a crucial role in modulating the afferent fiber discharge rate in the inferior colliculus, auditory cortex, and other nuclei of the ascending auditory system. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol phytoalexin, can inhibit serotonin transporters (SERT) to increase synaptic 5-HT levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on noise-induced damage in the serotonergic system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized and exposed to an 8-kHz tone at 116 dB for 3.5 h. Resveratrol (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection [IP]) and citalopram (20 mg/kg, IP), a specific SERT inhibitor used as a positive control, were administered once a day for four consecutive days, with the first treatment occurring 2 days before noise exposure. Auditory brainstem response testing and positron emission tomography (PET) with N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[18F]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[18F]-ADAM, a specific radioligand for SERT) were used to evaluate functionality of the auditory system and integrity of the serotonergic system, respectively, before and after noise exposure. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed 1 day after the last PET scan. Our results indicate that noise-induced serotonergic fiber loss occurred in multiple brain regions including the midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, auditory cortex, and frontal cortex. This noise-induced damage to the serotonergic system was ameliorated in response to treatment with resveratrol and citalopram. However, noise exposure increased the hearing threshold in the rats regardless of drug treatment status. We conclude that resveratrol has protective effects against noise-induced loss of SERT.",Probiotics in Extraintestinal Diseases: Current Trends and New Directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959761,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host.

Due to the practical applications of EEG emotion calculation, researchers often use edge calculation to reduce data transmission times, however, as EEG involves a large amount of data, determining how to effectively extract features and reduce the amount of calculation is still the focus of abundant research. Researchers have proposed many EEG feature extraction methods. However, these methods have problems such as high time complexity and insufficient precision. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce an innovative method for obtaining reliable distinguishing features from EEG signals. This feature extraction method combines differential entropy with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) that can be applied in feature extraction of emotional EEG signals. We use a three-category sentiment EEG dataset to conduct experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed feature extraction method can significantly improve the performance of the EEG classification: Compared with the result of the original dataset, the average accuracy increases by 68%, which is 7% higher than the result obtained when only using differential entropy in feature extraction. The total execution time shows that the proposed method has a lower time complexity.",Antioxidant and Anti-Diabetic Activities of Polysaccharides from Guava Leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959759,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Guava (Psidium guajava L., Myrtaceae) leaves have been used as a folk herbal tea to treat diabetes for a long time in Asia and North America.

The results indicated that GLP exhibited good DPPH, OH, and ABTS free-radical scavenging abilities, and significantly lowered fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, glycated serum protein, creatinine, and malonaldehyde. Meanwhile, it significantly increased the total antioxidant activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity in diabetic mice, as well as ameliorated the damage of liver, kidney, and pancreas. Thus, polysaccharides from guava leaves could be explored as a potential antioxidant or anti-diabetic agents for functional foods or complementary medicine.",The Relationship between Dietary Vitamin K and Depressive Symptoms in Late Adulthood: A Cross-Sectional Analysis from a Large Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959758,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Few studies assessed the associations between dietary vitamin K and depressive symptoms. We aimed to investigate the association between dietary vitamin K and depressive symptoms in a large cohort of North American People. In this cross-sectional analysis, 4,375 participants that were aged 45⁻79 years from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included. Dietary vitamin K intake was collected through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized in quartiles. Depressive symptoms were diagnosed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) ≥ 16. To investigate the associations between vitamin K intake and depressive symptoms, logistic regression analysis were run, which adjusted for potential confounders. Overall, 437 (=10%) subjects had depressive symptoms. After adjusting for 11 confounders, people with the highest dietary vitamin K intake had lower odds of having depressive symptoms (OR = 0.58; 95%CI: 0.43⁻0.80). This effect was only present in people not taking vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, higher dietary vitamin K intake was significantly associated with a lower presence of depressive symptoms, also after accounting for potential confounders.

The aim of this study was to characterize the associations between the preoperative bilirubin concentration and the risk of postoperative mortality and severe complications to guide decision-making regarding preoperative biliary drainage. Eighty-one patients undergoing liver and bile duct resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma between 2005 and 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Postoperative mortality and severe complications, defined as a Clavien⁻Dindo grade of ≥III, were the primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively. The severe postoperative complications and mortality rates were 28.4% (23/81) and 11.1% (9/81), respectively. Patients with preoperative biliary drainage had significantly lower bilirubin concentrations (p = 0.028) than did those without. The preoperative bilirubin concentration was a risk factor of postoperative mortality (p = 0.003), with an optimal cut-off of 6.20 mg/dL (c-statistic = 0.829). The preoperative bilirubin concentration was a risk factor of severe morbidity (p = 0.018), with an optimal cut-off of 2.48 mg/dL (c-statistic = 0.662). These results indicate that preoperative hyperbilirubinemia is a major risk factor of negative early postoperative outcomes of patients who undergo surgical treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and may aid in decision-making with respect to preoperative biliary drainage.",A Smart Context-Aware Hazard Attention System to Help People with Peripheral Vision Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959756,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Peripheral vision loss results in the inability to detect objects in the peripheral visual field which affects the ability to evaluate and avoid potential hazards. A different number of assistive navigation systems have been developed to help people with vision impairments using wearable and portable devices. Most of these systems are designed to search for obstacles and provide safe navigation paths for visually impaired people without any prioritisation of the degree of danger for each hazard. This paper presents a new context-aware hybrid (indoor/outdoor) hazard classification assistive technology to help people with peripheral vision loss in their navigation using computer-enabled smart glasses equipped with a wide-angle camera. Our proposed system augments users' existing healthy vision with suitable, meaningful and smart notifications to attract the user's attention to possible obstructions or hazards in their peripheral field of view. A deep learning object detector is implemented to recognise static and moving objects in real time. After detecting the objects, a Kalman Filter multi-object tracker is used to track these objects over time to determine the motion model. For each tracked object, its motion model represents its way of moving around the user. Motion features are extracted while the object is still in the user's field of vision. These features are then used to quantify the danger using five predefined hazard classes using a neural network-based classifier. The classification performance is tested on both publicly available and private datasets and the system shows promising results with up to 90% True Positive Rate (TPR) associated with as low as 7% False Positive Rate (FPR), 13% False Negative Rate (FNR) and an average testing Mean Square Error (MSE) of 8.8%. The provided hazard type is then translated into a smart notification to increase the user's cognitive perception using the healthy vision within the visual field. A participant study was conducted with a group of patients with different visual field defects to explore their feedback about the proposed system and the notification generation stage. The real-world outdoor evaluation of human subjects is planned to be performed in our near future work.",Consumer Attitudes Towards Environmental Concerns of Meat Consumption: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959755,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Meat consumption is a major contributor to global warming. Given the worldwide growing demand of meat, and the severe impact of meat production on the planet, reducing animal protein consumption is a matter of food security and public health. Changing consumer food behavior is a challenge. Taste preferences, culinary traditions and social norms factor into food choices. Since behavioral change cannot occur without the subject's positive attitude based on reasons and motivations, a total of 34 papers on consumer attitudes and behavior towards meat consumption in relation to environmental concerns were examined. The results show that consumers aware of the meat impact on the planet, willing to stop or significantly reduce meat consumption for environmental reasons, and who have already changed their meat intake for ecological concerns are a small minority. However, environmental motives are already appealing significant proportions of Westerners to adopt certain meat curtailment strategies. Those who limit meat intake for environmental reasons are typically female, young, simply meat-reducer (not vegan/vegetarian), ecology-oriented, and would more likely live in Europe and Asia than in the U.S."

This paper presents a new manufacturing method for 42Cr9Si2 steel hollow head and sodium filled valves. An inertia friction welding process parameter optimization was conducted to obtain a suitable process parameter range. The fatigue strength of 42Cr9Si2 steel at elevated temperatures was evaluated by rotating bending fatigue test with material specimens. Performance evaluation tests for real valve components were then carried out using a bespoke bench-top apparatus, as well as a stress evaluation utilizing a finite element method. It was proved that the optimized friction welding parameters of HHSV can achieve good welding quality and performance, and the HHSV specimen successfully survived defined durability tests proving the viability of this new method. The wear resistance of the HHSV specimens was evaluated and the corresponding wear mechanisms were found to be those classically defined in automotive valve wear.",Lysis Profiles of Salmonella Phages on Salmonella Isolates from Various Sources and Efficiency of a Phage Cocktail against S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959743,Microorganisms,2019 06 10,"Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are major foodborne pathogens of concern worldwide. Bacteriophage applications have gained more interest for biocontrol in foods. This study isolated 36 Salmonella phages from several animal farms in Thailand and tested them on 47 Salmonella strains from several sources, including farms, seafood processing plant and humans in Thailand and USA. Phages were classified into three major groups. The estimated phage genome size showed the range from 50 ± 2 to 200 ± 2 kb. An effective phage cocktail consisting of three phages was developed. Approximately 4 log CFU/mL of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium could be reduced. These phages revealed a burst size of up to 97.7 on S. Enteritidis and 173.7 PFU/cell on S. Typhimurium. Our phage cocktail could decrease S. Enteritidis on chicken meat and sunflower sprouts by 0.66 log CFU/cm² and 1.27 log CFU/g, respectively. S. Typhimurium on chicken meat and sunflower sprouts were decreased by 1.73 log CFU/cm² and 1.17 log CFU/g, respectively. Overall, animal farms in Thailand provided high abundance and diversity of Salmonella phages with the lysis ability on Salmonella hosts from various environments and continents. A developed phage cocktail suggests a potential biocontrol against Salmonella in fresh foods.",Synthetic miR-143 Inhibits Growth of HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer Cells by Suppressing KRAS Networks Including DDX6 RNA Helicase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959742,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. In the clinical setting, the identification of HER2 overexpression in GC was a significant finding, as trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 drug, provides a survival advantage to HER2-positive GC patients. In HER2-postive GC, the dysregulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways has been reported, and inhibition of these pathways is an important therapeutic strategy. MiR-143 is known to act as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, such as bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. In the current study, we developed a novel chemically-modified miR-143 and explored the functions of this synthetic miR-143 (syn-miR-143) in HER2-positive gastric cancer. The expression level of miR-143 was down-regulated in GC cell lines, including HER2-positive GC cell lines, MKN7, and KATO-III. The ectopic expression of miR-143 in those cell lines suppressed cell growth through systemic silencing of KRAS and its effector signaling molecules, AKT and ERK. Furthermore, syn-miR-143 indirectly down-regulated the expression of HER2, an upstream molecule of KRAS, through silencing DEAD/H-box RNA helicase 6 (DDX6), RNA helicase, which enhanced HER2 protein expression at the translational step in HER2-positive GC cells. These findings suggested that syn-miR-143 acted as a tumor suppressor through the impairment of KRAS networks including the DDX6.",Inhibition of Satellite RNA Associated Cucumber Mosaic Virus Infection by Essential Oil of Micromeria croatica (Pers.) Schott.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959741,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"The present results dealing with the antiphytoviral activity of essential oil indicate that these plant metabolites can trigger a response to viral infection. The essential oil from Micromeria croatica and the main oil components β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were tested for antiphytoviral activity on plants infected with satellite RNA associated cucumber mosaic virus. Simultaneous inoculation of virus with essential oil or with the dominant components of oil, and the treatment of plants prior to virus inoculation, resulted in a reduction of virus infection in the local and systemic host plants. Treatment with essential oil changed the level of alternative oxidase gene expression in infected Arabidopsis plants indicating a connection between the essential oil treatment, aox gene expression and the development of viral infection.","The Profile of Urinary Headspace Volatile Organic Compounds After 12-Week Intake of Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin by Children and Adolescents with Celiac Disease on a Gluten-Free Diet: Results of a Pilot, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959740,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can inform about the metabolic condition of the body. In the small intestine of untreated persons with celiac disease (CD), chronic inflammation can occur, leading to nutritional deficiencies, and consequently to functional impairments of the whole body. Metabolomic studies showed differences in the profile of VOCs in biological fluids of patients with CD in comparison to healthy persons; however, there is scarce quantitative and nutritional intervention information. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation of a gluten-free diet (GFD) with prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) on the concentration of VOCs in the urine of children and adolescents with CD. Twenty-three participants were randomized to the group receiving Synergy 1 (10 g per day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Urinary VOCs were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry. Sixteen compounds were identified and quantified in urine samples. The supplementation of GFD with Synergy 1 resulted in an average concentration drop (36%) of benzaldehyde in urine samples. In summary, Synergy 1, applied as a supplement of GFD for 12 weeks had a moderate impact on the VOC concentrations in the urine of children with CD.",In Vitro and In Silico Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Thalictricavine and Canadine and Their Predicted Penetration across the Blood-Brain Barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959739,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"In recent studies, several alkaloids acting as cholinesterase inhibitors were isolated from Corydalis cava (Papaveraceae). Inhibitory activities of (+)-thalictricavine (1) and (+)-canadine (2) on human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) were evaluated with the Ellman's spectrophotometric method. Molecular modeling was used to inspect the binding mode of compounds into the active site pocket of hAChE. The possible permeability of 1 and 2 through the blood⁻brain barrier (BBB) was predicted by the parallel artificial permeation assay (PAMPA) and logBB calculation. In vitro, 1 and 2 were found to be selective hAChE inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.38 ± 0.05 µM and 0.70 ± 0.07 µM, respectively, but against hBChE were considered inactive (IC50 values > 100 µM). Furthermore, both alkaloids demonstrated a competitive-type pattern of hAChE inhibition and bind, most probably, in the same AChE sub-site as its substrate. In silico docking experiments allowed us to confirm their binding poses into the active center of hAChE. Based on the PAMPA and logBB calculation, 2 is potentially centrally active, but for 1 BBB crossing is limited. In conclusion, 1 and 2 appear as potential lead compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",A Hylarana latouchii Skin Secretion-Derived Novel Bombesin-Related Pentadecapeptide (Ranatensin-HLa) Evoke Myotropic Effects on the in vitro Rat Smooth Muscles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959738,Toxins,2019 06 10,"Amphibians have developed successful defensive strategies for combating predators and invasive microorganisms encountered in their broad range of environments, which involve secretion of complex cocktails of noxious, toxic and diverse bioactive molecules from the skins. In recent years, amphibian skin secretions have been considered as an extraordinary warehouse for the discovery of therapeutic medicines. In this study, through bioactivity screening of the Hylarana latouchii skin secretion-derived fractions, a novel peptide belonging to ranatensin subfamily (ranatensin-HLa) was discovered, and structurally and pharmacologically-characterised. It consists of 15 amino acid residues, pGlu-NGDRAPQWAVGHFM-NH₂, and its synthetic replicate was found to exhibit pharmacological activities on increasing the contraction of the in vitro rat bladder and uterus smooth muscles. Corresponding characteristic sigmoidal dose-response curves with EC50 values of 7.1 nM and 5.5 nM were produced, respectively, in bladder and uterus. Moreover, the precursor of ranatensin-HLa showed a high degree of similarity to those of bombesin-like peptides from Odorrana grahami and Odorrana schmackeri. Hylarana latouchii skin continues to serve as a storehouse with diverse lead compounds for the development of therapeutically effective medicines.",Parasitic Protozoa: Unusual Roles for G-Quadruplexes in Early-Diverging Eukaryotes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959737,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Guanine-quadruplex (G4) motifs, at both the DNA and RNA levels, have assumed an important place in our understanding of the biology of eukaryotes, bacteria and viruses. However, it is generally little known that their very first description, as well as the foundational work on G4s, was performed on protozoans: unicellular life forms that are often parasitic. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on the discovery of G4s, intertwined with their biological significance across the protozoan kingdom. This is a history in three parts: first, a period of discovery including the first characterisation of a G4 motif at the DNA level in ciliates (environmental protozoa); second, a period less dense in publications concerning protozoa, during which DNA G4s were discovered in both humans and viruses; and third, a period of renewed interest in protozoa, including more mechanistic work in ciliates but also in pathogenic protozoa. This last period has opened an exciting prospect of finding new anti-parasitic drugs to interfere with parasite biology, thus adding new compounds to the therapeutic arsenal.",Absolute Single Cavity Length Interrogation of Fiber-Optic Compound Fabry⁻Perot Pressure Sensors Through a White Light Non-Scanning Correlation Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959736,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"A white light non-scanning correlation interrogation system was proposed and built to interrogate absolute length of the air cavity of fiber-optic compound Fabry⁻Perot pressure sensors for the extraction of pressure value. By carefully choosing thickness range and tilt angle of the optical wedge used for cavity length matching, correlation interferometric signal of the basal cavity can be naturally filtered out. Based on peak positioning by Fourier transform, bandpass filtering in frequency domain, inverse Fourier transform back to time domain, envelope fitting and zero fringe finding through a gravity center method, cavity length can be determined with an accuracy of 0.04%. The system was used for the interrogation of a fiber-optic compound Fabry⁻Perot pressure sensor under different pressures. For a pressure range of 0.1~2.9 Mpa, the linear relationship between the air cavity length and the gas pressure imposed was successfully extracted.",Low Serum Melatonin Levels Prior to Liver Transplantation in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma are Associated with Lower Survival after Liver Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959735,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Melatonin administration has been associated with different benefits in animals and patients suffering from liver diseases. However, there is no published data about circulating melatonin levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver transplantation (LT). Thus, the objective of this observational and retrospective study was to determine whether patients with HCC with lower serum melatonin levels prior to LT have a higher risk of one-year mortality after LT. We measured serum levels of melatonin, malondialdehyde (to assess lipid peroxidation), and total antioxidant capacity (to assess antioxidant state) before LT. One-year surviving LT patients (n = 129) showed higher serum levels of melatonin (p = 0.001) and total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.001) and lower serum levels of malondialheyde (p = 0.01) than non-surviving LT patients (n = 16). Logistic regression analysis showed that high serum melatonin levels prior to LT were associated with lower one-year LT mortality (odds ratio = 0.525; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.331⁻0.834; p = 0.006). We found an association between serum levels of melatonin with serum levels of malondialheyde (rho = -0.22; p = 0.01) and total antioxidant capacity (rho = 0.21; p = 0.01). Thus, the novel findings of our study were the association between high serum melatonin levels prior to LT and survival at first year after LT and the association between serum levels of melatonin with malondialheyde and total antioxidant capacity."

Using two independent portals (viewing and working) and maintaining a certain distance from the bony and neural structures allow closer access to the target lesion through a panoramic view by free handling of the scope and instruments rather than through a fixed view by docking into the Kambin's triangle. Minimally invasive surgery allows for reduced dissection and inevitable muscle injury, preserving stability and reducing risks of restabilization. The purpose of fusion surgery is the same as that of the three surgical techniques stated above. Its wider range of view helps to overcome limitations of conventional endoscopic spinal surgery and to supplement the weak points of microscopic spinal surgery, such as limited working space in a tubular retractor and difficulty in accessing the contralateral area. This technique provides an alternative to unilateral or bilateral decompression of lumbar central spinal stenosis, foraminal stenosis, low-grade spondylolisthesis, and adjacent segment degeneration. Early clinical outcomes are promising despite potential for complications, such as dural tearing and postoperative epidural hematoma, similar to other procedures. Merits of BESS include decreased postoperative infection rate due to continuous irrigation throughout the procedure and decreased need for fusion surgery for one- or two-level lumbar stenosis by wide sublaminar and foraminal decompression with minimal sacrifice of stabilizing structures.",Efficacy of Nasobiliary Tubes and Biliary Stents in Management of Patients with Bile Leak after Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959587,Clinical endoscopy,2019 04 21,"Bile leak is one of the most common complications of liver transplantation.

Compared with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), ESD has several benefits, which include resectability of various difficult lesion, accurate histologic assessment of specimen, and lower recurrence rate. However, the risk of procedure- related complications is higher with ESD than with EMR. Moreover, because the colon has a thin wall and limited endoscopic maneuverability, ESD is considered a more challenging and risky procedure when performed in the colon than in the stomach. ESD-related complications are more likely to occur. The significant complications associated with ESD are bleeding, perforation, coagulation syndrome and stenosis, most of which can be treated and prevented by endoscopic intervention and preparation. Therefore, it is important to know how to occur and manage the ESD related complication.","Reconsidering the ""MR Unsafe"" breast tissue expander with magnetic infusion port: A case report and literature review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959585,Archives of plastic surgery,2019 04 08,"Breast tissue expanders (TEs) with magnetic infusion ports are labeled ""MR Unsafe.""

The increasing prevalence of glaucoma due to an ageing population has necessitated the identification of suitable biomarkers for the early detection of the disease. Aqueous humour (AH) has been proposed as a source of biomarkers, but it can only be collected using a minor, yet invasive surgical intervention. Tears, however, are constantly available and can be collected any time via noninvasive methods. In order to examine the utility of tear as a surrogate for aqueous humour in biomarker development, we compared the levels of 27 cytokines and chemokines in paired samples of tear and aqueous humour using a Luminex multiplex immunobead-based technique. Significantly higher levels of cytokines in tear compared to aqueous humour were detected suggesting that tear and aqueous humour are not identical in terms of inflammation response. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-γ, GM-CSF and IL-5 in tear were significantly lower in patients who developed complications after one year, but no statistically significant changes in cytokine levels were observed in aqueous humour.

HCC treatment is hindered by the frequent emergence of chemoresistance to the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, which has been related to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that self-renew and often escape therapy. The key metabolic sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) has recently been recognized as a tumour growth regulator. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of AMPK in the development of a stem cell phenotype in HCC cells. To this end, we enriched the CSC population in HCC cell lines that showed increased expression of drug resistance (ALDH1A1, ABCB1A) and stem cell (CD133, Nanog, Oct4, alpha fetoprotein) markers and demonstrated their stemness phenotype. These cells were refractory to sorafenib-induced cell death. We report that sorafenib-resistant cells had lower levels of total and phosphorylated AMPK as well as its downstream substrate, ACC, compared with the parental cells. Interestingly, AMPK knockdown with siRNA or inhibition with dorsomorphin increased the expression of stem cell markers in parental cells and blocked sorafenib-induced cell death. Conversely, the upregulation of AMPK, either by transfection or by pharmacological activation with A-769662, decreased the expression of ALDH1A1, ABCB1A, CD133, Nanog, Oct4, and alpha fetoprotein, and restored sensitivity to sorafenib. Analysis of the underlying mechanism points to hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α as a regulator of stemness. In vivo studies in a xenograft mouse model demonstrated that stem-like cells have greater tumourigenic capacity. AMPK activation reduced xenograft tumour growth and decreased the expression of stem cell markers. Taken together, these results indicate that AMPK may serve as a novel target to overcome chemoresistance in HCC.",Molecular characterization of Capripox viruses obtained from field outbreaks in Nigeria between 2000 and 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959552,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 04 23,"Capripox virus infections are endemic diseases of livestock in Nigeria, but there are limited data on molecular characterization of circulating viruses. In this study, we investigated field outbreaks of Capripox virus infections in Nigeria via partial sequencing of viruses obtained from field samples. Eleven selected samples, collected from 2000-2016 from cattle (9), sheep (1) and goat (1) in three states in Nigeria and Capripox virus genome positive by PCR and real-time qPCR, were characterized using our newly developed partial sequencing protocol. This method for genetic characterization of Capripox virus strains allows a first, short molecular classification of strains responsible for the investigated field outbreaks in the country. Phylogenetically, the eight LSDV samples obtained from 2010 to 2016 are closely related to already published strains occurring in Greece and Serbia in the years 2015 and 2016, respectively, whereas the isolate from 2000 shows high similarity to the South African NI-2490 strain. These data indicate that there was a change of LSDV strains circulating in Nigeria between the years 2000 and 2010. The samples isolated from a goat and a sheep in different years seem to be related to already known GTPV strains, but clearly differ from all current published GTPV strains. Interestingly, both newly detected GTPV strains show up to 100% similarity compared to each other and led to clinical disease in sheep and goats. It is long known that some strains of GTPV and SPPV are able to infect both sheep and goats, but in most cases lead to more severe disease in only one of these species. Further genetic characterization of these isolates could provide more insight into pathogenesis and virulence factors of Capripox viruses, especially GTPV and SPPV.",Survey for Hepatitis E virus infection in non-human primates in zoos in Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959551,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 05 05,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that has been detected in different animal species.

At least one seropositive animal was detected in five of the 33 species sampled (15.2%). This is the first report of seropositivity in black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). Anti-HEV antibodies were found in six of the eight zoos included in the study (75.0%). Seroconversion was detected in one chimpanzee, which confirms HEV circulation in one zoo between 2015 and 2016. Seropositivity was significantly higher in hominids than in other NHP families. HEV RNA was not detected in any of the serum samples tested. The results indicate susceptibility of NHPs to HEV infection. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of these species in the epidemiology of HEV."

It is not known whether the use of such prosthesis designs may predispose to reduced function owing to its constraining design. The components are usually implanted with diaphyseal stem extensions to dissipate the increased forces. The totally stabilized (TS) implant is a contemporary VVC design with metaphyseal fixation only. It has a conforming articulation with increased rotational freedom compared with conventional VVC designs. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of the contemporary TS implant with its metaphyseally fixed components would be associated with inferior outcomes compared with conventional standard primary posterior stabilized (PS) implants. We reviewed 38 consecutive complex primary TKAs performed using the metaphyseally fixed TS implant and 76 matched patients receiving primary PS TKA, at a minimum follow-up of 24 months. The mean follow-up was 61.1 months (24-102). Only patients with osteoarthritis were included. Clinical outcome was assessed using range of motion (ROM) and Oxford knee score (OKS). Radiographic assessment was performed using the femorotibial angle (FTA) at 6 weeks followed by assessment of bone-implant interface lucencies at final follow-up. There were no major early postoperative complications. The mean postoperative ROM in the TS and PS groups were 114.1 and 112.0, respectively. There was no difference in the mean ROM and OKS between the two groups. The mean FTA for patients in both groups was within 3° of the expected. There was no evidence of progressive lucencies or implant migration at final follow-up. The metaphyseally fixed TS knee design achieves comparable short-term functional outcomes when compared with conventional PS designs in primary knee arthroplasty. Long-term follow-up studies are required to assess survivorship.",Dialysis Is Not Associated with Increased Risk of Perioperative Complications in TKA Patients after Adjusting for Pertinent Confounders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959539,The journal of knee surgery,2019 04 08,"With a growing prevalence for chronic renal failure, arthroplasty surgeons will find it more likely to have dialysis dependent patients present for knee replacement. Previous retrospective studies using a matched cohort of patients have reported worse perioperative outcomes for dialysis-dependent patients. However, many of these studies failed to control for pertinent confounders. This study aims to fill in that void. The present study compares lengths of stay, discharge status, and 30-day outcomes between dialysis-dependent TKA recipients and a matched cohort of nondialysis dependent TKA recipients. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify the study cohorts. Patients were propensity score matched based on patient-specific demographic variables, preoperative functional status, and preoperative laboratory values. Generalized regression models were conducted to assess the effects of dialysis dependency on perioperative outcomes. Dialysis dependent patients demonstrated longer mean lengths of stay (+1.14) and a lower likelihood for home discharge (odds ratio [OR] = 0.503). There was no increased risk of 30-day complications in dialysis dependent TKA patients. Our findings demonstrate no increased risk of 30-day complications after TKA when adjusting for pertinent confounders. This suggests TKA is safe for well optimized dialysis dependent patients prior to surgery.",Aperture and Suspensory Fixation Equally Efficacious for Quadriceps Tendon Graft Fixation in Primary ACL Reconstruction: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959537,The journal of knee surgery,2019 04 08,"This review is aimed to compare suspensory and aperture quadriceps tendon autograft femoral and tibial fixations in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL-R), and the clinical outcomes and complication profiles of each fixation method. Greater understanding of the optimal graft fixation technique for quadriceps tendon (QT) autografts may assist surgeons in improving outcomes after ACL-R. PubMed, Embase, and Medline were searched from database inception to September 2017, and again to July 2018, and identified 3,670 articles, 21 studies of which satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria. Across included studies, 1,155 QT ACL-R patients (mean age, 28.7 years [range, 15-59 years], with mean postoperative follow-up of 36.1 months [range, 3.4-120 months]), were analyzed. Suspensory fixation on both sides demonstrated a higher percentage of patients (81.7%) achieving the highest rating of ""A or B"" on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee ligament examination form compared with aperture fixation on both sides (67.7%). Moreover, suspensory fixation had a lower side-to-side difference in anterior laxity (1.6 mm) when compared with aperture fixation (2.3 mm). Among studies which reported graft failure, all of which employed aperture fixation, the rate was 3.2%. Across available data, primary ACL-R using QT grafts appears to have successful short-term outcomes with a short-term graft failure rate of 3% independent of fixation method. While there is limited data regarding the comparison of aperture and suspensory soft-tissue quadriceps tendon (SQT) fixation in ACL-R, the findings of this systematic review suggest that suspensory fixation and aperture fixation in both the femoral and tibial tunnels are equally efficacious based on clinical outcome data on IKDC grade and measured laxity.

The aim of this study is to evaluate proprioception in standing position at different knee flexion angles in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior tendon allograft. The study included 34 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior tendon allograft and 34 healthy individuals. Proprioception was evaluated in standing position at 15°, 30°, 60° flexion angles with the active joint position sense (AJPS) method using digital inclinometer. Proprioception deviation angle was found to be higher in the operated leg at 30° and 60° flexion angles in the patient group compared with the other leg (p < 0.05), the biggest proprioception difference was between the 15° and 60° flexion angles in both the patient and the control group (p < 0.05) that the difference between 15° and 30° flexion angles is lowest (p < 0.05), and that these differences are higher in the operated leg of the patient group compared with the other leg of the patient group and to the dominant leg of the control group (p < 0.05). As approximately 4 years after ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior tendon allograft, loss of proprioception at 60° knee flexion continued, ACL injury related to loss of proprioception may occur at angles higher than 30° flexion. Thus, patients may be provided with proprioception-enhancing rehabilitation in the long term, particularly, at flexion angles above medium levels.","[The ""light"" version of a perforator flap: significance of the Keystone Designed Perforator Flap Concept (KDPFC) in the lower extremity].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959534,"Handchirurgie, Mikrochirurgie, plastische Chirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Handchirurgie : Organ der Deutschsprachigen Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Mikrochirurgie der Peripheren Nerven und Gefasse : Organ der V...",2019 04 08,"Since the KDPFC was first described by Behan et al. in 2003, there have been a number of publications about this technique with case series between 1 and 300 flaps, and some have described further modifications of the design of the flap.

Little is known whether GHB's efficacy reflects the promotion of physiological sleep mechanisms and no study has investigated its sleep consolidating effects under low sleep pressure. GHB (50 mg/kg p.o.) and placebo were administered in 20 young male volunteers at 2:30 a.m., the time when GHB is typically given in narcolepsy, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover manner. Drug effects on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep spectra were analyzed. In addition, current source density (CSD) analysis was employed to identify the effects of GHB on the brain electrical sources of neuronal oscillations. Moreover, lagged-phase synchronization (LPS) analysis was applied to quantify the functional connectivity among sleep-relevant brain regions. GHB prolonged slow-wave sleep (stage N3) at the cost of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Furthermore, it enhanced delta-theta (0.5-8 Hz) activity in NREM and REM sleep, while reducing activity in the spindle frequency range (13-15 Hz) in sleep stage N2. The increase in delta power predominated in medial prefrontal cortex, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex. Theta power was particularly increased in the prefrontal cortex and both temporal poles. Moreover, the brain areas that showed increased theta power after GHB also exhibited increased lagged-phase synchronization among each other. Our study in healthy men revealed distinct similarities between GHB-augmented sleep and physiologically augmented sleep as seen in recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness. The promotion of the sleep neurophysiological mechanisms by GHB may thus provide a rationale for GHB-induced sleep and waking quality in neuropsychiatric disorders beyond narcolepsy.",Hypophagia induced by hindbrain serotonin is mediated through central GLP-1 signaling and involves 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptor activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959513,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 10,"The overlap in neurobiological circuitry mediating the physiological and behavioral response to satiation and noxious/stressful stimuli are not well understood. The interaction between serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) could play a role as upstream effectors involved in mediating associations between anorectic and noxious/stressful stimuli. We hypothesize that 5-HT acts as an endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system to mediate satiation and malaise in rats. Here, we investigate whether interactions between central 5-HT and GLP-1 signaling are behaviorally and physiologically relevant for the control of food intake and pica (i.e., behavioral measure of malaise). Results show that the anorexia and body weight changes induced by administration of exogenous hindbrain 5-HT are dependent on central GLP-1 receptor signaling. Furthermore, anatomical evidence shows mRNA expression of 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptors on GLP-1-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius by fluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that PPG neurons are likely to express both of these receptors. Behaviorally, the hypophagia induced by the pharmacological activation of both of these receptors is also dependent on GLP-1 signaling. Finally, 5-HT3, but not 5-HT2C receptors, are required for the anorectic effects of the interoceptive stressor LiCl, suggesting the hypophagia induced by these 5-HT receptors may be driven by different mechanisms. Our findings highlight 5-HT as a novel endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system and suggest that the central interaction between 5-HT and GLP-1 is involved in the control of food intake in rats.",Kasuistik: Hochrisiko-M0CRPC-Therapie mit Apalutamid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959512,Oncology research and treatment,2019 04 08,"Stieg bei einem Prostatakarzinom-Patienten, der keine Metastasen in der konventionellen Bildgebung hatte, unter der Androgendeprivation (ADT) der PSA-Wert, wurde bislang meist die ADT bis zum Auftreten von Metastasen fortgeführt.

A model Hamiltonian is proposed in the second quantization representation for the system of coupled surface plasmon and Fermi arc plasmon modes. We obtain the dispersion relations of coupled modes using the Bogoliubov transformation technique. We identify the upper coupled mode as the renormalized surface plasmon and the lower coupled mode as the renormalized Fermi arc plasmon. It is shown how the magnitude of the coupling depends on both the bare mode dispersions and their dampings. We also demonstrate that coupling increases the surface plasmon mode lifetime. Obtained results for the surface plasmon mode are qualitatively consistent with the recent experimental data of Weyl semimetals.

Importantly, the vibration period of the GZO nanoparticles at the same Ga doping concentration show a nonlinear increase as the nanoparticle size is increased, which is different from the common linear dependency in undoped ZnO nanoparticles.

In myocardium, these hormones stimulate both diastolic myocardial relaxation and systolic myocardial contraction, have a pro-angiogenic effect and an important role in extracellular matrix maintenance. Thyroid hormones modulate cardiac mitochondrial function. Dysfunction of thyroid axis impair myocardial bioenergetic status. Both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism are associated with a higher incidence of coronary events and an increased risk of heart failure progression. Endothelial function is also impaired in hypothyroid state, with decreased nitric oxide mediated vascular relaxation. In heart disease, particularly in ischemic heart disease, abnormalities in thyroid hormone levels are common and are an important factor to be considered. In fact, low thyroid hormone levels should be interpreted as a cardiovascular risk factor. Regarding ischemic heart disease, during the late post-myocardial infarction period, thyroid hormones modulate left ventricular structure, function and geometry. Dysfunction of thyroid axis might even be more prevalent in the referred condition since there is an upregulation of type 3 deiodinase in myocardium, producing a state of local cardiac hypothyroidism. In this focused review, we summarize the central pathophysiological and clinical links between altered thyroid function and ischemic heart disease. Finally, we highlight the potential benefits of thyroid hormone supplementation as a therapeutic target in ischemic heart disease.","ENDOCRINE HISTORY: The history of discovery, synthesis and development of testosterone for clinical use.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959485,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 23,"As the most important male hormone, testosterone has an impact on almost all organs and body functions. The biological effects of testosterone and the testes have been known since antiquity, long before testosterone was identified as the active agent. Practical applications of this knowledge were castration of males to produce obedient servants, for punishment, for preservation of the prepubertal soprano voice and even for treatment of diseases. Testes were used in organotherapy and transplanted as treatment for symptoms of hypogonadism on a large scale, although these practices had only placebo effects. In reaction to such malpractice in the first half of the 20th century science and the young pharmaceutical industry initiated the search for the male hormone. After several detours together with their teams in 1935, Ernst Laqueur (Amsterdam) isolated and Adolf Butenandt (Gdansk) as well as Leopold Ruzicka (Zürich) synthesized testosterone. Since then testosterone has been available for clinical use. However, when given orally, testosterone is inactivated in the liver, so that parenteral forms of administration or modifications of the molecule had to be found. Over 85 years the testosterone preparations have been slowly improved so that now physiological serum levels can be achieved.",DNA Methylation in the Pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959484,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 08,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the leading endocrine and metabolic disorder in premenopausal women characterized by hyperandrogenism and abnormal development of ovarian follicles. To date, the PCOS etiology remains unclear and has been related to insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and infertility, among other morbidities. Substantial evidence illustrates the impact of genetic, intrauterine, and environmental factors on the PCOS etiology. Lately, epigenetic factors have garnered considerable attention in the pathogenesis of PCOS considering that changes in the content of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and noncoding RNAs have been reported in various tissues of women with this disease. DNA methylation is changed in the peripheral and umbilical cord blood, as well as in ovarian and adipose tissue of women with PCOS, suggesting the involvement of this epigenetic modification in the pathogenesis of the disease. Perhaps, these defects in DNA methylation promote the deregulation of genes involved in inflammation, hormone synthesis and signaling, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Research on the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of PCOS is just beginning, and several issues await investigation. This review aims to provide an overview of current research focused on DNA methylation and PCOS, as well as discuss the perspectives regarding this topic.",Clock genes and cancer development in particular in endocrine tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959483,Endocrine-related cancer,2019 04 08,"Circadian rhythms in central and peripheral level are operated by transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of genes called 'clock genes' that are implicated in the development of several diseases including malignancies. Dysregulation of Clock system can affect cancer susceptibility by regulating DNA damage and repair mechanisms as well as apoptosis. A number of oncogenic pathways can be dysregulated via clock genes' epigenetic alterations including hypermethylation of clock genes' promoters or variants of clock genes. Clock genes disruption has been well studied in breast, lung, prostate cancer and hematological malignancies. However, it is still not entirely clear whether clock genes disruption is the cause or the consequence of tumourogenesis. Data in endocrine neoplasms are scarce. Recent findings suggest that clock genes are implicated in benign and malignant adrenocortical neoplasias. They are also associated with follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas and parathyroid adenomas as well as pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas. Dysregulation of clock genes is also encountered in ovarian and testicular tumours and may also be related with their susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents. The most common clock genes that are implicated in endocrine neoplasms are PER1, CRY1 and in most cases their expression is down-regulated in tumoural compared to normal tissues. Although there is still a lot to be done for the better understanding of the role of clock genes in endocrine tumourigenenesis, existing evidence could guide research and help identify novel therapeutic targets aiming mainly at the peripheral component of the clock gene system.",Developmental pathways and programming of diabetes: epidemiological aspects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959482,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 04 08,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major, rapidly increasing global public health challenge. The major risk factors for T2D include overweight and obesity, lifestyle related factors and genetic factors. Early life exposures shape the developmental trajectories and alter susceptibility to T2D. Based on epidemiological studies it has been suggested that fetal undernutrition plays a role in the etiology of T2D. A low birth weight has been considered a proxy for fetal undernutrition. A meta-analysis reported that a 1 kg increase in birth weight is associated with a roughly 20% lower risk of T2D. Although fetal life is of major importance for future health, the period spanning the first 1 000 days of life, is characterized by great plasticity and largely influencing later health. Different growth trajectories during this time period have also been associated with an increased risk of T2D. Studies assessing the association between age at BMI rebound in childhood and later risk for T2D have reported a 5-fold difference in T2D according to age at BMI rebound. Developmental and epidemiological cohort studies focusing on T2D have major public health implications supporting a paradigm shift; a shift from focusing upon risk factor modification in adult life to adopting a life course perspective when studying T2D. This paradigm shift will not only help us in getting a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying T2D, but it will also open new possibilities and opportunities in the prevention of T2D and related disorders.",Leptin resensitization: a reversion of leptin resistant states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959481,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 04 08,"Leptin resistance refers to states in which leptin fails to promote its anticipated effects, frequently coexisting with hyperleptinaemia. It is closely associated with obesity, and also observed in physiological situations such as pregnancy and in seasonal animals. Leptin resensitization refers to the reversion of leptin resistant states and is associated with improvement in endocrine and metabolic disturbances commonly observed in obesity and a sustained decrease of plasma leptin levels, possibly below a critical threshold level. In obesity, leptin resensitization can be achieved with treatments that reduce body adiposity and leptinaemia, or with some pharmacological compounds, while physiological leptin resistance reverts spontaneously. The restoration of leptin sensitivity could be a useful strategy to treat obesity, maintain weight loss and/or reduce the recidivism rate for weight regain after dieting. This review provides an update and discussion about reversion of leptin resistant states and modulation of the molecular mechanisms involved in each situation.",Chronic predator stress in female mice reduces primordial follicle numbers: implications for the role of ghrelin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959480,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 04 08,"Chronic stress is a known suppressor of female reproductive function. However, attempts to isolate single causal links between stress and reproductive dysfunction have not yet been successful due to their multi-faceted aetiologies. The gut-derived hormone ghrelin regulates stress and reproductive function and may therefore be pivotal in the neuroendocrine integration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and -gonadal (HPG) axes. Here, we hypothesised that chronic stress disrupts ovarian follicle maturation and that this effect is mediated by a stress-induced increase in acyl ghrelin and activation of the growth hormone secretatogue receptor (GHSR). We gave C57BL/6J female mice to 30 min daily chronic predator stress for 4 weeks, or no stress, and gave them daily GHSR antagonist (D-Lys3-GHRP-6) or saline. Exposure to chronic predator stress reduced circulating corticosterone, elevated acyl ghrelin levels and led to significantly depleted primordial follicle numbers. GHSR antagonism stress-dependently altered the expression of genes regulating ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins and was able to attenuate the stress-induced depletion of primordial follicles. These findings suggest that chronic stress-induced elevations of acyl ghrelin may be detrimental for ovarian follicle maturation.",Echocardiographic assessment of myocardial function and mechanics during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959479,Echo research and practice,2019 05 08,"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) plays a fundamental role in management of patients supported with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In light of fluctuating clinical states, serial monitoring of cardiac function is required. Formal quantification of ventricular parameters and myocardial mechanics offer benefit over qualitative assessment. The aim of this research was to compare unenhanced (UE) versus contrast-enhanced (CE) quantification of myocardial function and mechanics during ECMO in a validated ovine model."

This report describes the clinical course of a female former light smoker with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma whose tumor underwent histologic transformation from a well-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma to a well-differentiated lung squamous cell carcinoma in the same location at the left mainstem bronchus while maintaining the ALK fusion oncogene without any resistance mutations. After experiencing disease progression while on crizotinib, the patient participated in clinical trials that provided early access to the novel ALK inhibitors ceritinib and alectinib before they were commercially available. Tumor recurrence occurred at the primary and metastatic central nervous system sites (ie, brain and spine). At tumor progression, liquid biopsy and tumor genomic profiling of plasma cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) provided an accurate diagnosis with a short turnaround time compared with the tissue-based targeted capture NGS. The patient received several courses of radiation primarily to the brain and spine during her disease course. Her disease did not respond to the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, and she died on home hospice approximately 4 years after diagnosis. This case supports the importance of both histopathologic assessment and comprehensive genomic profiling in selecting appropriate treatment for patients with refractory, metastatic, ALK oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Use of symptom-directed radiation in tandem with ALK inhibitors contributed to the disease and symptomatic control and prolonged survival in this patient.",Low Provider Knowledge Is Associated With Less Evidence-Based Lung Cancer Screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959463,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,2019 04 08,"Despite widespread recommendation and supportive policies, screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) is incompletely implemented in the US healthcare system.

The proteasomal and autophagic-lysosomal degradation pathways are key measures to maintain proteostasis. Here, we report that hippocampal cells selected for full adaptation and resistance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress-resistant cells, OxSR cells) showed a massive increase in the expression of components of the cellular autophagic-lysosomal network and a significantly higher overall autophagic activity. A comparative expression analysis revealed that distinct key regulators of autophagy are upregulated in OxSR cells. The observed adaptive autophagic response was found to be independent of the upstream autophagy regulator mTOR but is accompanied by a significant upregulation of further downstream components of the canonical autophagy network such as Beclin1, WIPI1 and the transmembrane ATG9 proteins. Interestingly, the expression of the HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3, mediator of BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy and highly relevant for the clearance of aggregated proteins in cells, was found to be increased in OxSR cells that were consequently able to effectively overcome proteotoxic stress. Overexpression of BAG3 in oxidative stress-sensitive HT22 wildtype cells partly established the vesicular phenotype and the enhanced autophagic flux seen in OxSR cells suggesting that BAG3 takes over an important part in the adaptation process. A full proteome analysis demonstrated additional changes in the expression of mitochondrial proteins, metabolic enzymes and different pathway regulators in OxSR cells as consequence of the adaptation to oxidative stress in addition to autophagy-related proteins. Taken together, this analysis revealed a wide variety of pathways and players that act as adaptive response to chronic redox stress in neuronal cells.",A Golgi-associated redox switch regulates catalytic activation and cooperative functioning of ST6Gal-I with B4GalT-I.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959459,Redox biology,2019 06 10,"Glycosylation, a common modification of cellular proteins and lipids, is often altered in diseases and pathophysiological states such as hypoxia, yet the underlying molecular causes remain poorly understood. By utilizing lectin microarray glycan profiling, Golgi pH and redox screens, we show here that hypoxia inhibits terminal sialylation of N- and O-linked glycans in a HIF- independent manner by lowering Golgi oxidative potential. This redox state change was accompanied by loss of two surface-exposed disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain of the α-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal-I) and its ability to functionally interact with B4GalT-I, an enzyme adding the preceding galactose to complex N-glycans. Mutagenesis of selected cysteine residues in ST6Gal-I mimicked these effects, and also rendered the enzyme inactive. Cells expressing the inactive mutant, but not those expressing the wild type ST6Gal-I, were able to proliferate and migrate normally, supporting the view that inactivation of the ST6Gal-I help cells to adapt to hypoxic environment. Structure comparisons revealed similar disulfide bonds also in ST3Gal-I, suggesting that this O-glycan and glycolipid modifying sialyltransferase is also sensitive to hypoxia and thereby contribute to attenuated sialylation of O-linked glycans in hypoxic cells. Collectively, these findings unveil a previously unknown redox switch in the Golgi apparatus that is responsible for the catalytic activation and cooperative functioning of ST6Gal-I with B4GalT-I.",The Prüm Decisions as an Aspirational regime: Reviewing a Decade of Cross-Border Exchange and Comparison of Forensic DNA Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959458,Forensic science international. Genetics,2019 06 04,"The automatic exchange and comparison of DNA data between national databases to combat terrorism and cross-border crime in the EU area has been facilitated by the 2008 Prüm Decisions. While it was anticipated that all EU Member States would have fulfilled the requirements by August 2011, this has not yet occurred. Once each Member State has implemented the Prüm Decisions, which is expected to occur by spring or summer 2019, the EU Commission is planning on submitting a legislative proposal to amend the Prüm Decisions, possibly broadening its scope both in terms of types of data exchanged and the number of countries involved. Therefore, it is a timely place to review the available literature on the existing data on the cross-border exchange and comparison of DNA. However, due to the limited amount of available data regarding the Prüm regime's contribution to combating crime and terrorism, this article reviews national DNA databases' contribution to national criminal justice systems before it turns to the Prüm regime. Outlining how Prüm represents an ""aspirational regime"" focused on a secure and safe future, we draft recommendations directed towards rendering cross-border exchange of DNA data more transparent and accountable.",Hydrophobic sorption behaviors of 17β-Estradiol on environmental microplastics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959457,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Microplastics (MPs) have been regarded as a vector for contaminants and greatly affect the migration and fate of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in marine water. In this study, the sorption behavior of 17β-estradiol (E2) on MPs was investigated in marine water system. The sorption capacity of E2 varied greatly with the chemical structures of MPs. The adsorption or partition contribution of E2 sorption on MPs was well quantified with adsorption-partition dual-mode model mechanism. The hydrophobic partition dominantly regulates the sorption of E2 due to the high crystallinity of MPs and high accessibility of amorphous domain of rubbery MPs. Smaller particle size benefits the sorption of E2 on same kind of MPs. The salinity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) have minor effect on E2 sorption by MPs in real marine water. The result shows that the MPs greatly influence the transportation of E2 and cause potential environmental risk to marine ecosystem."
