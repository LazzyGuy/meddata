Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to exhibit a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of RSV on renal inflammation and oxidative stress in obese mice induced by high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6 mice were induced to have nephropathy associated obesity by high-fat diet for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of feeding, oral supplementation with 100 mg RSV/kg body weight/day was applied with the high-fat-diet feeding for another 4 weeks. The results showed that RSV treatment protected against renal damage induced by high-fat diet, as evidenced by the decreased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, alleviation of glomerular damage, and tubular vacuolization. In addition, RSV enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activity; improved the expression of genes related to inflammation; and decreased the malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 concentrations in the kidney of high-fat-diet mice. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate renal damage in obese mice induced by high-fat diet via suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress.",Trials with proxy-reported outcomes registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554370,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 07,"A proxy is someone other than a patient who reports a patient's outcomes as if they are the patient.

One such species, the herbaceous native annual Linum sulcatum Riddell (Linaceae), is thought to be self-compatible, but there has been no experimental evidence to date to support this claim. To assess the breeding system of this species, seeds were collected from wild populations and reared in a controlled environment. Floral manipulations and controlled pollinations were conducted to determine the degree of self-compatibility of this species and to distinguish between autonomous and facilitated modes of selfing. Additional controlled within- and between-population crosses were conducted to determine the relative degree to which this species can outcross. This study showed that self-fertilization was highly successful and can occur autonomously. In contrast, outcrossing success, both within and between populations, was very limited, suggesting this species may exhibit an extreme degree of cross-incompatibility. A pollen tube growth experiment showed that self-pollination resulted in the formation of more pollen tubes relative to cross-pollination and that complete pollen tube growth can occur less than 2 h following self-pollination. This information is relevant to the future persistence of this species, as much of its remaining habitat is distributed among small, highly fragmented patches subjected to current and future environmental stressors.",Adsorption and in vitro release study of curcumin form polyethyleneglycol functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube: kinetic and isotherm study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554368,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",2018 12 16,"Polyethylene glycol functionalized with oxygenated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-PEG-MWCNTs) as an efficient nanomaterial for the in vitro adsorption/release of curcumin (CUR) anticancer agent. The synthesized material was morphologically characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the CUR adsorption process was assessed with kinetic and isotherm models fitting well with pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherms. The results showed that the proposed O-PEG-MWCNTs has a high adsorption capacity for CUR (2.0 × 103 mg/g) based on the Langmuir model. The in vitro release of CUR from O-PEG-MWCNTs was studied in simulating human body fluids with different pHs (ABS pH 5, intestinal fluid pH 6.6 and body fluid pH 7.4). Lastly, to confirm the success compliance of the O-PEG-MWCNT nanocomposite as a drug delivery system, the parameters affecting the CUR release such as temperature and PEG content were investigated. As a result, the proposed nanocomposite could be used as an efficient carrier for CUR delivery with an enhanced prolonged release property. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.",Epidemiology of gastrostomy insertion for children and adolescents with intellectual disability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554367,European journal of pediatrics,2019 04 08,"The largest group of recipients of pediatric gastrostomy have neurological impairment with intellectual disability (ID). This study investigated trends in first gastrostomy insertion according to markers of disadvantage and ID etiology. Linked administrative and health data collected over a 32-year study period (1983-2014) for children with ID born between 1983 and 2009 in Western Australia were examined. The annual incidence rate change over calendar year was calculated for all children and according to socioeconomic status, geographical remoteness, and Aboriginality. The most likely causes of ID were identified using available diagnosis codes in the linked data set. Of 11,729 children with ID, 325 (2.8%) received a first gastrostomy within the study period. The incidence rate was highest in the 0-2 age group and there was an increasing incidence trend with calendar time for each age group under 6 years of age. This rate change was greatest in children from the lowest socioeconomic status quintile, who lived in regional/remote areas or who were Aboriginal. The two largest identified groups of ID were genetically caused syndromes (15.1%) and neonatal encephalopathy (14.8%).Conclusion: Gastrostomy is increasingly used in multiple neurological conditions associated with ID, with no apparent accessibility barriers in terms of socioeconomic status, remoteness, or Aboriginality. What is Known: • The use of gastrostomy insertion in pediatrics is increasing and the most common recipients during childhood have neurological impairment, most of whom also have intellectual disability (ID). What is New: • Nearly 3% of children with ID had gastrostomy insertion performed, with the highest incidence in children under 3 years of age. • Gastrostomy use across different social groups was equitable in the Australian setting.","Effect of tree foliage supplementation of tropical grass diet on in vitro digestibility and fermentation, microbial biomass synthesis and enteric methane production in ruminants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554366,Tropical animal health and production,2019 04 19,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of tree foliage species supplemented in ruminant diets based on Pennisetum purpureum on the in vitro digestibility and fermentation, microbial biomass synthesis and enteric methane production. Seven experimental diets were evaluated, including a control treatment based on P. purpureum (PT) grass, and six additional treatments supplemented with 30.0% foliage from Neomillspaughia emargiata (NE), Tabernaemontana amygdalifolia (TA), Caesalpinia gaumeri (CG), Piscidia piscipula (PP), Leucaena leucocephala (LL) and Havardia albicans (HA). A randomised complete block design repeated in two periods (block) was used. The highest gas production (P < 0.05) was recorded in treatments TA and PT (237 and 228 mL g-1, respectively). The highest in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic matter (IVOMD) (P < 0.05) was recorded in the control treatment PT (57.9% and 66.1%, respectively). Treatments LL, NE, TA and PP promoted greater microbial biomass synthesis (290, 223, 220 and 213 mg g-1, respectively) (P < 0.05). The proportion of propionic acid also increased in these latter treatments and in treatments CG and HA (P < 0.05). Additionally, treatments LL, PP, NE and TA decreased methane production (25.8, 29.5, 30.6 and 31.8 L kg-1 of digested dry matter, respectively). In conclusion, supplementation with L. leucocephala, P. piscipula, N. emargiata and T. amygdalifolia in ruminant diets based on P. purpureum is one feed alternative that can promote greater efficiency and synthesis of microbial biomass, increase the proportions of propionic and butyric acid and decrease the production of enteric methane by 15.6 to 31.6%.","Comparative effectiveness of Sumaq and Neem extract cream, Eniloconazole and glycerine iodine on dermatophytosis in Arabian horses: a randomized clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554365,Tropical animal health and production,2019 04 19,"Dermatophytosis is a contagious fungal disease among animal communities. The major concerns of dermatophytosis are cost of treatment, difficulty of control, and the public health consequences. The objective of the present study was to compare the clinical efficacy of Sumaq and Neem extract cream with that of traditional treatments, eniloconazole and glycerine iodine, on dermatophytosis in Arabian horses. For this purpose, 37 Arabian horses with dermatophytosis had been used. Fungal isolation and identification for each horse were carried out by standard microbiological procedures. Sumaq (Rhus coriaria Linn.) and Neem (Azadirachta indica) seed extracts were selected based on in vitro effectiveness. Horses were randomly allocated into four groups. The first group (n = 8) was treated with glycerine iodine 10% daily for 7 days. The second group (n = 10) was treated using eniloconazole 10% emulsified concentrate four times with 2 days interval. The third group (n = 11) was treated with Neem seeds extract (20% cream) daily for 10 days, and the fourth group (n = 8) was treated with Sumaq extract (5% cream) daily for 10 days. Clinical and mycological evaluations were assessed at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-treatment. The Sumaq and eniloconazole were more effective on clinical index score after 7 days of treatment followed by Neem seed 20% cream. At 28 days post-treatment, a complete healing was obtained by Sumaq 5% cream and eniloconazole (median clinical sum score = zero) followed by Neem (median clinical sum score = 1.5). Moreover, Dermatophytes spp. was isolated only from two horses, one from Neem group and the other from glycerin iodine group. The present results indicate that Sumaq 5% and Neem seed extract are effective alternative treatment for dermatophytosis in Arabian horses.",Neurocognitive and functional outcomes at 5 years of age after renal transplant in early childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554364,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2019 03 29,"Clinicians often use information about developmental outcomes in decision-making around offering complex, life-saving interventions in children such as dialysis and renal transplant.

These functions are done primarily through the nephron, which relies on strict regulation of various metabolic pathways. Any deviations in the metabolic profile of nephrons or their precursor cells called nephron progenitors can lead to renal pathologies and abnormal development. Metabolism encompasses the mechanisms by which cells generate intermediate molecules and energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required by all cells and is mainly generated through glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. During kidney development, self-renewing or proliferating cells rely on glycolysis to a greater extent than the other metabolic pathways to supply energy, replenish reducing equivalents, and generate nucleotides. However, terminally differentiated cell types rely more heavily on fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation performed in the mitochondria to fulfill energy requirements. Further, the mature nephron is comprised of distinct segments and each segment utilizes metabolic pathways to varying degrees depending on the specific function. This review will focus on major metabolic processes performed by the nephron during health and disease.",Functional roles of Grainyhead-like transcription factors in renal development and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554362,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2018 12 16,"Proper renal function relies on the tightly regulated development of nephrons and collecting ducts. This process, known as tubulogenesis, involves dynamic cellular and molecular changes that instruct cells to form highly organized tubes of epithelial cells which compartmentalize the renal interstitium and tubular lumen via assembly of a selective barrier. The integrity and diversity of the various renal epithelia is achieved via formation of intercellular protein complexes along the apical-basal axis of the epithelial cells. In recent years, the evolutionarily conserved family of Grainyhead-like (GRHL) transcription factors which encompasses three mammalian family members (Grainyhead-like 1, 2, 3) has emerged as a group of critical regulators for organ development, epithelial differentiation, and barrier formation. Evidence from transgenic animal models supports the presence of Grainyhead-like-dependent transcriptional mechanisms that promote formation and maintenance of epithelial barriers in the kidney. In this review, we highlight different Grhl-dependent mechanisms that modulate epithelial differentiation in the kidney. Additionally, we discuss how disruptions in these mechanisms result in impaired renal function later in life."

We report a case of sudden infant death because of clinically undiagnosed VSD in a seemingly healthy 16-day-old boy. Although a cardiac murmur was auscultated at birth, detailed clinical examination was not performed. Medicolegal autopsy revealed a perimembranous large VSD with a single coronary artery. The infant was diagnosed to have had HF based on the increased weight of the heart and extremely high serum brain natriuretic peptide levels. Histological examination revealed the degeneration of cardiomyocytes. The large VSD was thought to be the major cause of HF, although single coronary artery-associated cardiomyopathy might have also partially contributed to it. The decline in the physiological neonatal pulmonary resistance, which occurs over the first 1 or 2 weeks following birth, led to the acute progression of HF, resulting in circulatory collapse and sudden death. Detailed clinical examination should be performed for neonates with cardiac murmur to prevent avoidable death.",Voltammetric determination of levofloxacin using silver nanoparticles deposited on a thin nickel oxide porous film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554349,Mikrochimica acta,2019 01 25,"The authors describe a simplified chemical precipitation method and silver mirror reaction to synthesize a nanocomposite consiting of silver nanoparticles on a thin and porous nickel oxide film.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether two polymorphisms in IL12B gene, rs17860508 and rs3212227, are associated with RRMS, and to define their function effect on serum level of IL-12p40 and IL-23 and degree of disability in RRMS cases. In total 156 Bulgarian patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale score ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 in remission of the disease and 379 controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-based methods. The IL-12p40 and IL-23 serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We have found substantially higher IL-12p40 and IL-23 serum levels in cases than in controls (p < 0.01) in a sex-dependent manner. Women with RRMS had significantly higher IL-12р40 and IL-23 than men. Gender-stratified association analyses showed a significant impact of rs3212227 polymorphism on RRMS susceptibility in men. The carriers of rs3212227*CC-genotype (OR 3.390, 95% CI 1.007-11.545, p = 0.023) and haplotype rs17860508*2-allele/rs3212227*C-allele (OR 3.740; 95% CI 1.36-10.32, p = 0.007), showed higher risk of RRMS in men, in contrast to women. In women, both IL12B polymorphisms influencing the course, rather than genetic predisposition of RRMS. The rs17860508*22-genotype was associated with significantly lower disability (OR 0.208; 95% CI 0.055-0.725; pc = 0.01) and lower IL-23 serum levels (p = 0.0345), while rs3212227*AA-genotype was associated with early onset of the disease (OR 2.368; 95% CI 1.007-5.608; p = 0.03). Our results suggest that sex-specific effects of IL12B polymorphisms, rs17860508 and rs3212227, on genetic predisposition and disease course of RRMS, is probably mediated by their gender-dependent functional effect on IL-12p40-containing cytokines.",Autism in India: a case-control study to understand the association between socio-economic and environmental risk factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554347,Acta neurologica Belgica,2018 12 16,"Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the cause of autism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of socioeconomic, environmental, pregnancy and newborn-related risk factors among children with autism spectrum disorders. This was a population-based case-control study. The study included 55 children with autism spectrum disorder and 55 age and sex matched typically developing normal children (TD) between 3 and 12 years. Several socio-economic factors, environmental factors, pregnancy related, natal, post-natal factors and the first noticed signs by the parents were analyzed. Chi-square test was used to compare nominal variables. For multivariate analysis, forward stepwise logistic regression model was employed to examine the association between autism and the chances that the child develops ASD to assess the odds ratios. Male predominance was observed in the study. Logistic regression model showed statistical significance of the following factors: paternal age greater than 40 years, family history of autism, nutrition during pregnancy, mode of labor, fetal hypoxia, NICU stay and history of breast feeding. In this epidemiological study of autism in Coimbatore city, we found correlation between several environmental factors during fetal development and can be transmitted to succeeding generations, causing atypical behavior phenotypes. The exact exposure magnitude, exposure time in relation to vital developmental periods need to be studied to understand the influence of socioeconomic and environmental factors, which can be improved to prevent ASD-related challenges.",Skeletal fragility: an emerging complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554346,Endocrine,2019 02 22,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an emerging cause of skeletal fragility.

In order to cope with the increasingly serious issues related to the ecological environment and poverty alleviation, the Government of Yunnan in Southwest China launched a large-scale afforestation campaign (plantation forestry) on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which is the main source of several major river systems in Southeast Asia. In this study, we use GIS to investigate the impacts of a large-scale afforestation on the water storage balance of Southeast Asia. Results show an expansion of the arid zone in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in recent years, and runoff from rivers has decreased year after year. In contrast to natural forests, planted forests are a characteristic of more water shortages, less rainfall, and higher evapotranspiration rates. Moreover, planted forests may exacerbate conflicts between humans and nature over water resources. Additionally, with respect to downstream populations affected by the government's afforestation policy, China has bore the brunt of the resultant water scarcity predicament (approximately 52.29%), followed by Vietnam (26.39%), Laos (6.78%), Cambodia (6.16%), Thailand (4.42%), and Myanmar (3.96%). To alleviate this problem and the potential crises that may result from it, the Government of China should change its policy from its focus on afforestation to promoting natural vegetation conservation practices.",Renoprotective effects of the novel prostaglandin EP4 receptor-selective antagonist ASP7657 in 5/6 nephrectomized chronic kidney disease rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554341,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Prostaglandins (PGs) are important lipid mediators of numerous physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in the kidney. PGE2, the most abundant renal PG, plays a major role in renal physiology, including renin release and glomerular hemodynamics. We investigated the renoprotective properties of the novel PGE2 EP4 receptor-selective antagonist ASP7657 in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, a chronic kidney disease (CKD) model. Eight weeks of repeated administration of ASP7657 (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) dose-dependently and significantly reduced urinary protein excretion and attenuated the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage, including fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, without affecting blood pressure. Additionally, ASP7657 tended to have beneficial effects on renal function, as indicated by the decrease in plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels and attenuation of the decline in creatinine clearance (Ccr). The angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan (10 mg/kg) also showed these renoprotective effects while significantly reducing blood pressure. ASP7657 dose-dependently and significantly reduced the EP4 receptor agonist-induced increase in plasma renin activity, as assessed by angiotensin I release in normal rats. Additionally, ASP7657 attenuated hyperfiltration assessed by Ccr without changing the renal blood flow or blood pressure in diabetic rats. These results suggest that ASP7657 suppresses the progression of chronic renal failure by modulating renin release and improving renal hemodynamics, and may therefore be a promising therapeutic option for inhibiting the progression of CKD.","Elucidating the beneficial effects of melphalan, adriamycin, and corticoids in combination with bortezomib against multiple myeloma in vitro.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554340,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Combining bortezomib with other anti-cancer drugs or glucocorticoids is more efficient in multiple myeloma than bortezomib alone. However, the molecular mechanism of this beneficial effect is largely unknown. To investigate the effects of these compounds on bortezomib's anti-proliferative potency and its intracellular accumulation and potency to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like proteasomal subunit, seven myeloma cell lines were investigated after exposure to bortezomib alone or either combined with adriamycin plus dexamethasone (PAD regimen) or melphalan plus prednisolone (VMP regimen), respectively. PAD or VMP combinations did not alter cellular bortezomib uptake. However, PAD and VMP regimens increased bortezomib's chymotrypsin-like subunit inhibitory potency. This likely originates from indirect proteasome modulation, because adriamycin, dexamethasone, melphalan, or prednisolone did not inhibit this subunit when used alone. Strikingly, the anti-proliferative potency of bortezomib was not enhanced but slightly lowered in some cell lines when used in combinations. Adriamycin, dexamethasone, melphalan, or prednisolone can enhance bortezomib's chymotrypsin-like subunit inhibitory potency, likely by mechanisms indirectly influencing proteasome functionality."

However, little is known whether the model race and viewing perspective could affect women's body-viewing gaze behaviour and body perception. Here, we presented female body images of Caucasian, Asian and African avatars in a continuum of common dress sizes in full frontal, mid-profile and rear view, and asked young Caucasian women to rate the perceived body attractiveness and body size. Their body-viewing gaze distributions were then correlated with their behavioural responses, their own body composition and body satisfaction. Our analysis revealed a clear in-group favouritism, in which Caucasian women tended to rate Caucasian avatars more attractive and slimmer than Asian and African avatars. Their body-viewing gaze patterns, on the other hand, were not affected by avatar race but were modulated by viewing perspectives. The frontal-view body (especially upper-body and waist-hip regions) attracted the highest proportion of viewing time, followed by the mid-profile view and then the rear-view body. Furthermore, our participants' own body composition and satisfaction level did not affect their judgement of other women's body attractiveness and body size, but could influence their gaze allocation at local body features. It seems that both body perception and body-viewing gaze behaviour are subject to group and individual biases.",Association Between Citrus Flushing Cycles and Asian Citrus Psyllid Demography in Huanglongbing-Free Area in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554328,Neotropical entomology,2019 06 10,"Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), named as Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), is the vector of the bacterium associated with huanglongbing (HLB), the most destructive citrus disease. The use of citrus flushing and ACP monitoring tools is essential for the knowledge of the occurrence pattern of cycles of both and for the improvement of the ACP management. During 3 years, 20 branches from 20 trees were evaluated for vegetative flushing, ACP abundance, and occupation in tree and branches in a Brazilian citrus area free for HLB. The obtained data was investigated through spectral and co-spectral analyses. Four to 12 flush shoot cycles occurred per year, which were similar to abundance and occupation cycles of ACP, with an apparent synchronization between these variables. In general, there was a difference from 14 to 19 days between flushing and ACP peaks, with an occurrence of the flushing peaks before the ACP peaks. Results will provide useful information to citrus growers and agricultural defense agencies to apply a suitable and targeted ACP management, which will avoid or delay the disease entrance into still free HLB areas. In addition, the modeling of occupation and abundance cycles of vectors as applied in this study may be useful for other pathosystems which insect vectors are associated or even in the intrusion monitoring programs.",Deep sequencing salivary proteins for periodontitis using proteomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554327,Clinical oral investigations,2019 01 14,Saliva is a bodily fluid transuded from gingival crevice fluid and blood and contains many proteins.

In this study, we analyzed the microbiota in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), mucosa, and feces in cecum of the PRRSV-challenged pigs using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform, to investigate the role of microbiota in the pathogenesis and development of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Quantitative insights into microbial ecology analyses indicated that the dominant bacterial groups in the lung from the PRRSV-challenged pigs were Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma hyorhinis, with a relative abundance of 35-48% and 27-41%, respectively. Our results were consistent with the clinical observation that the PRRSV-infected pigs are always co-infected with other bacteria, such as Haemophilus and Mycoplasma. On the other hand, Campylobacter and Clostridium became the two most abundant bacteria in the mucosal and luminal microbiota of the cecum of the PRRSV-challenged pigs, and the relative abundance was four times higher than that in the healthy pigs. This suggested that Campylobacter and Clostridium might be associated with the pathogenesis of diarrhea in PRRS. Linear discriminant analysis effect size reveals significant microbial dysbiosis of BAL, mucosa, and feces in cecum of the PRRSV-challenged pigs. We have identified a structural imbalance of the microbiota, characterized by a reduced diversity of microbiota and abundance alterations of certain bacteria in the PRRSV-challenged pigs. The observed microbiota dysbiosis in this study provides insight into the roles of the microbiota in the complications of the PRRSV infection.","Residential Mobility and Flourishing Among United States School-Age Children, 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554322,Maternal and child health journal,2019 06 13,"Objectives To investigate the association of residential mobility with flourishing among school-age children. Methods Data from the 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health were used to examine parent/caregiver-reported information on flourishing and residential mobility for children age 6-17 (N = 63,333). Residential mobility was the number of times the child moved categorized as: none, 1-2, and 3+. Children who were reported to show interest/curiosity, finish tasks, stay calm/in control, care about doing well in school, and do all homework were coded as flourishing. Sex-specific multivariable models were used to model the relative risk of mobility on flourishing. Interactions of mobility with age and poverty were tested. Results Among US school-age children, 22% had no moves, 39% had 1-2 moves and 39% had 3+ moves in their lifetime. Nearly half (45%) were flourishing. Both boys and girls who moved 3+ times were less likely to flourish compared to children with no moves. Among poor boys moving 3+ times was associated with less flourishing (aRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71, 0.98) with no association for non-poor boy. Among girls the pattern was reversed (aRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81, 0.95 for non-poor girls and no association for poor girls). Conclusions for Practice Residential mobility may lead to lower rates of flourishing. The patterns, when stratified by age or poverty, are different for boys and girls.",Classification of the superior angle of the scapula and its correlation with the suprascapular notch: a study on 303 scapulas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554321,Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,2019 04 03,"The aims of this study had been to classify the superior angle of the scapula based on morphological features, and to investigate its correlation with the suprascapular notch.",Bacterial community activity and dynamics in the biofilm of an experimental hybrid wetland system treating greywater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554320,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 20,"The objectives of this study were to determine the biofilm microbial activity and bacterial community structure and successions in greywater treatment filters and to relate the treatment efficiency to the bacterial community parameters. This 10-month study was performed in a newly established experimental system for domestic greywater treatment that consisted of three parallel vertical flow filters (VFs) followed by a horizontal flow filter (HF). A rapid increase in the bacterial community abundance occurred during the first 85 days of filter operations, followed by a short-term decrease and the stabilization of the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers at average levels of 1.2 × 109 and 3.2 × 108 copies/g dw in VFs and HF, respectively, until the end of the experiment. The dominant bacterial phyla and genera differed between the VFs and HF. The temporal variation in the bacterial community structure was primarily related to the species replacement, and it was significantly affected by the influent organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in the VFs and the ammonia and organic carbon in the HF filters. Despite the differences in the community structure and assembly mechanisms, the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community showed high congruence between the filter types. The treatment efficiency was related to the biofilm bacterial community diversity and abundance and the abundance of certain bacterial genera in the VF filters. The results suggest that the dominant pathway of nitrogen removal by greywater treatment VFs occurs via coupled heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification, while the contribution of aerobic denitrification is temporally variable in these filters."

Two new cases of this association are presented: two young adults, after using inhaled cocaine for a few years, were diagnosed with SSc. While a 24 year-old white female patient presented with diffuse SSc with multiple digital ulcers and scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), a 27 year-old male patient presented limited SSc with skin ulcers and digital gangrene, rapidly evolving to death due to massive intestinal hemorrhage. The authors performed a literature search and found only eight previously published cases. The clinical picture of these patients shows a predominance of vascular involvement, including multiple ulcers and SRC. There is no association with specific SSc autoantibodies.

Additionally, we review few other cases reported in the literature and the pathophysiological pathway of association between TMA and EGPA. We found that the mutual relationships between the inflammation triggered by vasculitis, the exacerbated complement activation, together with hypereosinophilia and endothelial damage seem to be the key in explaining the connection between both entities.

This study was conducted among a nonclinical sample of urban adolescents. Family functioning was assessed using five constructs adopted from the FACES-IV measure: 'family cohesion,' 'family flexibility' 'family communication,' 'family satisfaction,' and 'family balance.' Mood data was gathered using 13 items from a daily affect scale. Binge eating was assessed using two subscales from the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale-binge eating associated with 'embarrassment' (BE1), and binge eating associated with a sense of 'loss of control' (BE2). A multilevel modeling approach was employed to examine how associations between momentary moods and binge eating behaviors were moderated by family functioning. Results indicated that measures of negative affect, stress/frustration, and tiredness/boredom were significantly and positively associated with two measures of binge eating (BE1 and BE2; p values ≤ 0.05), and that multiple factors of family functioning buffered the positive predictive effects of moods on binge eating.

Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we cannot reject the hypothesis of a zero effect of the Medicaid eligibility expansion on an establishment's probability of offering ESI, the percentage of an establishment's workforce that takes up coverage, or the out-of-pocket premium for single coverage. We find some evidence suggestive of an inverse relationship between the expansion of Medicaid and the percentage of an establishment's workers eligible for ESI. In line with other employer- and individual-level studies of the effect of the ACA on employment-related outcomes, we find that employer provision of health insurance was largely unaffected by the Medicaid expansions."

These kinds of yeasts adapt to a biological aging condition by forming a biofilm known as ""flor velum"" and by changing from fermentative to oxidative metabolism. It has been reported that some functions such as increase of cell surface hydrophobicity or changes to lipid metabolism are enhanced when yeasts switch to biofilm lifestyle. Here, we attempt to reveal intracellular metabolites and protein molecular functions not documented before that are relevant in biofilm formation and in fermentation by an endometabolome and proteome screening. We report that at early stages of biofilm formation, flor yeasts accumulate mannose, trehalose, glycerol, oleic and stearic acids and synthesize high amounts of GTPases, glycosylases and lipoproteins. On the other hand, in early fermentation, flor yeasts rapidly consume glucose and phosphoric acid; and produce abundant proteins related to chromatin binding, transcription factors and methyl transferases.",Relative expression of stress-related genes during acclimation at low temperature of psychrotrophic Oenococcus oeni strains from Patagonian wine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554282,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 01 29,"In the present study, we evaluated the transcriptional response of four stress-related genes in three Oenococcus oeni strains after acclimation at two different temperatures. Gene expression was analyzed at time zero and after 48 h acclimation at 18 and 21 °C. After the acclimation period cells were inoculated into sterile Pinot noir wine and MLF was followed for 25 days to investigate if different acclimation temperatures could influence cell survival and MLF performance. L-malic acid consumption, population survival, and transcriptional behavior were different upon the acclimation temperature. rmlB and hsp20 genes presented a considerable increase in their expression level when strains were acclimated at 18 °C particularly in the psychrotrophic strains UNQOe19 and UNQOe4 isolated from Patagonian Pinot noir wine in comparison with the control strain (ATCC 27310). The increase in rmlB and hsp20 expression could account for the better survival of these strains in Pinot noir in comparison with the control strain. In addition, Patagonian populations acclimated at 18 °C were able to consume a higher percentage of L-malic acid in comparison with cells acclimated at 21 °C. Our results suggest that gene expression analysis of cells acclimated at sub-optimal temperatures could benefit the selection of psychrotrophic strains aimed as starter cultures.",Molecular dynamics simulation study of the effect of halothane on mixed DPPC/DPPE phospholipid membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554281,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 02 15,"We report results of a molecular dynamics simulation study of the effect of one general anesthetic, halothane, on some properties of mixed DPPC/DPPE phospholipid membranes. This is a suitable model for the study of simple, two-phospholipid membrane systems. From the simulation runs, we determined several membrane properties for five different molecular proportions of DPPC/DPPE. The effect of halothane on the studied membrane properties (area per lipid molecule, density of membrane, order parameter, etc.) was rather small. The distribution of halothane is not uniform through the bilayer thickness. Instead, there is a maximum of anesthetic concentration around 1.2 nm from the center of the membrane. The anesthetic molecule is located close to the phospholipid headgroups. The position of the halothane density maximum depends slightly on the DPPC/DPPE molar proportion. Snapshots taken over the plane of the membrane, as well as calculated two-dimensional radial distribution functions show that the anesthetic has no preference for either phospholipid (DPPC or DPPE). Our results indicate that this anesthetic molecule has only small effects on DPPC/DPPE mixed membranes. In addition, halothane displays no preferential location around DPPC or DPPE. This is probably due to the hydrophobic nature of halothane and to the fact that the chosen phospholipids have the same hydrophobic tails.",A star-shaped molecularly imprinted polymer derived from polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes with improved site accessibility and capacity for enantiomeric separation via capillary electrochromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554280,Mikrochimica acta,2019 01 16,"A star-shaped molecularly imprinted coating was prepared starting from octavinyl-modified polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (Ov-POSS). It possesses a relatively open structure and has good site accessibility and a larger capacity even at lower cross-linking. The imprinted coating was prepared from S-amlodipine (S-AML) as the template and analyte, Ov-POSS as the cross-linker, and methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. The preparation and chromatographic parameters were optimized, including ratio of template to functional monomer, apparent cross-linking degree, pH value, ACN content and salt concentration in the mobile phase. The best resolution in enantiomer separation by means of capillary electrochromatography reaches a value of 33. A good recognition ability (α = 2.60) was obtained and the column efficiency for S-AML was 54,000 plates m-1.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in strategies to remove these autoantibodies, particularly therapeutic peptides to neutralize β1-AA. Researchers are investigating the roles of cyclic peptides that mimic the structure of relevant epitopes on the β1-AR-ECII in a number of immune-mediated diseases. Here, we used a cyclic peptide, namely, RD808, to neutralize β1-AA, consequently alleviating β1-AA-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the protective effects of RD808 on the myocardium both in vitro and in vivo. RD808 was found to increase the survival rate of cardiomyocytes; furthermore, it decreased myocardial necrosis and apoptosis and improved the cardiac function of BalB/c mice in a β1-AA transfer model. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that myocardial autophagy was increased in the presence of RD808, which might contribute to its cardioprotective effects.

The worldwide epidemic of IHD urgently requires innovative treatments despite the significant advances in medical, interventional, and surgical therapies for this disease. Angiogenesis is a physiological and pathophysiological process that initiates vascular growth from pre-existing blood vessels in response to a lack of oxygen. This process occurs naturally over time and has encouraged researchers and clinicians to investigate the outcomes of accelerating or enhancing this angiogenic response as an alternative IHD therapy. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been shown to revascularize ischemic heart tissue, reduce the progression of tissue infarction, and evade the need for invasive surgical procedures or tissue/organ transplants. Several approaches, including the use of proteins, genes, stem/progenitor cells, and various combinations, have been employed to promote angiogenesis. While clinical trials for these approaches are ongoing, microvesicles and exosomes have recently been investigated as a cell-free approach to stimulate angiogenesis and may circumvent limitations of using viable cells. This review summarizes the approaches to accomplish therapeutic angiogenesis for IHD by highlighting the advances and challenges that addresses the applicability of a potential pro-angiogenic medicine.","Contribution of monoaminergic mechanisms to the discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) in Sprague-Dawley rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554256,Psychopharmacology,2019 06 16,"3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a popular synthetic cathinone reported to have a high abuse potential.

Recently, many authors reported the usefulness of liquid biopsy for the management of malignancy. Summary and Key Messages: The peripheral blood of cancer patients is a pool of cells and/or cell products derived from the primary or metastatic tumor, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating free (cf) DNA or RNA, and exosomes containing proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. CTCs are tumor cells that can be isolated from peripheral blood. Free circulating DNA with a tumor-specific mutation is called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Some patients who undergo curative surgery experience recurrent disease, which can be due to the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Thus, MRD indicates a high risk of relapse. Detection of ctDNA or CTC after surgery is a direct proof of MRD. Molecular volume (e.g., the number of CTCs and level of ctDNA) might reflect tumor burden, thus high molecular volume may indicate poor prognosis. The most notable application of liquid biopsy in cancer is to understand spatial and temporal heterogeneities. Heterogeneity is one of the causes of refractoriness and hampers prediction of chemotherapeutic effect. Emerging mutations that are not present in primary tumors but are found in their metastases can be detected in ctDNA. Some colorectal cancer patients with wild-type RAS do not respond to epidermal growth factor receptor blockade. In a subset of these patients, RAS mutation is detected in ctDNA, indicating heterogeneity.",The Short- and Long-Term Outcomes in Elderly Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Curative Surgery: A Case-Controlled Study with Propensity Score Matching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554221,European surgical research.

Whether all of these differentiation protocols produce qualitatively similar organoid cell types is not yet clear.

This demonstrates that the 2 protocols have much in common, and that neither produces kidney cells in a pure or comprehensive manner. Ureteric lineages appear to be absent, and organoids are contaminated with non-kidney cell types, including neurons and muscle cells. Based on the scRNA-seq datasets, a new differentiation protocol is devised to reduce non-kidney cell types, without adversely affecting organoid epithelial cells. Second Opinion: Together with published analyses of a third differentiation protocol, these findings suggest more commonalities than differences between kidney organoid platforms, and identify critical strategies for functional improvement of these cellular structures.",Effects of Early Initiation of Solid Versus Liquid Diet after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection on Quality of Life and Postoperative Outcomes: A Prospective Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554216,Digestion,2019 03 28,Feeding recommendations after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms are not established and based on clinical experience.,Diagnostic Accuracy of Digital Retinal Fundus Image Analysis in Detecting Diabetic Maculopathy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554213,Ophthalmic research,2019 03 28,Digital retinal imaging is the gold standard technique for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular oedema (DME) assessment during DR screening.,The Relationship between Weight Status and Depressive Symptoms in a Population Sample with Obesity: The Mediating Role of Appearance Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554212,Obesity facts,2019 03 28,Identifying the underlying pathways between obesity and depression and which individuals with obesity are at risk for developing depressive symptoms is important for improving prevention and treatment efforts.

This process disrupts the developmental competence. In the present study, we showed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was accumulated in oocytes during the postovulatory aging. ROS inhibited Sirt1 expression, and then increased oxidative stress by downregulating the intracellular Sirt1-FOXO3a-SOD2 axis. Moreover, the inhibited Sirt1 expression was related to the decreased mitochondrial function and the lowered level of autophagy. The mitochondrial-related apoptosis was increased by inhibiting the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, due to the accumulation of ROS in the postovulatory oocytes. The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) can reduce ROS by inhibiting the tricarboxylic acid (TAC) cycle. We found that PDK4 was significantly decreased in the postovulatory aging oocytes. Putrescine, one of the abundant biogenic amines, ameliorated the effects of ROS and therefore improved the quality of the postovulatory aging oocytes by increasing the expression of PDK4. When PDK4 was downregulated using siRNAs, the effects of putrescine were significantly receded.

The authors sought to investigate the occurrence of acute perioperative occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) with contralateral stroke following revascularization surgery, a rare complication that has not been previously reported.METHODSThis study is a retrospective review of a prospective database of a single surgeon's series of revascularization operations in patients with MMD. From 1991 to 2016, 1446 bypasses were performed in 905 patients, 89.6% of which involved direct anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery (STA) to a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Demographic, surgical, and radiographic data were collected prospectively in all treated patients.RESULTSSymptomatic contralateral hemispheric infarcts occurred during the postoperative period in 34 cases (2.4%). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in each of these patients. In 8 cases (0.6%), DSA during the immediate postoperative period revealed associated new occlusion of the contralateral ICA. In each of these cases, revascularization surgery involved direct anastomosis of the STA to an M4 branch of the MCA. Preoperative DSA revealed moderate (n = 1) or severe (n = 3) stenosis or occlusion (n = 4) of the ipsilateral ICA and mild (n = 2), moderate (n = 4), or severe (n = 2) stenosis of the contralateral ICA. The baseline Suzuki stage was 4 (n = 7) or 5 (n = 1). The collateral supply originated exclusively from the intracranial circulation in 4/8 patients (50%), and from both the intracranial and extracranial circulation in the remaining 50% of patients. Seven (88%) of 8 patients improved symptomatically during the acute postoperative period with induced hypertension. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge was worse than baseline in 7/8 patients (88%), whereas 1 patient had only minor deficits that did not affect the mRS score. At the 3-year follow-up, 3/8 patients (38%) were at their baseline mRS score or better, 1 patient had significant disability compared with preoperatively, 2 patients had died, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Three-year follow-up is not yet available in 1 patient.CONCLUSIONSAcute occlusion of the ICA on the contralateral side from an STA-MCA bypass is a rare, but potentially serious, complication of revascularization surgery for MMD. It highlights the importance of the hemodynamic interrelationships that exist between the two hemispheres, a concept that has been previously underappreciated. Induced hypertension during the acute period may provide adequate cerebral blood flow via developing collateral vessels, and good outcomes may be achieved with aggressive supportive management and expedited contralateral revascularization.",Prospective clinical validation of a meningioma consistency grading scheme: association with surgical outcomes and extent of tumor resection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554187,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 03 08,"OBJECTIVEThe present study aims to assess the clinical utility of a previously validated intraoperative meningioma consistency grading scale and its association with extent of resection (EOR) and various surgical outcomes.METHODSThe previously validated grading system was prospectively assessed in 127 consecutive patients undergoing open craniotomy for meningioma by multiple neurosurgeons at two high-volume academic hospitals from 2013 to 2016. Consistency grading scores ranging from 1 (soft) to 5 (firm/calcified) were retrospectively analyzed to test for association with surgical outcomes and EOR, categorized as gross-total resection (GTR) or subtotal resection, defined by postoperative MRI.RESULTSOne hundred twenty-seven patients were included in the analysis with a tumor consistency distribution as follows: grade 1, 3.1%; grade 2, 14.2%; grade 3, 44.1%; grade 4, 32.3%; and grade 5, 6.3%. The mean tumor diameter was 3.6 ± 1.7 cm. Tumor consistency grades were grouped into soft (grades 1 and 2), average (grade 3), and firm (grades 4 and 5) groups for statistical analysis with distributions of 17.3%, 44.1%, and 38.6%, respectively. There was no association between meningioma consistency and maximal tumor diameter, or location. Mean duration of surgery was longer for tumors with higher consistency: grades 1 and 2, 186 minutes; grade 3, 219 minutes; and grades 4 and 5, 299 minutes (p = 0.000028). There was a trend toward higher perioperative complication rates for tumors of increased consistency: grades 1 and 2, 4.5%; grade 3, 7.0%; and grades 4 and 5, 20.8% (p = 0.047). The proportion of GTR for each consistency group was as follows: grades 1 and 2, 77%; grade 3, 68%; and grades 4 and 5, 43% (p = 0.0062).CONCLUSIONSIn addition to other important meningioma characteristics such as invasiveness, tumor consistency is a key determinant of surgical outcomes, including operative duration and EOR. Future studies predicting tumor consistency based on preoperative neuroimaging will help considerably with preoperative planning for meningiomas.",Seizure control after radiosurgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a 25-year experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554186,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 03 08,"OBJECTIVESeizures are the second-most common presenting symptom in patients with lobar arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, few studies have assessed the long-term effect of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on seizure control. The authors of this study assess the outcome of SRS for these patients to identify prognostic factors associated with seizure control.METHODSPatients with AVM who presented with a history of seizure and underwent SRS at the authors' institution between 1987 and 2012 were retrospectively assessed. The total cohort included 155 patients with a mean follow-up of 86 months (range 6-295 months). Primary outcomes assessed were seizure frequency, antiepileptic drug regimen, and seizure freedom for 6 months prior to last follow-up.RESULTSSeizure-free status was achieved in 108 patients (70%), with an additional 23 patients (15%) reporting improved seizure frequency as compared to their pre-SRS status. The median time to seizure-free status was estimated to be 12 months (95% CI 0-27 months) as evaluated via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The mean seizure frequency prior to SRS was 14.2 (95% CI 5.4-23.1) episodes per year. Although not all patients tried, the proportion of patients successfully weaned off all antiepileptic drugs was 18% (28/155 patients). On multivariate logistic regression, focal impaired awareness seizure type (also known as complex partial seizures) and superficial venous drainage were significantly associated with a decreased odds ratio for seizure-free status at last follow-up (OR 0.37 [95% CI 0.15-0.92] for focal impaired awareness seizures; OR 0.36 [95% CI 0.16-0.81] for superficial venous drainage). The effects of superficial venous drainage on seizure outcome were nonsignificant when excluding patients with < 2 years of follow-up. AVM obliteration did not correlate with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.202, chi-square test).CONCLUSIONSThis study suggests that SRS improves long-term seizure control and increases the likelihood of being medication free, independently of AVM obliteration. Patients with focal impaired awareness seizures were less likely to obtain long-term seizure relief.",Topical vancomycin for neurosurgery wound prophylaxis: an interim report of a randomized clinical trial on drug safety in a diverse neurosurgical population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554184,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 03 08,"OBJECTIVEPostoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) in neurosurgical patients carry a significant risk of increased morbidity and mortality. With SSIs accounting for approximately 20% of nosocomial infections and costing approximately $1.6 billion USD annually, there is a need for additional prophylaxis to improve current standards of care. Topical vancomycin is increasingly utilized in instrumented spinal and cardiothoracic procedures, where it has been shown to reduce the risk of SSIs. A randomized controlled trial assessing its efficacy in the general neurosurgical population is currently underway. Here, the authors report their initial impressions of topical vancomycin safety among patients enrolled during the 1st year of the trial.METHODSThis prospective, multicenter, patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial will enroll 2632 patients over 5 years. Here, the authors report the incidence of adverse events, the degree of systemic vancomycin absorption in treated patients, and pattern changes of antibiotic-resistant profiles of Staphylococcus aureus flora among patients enrolled during the 1st year.RESULTSThe topical vancomycin treatment group comprised 257 patients (514 total enrolled patients), of whom 2 exhibited weakly positive serum levels of vancomycin (> 3.0 mg/dl). S. aureus was detected preoperatively in the anterior nares of 35 (18.1%) patients and the skin near the surgical site of 9 (4.7%). Colonization in the nares remained for many patients (71.4%) through postoperative day 30. The authors found a significant association between preoperative S. aureus colonization and postoperative colonization. Seven methicillin-resistant isolates were detected among 6 different patients. Two isolates were detected preoperatively, and 5 were de novo postoperative colonization. No adverse responses to treatment have been reported to date.CONCLUSIONSThe authors' data indicate that the use of topical vancomycin is safe with no significant adverse effects and minimal systemic absorption, and no development of vancomycin-resistant microorganisms.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT02284126 (clinicaltrials.gov).",Incidence of the initiation of comfort care immediately following emergent neurosurgical and endovascular procedures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554183,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 03 08,"OBJECTIVEIt is unknown what proportion of patients who undergo emergent neurosurgical procedures initiate comfort care (CC) measures shortly after the operation. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the proportion and predictive factors of patients who initiated CC measures within the same hospital admission after undergoing emergent neurosurgery.METHODSThis retrospective cohort study included all adult patients who underwent emergent neurosurgical and endovascular procedures at a single center between 2009 and 2014. Primary and secondary outcomes were initiation of CC measures during the initial hospitalization and determination of predictive factors, respectively.RESULTSOf the 1295 operations, comfort care was initiated in 111 (8.6%) during the initial admission. On average, CC was initiated 9.3 ± 10.0 days postoperatively. One-third of the patients switched to CC within 3 days. In multivariate analysis, patients > 70 years of age were significantly more likely to undergo CC than those < 50 years (70-79 years, p = 0.004; > 80 years, p = 0.0001). Two-thirds of CC patients had been admitted with a cerebrovascular pathology (p < 0.001). Admission diagnosis of cerebrovascular pathology was a significant predictor of initiating CC (p < 0.0001). A high Hunt and Hess grade of IV or V in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly associated with initiation of CC compared to a low grade (27.1% vs 2.9%, p < 0.001). Surgery starting between 15:01 and 06:59 hours had a 1.70 times greater odds of initiating CC compared to surgery between 07:00 and 15:00.CONCLUSIONSInitiation of CC after emergent neurosurgical and endovascular procedures is relatively common, particularly when an elderly patient presents with a cerebrovascular pathology after typical operating hours.",Functional connectivity analysis and prediction of cognitive change after carotid artery stenting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554182,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 04 02,"OBJECTIVEThe neurocognitive course of patients who have undergone cerebral revascularization has been the subject of many studies, and the reported effects of carotid artery stenting (CAS) on cognitive function have varied from study to study. The authors hypothesized that cognitive amelioration after CAS is associated with alteration of the default mode network (DMN) connectivity, and they investigated the correlation between functional connectivity (FC) of the DMN and post-CAS changes in cognitive function in order to find a clinical marker that can be used to predict the effect of cerebral revascularization on patients' cognitive function in this preliminary exploratory study.METHODSThe authors examined post-CAS changes in cognitive function in relation to FC in patients treated for unilateral carotid artery stenosis. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was performed with a 3-T scanner before and 6 months after CAS in 8 patients. Neuropsychological tests (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised) were administered to each patient before and 6 months after CAS. The DMN was mapped for each patient through independent component analysis of the rs-fMR images, and the correlation between FC of the DMN and post-CAS change in cognitive function was analyzed on a voxel level. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify preoperative factors associated with a post-CAS change in cognitive function.RESULTSPost-CAS cognitive function varied between patients and between categories of neuropsychological tests. Although there was no significant overall improvement in Working Memory scores after CAS, post-CAS Working Memory scores changed in negative correlation with changes in FC between the DMN and the precentral/superior frontal gyrus and between the DMN and the middle frontal gyrus. In addition, the preoperative FC between those areas correlated positively with the post-CAS improvement in working memory.CONCLUSIONSFC between the DMN and working memory-related areas is closely associated with improvement in working memory after CAS. Preoperative analysis of FC of the DMN may be useful for predicting postoperative improvement in the working memory of patients being treated for unilateral stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery.Clinical trial registration no.: UMIN000020045 (www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm).",Intraoperative near-infrared imaging with receptor-specific versus passive delivery of fluorescent agents in pituitary adenomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554181,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 03 08,"OBJECTIVEIntraoperative molecular imaging with tumor-targeted fluorescent dyes can enhance resection rates. In contrast to visible-light fluorophores (e.g., 5-aminolevulinic-acid), near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have increased photon tissue penetration and less contamination from tissue autofluorescence. The second-window ICG (SWIG) technique relies on passive accumulation of indocyanine green (ICG) in neoplastic tissues. OTL38, conversely, targets folate receptor overexpression in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. In this study, we compare the properties of these 2 modalities for NIR imaging of pituitary adenomas to better understand the potential for NIR imaging in neurosurgery.METHODSA total of 39 patients with pituitary adenomas were enrolled between June 2015 and January 2018 in 2, sequential, IRB-approved studies. Sixteen patients received systemic ICG infusions 24 hours prior to surgery, and another 23 patients received OTL38 infusions 2-3 hours prior to surgery. NIR fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR) was recorded during and after resection. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the 23 adenomas resected from patients who received OTL38 to assess expression of folate receptor-alpha (FRα).RESULTSAll 16 adenomas operated on after ICG administration demonstrated strong NIR fluorescence (mean SBR 4.1 ± 0.69 [SD]). There was no statistically significant difference between the 9 functioning and 7 nonfunctioning adenomas (p = 0.9). After administration of OTL38, the mean SBR was 1.7 ± 0.47 for functioning adenomas, 2.6 ± 0.91 for all nonfunctioning adenomas, and 3.2 ± 0.53 for the subset of FRα-overexpressing adenomas. Tissue identification with white light alone for all adenomas demonstrated 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity. SWIG demonstrated 100% sensitivity but only 29% specificity for both functioning and nonfunctioning adenomas. OTL38 was 75% sensitive and 100% specific for all nonfunctioning adenomas, but when assessment was limited to the 9 FRα-overexpressing adenomas, the sensitivity and specificity of OTL38 were both 100%.CONCLUSIONSIntraoperative imaging with NIR fluorophores demonstrates highly sensitive detection of pituitary adenomas. OTL38, a folate-receptor-targeted fluorophore, is highly specific for nonfunctioning adenomas but has no utility in functioning adenomas. SWIG, which relies on passive diffusion into neoplastic tissue, is applicable to both functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, but it is less specific than targeted fluorophores. Thus, targeted and nontargeted NIR fluorophores play important, yet distinct, roles in intraoperative imaging. Selectively and intelligently using either agent has the potential to greatly improve resection rates and outcomes for patients with intracranial tumors."

Although their role in ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and degradation of cell-surface proteins is extensively documented, the features of MARCH proteins and their substrates that drive the molecular recognition events leading to ubiquitin transfer remain poorly defined. In this study, we sought to determine the features of human MARCH9 that are required for regulating the surface levels of its substrate proteins. Consistent with previous studies of other MARCH proteins, we found that susceptibility to MARCH9 activity is encoded in the transmembrane (TM) domains of its substrates. Accordingly, substitutions at specific residues and motifs within MARCH9's TM domains resulted in varying degrees of functional impairment. Most notably, a single serine-to-alanine substitution in the first of its two TM domains rendered MARCH9 completely unable to alter the surface levels of two different substrates: the major histocompatibility class I molecule HLA-A2 and the T-cell co-receptor CD4. Solution NMR analysis of a MARCH9 fragment encompassing the two TM domains and extracellular connecting loop revealed that the residues contributing most to MARCH9 activity are located in the α-helical portions of TM1 and TM2 that are closest to the extracellular face of the lipid bilayer. This observation defines a key region required for substrate regulation. In summary, our biochemical and structural findings demonstrate that specific sequences in the α-helical MARCH9 TM domains make crucial contributions to its ability to down-regulate its protein substrates.","Increasing proportion of herpes simplex virus type 1 among women and men diagnosed with first-episode anogenital herpes: a retrospective observational study over 14 years in Melbourne, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554143,Sexually transmitted infections,2019 05 17,"Reports of rising herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genital infections relative to HSV-2 have been published up to 2006 in Australia.

One striking difference between subtypes is that the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is usually not mutated in HPV+ HNSCCs. However, p53 is inhibited by viral oncoprotein E6, leading to premature proteasomal degradation. We asked whether bortezomib (BZM), a clinically approved inhibitor of the proteasome, can functionally restore p53 and investigated in how far this will result in an enhanced radio- or chemosensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC cell lines. For all four HPV+ cell lines tested, BZM led to functional restoration of p53 and transactivation of downstream protein p21. In HPV+ cells, BZM also restored the radiation-induced p53/p21 transactivation. Consistently, in HPV+ cells, a restored G1 arrest as well as enhanced apoptosis were seen when BZM was given prior to irradiation (IR) or cisplatin (CDDP).

In this study cationic liposomes of cabazitaxel (CBX) and silibinin (SIL) were prepared with an aim to kill cancer cells and CSCs for prostate cancer. CBX act as cancer cell inhibitor and SIL as CSC inhibitor. Hyaluronic acid (HA), an endogenous anionic polysaccharide was coated on cationic liposomes for targeting CD44 receptors over expressed on CSCs. Liposomes were prepared by ethanol injection method with particle size below 100 nm and entrapment efficiency of more than 90% at 10% w/w drug loading. Liposomes were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Liposomes were evaluated for their anticancer action in androgen independent human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145). HA coated liposomes showed potential cytotoxicity over other groups with low IC50, significantly inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis. Synergistic cytotoxic effect was also observed with HA coated liposomes that resulted in colony formation inhibition and G2/M phase arrest. Proficient cytotoxicity against CD44+ cells (14.87 ± 0.41% in PC-3 and 33.95 ± 0.68% in DU-145 cells) indicated the efficiency of HA coated liposomes towards CSC targeting.

In this study, the protective effects and mechanisms of EVO on DSS-induced UC mice were investigated. The results indicated that treatment with EVO ameliorated DSS-induced UC mice body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, colonic pathological damage, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 was also significantly inhibited by EVO. Further mechanistic results showed that EVO restrained the inflammation by regulating NF-κB signal and NLRP3 inflammasome.

The anti-colon cancer properties of Manilkara zapota leaf water extract have yet to be investigated thus far. Therefore, our present study aimed to evaluate the ability to induce apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms of Manilkara zapota leaf water extract against human colorectal cancer (HT-29) cells. The cytotoxicity of Manilkara zapota leaf water extract was screened in different cancer cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) analyses. The morphological changes in HT-29 cell lines after exposure to Manilkara zapota leaf water extract were viewed under fluorescence and inverted light microscope. The apoptotic cell was measured by Annexin V-propidium iodide staining. The caspase-3 and -8 activities were assessed by colorimetric assay. Overall analyses revealed that treatment with Manilkara zapota leaf water extract for 72 h can inhibit the viability of HT-29 cells. Incubation with Manilkara zapota leaf water extract for 24, 48, and 72 h significantly increased (p < 0.05) the total apoptotic cells compared to the control. Treatment with 21, 42, and 84 μg/mL of Manilkara zapota leaf water extract for 72 h triggered both caspase-3 and -8 activities in a concentration-dependent pattern. We also found that the catalase level in the two treatment groups (21 and 42 μg/mL) was significantly elevated after 24 h incubation. Incubation with Manilkara zapota leaf water extract for 72 h triggered the transcriptional elevation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), AXIN1, and casein kinase 1 (CK1). The β-catenin mRNA levels were reduced accordingly when the concentration of the Manilkara zapota leaf water extract was increased. Our results suggested that Manilkara zapota leaf water extract offer great potential against colorectal cancer through modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, caspase-dependent pathway, and antioxidant enzyme."

With as little as the content of 0.25 cell injected, more than 24 cationic metabolites could be identified. A further improvement of sample preparation and/or the injection part is required in order to effectively analyze the compounds of interest in very low sample amounts by sheathless CE-MS. However, the results obtained so far clearly indicate the strong potential of the proposed method for metabolic profiling of limited sample amounts.","The effects of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on gene expression related to inflammation, insulin and lipid in patients with Parkinson's disease: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554092,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2018 12 24,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on gene expression related to inflammation, insulin and lipid in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD)."

At MCSs two organelles are connected via protein tethers that bring them in close proximity to facilitate metabolite exchange. In this review, we will focus on the MCSs connecting the ER and mitochondria, which have been implicated in phospholipid transport. While we already know the molecular identity of some tethers, we are still far from understanding the mechanisms underlying the phospholipid transport processes. In vitro studies suggest that some proteins in MCSs are capable of transporting lipids, however only at rates that do not meet the mitochondrial lipid demand. In vivo studies are even more puzzling as it appears that many redundant lipid transport routes, involving various lipid transport proteins and various MCSs, compensate for each other when necessary. Here, we will discuss the challenges in interpreting the data on lipid transport between ER and mitochondria from in vitro and in vivo experiments by highlighting some critical aspects that might be worth addressing in the future.",Characterization of CDOM in saline and freshwater lakes across China using spectroscopic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554078,Water research,2019 04 26,"Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a major component of DOM in waters, and plays a vital role in carbon cycling in inland waters. In this study, the light absorption and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEMs) of CDOM of 936 water samples collected in 2014-2017 from 234 lakes in five regions across China were examined to determine relationships between lake water sources (fresh versus saline) and their fluorescence/absorption characteristics. Results indicated significant differences regarding DOC concentration and aCDOM(254) between freshwater (6.68 mg C L-1, 19.55 m-1) and saline lakes (27.4 mg C L-1, 41.17 m-1). While humic-like (F5) and fulvic-like (F3) compounds contributed to CDOM fluorescence in all lake waters significantly, their contribution to total fluorescence intensity (FT) differed between saline and freshwater lakes. Significant negative relationships were also observed between lake altitude with either F5 (R2 = 0.63, N = 306) or FT (R2 = 0.64, N = 306), suggesting that the abundance of humic-like materials in CDOM tends to decrease with increased in lakes altitude. In high-altitude lakes, strong solar irradiance and UV exposure may have induced photo-oxidation reactions resulting in decreased abundance of humic-like substances and the formation of low molecular weight compounds. These findings have important implications regarding our understanding of C dynamics in lacustrine systems and the contribution of these ecosystems to the global C cycle.",Distinct microbially induced concrete corrosion at the tidal region of reinforced concrete sewers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554077,Water research,2019 04 26,"Microbially induced concrete corrosion (MICC) is a major deterioration affecting sewers worldwide. MICC is not uniform on sewer inner walls and often occurs at hot spots such as crown and tidal regions, which are critical to determine sewer service life. Especially, concrete corrosion in tidal regions is complicated due to the fluctuation of wastewater levels and the hydraulic scouring effects. The traditional methodology of corrosion monitoring also limits the study of the tidal corrosion. In this study, by using a combination of various advanced mineral analytical techniques and culture-independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the development of corrosion, the formation of corrosion products and the variation of microbial communities in tidal regions were investigated systematically. The physical-chemical characteristics in tidal regions varied with the distance from the wastewater surface. Above the wastewater, more severe corrosion was detected with a closer distance to wastewater, producing gypsum as the major corrosion products. The microbial succession in tidal regions occurred, with the coexistence of conventional autotrophic SOB and acidophilic heterotrophic bacteria initially, and shifting to the predominant colonization of Mycobacterium when pH reached around 1. The heterotrophic bacteria, i.e. Mycobacterium and Bacillus, were likely responsible for the observed corrosion due to the potential capability in generating sulfuric acid. The applications of advanced mineral and microbial analytical techniques were demonstrated effective in improving the understanding of concrete sewer corrosion.","""It's about bloody time"": Perceptions of people who use drugs regarding drug law reform.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554076,The International journal on drug policy,2019 02 18,"In Australia and elsewhere, the impacts of drug prohibition have sparked a critical dialogue about the state of current drug laws.

This death pathway is critical for controlling pathogenic infection. In invertebrates, however, due to the lack of adaptive immune response, it is still elusive whether Caspase 1-dependent cell death pathway exists. In this study, our data showed that Caspase 1-mediated cell death was activated by white spot syndrome virus to counteract virus infection. Caspase 1 had a higher expression in hemocytes and lymphoid-like organ in shrimp and WSSV infection was promoted upon the inhibition of Caspase 1 enzymatic activity. IL-1β-like protein was identified as the substrate of Caspase 1 and its interaction with Caspase 1 was validated ectopically and endogenously. Moreover, IL-1β like protein was released into extracellular contents under WSSV infection and Prophenoloxidase system was activated, resulting in the reduction of WSSV. Our data unraveled a previously unidentified mechanism through which Caspase 1-dependent cell death controlled virus infection in shrimp.",Adaptation of Rabensburg virus (RBGV) to vertebrate hosts by experimental evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554071,Virology,2019 03 20,"Rabensburg virus (RBGV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) has been classified as both a novel flavivirus and a unique lineage of West Nile virus (WNV). RBGV and WNV share approximately 76% sequence homology, yet RBGV does not replicate to high viral titers within vertebrate cell lines at physiological temperatures and has not been naturally isolated from a vertebrate host. These unique genetic and biological characteristics make RBGV a viable tool to identify the genetic determinants of flavivirus infectivity and fitness in vertebrate hosts. Using experimental evolution, we characterized mutated variants of RBGV that have altered capacity for infection and replication in various cell lines. Shared genetic differences within these variants were identified throughout the genome, with a large majority found in the NS3 and NS5 genes. Our results support a role for the replication complex in host utilization and suggest that epistatic interactions likely contribute to host-specific fitness and emergence.","Synthesis, characterization, DNA binding, topoisomerase I inhibition and antiproliferation activities of three new functionalized terpyridine platinum(II) complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554070,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 01 29,"Three new platinum(II) complexes with pendent morpholine were synthesized, namely complex 1 ([Pt(L)Cl]CF3SO3), complex 2 ([Pt(L)(NH3)](CF3SO3)2) and complex 3 ([Pt(L)(PPh3)](CF3SO3)2), where L = 4'-[4-(4-morpholinobutyloxy)phenyl]-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine and PPh3 = triphenylphosphine.

An evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity for both ligand and complexes was performed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay in three cancer cell lines and normal cells as the control, respectively. IC50 values of complexes 1-3 were lower than those exhibited for the reference drug cisplatin, and selectivity of these complexes were greater than cisplatin. Among them, complex 3 with a leaving group PPh3 was found to be the most efficacious complex against certain cell lines, especially for cisplatin-resistant A549cisR cells.

The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's is not yet fully understood, so existing research has focused on understanding the prominent features of the disease. These include amyloid plaques, which accumulate in the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease; impaired glucose metabolism; and neuronal cell death. Emerging evidence suggests that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet may help to mitigate the damage associated with these pathologies. The ketogenic diet could alleviate the effects of impaired glucose metabolism by providing ketones as a supplementary energy source. In addition, this diet may help to reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques while reversing amyloid β toxicity. Research has begun to identify early underlying mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease that could be targeted by new prevention strategies. Glycation of the ApoE protein leads to impaired transportation of important lipids, including cholesterol, to the brain, resulting in lipid deficiencies that could explain progression to the later pathologies of the disease. In this review, we hypothesize that the ketogenic diet could be an effective treatment and prevention for Alzheimer's disease, but both ketone production and carbohydrate restriction may be needed to achieve this."

To assess the influence of the water quality used for watering, we collected samples from soil, roots, leaves and beans from the legume plant Vicia faba (broad beans) in three agricultural peri-urban plots (Barcelona, NE Spain), irrigated with either groundwater, river water, or reclaimed water. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) sul1, tetM, qnrS1, blaCTX-M-32,blaOXA-58, mecA, and blaTEM were quantified by real-time PCR, along with 16S rDNA and intl1 sequences, as proxies for bacterial abundance and integron prevalence, respectively. Microbiome composition of all samples were analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Results show a gradient of bacterial species diversity and of ARG prevalence from highly diverse soil samples to microbially-poor beans and leaves, in which Rhizobiales essentially displaced all other groups, and that presented very small loads of ARGs and integron sequences. The data suggest that the microbiome and the associated resistome were likely influenced by agricultural practices and water quality, and that future irrigation water legal standards should consider the specific Physiology of the different crop plants.",Engineered nanomaterials inhibit Podosphaera pannosa infection on rose leaves by regulating phytohormones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554052,Environmental research,2019 02 03,"In the present study, we investigated the antifungal effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) against Podosphaera pannosa (P. pannosa), a fungal pathogen that causes powdery mildew on plants in the rose family. Four commercial ENMs, including multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs, were used to prepare 50 or 200 mg/L NP suspensions in deionized water. Rose leaves in water-agar plates were sprayed by different ENM suspensions mixed with P. pannosa conidia. After a 19-day standard infection test, the growth of P. pannosa on rose leaves was evaluated. All four ENMs inhibited infection by P. pannosa at the concentration 200 mg/L, whereas only CuO NPs decreased fungal growth at 50 mg/L. The phytohormone content of the leaves was measured across all treatments to investigate potential ENMs antifungal mechanisms. The results suggest that ENMs increased plant resistance to fungal infection by altering the content of endogenous hormones, particularly zeatin riboside (ZR).

Genetics,2019 03 14,"Compound repeats provide a testing ground for evaluating hypotheses on the causes and consequences of stutter. As compound repeats have two repeating motifs, each motif may produce stutter variants; thus as the repeat within the locus is compound, so is the resultant stutter. Further, the rates of stutter formation between these motifs may not be independent. This lack of independence may complicate modeling strategies, thus contributing to the challenges of mixture interpretation that rely on nucleotide sequence. This study evaluates compound stutter in two STR loci: D2S1338 and D12S391. The effects of flanking variation, as well as possible interactions between the two different uninterrupted stretches (US) and their respective stutter variants are assessed. Multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) was used to show that, as with simple repeats, the rate of stutter product formation of a particular repeating motif is not solely a function of the US of that repeat. The nucleotides adjacent to the repeating motif also appear to influence the rate of stutter formation of that motif, with those nucleotides sometimes including the other motif. MMLR was used to estimate the size of these effects and to construct an example of a two-dimensional (thus, a compound) stutter prediction. This example may merit further investigation in the application of massively parallel sequencing data to mixture interpretation and probabilistic genotyping.",Fibril bending stiffness of 3D collagen matrices instructs spreading and clustering of invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554026,Biomaterials,2018 12 28,"Extracellular matrix stiffening of breast tissues has been clinically correlated with malignant transformation and poor prognosis. An increase of collagen fibril diameter and lysyl-oxidase mediated crosslinking has been observed in advanced tumor stages. Many current reports suggest that the local mechanical properties of single fibrillar components dominantly regulate cancer cell behavior. Here, we demonstrate by an independent control of fibril diameter and intrafibrillar crosslinking of three-dimensional (3D) collagen matrices that fibril bending stiffness instructs cell behavior of invasive and non-invasive breast cancer cells. Two types of collagen matrices with fibril diameter of either 650 nm or 800 nm at a similar pore size of 10 μm were reconstituted and further modified with the zero-length crosslinker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) at concentrations of 0, 20, 100 and 500 mM. This approach yields two sets of collagen matrices with overlapping variation of matrix elasticity. With these matrices we could prove the common assumption that matrix elasticity of collagen networks is bending dominated with a linear dependence on fibril bending stiffness. We derive that the measured variation of matrix elasticity is directly correlated to the variation of fibril bending stiffness, being independently controlled either by fibril diameter or by intrafibrillar crosslinking. We use these defined matrices to demonstrate that the adjustment of fibril bending stiffness allows to instruct the behavior of two different breast cancer cell lines, invasive MDA-MB-231 (human breast carcinoma) and non-invasive MCF-7 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma). Invasiveness and spreading of invasive MDA-MB-231 cells as well as clustering of non-invasive MCF-7 cells is thereby investigated over a broad parameter range.

Direct conversion of somatic cells to other lineages thereby bypassing the intermediate pluripotent state has enormous applicability with respect to time requirement for conversion as well as safety issues. Among various approaches, chemical induced cell conversion is safe yet effective, and the use of small molecules has thus increased greatly in recent years in regenerative fields due to easy applicability, efficient scalability, and consistent reproducibility. Here we report a combination of small molecules capable of converting mouse fibroblasts into skeletal muscle-like cells (SMLCs) without requiring ectopic transcription factor expression. We observed that a combination of chemicals is necessary and sufficient to convert mouse fibroblast to SMLCs that have functional similarity to skeletal muscles. In addition, we also found that cytokines responsible for modulating several key signaling pathways enhance the maturation of converted SMLCs into multinucleated myocytes. Epigenetic analysis revealed that this conversion is accomplished by an epigenetic overhaul, followed by activation of key signal pathways responsible for activating skeletal specific loci. We further observed that human adipocyte-derived stem cells can be converted into SMLCs under conditions similar to that of fibroblasts. This study not only provides an example of chemical induced direct conversion, but also underlines the key signaling pathways that are needed to induce mesodermal lineages and muscles from pleotropic type cells.","Association between prenatal opioid exposure, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes at 5-8 months of age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554024,Early human development,2019 05 13,"While use of prescription opioids and medication assisted therapy (MAT) for opioid use disorder in pregnancy, as well as the incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) continue to rise, little is known about outcomes for children with NOWS beyond the newborn period.",Chemical and odor characterization of gas emissions released during composting of solid wastes and digestates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554023,Journal of environmental management,2019 01 26,"Hazardous and odorous gas emissions from composting and methanization plants are an issue of public concern.

A total of 60 chemical compounds belonging to 9 chemical families were identified and quantified. Terpenes, oxygenated compounds, and ammonia exhibited the largest cumulative mass emission. Odor emission rates (OUE h-1) were computed based on OC measurements and related to the initial amount of organic matter composted and the process time to provide odor emission factors (OEFs in OUE g-1OM0). The composting process of solid wastes accounted for OEFs ranging from 65 to 3089 OUE g-1OM0, whereas digestates composting showed a lower odor emission potential with OEF fluctuating from 8.6 to 30.5 OUE g-1OM0. Moreover, chemical concentrations of single compounds were weighted with their corresponding odor detection thresholds (ODTs) to yield odor activities values (OAVs) and odor contribution (POi, %). Volatile sulfur compounds were the main odorants (POi = 54-99%) regardless of the operational composting conditions or substrate treated. Notably, methanethiol was the leading odorant for 73% of the composting experiments."

B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 13,"Breviscapine (BVP) is a flavonoid compound with strong neuroprotective and anti-platelet aggregation effect. The objective of this study is to design novel BVP nanocrystals modified by natural panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) for enhancing dissolution and anti-platelet aggregation effect of BVP. BVP nanocrystals modified by PNS (BVP-NC/PNS) were firstly prepared by coupling homogenization technology and freeze-drying technology, and BVP nanocrystals modified by RH40 (BVP-NC/RH40) as reference for comparison. The morphology, crystals characterization, dissolution behavior and anti-platelet aggregation effect of BVP-NC/PNS was systemically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the PNS could effectively maintain stability of BVP-NC at suspensions state dependent of its surface activity and the electrostatic repulsion effect. Combination of PNS and trehalose could prevent the aggregation of BVP-NC/PNS during freeze-drying. The PXRD and DSC results demonstrated that the BVP crystal state in BVP-NC/PNS was not changed owing to PNS modification and homogenization treatment. And the freeze-dried BVP-NC could easily recover back to BVP-NS and significantly improve the dissolution of BVP. The AUC(0-∞) of the BVP-NC/PNS was 4.54 times as high as that of the coarse BVP, but not significantly different compared to that of BVP-NC/RH40 (p < 0.05). The anti-platelet aggregation results demonstrated that, BVP-NC/PNS group showed more effective inhibition on PAF-induced platelet aggregation compared with corresponding control groups, which might attribute to the enhanced bioavailability of BVP and synergistic effect of PNS with BVP. In conclusion, PNS could be used as an alternative stabilizer for preparation of BVP-NC, and BVP-NC modified by PNS is a promising formulation strategy for enhancing oral bioavailability and anti-platelet aggregation of BVP.",Understanding the kinetic mixing between liquid crystalline nanoparticles and agrochemical actives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554010,"Colloids and surfaces.

Optimization was carried out under response surface methodology-central composite design (RSM-CCD). Maximum percentage swelling of semi-IPN obtained was 496.57%. The concentrations of acrylamide, citric acid and ammonium persulphate used as monomer, cross-linker and initiator, respectively were found to be significant parameters.

However, the wide variability in the performance of different lots calls for parallel testing of multiple batches over extended periods of culture. Identification of the serum components that determine hematopoietic support would therefore save considerable time and effort and would help to standardize culture procedures. We report here that the ability of horse serum to support the self-renewal of multipotent murine hematopoietic progenitor FDCP-Mix cells is correlated to the concentration of specific fatty acid products of phospholipase A2 and more closely to the spectrum of eicosanoids generated by their further processing through cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Supportive sera have low levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and inflammatory eicosanoids. This links known markers of inflammation, infection and platelet activation to the ability of serum to maintain progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state, providing a means for prospective identification of suitable sera as well as quality control of the production process.",Recent preparative applications of redox enzymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554005,Current opinion in chemical biology,2019 04 12,"Redox enzymes offer many powerful transformations for the efficient industrial-scale synthesis of diverse chemicals desired by society.

While in some cases commercial enzymes can be employed directly on industrial scales, in other cases protein engineering is necessary to evolve an enzyme fit for non-biological substrates and conditions. Both approaches require the input of process engineering to properly balance the needs of the enzymatic chemistry with the requirements for an industrial process. A convergence of advances in enzyme discovery, protein engineering, and process engineering is expected to fuel a more rapid development of enzymatic synthetic processes and a wider adoption of biocatalysis on industrial scales.",Pathologic Laughter as an Early and Unusual Presenting Symptom of Petroclival Meningioma: a Case Report and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554003,World neurosurgery,2019 04 04,"Pathologic laughter is inappropriate, involuntary, and unmotivated laughter episodes that may or may not be associated with mirth or amusement.

Data scarcity and data unavailability are two major problems for computational approaches in the prediction of pathogen-host interactions. Developing a computational method to predict pathogen-host interactions with high accuracy, based on protein sequences alone, is of great importance because it can eliminate these problems. In this study, we propose a novel and robust sequence based feature extraction method, named Location Based Encoding, to predict pathogen-host interactions with machine learning based algorithms. In this context, we use Bacillus Anthracis and Yersinia Pestis data sets as the pathogen organisms and human proteins as the host model to compare our method with sequence based protein encoding methods, which are widely used in the literature, namely amino acid composition, amino acid pair, and conjoint triad. We use these encoding methods with decision trees (Random Forest, j48), statistical (Bayesian Networks, Naive Bayes), and instance based (kNN) classifiers to predict pathogen-host interactions. We conduct different experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. We obtain the best results among all the experiments with RF classifier in terms of F1, accuracy, MCC, and AUC."

BPA was detected at different levels in all liver samples from BPA-treated rats, although the exposure dose was the same in all treated animals, and also from control rats, highlighting the difficulties in eliminating external uncontrolled exposure and the need for internal biological monitoring. Fourier Transform Infrared analysis was applied to detect structural changes occurring in several molecules (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids) as well as the presence of specific metabolic processes. The spectroscopic analyses clearly demonstrated a different lipid composition more than an evident lipid accumulation and a glycogen accumulation decrease, revealing a metabolic disturbance in livers with a normal histological aspect.

Among a total of 1448 nodal sites examined, disease involvement was detected in 232 (16%) and 280 (19.3%) nodal areas by CECT and PET-CT, respectively (P < 0.01). Sensitivity of CECT in detecting disease involvement ranged from 0% for internal mammary region (7 cases) and Waldayer's ring (1 case) to 100% for mediastinum. A total of 248 extranodal areas were examined. CECT and PET-CT identified disease involvement in 19 (7.7%) and 25 (10.1%) extranodal areas, respectively (P = n.s). Compared to PET-CT, CECT detected a lower number of cases with bone and/or bone marrow involvement (P = 0.05), whereas no differences were detected at the level of lung. By contrast, CECT identified liver lesions in four patients versus three identified by PET-CT. In comparison to CECT, PET-CT upstaged 6 patients (9.7%) and downstaged 1 patient (1.6%). We showed that PET-CT modified treatment strategy in five (8.1%) cases not only as a result of stage advancement (2 cases) but also of a different prognostic stratification in patients with localized disease (3 cases), due to the better sensitivity in detecting nodal involvement.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to report changes in the histological appearance of the testicular morphology of neonatal and juvenile harbour porpoises during maturation, to identify stages of spermatogenesis in adult males and to detect seasonal modifications. The identification of these stages can be used to assess the developmental profile of gene expression during spermatogenesis and to identify defects in spermatogenesis arising in pathological conditions. Testes of adult male harbour porpoises from the North and Baltic Sea that became stranded or by-caught in the years 1998-2016 were histologically examined using Haematoxylin and Eosin - staining. The Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining was used for spermatogenic staging and the evaluation of the development of the acrosomic cap. For the identification of changes in testes morphology and morphometry during the course of the year, histological characteristics like germ cell associations and diameter of the convoluted seminiferous tubules were noted for each month. The analysis showed that in adult males more than one stage of spermatogenesis could be found per cross section of the convoluted seminiferous tubules similar to findings in men and some ape species. This rare phenomenon is called multi-stage-arrangement. In sexually active males from the peak breeding season (June and July) eight stages of spermatogenesis were identified and all stages occurred simultaneously, while during the low breeding season (August to May) only residual spermatogenesis or constituent germ cell populations were found. Missing germ cell generations were recorded in specimens from July to September. Our investigations provide a detailed staging of spermatogenesis and give new insight into the reproductive biology of male harbour porpoises. With these new basic parameters, indicators for endocrine disruptors can be developed in the future, aiming to detect how environmental factors could affect male fertility in wildlife.",Induction of spermiation using Ovaprim™ with topical gill method in the silver rasbora (Rasbora argyrotaenia).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553978,Theriogenology,2019 02 15,"The main obstacles on silver rasbora (Rasbora argyrotaenia) culture are having the limited number of broodstock and spawning depending on the season.

To determine whether PERK modulates the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, we investigated the effects of PERK knock-down on intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells in mice. Lgr5-EGFP knock-in mice were fed with lentivirus-PERK shRNA twice a day for three days. Isolated intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells were treated with lentivirus-PERK shRNA. The number of Lgr5-positive cells, the proliferation and apoptotic indices, several biomarkers for proliferation and differentiation, and Akt expression in intestinal stem cells were detected in vivo, in vitro and in two intestinal epithelial injury models caused by radiotherapy and sepsis. PERK knock-down could significantly diminish the number and proliferation of Lgr5-positive cells, induce the low expression of several proliferation markers and the high expression of several differentiation markers in Lgr5-positive cells, enhance the apoptotic Lgr5-positive cells, and reduce the Akt expression in intestinal Lgr5-positive stem cells. Similar results were observed in radiotherapy- and sepsis-induced intestinal injuries. Moreover, PERK inhibition markedly decreased the survival of mice in response to radiation and sepsis.

The pretreatment temperature, holding time, and pressure ranged from 150 to 240 °C, 5 to 30 min, and 476 to 3367 kPa, respectively. The highest solubilization improvement of ∼50% was achieved under the pretreatment condition of ""220 °C-10 min-2323 kPa"" corresponding to the SI value of 4.5. However, the maximum biomethane production yield of 280 mL/g TCODadded and biomethane production rate of 30 mL/g TCODadded were obtained under the less intense pretreatment conditions of ""190 °C-20 min-1247 kPa"" and ""170 °C-30 min-786 kPa"", respectively.",Effects of light-dark cycles on photosynthetic bacteria wastewater treatment and valuable substances production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553961,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) wastewater treatment is a novel method with great potential for resource recovery. Light-dark cycle is important for photosynthetic microorganisms, but its impact on PSB wastewater treatment is still unclear. This study evaluated the effects of four light-dark cycles on PSB biomass, valuable substances production, and pollutant removal. Results indicate that the highest biomass concentration was obtained under 24 h light/24 h dark cycle. The highest concentrations of protein and coenzyme Q10 were obtained under 3 h light/3h dark cycle (826.73 and 88.8 mg/g, respectively). Pigment production were stable under all light-dark cycles tested. Light-dark cycles had little effect on COD and TP removal, while 24 h light/24 h dark cycle resulted in the highest NH3-N removal. ATP and RuBisCO concentrations followed similar trends under different light-dark cycles. These results revealed that PSB could provide more biomass and valuable substances with given energy by changing light-dark cycles.",Fate of antibiotic resistance genes during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge: Role of solids retention times in different configurations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553960,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"In this study, three anaerobic digestion experiments were established to investigate the effects of solids retention times (SRT) on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge (CK), one-stage anaerobic digestion of microwave pretreatment sludge (MW) and two-stage anaerobic digestion of microwave pretreatment sludge (Acid stage and CH4 stage). The response of ARGs to the SRT varied significantly from ARG types and reactor configurations. Shorter SRT could avail the ARGs reduction for CK and two-stage digestion, while MW need longer SRT for the ARGs reduction. Concerning the variance of microbial community caused by reactor configurations, the role of SRT was limited. The partial redundancy analysis and structural equation models analysis indicated that the role of SRT on the ARGs fate could be attributed the most to the co-selection from heavy metals.","Occurrence, diversity, and persistence of antibiotic resistant enterococci in full-scale constructed wetlands treating urban wastewater in Sicily.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553958,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"Enterococci isolated from different sites of an urban wastewater treatment plant (consisting of three horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands) were investigated. One-hundred-thirty isolates were identified at species level and tested for resistance to eleven antibiotics, by microdilution method, and their clonal relatedness was established by SmaI-PFGE analysis. Results highlighted the persistence of enterococcal population in all effluents and the dominance of E. faecium species. A high incidence of antibiotic resistance against erythromycin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and ampicillin was observed, with 120 strains (93%) showing a multi-drug-resistance. Numerous pulso-types with a unique pattern were detected indicating a high diversity within enterococcal population. The recurrence of some pulso-types in different effluents was disclosed and, within the same pulso-types, different resistance patterns were observed. Comparing the MIC values of strains from inlet and outlet, different trends were observed, highlighting a certain variability among constructed wetlands in affecting the antibiotic resistance among enterococcal population.",How changes in molecular weight and PDI of a polymer in amorphous solid dispersions impact dissolution performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553957,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"Polymers functionally contribute to supersaturation and precipitation inhibition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in amorphous solid dispersions (ASD). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor physicochemical changes of the polymeric carrier caused by the manufacturing process. This is especially important when the material is exposed to heat and shear stress as in case of hot-melt extrusion (HME). This study evaluated the impact of HME process conditions on physical characteristics of poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl-acetate) 60:40 (PVP-VA64) which is a widely used polymer for HME. Focus was set on molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI), by means of absolute molar mass detection via multi-angle light scattering. The generation of a high Mw fraction together with a decrease of the average Mw was detected. In a next step, the influence of these changes on the dissolution behavior of ASD was evaluated. Different stress conditions were applied onto PVP-VA64 in placebo extrusions. The obtained stressed polymer samples were subsequently used to prepare verum ASD with ketoconazole by spray drying (SD). SD dispersions (SDD) of thermally stressed PVP-VA64 were compared to SDD prepared with bulk powder. Although there were only slight changes in Mw and PDI, they significantly impacted supersaturation and precipitation of the formulation.",Gelatin-based hydrogels as potential biomaterials for colonic delivery of oxaliplatin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553956,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"In present investigation, gelatin-based (AA-co-AMPS) hydrogels were prepared using N, N'-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a cross-linker and ammonium per sulfate (APS) as an initiator. The successful crosslinking and network formation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) investigations proved the higher thermal stability and successful entrapment of oxaliplatin (OXP) in the polymeric network. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the loss in crystallinity of the drug after loading in the hydrogel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the porous surface of the hydrogel. The newly formed hydrogels were responsive to change in pH. The swelling, drug loading and drug release was increased with increase in concentration of acrylic acid (AA) while gelatin and 2-acrylamido 2-methylpronesulfonic acid (AMPS) were found to act inversely. The in-vitro enzymatic degradation study showed that the blank hydrogels were more stable against the blank PBS than the collagenase and lysozyme. MTT-assay proved that the blank hydrogels were cyto-compatible while free OXP as well as OXP-loaded hydrogels showed dose dependent controlled cytotoxicity against Vero, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines. The preliminary safety evaluation and oral tolerability showed that the hydrogel suspension was biocompatible and well tolerable upto 4000 mg/kg of body weight without causing any hematological or histopathological changes in rabbits.",Self-implanted tiny needles as alternative to traditional parenteral administrations for controlled transdermal drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553955,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"Controlled drug-delivery systems have potential as substitutes for traditional medication systems due to the advantages in safety, efficacy, and patient compliance that these long-acting dosage forms provide. In this context, the present study focus on the development of self-implanted hyaluronic acid (HA) tiny needles that encapsulate ivermectin (IVM)-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles for controlled transdermal IVM release to treat parasitic diseases. The fabricated tiny needles involved matching portable applicator have potentially able for self-administration by patients without intense pain or complexity of current controlled-release devices. The biodegradable IVM-loaded PLGA microparticles were prepared and encapsulated within the tip of dissolving HA tiny needles to achieve high delivery efficiency. The drug loading of tiny needles might be controlled by varying the repeat time of filling or pressing processes. In-vitro tests showed that the tiny needles have sufficient mechanical strength to be inserted into skin within seconds and, next rapidly dissolved to release the loaded drug carriers into subcutaneous tissues for intradermal sustained IVM release. With the in-vivo test in rats, the insertion site recovered barrier property within 3 h. In comparison to traditional hypodermic injection or implantation of controlled-release systems, the proposed polymer tiny needles can be considered as a promising device for controlled transdermal drug delivery."

The United States has seen an increase in the number of adult daily cannabis users and in the number of adults diagnosed with cannabis use disorder. However, little work has examined patterns of use or unique subgroups of adult cannabis users, which may be useful in developing targeted treatment interventions for problematic cannabis users. Therefore, the current study used latent profile analysis to identify whether cannabis users can be categorized across distinct subgroups of adult users.",Influence of cognitive stance and physical perspective on subjective and autonomic reactivity to observed pain and pleasure: An immersive virtual reality study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553938,Consciousness and cognition,2018 12 31,"Observing others' pain may induce a reaction called personal distress that may be influenced by top-down (imagine self or other in pain, i.e., self- vs other-oriented stance) and bottom-up (physical perspective of those who suffer, i.e., first vs third person perspective- 1PP vs 3PP) processes. The different contributions of these processes have not been teased apart. By capitalizing on the power of Immersive Virtual Reality, we explored how behavioural (subjective ratings) and physiological reactivity (skin conductance reactivity, SCR) to pain and pleasure delivered to an avatar was influenced by Cognitive stance and Physical perspective. Taking an Other-Oriented stance leads to attributing higher congruent valence (i.e. pain rated as unpleasant and pleasure as pleasant) and intensity to the stimuli and induces reduced SCR. Ownership over the virtual limb was maximal in 1PP where physiological reactivity to the stimuli was comparable. Our results highlight different components underpinning reactivity to pain and pleasure.",Exposure to tobacco smoke during the early postnatal period modifies receptors and enzymes of the endocannabinoid system in the brainstem and striatum in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553937,Toxicology letters,2019 02 26,"Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure during brain development has been associated with several disorders, such as depression, anxiety, sudden infant death syndrome, and the predisposition to addiction. The endocannabinoid system plays an essential role in neuronal development. We investigated the effects of early postnatal ETS exposure on the endocannabinoid system in different brain regions. C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to ETS that was generated from 3R4F cigarettes from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P14. Receptors and enzymes of the endocannabinoid system were assessed in infancy, adolescence, and adulthood by Western blot. In the brainstem, ETS exposure decreased cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor, CB2 receptor, N-arachidonoyl phosphatidyl ethanol-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), and fatty acid amino hydrolase (FAAH) levels and increased in diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) levels during infancy and decreased CB2 and FAAH levels during adulthood. In the striatum, ETS decreased in the NAPE-PLD and MAGL levels and increased FAAH levels during infancy, increased FAAH levels during adolescence, and decreased NAPE-PLD levels during adulthood. The present findings indicate that exposure to ETS during a critical period of brain development can disturb the endocannabinoid system in the brainstem and striatum, regions that are involved in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome and the susceptibility to addiction.",When humans behave like monkeys: Feedback delays and extensive practice increase the efficiency of speeded decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553935,Cognition,2019 01 21,"The study of non-human primates has been foundational in understanding the neural origins of human decision processes, yet the approach rests on the assumption that one can validly extrapolate from the animal to the human. In the context of decision making, this requires constancy across species in physiological and cognitive processes. The former cannot be experimentally validated and therefore remains assumed, and recent findings have called into question the latter: non-human primates become increasingly urgent as the time spent making a decision increases, but humans do not; from a normative perspective, monkeys are making closer-to-optimal decisions than humans. Rather than presuming species differences, here we test an alternative hypothesis: previously overlooked differences in methodological procedures from the two research traditions implicitly reinforced fundamentally different decision strategies across the two species. We show that when humans experience decision contexts matched to those experienced by non-human primates - extensive task practice, or time-based penalties - they display increasing levels of urgency as decision time grows longer, in precisely the same manner as non-human primates. Our findings indicate that previously observed differences in decision strategy between humans and non-human primates are eliminated when the decision environment is more closely matched across species, placing a constraint on the interpretation and mapping of neurophysiological results in non-human primates to humans when there are fundamental differences in the task design.",A mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553934,Cognition,2019 03 02,"Implicit social biases play a critical role in shaping our attitudes towards other people. Such biases are thought to arise, in part, from a comparison between features of one's own self-image and those of another agent, a process known as 'bodily resonance'. Recent data have demonstrated that implicit bias can be remarkably plastic, being modulated by brief immersive virtual reality experiences that place participants in a virtual body with features of an out-group member. Here, we provide a mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias in terms of a putative self-image network that encodes associations between different features of an agent. When subsequently perceiving another agent, the output of this self-image network is proportional to the overlap between their respective features, providing an index of bodily resonance. By combining the self-image network with a drift diffusion model of decision making, we simulate performance on the implicit association test (IAT) and show that the model captures the ubiquitous implicit bias towards in-group members. We subsequently demonstrate that this implicit bias can be modulated by a simulated illusory body ownership experience, consistent with empirical data; and that the magnitude and plasticity of implicit bias correlates with self-esteem. Hence, we provide a simple mechanistic account of bodily resonance and implicit bias which could contribute to the development of interventions for reducing the negative evaluation of social out-groups.",Engineering of the citrate exporter protein enables high citric acid production in Aspergillus niger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553933,Metabolic engineering,2019 03 04,"Aspergillus niger was engineered using a gene responsible for citric acid transport, which has a significant impact on citric acid secretion when overexpressed. The transport gene was identified by a homology search using an itaconic acid transporter from Ustilago maydis as template. The encoding homologous protein CexA belongs to the major facilitator superfamily subclass DHA1 and members of this family work as drug-H+ antiporter. The disruption of this gene completely abolishes citric acid secretion, which indicates that this protein is the main citric acid transporter in A. niger. In the disruption strain, the metabolism is re-routed mainly to oxalic acid, which is a known by-product during citric acid production. The gene can be heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which leads to the secretion of citric acid during the growth on glucose. These results confirm the functionality of CexA as the main transporter for citric acid of A. niger. Overexpression of cexA leads to a significant increase in secreted citric acid. Thereby, striking differences between a strong constitutive expression system using pmbfA as a promoter and an inducible expression system using ptet-on can be observed. The inducible system significantly outcompetes the constitutive expression system yielding up to 109 g/L citric acid, which is 5 times higher compared to the parental wild-type strain and 3 times higher compared to the constitutive expression system. These results demonstrate the importance of the cellular transport system for an efficient production of metabolites. By overexpressing a single gene, it is possible to significantly improve the citric acid secretion capability of a moderately producing parental strain.",Incremental clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of providing supervised physiotherapy in addition to usual medical care in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee: 2-year results of the MOA randomised controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553932,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 02 26,"To investigate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness at 2-year follow-up of providing individual, supervised exercise physiotherapy and/or manual physiotherapy in addition to usual medical care.","Calcioic acid: In vivo detection and quantification of the terminal C24-oxidation product of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and related intermediates in serum of mice treated with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553931,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 21,"Calcitroic acid, the excretory form of vitamin D, is the terminal product of a 5-step pathway catalyzed by CYP24A1, commencing with C24-hydroxylation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). Catabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) proceeds via analogous steps culminating in calcioic acid; however this C23-truncated acid has not been reported in the circulation. It has recently been shown that 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3) is an important factor in optimal bone fracture healing acting via an effector molecule FAM57B2 to produce lactosylceramide. Administration of 24,25-(OH)2D3 was found to restore normal fracture repair in Cyp24a1-/- mice devoid of 24,25-(OH)2D3. We set out to study the multi-step catabolism of D3 metabolites in vivo using LC-MS/MS methods in vehicle or 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated mice. Vehicle-treated Cyp24a1+/- mice possessed normal levels of serum 24,25-(OH)2D3 (7 ng/mL) and 25-OH-D3-26,23-lactone (4 ng/mL). We also detected 24-oxo-25-OH-D3 (3 ng/mL) and 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3 (0.4 ng/mL); which were not detectable in vehicle-treated Cyp24a1-/- mice. In 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated Cyp24a1+/- mice, serum 24,25-(OH)2D3 rose to 200 ng/mL while 25-OH-D3-26,23-lactone remained unchanged in comparison to vehicle-treated Cyp24a1+/- mice Concentration of serum 24-oxo-25-OH-D3 and 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3 rose by 10-fold, when Cyp24a1+/- mice were treated with 24,25-(OH)2D3 Calcioic acid was increased to 0.030 ng/mL for 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated Cyp24a1+/- mice. In 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated Cyp24a1-/- mice, serum 24,25-(OH)2D3 rose further to a striking 830 ng/mL due to lack of catabolism of the 24,25-(OH)2D3 dose. Serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels were suppressed in 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated Cyp24a1+/- and Cyp24a1-/- mice. Circulating 1,24,25-(OH)3D3 rose from 73 pg/mL to 106 pg/mL when Cyp24a1+/- mice were treated with 24,25-(OH)2D3. While undetectable in vehicle-treated Cyp24a1-/- mice, 1,24,25-(OH)3D3 rose unexpectedly to 153 pg/mL in 24,25-(OH)2D3-treated nulls suggesting conversion of 24,25-(OH)2D3 to 1,24,25-(OH)3D3 via 1-hydroxylation. Taken together, amplification of 24,25-(OH)2D3 catabolism by exogenous doses of this metabolite have enabled detection of downstream C24-oxidation pathway products in vivo, including calcioic acid; and provides a platform for studying alternative routes of vitamin D metabolism that may occur in pathological states including hypervitaminosis D and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia caused by mutations of CYP24A1."

Herein, we utilized a magnetic nanoparticle-based platform with cationic polymer modification to promote radiotherapy for glioma treatment. We found that the nanoplatform induced cytotoxicity to glioma cells under radiation as well as promoting significant survival benefits in both immunocompetent and aythmic mice with glioma. Utilizing the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles, we were able to ascertain that myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were taking up nanoparticles in the brain tumor. The observed efficacy was attributed to destruction of glioma cells as well as MDSCs repolarization from immunosuppressive phenotype to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which promoted antitumor effects and synergistically promoted radio-therapeutic effects. Our nanoparticles provide a robust dual-targeting platform for glioma radiotherapy by simultaneous eradication of tumor cells and manipulation of myeloid phenotypes in the central nervous system.",Photoacoustic microscopy of obesity-induced cerebrovascular alterations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553918,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Cerebral small vessel disease has been linked to cognitive, psychiatric and physical disabilities, especially in the elderly. However, the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, largely due to the limited accessibility of these small vessels in the live brain. Here, we report an intravital imaging and analysis platform for high-resolution, quantitative and comprehensive characterization of pathological alterations in the mouse cerebral microvasculature. By exploiting multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), microvascular structure, blood perfusion, oxygenation and flow were imaged in the awake brain. With the aid of vessel segmentation, these structural and functional parameters were extracted at the single-microvessel level, from which vascular density, tortuosity, wall shear stress, resistance and associated cerebral oxygen extraction fraction and metabolism were also quantified. With the use of vasodilatory stimulus, multifaceted cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was characterized in vivo. By extending the classic Evans blue assay to in vivo, permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was dynamically evaluated. The utility of this enabling technique was examined by studying cerebrovascular alterations in an established mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity. Our results revealed increased vascular density, reduced arterial flow, enhanced oxygen extraction, impaired BBB integrity, and increased multifaceted CVR in the obese brain. Interestingly, the 'counterintuitive' increase of CVR was supported by the elevated active endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the obese mouse. Providing comprehensive and quantitative insights into cerebral microvessels and their responses under pathological conditions, this technique opens a new door to mechanistic studies of the cerebral small vessel disease and its implications in neurodegeneration and stroke.",Increased cerebral blood flow after single dose of antipsychotics in healthy volunteers depends on dopamine D2 receptor density profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553916,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"As a result of neuro-vascular coupling, the functional effects of antipsychotics in human brain have been investigated in both healthy and clinical populations using haemodynamic markers such as regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF). However, the relationship between observed haemodynamic effects and the pharmacological action of these drugs has not been fully established. Here, we analysed Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) rCBF data from a placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, who received a single dose of three different D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists and tested the association of the main effects of the drugs on rCBF against normative population maps of D2R protein density and gene-expression data. In particular, we correlated CBF changes after antipsychotic administration with non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) template maps of the high affinity D2-antagonist Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligand [18F]Fallypride and with brain post-mortem microarray mRNA expression data for the DRD2 gene from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA). For all antipsychotics, rCBF changes were directly proportional to brain D2R densities and DRD2 mRNA expression measures, although PET BPND spatial profiles explained more variance as compared with mRNA profiles (PET R2 range = 0.20-0.60, mRNA PET R2 range 0.04-0.20, pairwise-comparisons all pcorrected<0.05). In addition, the spatial coupling between ΔCBF and D2R profiles varied between the different antipsychotics tested, possibly reflecting differential affinities. Overall, these results indicate that the functional effects of antipsychotics as measured with rCBF are tightly correlated with the distribution of their target receptors in striatal and extra-striatal regions. Our results further demonstrate the link between neurotransmitter targets and haemodynamic changes reinforcing rCBF as a robust in-vivo marker of drug effects. This work is important in bridging the gap between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of novel and existing compounds.",Low frequency pulse stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in Trpm4-/- knockout rats differently affects baseline BOLD signals in target regions of the right hippocampus but not BOLD responses at the site of stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553915,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Electrical stimulation of right Schaffer collateral in Trpm4-/- knockout and wild type rats were used to study the role of Trpm4 channels for signal processing in the hippocampal formation. Stimulation induced neuronal activity was simultaneously monitored in the CA1 region by in vivo extracellular field recordings and in the entire brain by BOLD fMRI measurements. In wild type and Trpm4-/- knockout rats, consecutive 5 Hz pulse trains elicited similar neuronal responses in the CA1 region and similar BOLD responses in the stimulated right hippocampus. Stimulus-related positive BOLD responses were also found in the left dorsal hippocampus. In contrast to the right dorsal hippocampus, baseline BOLD signals in the left hippocampus significantly decreased during consecutive stimulation trains. Similarly, slowly developing significant declines in baseline BOLD signals, in absence of any positive BOLD responses, were also observed in the right entorhinal, right piriform cortex, right basolateral amygdala and right dorsal striatum whereas baseline BOLD signals remained almost stable in the corresponding left regions. Furthermore, significant declines in baseline BOLD signals were found in the prefrontal cortex and prelimbic/infralimbic cortex. Because significant baseline BOLD declines were only observed in target regions of the right dorsal hippocampus, it might reflect functional connectivity between these regions. In all observed regions the decline in baseline BOLD signals was significantly delayed and less pronounced in Trpm4-/- knockout rats when compared to wild type rats. Thus, either Trpm4 channels are involved in mediating these baseline BOLD shifts or functional connectivity of the hippocampus is impaired in Trpm4-/- knockout rats.",New and Recurrent Colorectal Cancers After Resection: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Endoscopic Surveillance Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553914,Gastroenterology,2019 05 03,Outcomes of endoscopic surveillance after surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) vary with the incidence and timing of CRC detection at anastomoses or non-anastomoses in the colorectum.

In this study, we identified an anti-oligomeric Aβ42 aggregate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, HT6, that is capable of efficiently binding to medium-sized Aβ42 aggregates (mainly 18-45 kDa) in vitro with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 3.0 × 10-6 M, whether they were derived from Aβ42 monomer, larger Aβ42 oligomers, or even fibrils. This ability allowed scFv HT6 to induce the gradual disassembly of large Aβ42 aggregates into small Aβ42 oligomers while simultaneously effectively inhibiting the further development of Aβ42 aggregates. Moreover, the scFv HT6-targeted conformational region on Aβ42 aggregates was found to be more local and relatively close to the N-terminus of Aβ42; thus, scFv HT6 significantly delayed or even prevented the aggregation of Aβ42 protofibrils, while significantly reducing the cytotoxicity of Aβ42 oligomers. Overall, this study demonstrate that even though the decrease in the cytotoxicity of Aβ42 aggregates might be closely related to the reduction in Aβ42 aggregates and vice versa, the reduction in Aβ42 aggregates might not necessarily be accompanied by or followed by the reduction or even elimination of the cytotoxicity of Aβ42 aggregates. This insight enriches the diversity of anti-oligomeric Aβ42 antibodies, further providing a new understanding into the relationship between their binding pattern to Aβ42 aggregates and the efficacy against their formation, offering a therapeutic strategy to delay the progression of AD.","Shifting characteristics of nonmedical prescription tranquilizer users in the United States, 2005-2014.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553910,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 25,"Benzodiazepine overdose rates have increased in the US, largely from concomitant use of other drugs such as opioids.

One reason for decline in performance is enteritis, usually affecting newborn lambs. Enteritis can be fatal, especially in dairy herds. Generally, lambs are fed sucrose or unprocessed milk from sheep or cow that is heated and fed to animals two or three times a day in baby bottles. However, on most farms, milk temperature differs among feeds, as often the process of alteration among diet adaptations is deficient, contributing to enteritis and consequent diarrhea. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to verify the administration of the homeopathic product (Dia 100®) in newborn and bottle-fed lambs, in order to prevent or minimize the occurrence of diarrhea. We studied 60 lambs, divided into two groups with ten repetitions each (n = 30) and during the nursing period (1-45 days of life). Animals in the treated group received the homeopathic product (36 g) orally divided into three doses (1, 7 and 14 days of life). We measured weight gain, mortality, bacterial counts (Escherichia coli and total coliforms) in feces, hematological analysis (leukocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocytes) and biochemical analyses (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, albumin, globulin, urea and total protein) at four time-points. There were no differences in weight gain between groups (P > 0.05); however, there was a higher mortality rate in the control group (13%) than in the treated group (6%). E. coli counts were significantly higher in the stools of control group lambs on days 15 and 45 of the experiment (P < 0.05). Total leukocyte counts were greater in treated animals due to greater numbers of lymphocytes on day 15 of the experiment (P < 0.05). In the treated group, we found higher serum levels of total protein, urea (day 15), globulin and triglycerides (days 15 and 30). In the period of administration of the homeopathic product, there was substantial and significant reduction of cases of diarrhea (up to day 14); however, after this period, there were no difference between groups. Based on these results, we concluded that the homeopathic product had moderate efficacy in terms of control of diarrhea. The treated lambs made better use of nutrients, contributing to the development of their immune responses.",Emerging Trends in Financing of Adult Heart Transplantation in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553907,JACC.

Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antiprotozoal activity due to interference with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of NTZ on the energetic metabolism of Taenia crassiceps cysticerci intracranially inoculated BALB /c mice. The infected animals were treated with a single oral dose of NTZ 30 days after the inoculation. Analysis of the organic acids was performed through high performance liquid chromatography. Glucose was detected only in the treated groups, alongside with a significant decrease in lactate, pyruvate and oxaloacetate concentrations which indicate an increase in gluconeogenesis. The non-detection of alpha-ketoglutarate indicated the use of the fumarate reductase pathway in all groups. It was possible to confirm the drugs mode of action due to the non-detection of acetate in the treated groups. There was an increase in the fatty acids oxidation. Therefore it was possible to observe that NTZ induces gluconeogenesis as well as the increase of alternative energetic pathways such as fatty acids oxidation in T. crassiceps cysticerci.",A novel ferritin gene from Procambarus clarkii involved in the immune defense against Aeromonas hydrophila infection and inhibits WSSV replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553892,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Ferritin is a protein related to the storage of iron and widely distributed in animals. It participates in many biological process, including antioxidation, cell activation, angiogenesis, regulation of iron metabolic balance and immune defense. In the present study, a novel ferritin gene was identified from red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, with a cDNA sequence encoding a predicted 221 amino-acid residues. The ferritin protein contains a 19-residue signal peptide and 145-residue classic ferritin domain. The NJ phylogenetic analysis showed PcFer clustered with other crustacean peptides. The recombinant PcFer protein was produced and purified in E. coli, and the anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained. The rPcFer exhibited iron binding activity at a dose-dependent effect. The qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that PcFer was highly expressed in hemocytes, hepatopancreas, and gills. After challenged with WSSV and Aeromonas hydrophila, the mRNA and protein expression patterns of PcFer were significantly up-regulated in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. dsRNA interfering technique was utilized to silence the expression of PcFer gene. The WSSV copy number in PcFer silenced shrimp was much higher than that in the control group. The present study indicated that PcFer was involved in the immune defense against WSSV and Aeromonas hydrophila, and might inhibit WSSV replication in P. clarkii. These results will provide important data support for further study of the functional role of the ferritin gene.",Effects of high-soy diet on S100 gene expression in liver and intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553891,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"The current study examines expression of S100 genes, a group of calcium-sensing proteins poorly characterized in fishes. In mammals, these proteins are known to play roles beyond calcium-signaling, including mediation of inflammatory processes. Some S100 proteins also serve as biomarkers for a variety of autoinflammatory conditions. It is well known that salmonids exhibit varying degrees of intestinal enteritis when exposed to alternative feed ingredients containing antinutritional factors, with soybean meal (SBM) being one of the best characterized. The etiology of soy-caused distal enteritis isn't entirely understood but displays similar histopathological alterations to the gut observed in human mucosal inflammatory bowel diseases. We sought to determine if teleost S100 genes show a concomitant response like that observed in mammals, utilizing rainbow trout fed high-soy diets as a model for intestinal inflammation. We examined expression of fourteen known salmonid S100 genes in the liver, first segment of the mid-intestine (proximal intestine), and second segment of the mid-intestine (distal intestine). After 12 weeks on a high-soy diet containing 40% SBM, we observed upregulation of several S100 genes in the distal intestine (S100I2, A10a, V1, V2, and W), no changes in the proximal intestine, and downregulation of S100V2 in the liver. Overall, our results provide further knowledge of the expression of S100 genes and provide targets for future research regarding inflammatory processes in the rainbow trout gut.",Hematopoietic tissue of Macrobrachium rosenbergii plays dual roles as a source of hemocyte hematopoiesis and as a defensive mechanism against Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553890,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"White tail disease caused by Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) infection takes place only in nauplii, not adults, of M. rosenbergii prawn. Hemocyte homeostasis and immune-related functions derived from the hematopoietic tissue (Hpt) in adult prawn are presumed to play roles in resisting viral infection. To elucidate the role of the Hpt cell response to MrNV, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed with MrNV-infected prawn at various time intervals. The results showed that there were 462 unigenes that were differentially expressed between mock and infected samples. BlastX sequence analysis revealed that two proteins, crustacean hematopoietic factor (CHF) and cell growth-regulating zinc finger protein (Lyar), are involved in hemocyte hematopoiesis and are up-regulated during MrNV infection. In fact, genes involved in cell growth regulation and immunity were highly expressed at 6 h and decreased within 24 h post-infection. Localization studies in the Hpt tissue revealed the presence of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and CHF mRNAs in Hpt cells. Considering these findings, we concluded that resistance to MrNV infection in adult prawn is due to an increase in humoral immune factors and the acceleration of hemocyte homeostasis by the dual roles of the Hpt organ in M. rosenbergii.","The comparisons in protective mechanisms and efficiencies among dietary α-lipoic acid, β-glucan and l-carnitine on Nile tilapia infected by Aeromonas hydrophila.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553889,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Dietary α-lipoic acid (LA), β-glucan (Gluc) and l-carnitine (L-Ca) are commonly used additives to promote fish growth and stress resistance in aquaculture production. However their mechanisms and efficiencies in helping fish to resist diseases have not been compared before. In this study, we fed Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with diets containing appropriate doses of LA, Gluc and L-Ca for five weeks and further intraperitoneally injected the fish with Aeromonas hydrophila. After dietary treatment, none of the additives affected the fish growth, but dietary Gluc and L-Ca reduced protein and lipid body contents in fish, respectively. After A. hydrophila challenge, all fish treated with the three dietary additives showed higher survival rate, but those fed on dietary L-Ca had lower survival than those fed on LA and Gluc diets, indicating high protection efficiency of LA and Gluc. The protective mechanisms of the three feed additives were quite different under A. hydrophila infection. Dietary LA induced higher total antioxidant capacity and higher mRNA expression of anti-oxidative genes than other additives in liver and also activated partly the immune function in serum and spleen. Gluc largely increased the immune function by activating the immunity enzymes in serum, inducing inflammation in liver and increasing the expression of immune genes in spleen and head kidney. Gluc also increased partly the antioxidant capacity in serum and liver and lipid catabolism in liver. L-Ca largely increased lipid catabolism in liver while it increased partly the antioxidant capacities in serum and liver. Taken together, these results indicate that, dietary LA, Gluc and L-Ca have various protective mechanisms and differ in their efficiencies on resisting A. hydrophila infection in Nile tilapia.","Effect of dietary supplementation with apple cider vinegar and propionic acid on hemolymph chemistry, intestinal microbiota and histological structure of hepatopancreas in white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553888,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of Apple cider vinegar (ACV) and propionic acid (PA) on biochemical parameters of hemolymph, intestinal microbiota and histology of hepatopancreas in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Five experimental diets were evaluated in this study including diets supplemented with 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0% of ACV, 0.5% propionic acid, and a control diet with no supplements. Shrimps (initial weight of 10.2 ± 0.04 g) in triplicate groups with the density of 25 shrimps per tank were fed the diets for 60 days. At the end of the feeding trial, shrimps fed with ACV and PA supplemented diets had significantly higher total protein level than those fed the control diet (P < 0.05). The number of Vibrio spp., R-cells (lipid storage cells) of hepatopancreas and cholesterol level in shrimps fed the diets containing ACV and PA were lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, there was no remarkable variations in glucose concentration, B-cell number and tubule diameter among the experimental diets (P > 0.05). In addition, shrimps fed the ACV diets had significantly lower total heterotrophic marine bacteria compared to the control or PA groups, and the lowest bacterial number was observed in shrimp fed 4% ACV supplemented diet (P < 0.05). Supplementation of 2 and 4% ACV as well as 0.5% PA in the diet led to a significantly higher calcium concentration than the control treatment (P < 0.05). The lowest triglyceride concentration was observed in the shrimps fed diets containing 2.0 and 4.0% ACV, which resulted in 15 and 20% reduction, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, the findings indicates that ACV and PA possess antimicrobial activity and demonstrate beneficial effects on health status, so they can be potentially used as feed additive in the feeding of L. vannamei.",Use of probiotics in aquaculture of China-a review of the past decade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553887,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"China is the largest aquaculture producer in the world. Antibiotics were extensively used to ensure the development of the intensive aquaculture; however, the use of antibiotics causes safety- and environment-associated problems. As an alternative strategy to antibiotics, aquatic probiotics have attracted attention. The microbial organisms used as probiotics or tested as potential probiotics in Chinese aquaculture belong to various taxonomic divisions, including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and yeast. Moreover, the mixture of probiotic strains and synbiotics are also widely used. Studies on the mode of action of aquatic probiotics have extended our understanding of the probiotic effects, and novel mechanisms have been discovered, such as interference of quorum sensing. However, use of probiotics in Chinese aquaculture is still at an initial stage, and there are potential risks for some probiotic applications in aquaculture. Further regulation and management are required to normalize the production and usage of aquatic probiotics. In this review, we discuss species, effects, and mode of actions of probiotics in Chinese aquaculture since 2008. Challenges and future directions for research are also discussed.","Differential accumulation of Tau phosphorylated at residues Thr231, Ser262 and Thr205 in hippocampal interneurons and its modulation by Tau mutations (VLW) and amyloid-β peptide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553886,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 16,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (P-Tau). Our recent data showed a differential accumulation of Tau protein phosphorylated at residue Thr231 (pThr231) in distinct hippocampal neurons in VLW mice-a model that overexpresses mutated human Tau. Here we demonstrate that, in VLW mice, the accumulation of human P-Tau in pyramidal cells induces the phosphorylation of murine Tau at residue Thr231 in hippocampal interneurons. In addition, we show that pSer262 and pThr205 Tau are present specifically in the soma of some hippocampal interneurons in control mice. Analysis of J20 mice-a model that accumulates Aβ-and of VLW animals showed that the density of hippocampal interneurons accumulating pThr205 Tau is lower in VLW mice than in controls. In contrast, the density of interneurons accumulating pThr205 Tau in J20 mice was increased compared to controls in hippocampal regions with a higher Aβ plaque load, thereby suggesting that pThr205 Tau is induced by Aβ. No significant differences were found between the density of hippocampal interneurons positive for pSer262 Tau in VLW or J20 mice compared to control animals. We also show that pSer262 and pThr205 Tau are present in the soma of some hippocampal interneurons containing Parvalbumin, Calbindin or Calretinin in control, VLW, and J20 mice. Moreover, our results reveal that some interneurons in human hippocampi of cases of AD and control cases accumulate pSer262 and pThr205 Tau.

General subjects,2019 01 20,"Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mcEDS) due to CHST14/D4ST1 deficiency (mcEDS-CHST14) is a recently delineated type of EDS caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CHST14, which results in the depletion of dermatan sulfate (DS). Clinical characteristics of mcEDS-CHST14 consist of multiple malformations and progressive fragility-related manifestations, including skin hyperextensibility and fragility. Skin fragility is suspected to result from the impaired assembly of collagen fibrils caused by alteration of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain of decorin-proteoglycan (PG) from DS to chondroitin sulfate (CS). This systematic investigation of the skin pathology of patients with mcEDS-CHST14 comprised both immunostaining of decorin and transmission electron microscopy-based cupromeronic blue staining to visualize GAG chains. Collagen fibrils were dispersed in the affected papillary to reticular dermis; in contrast, they were regularly and tightly assembled in controls. Moreover, the fibrils exhibited a perpendicular arrangement to the affected epidermis, whereas fibrils were parallel to control epidermis. Affected GAG chains were linear, stretching from the outer surface of collagen fibrils to adjacent fibrils; in contrast, those of controls were curved, maintaining close contact with attached collagen fibrils. This is the first observation of compositional alteration, from DS to CS, of GAG side chains, which caused structural alteration of GAG side chains and resulted in spatial disorganization of collagen networks; this presumably disrupted the ring-mesh structure of GAG side chains surrounding collagen fibrils. McEDS-CHST14 provides a critical example of the importance of DS in GAG side chains of decorin-PG during assembly of collagen fibrils in maintenance of connective tissues.",Menthol-induced facilitation of cerebrocortical excitatory propagation induced by air puff stimulation of the nasal cavity in the rat: An optical imaging study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553866,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Temperature plays a critical role in the sensation of airflow in the nasal mucosa. Neural activities of the ethmoidal nerve, a trigeminal afferent, responding to airflow are suppressed by warm airflow, whereas cold airflow enhances the ethmoidal nerve activities, which is mimicked by application of menthol, a cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptor agonist. However, it has been an open issue how menthol modulates the spatiotemporal profiles of neural activities of somatosensory cortical neurons. In this study, we assessed neural responses to an air puff stimulation (100 ms) to the nasal cavity in the absence or presence of l-menthol using an optical imaging technique with a voltage-sensitive dye in the primary cortex (S1) of urethane-anesthetized rats. A weak air puff application (15 psi) without l-menthol induced neural excitation in a part of the contralateral S1. The air puff stimulation with l-menthol significantly increased the optical signal intensity, expanded the activated area, and shortened the latency, compared to those in the absence of l-menthol. These results suggest that activation of cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors sharpens airflow sensation in the nasal cavity and expands the receptive field, especially toward the pharynx, which may contribute to enhanced flavor perception.",Effectiveness of acute transcranial direct current stimulation on non-motor and motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553865,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an appropriate treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD).

The present study describes a special type of non-internalizing antibody-drug-conjugates that specifically target Gal-3BP. Here, we show that the humanized 1959 antibody, which specifically recognizes secreted Gal-3BP, selectively localized around tumor but not normal cells. A site specific disulfide linkage with thiol-maytansinoids to unpaired cysteine residues of 1959, resulting in a drug-antibody ratio of 2, yielded an ADC product, which cured A375m melanoma bearing mice. ADC products based on the non-internalizing 1959 antibody may be useful for the treatment of several human malignancies, as the cognate antigen is abundantly expressed and secreted by several cancers, while being present at low levels in most normal adult tissues.",Current state of the polymeric delivery systems of fluoroquinolones - A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553851,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 01 20,"Recently, growing interest in polymers (natural and synthetic) as drug carriers in controlled release formulations and drug targeting systems that may improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce the side effects of a drug therapy, has been observed.

Over the past decades, immunotherapy has improved the clinical outcome for cancer patients. However, in many cases, mutations in cancer cells, lack of selectivity, insufficiency of tumor-reactive T cells, and host immunosuppression limit the clinical benefit of immunotherapy. Combination approaches in immunotherapy may overcome these obstacles. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that combination immunotherapy is the future of cancer treatment. However, designing safe and rational combinations of immunotherapy with other treatment modalities is critical.

Although nanoparticle-based drug delivery exhibits great potential, there are some challenges facing like rapid plasma clearance, triggering or aggravation of immune response, etc. Herein, cell-based targeted drug delivery systems have drawn more and more attention owing to low immunogenicity and intrinsic mutation rate, and innate ability to allow targeted delivery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in gene and drug delivery. The use of MSCs is a promising approach for the development of gene transfer systems and drug loading strategies because of their intrinsic properties, including homing ability and tumor tropism. By combining the inherent cell properties and merits of synthetic nanoparticles (NPs), cell membrane coated NPs emerge as the time requires. Overall, we provide a comprehensive overview of the utility of MSCs in drug and gene delivery as well as MSC membrane coated nanoparticles for therapy and drug delivery, aiming to figure out the significant room for development and highlight the potential future directions.","Mortality, morbidity, and hospitalisations due to influenza lower respiratory tract infections, 2017: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553848,The Lancet.

Molecular and cell biology of lipids,2019 01 22,"Cholesterol, an essential lipid component of cellular plasma membranes, regulates fluidity, mechanical integrity, raft structure and may specifically interact with membrane proteins. Numerous effects on ion channels by cholesterol, including changes in current amplitude, voltage dependence and gating kinetics, have been reported. We have previously described such changes in the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 of lymphocytes by cholesterol and its analog 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC). In voltage-gated channels membrane depolarization induces movement of the voltage sensor domains (VSD), which is transmitted by a coupling mechanism to the pore domain (PD) to open the channel. Here, we investigated whether cholesterol effects were mediated by the VSD to the pore or the PD was the direct target. Specificity was tested by comparing Kv1.3 and Kv10.1 channels having different VSD-PD coupling mechanisms. Current recordings were performed with two-electrode voltage-clamp fluorometry, where movement of the VSDs was monitored by attaching fluorophores to external cysteine residues introduced in the channel sequence. Loading the membrane with cholesterol or 7DHC using methyl-β-cyclodextrin induced changes in the steady-state and kinetic parameters of the ionic currents while leaving fluorescence parameters mostly unaffected in both channels. Non-stationary noise analysis revealed that reduction of single channel conductance rather than that of open probability caused the observed current decrease. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning and stimulated emission depletion microscopy demonstrated significant changes in the distribution of these ion channels in response to sterol loading. Our results indicate that sterol-induced effects on ion channel gating directly target the pore and do not act via the VSD.",Platelet-derived growth factor-D enables liver myofibroblasts to promote tumor lymphangiogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553841,Journal of hepatology,2019 03 19,"In cholangiocarcinoma, early metastatic spread via lymphatic vessels often precludes curative therapies.

This study aimed to investigate the possible use of an imidazole fungicide miconazole as a novel therapy for OPIDN. Adult hens, the most commonly used animal models in OPIDN studies, were orally given tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). We showed that miconazole, which was administered daily to hens beginning on the 7th day after TOCP exposure, drastically ameliorated the neurotoxic symptoms and histopathological damages in spinal cord and sciatic nerves. Mechanistically, miconazole inhibited the TOCP-induced activation of ErbB/Akt signaling, and enhanced the myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. In a glial cell model sNF96.2 cells, miconazole restored the TOCP-inhibited MBP expression, and promoted cell differentiation as well as cell migration by inhibiting the activation of ErbB/Akt signaling pathway. In sum, miconazole, a synthetic imidazole fungicide, could ameliorate the symptoms and histopathological changes of OPIDN, probably by promoting glial cell differentiation and migration to enhance myelination via inhibiting the activation of ErbB/Akt. Thus, miconazole is a promising candidate therapy for the clinical treatment of OPIDN.",Out of control? Acting out anger is associated with deficient prefrontal emotional action control in male patients with borderline personality disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553826,Neuropharmacology,2018 12 21,"Difficulty in anger control and anger-related aggressive outbursts against others are frequently reported by patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although male sex is a known predictor for aggression, hardly any study has addressed the neural correlates of deficient anger control in male patients with BPD. Building on previous reports in female BPD, we investigated the involvement of lateral antero- and dorsal prefrontal cortex in the control of fast emotional actions and its relation to self-reported tendencies to act out anger. 15 medication-free male patients with BPD and 25 age- and intelligence-matched healthy men took part in a social Approach-Avoidance task in the MR-scanner. This task allows the measurement of neural correlates underlying the control of fast behavioral tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Hypothesis-driven region-of-interest and exploratory whole brain analyses were used to test for activations of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions and their relation with the amygdala during emotional action control as well as their association with self-reported anger out in male patients with BPD and healthy volunteers. Male patients with BPD showed reduced anterolateral prefrontal activations during emotional action control compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, anger out was negatively related to antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal activations, while it was positively related to amygdala activity in male patients with BPD. The current results suggest the involvement of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions in controlling and overriding fast emotional actions. Deficits in lateral prefrontal emotion control seem to be a common neural mechanism underlying anger-related aggression.",The critical role of microRNAs in stress response: Therapeutic prospect and limitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553824,Pharmacological research,2019 04 01,"Stress response refers to the systemic nonspecific response upon exposure to strong stimulation or chronic stress, such as severe trauma, shock, infection, burn, major surgery or improper environment, which disturb organisms and damage their physical and psychological health. However, the pathogenesis of stress induced disorder remains complicated and diverse under different stress exposure. Recently, studies have revealed a specific role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cellular function under different types of stress, suggesting a significant role in the treatment and prevention of stress-related diseases, such as stress ulcer, posttraumatic stress disorder, stress-induced cardiomyopathy and so on. This paper have reviewed the literature on microRNA related stress diseases in different databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and the MiRbase. It considers only peer-reviewed papers published in English between 2004 and 2018. This review summarizes new advances in principles and mechanisms of miRNAs regulating stress signalling pathway and the role of miRNAs in human stress diseases. This comprehensive review is to provide an integrated account of how different stresses affect miRNAs and how stress-miRNA pathways may, in turn, be linked with disease, which offers some potential strategies for stress disorder treatment.

Subsequently, the effect of Up4A on vascular tone regulation was intensively investigated in arteries isolated from different vascular beds in rodents including rat pulmonary arteries, aortas, mesenteric and renal arteries as well as mouse aortas, in which Up4A produces vascular contraction. In contrast, Up4A produces vascular relaxation in porcine coronary small arteries and rat aortas. Intravenous infusion of Up4A into conscious rats or mice decreases blood pressure, and intravenous bolus injection of Up4A into anesthetized mice increases coronary blood flow, indicating an overall vasodilator influence in vivo. Although Up4A is the first dinucleotide described that contains both purine and pyrimidine moieties, its cardiovascular effects are exerted mainly through activation of purinergic receptors. These effects not only encompass regulation of vascular tone, but also endothelial angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and vascular calcification. Furthermore, this review discusses a potential role for Up4A in cardiovascular pathophysiology, as plasma levels of Up4A are elevated in juvenile hypertensive patients and Up4A-mediated vascular purinergic signaling changes in cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Better understanding the vascular effect of the novel dinucleotide Up4A and the purinergic signaling mechanisms mediating its effects will enhance its potential as target for treatment of cardiovascular disease.",Full-Thickness Intraoral Mucosa Barrier Models for In Vitro Drug-Permeation Studies Using Microneedles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553821,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 26,"The use of permeation enhancers such as microneedles (MNs) to increase drug penetration across intraoral mucosa has increased in recent years. Permeation studies, commonly performed using vertical diffusion cells, are a well-established way to preview formulations and enhance their performance during the development stage. However, to our knowledge, the existing intraoral mucosa barrier models do not permit permeation using MN-pretreated mucosa due to their insufficient thickness. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a barrier model using thick palate tissues to perform in vitro permeation studies, with physical enhancement of the permeability of intraoral mucosa by pretreatment with MNs. The adapted Franz-type cells used in the permeation experiments were validated (cell dimensions and volume, sealing effectiveness, stirring and dissolution efficiency, temperature control, and establishment of uniaxial flux). Commercially available MNs were used in the palatal mucosa. Optical images of the mucosa were acquired to analyze the microperforations created. In vitro permeation studies were conducted with the MN-pretreated mucosa. This work presents a new in vitro method for the evaluation of MNs as permeation enhancers, with the aim of improving the absorption of drug formulations topically applied within the oral cavity.","Interpersonal-level discrimination indices, sociodemographic factors, and telomere length in African-Americans and Whites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553820,Biological psychology,2019 05 01,"Studies have linked self-reported discrimination to telomere attrition, a biological marker of accelerated cellular aging.

We aimed to examine the effect of peripheral, systemic inflammation on oxidative stress and apoptosis in the hippocampi of male and female mice. We hypothesized that (1) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) would induce depressive-like behavior and hippocampal oxidative stress after 1 day in males, and (2) that a single LPS exposure would result in hippocampal apoptosis at 28 days. Further, we predicted that female sex would confer protection from the molecular and behavioral deleterious effects of LPS. Males exhibited depressive-like behavior 24 h after LPS administration compared to the males given saline. Female mice did not exhibit depressive-like behavior after LPS compared to females in the saline group. Males given LPS also had increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) I in the hippocampus by 24 h compared to the saline group. At 28 days, we found decreased levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in males given LPS compared to males given saline. Moreover, males given LPS showed increased apoptosis.

The goal of the current study was to use a rat-tail vibration model to determine how vibration frequency influences factors related to nerve injury and dysfunction. Rats were exposed to restraint, or restraint plus tail vibration at 62.5 Hz or 250 Hz. Nerve function was assessed using the current perception threshold (CPT) test. Exposure to vibration at 62.5 and 250 Hz, resulted in a reduction in the CPT at 2000 and 250-Hz electrical stimulation (i.e. increased Aβ and Aδ, nerve fiber sensitivity). Vibration exposure at 250 Hz also resulted in an increased sensitivity of C-fibers to electrical stimulation and thermal nociception. These changes in nerve fiber sensitivity were associated with increased expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in ventral tail nerves, and increases in circulating concentrations of IL-1 β in rats exposed to 250-Hz vibration. There was an increase in glutathione, but no changes in other measures of oxidative activity in the peripheral nerve. However, measures of oxidative stress were increased in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). These changes in pro-inflammatory factors and markers of oxidative stress in the peripheral nerve and DRG were associated with inflammation, and reductions in myelin basic protein and post-synaptic density protein (PSD)-95 gene expression, suggesting that vibration-induced changes in sensory function may be the result of changes at the exposed nerve, the DRG and/or the spinal cord.",Age-related Changes in Neural Coding of Envelope Cues: Peripheral Declines and Central Compensation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553793,Neuroscience,2019 06 07,"Aging listeners often experience difficulties in perceiving temporally complex acoustic cues in noisy environments. These difficulties likely have neurophysiological contributors from various levels of auditory processing. Cochlear synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers exhibit a progressive decline with age which is not reflected in the threshold audiogram. The functional consequences of this loss for the coding of suprathreshold sound remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that cochlear synaptopathy results in degraded representations of temporal envelope cues at the earliest levels of the auditory pathway. Central nuclei downstream of the auditory nerve exhibit a compensatory plasticity in response to this deafferentation, in the form of altered gain. This results in a modulation frequency selective increase in the representation of envelope cues at the level of the auditory midbrain and cortex. These changes may be shaped by mechanisms such as decreased inhibitory neurotransmission occurring with age across various central auditory nuclei. Altered representations of the differing temporal components of speech due to these interactions between multiple levels of the auditory pathway may contribute to the age-related difficulties hearing speech in noisy environments."

Adult patients with PFP who presented at our department between January 2006 and December 2013 qualified for the study if they had undergone lumbar puncture and also been tested for the presence of borrelial IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay. Patients with PFP who had obvious signs/symptoms indicating a disease other than Lyme borreliosis (LB) were excluded. Patients who qualified for the study were classified into three groups according to the clinical and microbiological criteria: those having confirmed LB, those with possible LB, and those with PFP of unknown etiology. Of 589 patients diagnosed with PFP during the eight-year period, 436 patients (240 males, 196 females) with median age 42.5 years (15-87 years) qualified for the study. Among these patients, 64 (14.7%) fulfilled criteria for confirmed LB, 120 (27.5%) had a diagnosis of possible LB, and in 252 (57.8%) the cause of their PFP remained unknown. When compared with patients with unknown cause of PFP, the patients with confirmed LB were older, more often presented in summer, more often reported tick bites, more frequently had LB in the past, more often complained of constitutional symptoms and radicular pain, and more often had bilateral palsy and CSF pleocytosis. Among the patients with possible LB and patients with unknown cause of PFP there were no differences in frequency of constitutional symptoms, radicular pain, bilateral palsy or CSF pleocytosis. Presentation in summer, tick bites, constitutional symptoms and radicular pain, bilateral palsy, and CSF pleocytosis strongly suggest borrelial etiology of PFP.",Sex differences in cerebral perfusion changes after mild traumatic brain injury: Longitudinal investigation and correlation with outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553777,Brain research,2019 02 17,"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is known to have marked developmental sex differences. We investigated whether gender differences exert modulatory effect on mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) from both neuropsychological testing and brain CBF changes using a longitudinal design from acute stage to subacute 1 month post-injury. Our results supported that cognitive information processing speed (IPS), as one of core cognitive impairments following mTBI, were at least partially independent from other self-reported syndromes, such as post concussive symptom and posttraumatic stress disorder, and that it can be selectively impaired in specific male mTBI individuals. The gender difference of this cognitive domain in healthy control attenuated following mTBI and only male patients showed impaired language fluency accompanying with increased CBF changes compared with male controls. The increased CBF in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can predict much worse cognitive IPS performance in male patients. In contrast, female patients with mTBI displayed no impairments on any neuropsychological performance, and female sex may be a protective factor against neuropsychological impairments. Moreover, the significant interaction effect of time and gender exhibited in the left inferior frontal cortex (Broca's area). Simple effect test suggested gender differences in this area was mainly derived from the patients group at later subacute but not acute phase, for the reduced CBF at subacute mainly in the male patients. Thus, the current findings suggest that regional CBF may provide an objective biomarker for tracking gender modulatory effect on mTBI and its potentially pathological recovery process.",Smc3 is required for mouse embryonic and adult hematopoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553776,Experimental hematology,2019 06 10,"SMC3 encodes a subunit of the cohesin complex that has canonical roles in regulating sister chromatids segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Recurrent heterozygous mutations in SMC3 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies. In this study, we investigated whether the missense mutations in SMC3 might have dominant-negative effects or phenocopy loss-of-function effects by comparing the consequences of Smc3-deficient and -haploinsufficient mouse models. We found that homozygous deletion of Smc3 during embryogenesis or in adult mice led to hematopoietic failure, suggesting that SMC3 missense mutations are unlikely to be associated with simple dominant-negative phenotypes. In contrast, haploinsufficiency was tolerated during embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. Under steady-state conditions, Smc3 haploinsufficiency did not alter colony forming in methylcellulose, only modestly decreased mature myeloid cell populations, and led to limited expression changes and chromatin alteration in Lin-cKit+ bone marrow cells. However, following transplantation, engraftment, and subsequent deletion, we observed a hematopoietic competitive disadvantage across myeloid and lymphoid lineages and within the stem/progenitor compartments. This disadvantage was not affected by hematopoietic stresses, but was partially abrogated by concurrent Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency, suggesting that antecedent mutations may be required to optimize the leukemogenic potential of Smc3 mutations.",A neural substrate of early response capture during conflict tasks in sensory areas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553774,Neuropsychologia,2019 05 19,"Studies that aim to understand the neural correlates of response conflicts commonly probe frontal brain areas associated with controlled inhibition and decision processes. However, untimely fast conflict errors happen even before these top-down processes are engaged. The dual-route model proposes that during conflict tasks, as soon as the stimulus is presented, two early processes are immediately at play. The task-relevant and task-irrelevant processes generate either compatible responses, when all stimulus features align, or incompatible responses, when stimulus features are in conflict. We aimed to find a neural substrate of these two processes by means of relating the quality of the representation of stimulus features in visual and somatosensory brain areas to responses in conflict tasks. Participants were scanned using fMRI while performing somatosensory and visual Simon tasks. The fMRI data were then analysed using a MVPA in early visual and somatosensory cortices. In agreement with our hypotheses, results suggest that the sensory representation of the task-relevant and task-irrelevant features drive erroneous trials. These results demonstrate that traces of response conflicts can arise already in sensory brain areas and that the quality of the representations in these regions can account for an early response capture by irrelevant stimulus features.",Effects of pregnancy experience on ovarian senescence and longevity in Hatano rats bred for high- and low-avoidance learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553773,Experimental gerontology,2019 02 12,"We investigated the effects of pregnancy experience on ovarian senescence and longevity using two inbred strains of Hatano rats. These strains have been selectively bred for high- and low-avoidance animals (HAA and LAA, respectively), but the HAA line has a slower onset of ovarian senescence and a shorter lifespan compared with the LAA line. The onset of abnormal estrous cycles and survival curves were compared between nulliparous and parous rats in each line. In the HAA line, pregnancy experience did not change the onset of ovarian senescence but increased longevity. This suggests that a pituitary tumor, which is a causal factor for accelerated mortality in this line, developed slowly in parous rats. In the LAA line, pregnancy experience delayed the onset of ovarian senescence and reduced the incidence of mammary tumors but did not increase longevity because of an increased frequency of constipation with megacolon. These data suggest that the effects of pregnancy experience on ovarian senescence and longevity depend on the reproductive characteristics of the rat strains.",CX3CL1-Fc treatment prevents atherosclerosis in Ldlr KO mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553772,Molecular metabolism,2019 06 09,Atherosclerosis is a major cause of cardiovascular disease.

Additionally, we aim to observe if combining exercise training in TFAM transgenic mice prior to HLS has a synergistic effect in preventing skeletal muscle atrophy. Male C57BL/6J-based transgenic mice (12-14 weeks old) overexpressing TFAM were assigned to a control (T-Control), 7-day HLS (T-HLS), and 2-week exercise training prior to 7-day HLS (T-Ex + HLS) groups. These groups were compared to male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice (12-14 weeks old) assigned to Control, 7-day HLS (HLS), 2-week exercise training prior to 7-day HLS (Ex + HLS), and 2-week exercise training (Ex). Overexpressing TFAM results in a decrease of 8.3% in soleus and 2.6% in gastrocnemius muscle weight to bodyweight ratio after only HLS compared to wild-type mice incurring a loss of 27.1% in soleus and 21.5% in gastrocnemius muscle after HLS. Our data indicates TFAM may play a critical role in protecting skeletal muscle from disuse atrophy and is correlated with increased expression of antioxidants (SOD-2) and potential redox balance. TFAM may be an attractive molecule of interest for potential, future therapeutic development. NEW AND NOTEWORTHY: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a TFAM overexpression transgenic mouse model is being used in the analysis of disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Here we provide evidence of a potential role for TFAM in diminishing skeletal muscle atrophy.",Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol upregulates fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) via PPARα induction: A possible evidence for the cancellation of PPARβ/δ-mediated inhibition of PPARα in MDA-MB-231 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553767,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2019 01 24,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors, with three characterized subtypes: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. The biological correlation between the two PPAR subtypes PPARα and γ and carcinogenesis is well-characterized; however, substantially less is known about the biological functions of PPARβ/δ. PPARβ/δ has been reported to repress transcription when PPARβ/δ and PPARα or PPARγ are simultaneously expressed in some cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells express functional levels of PPARβ/δ. We have previously reported that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), a major cannabinoid component of the drug-type cannabis plant, can stimulate the expression of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) via upregulation of PPARα expression in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Although the possibility of an inhibitory interaction between PPARα and PPARβ/δ has not been demonstrated in MDA-MB-231 cells, we reasoned if this interaction were to exist, Δ9-THC should make PPARα free to achieve FA2H induction. Here, we show that a PPARβ/δ-mediated suppression of PPARα function, but not of PPARγ, exists in MDA-MB-231 cells and Δ9-THC causes FA2H induction via mechanisms underlying the cancellation of PPARβ/δ-mediated inhibition of PPARα, in addition to the upregulation of PPARα."

Although several drugs are available to manage T2D, problems associated with person-to-person variability in drug efficacy and potential side-effects remain unresolved. Owing to the emerging role of the gut microbiome in obesity and T2D, the interaction between gut microbes and anti-diabetic drugs and its influence on drugs' functions remains of immediate research interest. On one hand, drugs can manipulate gut microbiome composition and metabolic capacity. Conversely, the metabolic activities of the microbiome and its metabolites can also influence drug metabolism and effects. Hence, understanding this bi-directional drug-microbiome interaction and how it influences the clinical outcomes of antidiabetic drugs can pave the way to develop next-generation strategies to ameliorate diabetes. This review presents evidences demonstrating the putative interactions between anti-diabetic drugs and the gut microbiome, and discusses the potential of microbiome modulators to manipulate drug-microbiome interactions and the drug metabolism.",Blind fMRI source unmixing via higher-order tensor decompositions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553751,Journal of neuroscience methods,2019 02 06,"The growing interest in neuroimaging technologies generates a massive amount of biomedical data of high dimensionality.

Men with clinical low-risk disease can receive active surveillance to safely preserve quality of life, provided that the risk of an undetected aggressive cancer can be managed. Thus, prediction of a tumor's metastatic potential, ideally using only a biopsy sample, is critical to choosing appropriate treatment. We previously proposed and verified a metastasis potential score (MPS) based on regions prone to copy number alterations in metastatic prostate cancer; MPS is highly predictive of metastatic potential in primary tumors. We developed a novel, targeted postligation amplification sequencing approach, which we call the next-generation copy number alteration assay, to efficiently interrogate 902 genomic sites that belong to 194 genomic regions used in the MPS calculation. The assay is designed to work with the latest generation of sequencing platforms to produce estimates of copy number alteration events. The assay's technical reproducibility, robustness to low starting genomic material, and accuracy have been verified. The assay performed very well on cell lines, a cohort of prostate cancer surgical research samples, and matched punched biopsy samples, making it a significant step toward incorporating sequencing techniques for prostate cancer evaluation.",Chronic hepatitis C infection - Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in the era of direct acting antivirals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553749,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 06 13,"Significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection and its associated fibrosis have revolutionized treatment of these patients over the last several years. Liver biopsy, the gold standard diagnostic method for evaluating liver fibrosis level, was routinely used prior to initiation of hepatitis C therapy, placing patients at an inherent risk of adverse events. The recent advent of noninvasive serologic and nonserologic measures of hepatic fibrosis level has reduced the need for liver biopsy significantly, thereby minimizing its associated risks. These noninvasive methods have been extensively studied in the era of interferon therapies and are increasingly recognized in the realm of direct acting antiviral agents as well. Their validation of use after having achieved a sustained virologic response is yet to occur, but the future remains promising. This review focuses on the various non-invasive diagnostic modalities of liver fibrosis and discusses how they can be applied to the care of patients undergoing direct acting antiviral therapy for hepatitis C. In the constantly evolving landscape of hepatitis C therapy, the review underscores the important prognostic value of fibrosis staging prior to HCV treatment and suggests potential uses for non-invasive fibrosis assessment following successful HCV eradication.",Clinical Comparison Between Shortening Osteotomy of the Proximal Phalanx Neck and Arthrodesis in Hammer Toe Surgery at Mid-TermFollow-Up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553747,The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 03 09,"The treatment of hammer toe has been advocated for years, and many procedures have been proposed with skeletal and soft tissue intervention.

To experiment with a technique that respects the anatomy and joint function, we used a distal subtraction osteotomy of the proximal phalanx neck. We compared a series of 78 patients, divided in to 2 groups: 38 (48.7%) treated with arthrodesis and 40 (51.3%) with shortening osteotomy. Patients were aged 22 to 78 years, with a mean final follow-up period of 56.6 (range 24 to 96) months. For clinical evaluation, we used the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score, and a subjective rating scale. The results were comparable between the 2 techniques; however, we report faster functional recovery in the group treated with shortening osteotomy (p < .0001), with an adjunctive advantage of preserving the integrity of the proximal interphalangeal joint.

By resolving read-mapping ambiguities, which occur for a large fraction of ribosome footprints and distort quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found that obligate components of multiprotein complexes are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. By systematically interrogating the impact of gene dosage variations in budding yeast, we found a general lack of negative feedback regulation protecting the normally precise rates of subunit synthesis.

This work uses he laws obeyed by molecules during a reaction, translates them into mathematical equations, and then compares the results predicted by the equations to data obtained in laboratory conditions. This can inform whether the mechanism used to create the mathematical model is consistent with experimental results. Philip K. Maini has contributed to several significant results in the field of mathematical modelling in enzyme kinetics. Along with his collaborators, he has published results analyzing and extending the Quasi-Steady State Assumption, applying it to special enzyme reactions, and considering special conditions. This review paper will provide an overview of the contributions made by PK Maini to the field of modelling enzyme kinetics, summarize the main results and discuss their significance.",Comparison of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction with serological tests and culture for diagnosing human brucellosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553722,Journal of infection and public health,2019 05 10,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease with various clinical presentations and early diagnosis is crucial to avoid severe complications.

Even though there are various existing anti-inflammatory therapies, which are not enough to control the inflammation caused due to various contributing factors such as anti-inflammatory genes and antioxidant enzymes. This leads to an urgent need of novel drug delivery systems to combat the oxidative stress. This review gives a brief insight into the biological factors involved in causing oxidative stress, one of the emerging hallmark feature in CRDs and particularly, highlighting recent trends in various novel drug delivery carriers including microparticles, microemulsions, microspheres, nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, solid lipid nanocarriers etc which can help in combating the oxidative stress in CRDs and ultimately reducing the disease burden and improving the quality of life with CRDs patients. These carriers improve the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability to the target site.

Melatonin research has expanded rapidly, affecting an impressive enhancement in the understanding of its functions in plants and animals. However, far less focus has been directed to clarifying the nature of melatonin dose-response relationships. Here, we provide substantial evidence of melatonin-induced biphasic dose-response relationships from a series of independent studies involving plant and animal models. The characteristics of these dose responses are similar to those of the broad toxicological and pharmacological hormesis literature. Our analysis suggests that melatonin, in coordination with the circadian rhythms, is involved in stress adaptive responses, and may act as a conditioning agent protecting organisms against subsequent health threats within an hormetic framework. Incorporation of melatonin-induced hormesis in research protocols has the potential to enhance the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, cancers, and other animal diseases, as well as protection against environmental stress and to increase plant productivity.",Longitudinal trajectories of hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to episodic retrieval: Effects of age and puberty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553718,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 06 12,"The current study investigated longitudinal change in hippocampal and prefrontal contribution to episodic retrieval. Functional neuroimaging data were collected during an item-context association memory task for children between the ages of 8 and 14 with individuals scanned 1-3 times over the course of 0.75-3.7 years (Timepoint 1 N = 90; Timepoint 2 N = 83, Timepoint 3 N = 75). We investigated developmental changes in functional activation associated with episodic retrieval (correct item-context > incorrect item-context contrast) and asked whether pubertal changes contributed to developmental changes in pattern of activation. Non-linear developmental trajectories were observed. In the hippocampus, activation decreased with age during childhood and then increased into early adolescence. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, activation was largely absent initially, but quickly accelerated over time. Independent of age, changes in pubertal status additionally predicted increases in item-context activation in initially older children, and decreases in initially younger children across both regions and two indicators of puberty: the Pubertal Development Scale and salivary testosterone. These findings suggest that changes in both age and pubertal status uniquely contribute to memory-related activation, and the timing of pubertal onset may play an important role in the neural mechanisms supporting memory retrieval.",Surrogacy and ethics in women with cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553717,Best practice & research.

Cardiovascular imaging,2019 02 08,"Traditional approaches to the characterization of secondary or functional mitral regurgitation (MR) have largely ignored the critical importance of the left ventricle (LV). We propose that patients with secondary MR represent a heterogenous group, which can be usefully subdivided based on understanding that the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) is dependent on left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). According to the Gorlin hydraulic orifice equation, patients with heart failure, an LV ejection fraction of 30%, an LVEDV of 220 to 250 ml, and a regurgitant fraction of 50% would be expected to have an EROA of ≈0.3 cm2 independent of specific tethering abnormalities of the mitral valve leaflets. The MR in these patients is proportionate to the degree of LV dilatation and can respond to drugs and devices that reduce LVEDV. In contrast, patients with EROA of 0.3 to 0.4 cm2 but with LVEDV of only 160 to 200 ml exhibit degrees of MR that are disproportionately higher than predicted by LVEDV. These patients appear to preferentially benefit from interventions directed at the mitral valve. Our proposed conceptual framework explains the apparently discordant results from 2 recent randomized controlled trials of mitral valve repair. The MITRA-FR (Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation) trial enrolled patients who had MR that was proportionate to the degree of LV dilatation, and during long-term follow-up, the LVEDV and clinical outcomes of these patients did not differ from medically-treated control subjects. In comparison, the patients enrolled in the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial had an EROA ≈30% higher but LV volumes that were ≈30% smaller, indicative of disproportionate MR. In these patients, transcatheter mitral valve repair reduced the risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure, and these benefits were paralleled by a meaningful decrease in LVEDV. Thus, characterization of MR as proportionate or disproportionate to LVEDV appears to be critical to the selection of an optimal treatment for patients with chronic heart failure and systolic dysfunction.",Histopathologic Characterization of Peripheral Arteries in Subjects With Abundant Risk Factors: Correlating Imaging With Pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553660,JACC.

Old age, underlying heart disease, and coronary risk factors are known risk factors for heart failure. Thus, congestive heart failure is rarely considered as a differential diagnosis of chronic cough in a previously healthy young person. However, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) can result in such a situation. A case of a previously healthy 27-year-old woman with TIC is described herein. On the first examination, the patient presented with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by persistent tachyarrhythmia. Cardiomyopathy subsided with only heart rate control; therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having TIC. TIC can develop irrespective of age and underlying heart disease. The long-term outcome may be good, and LV systolic function recovers in most patients following resolution of arrhythmia. Physicians need to consider TIC as a differential diagnosis in patients of any age who present with heart failure, because prompt treatment generally leads to resolution of symptoms and ventricular function.","Off-clamp vs on-clamp robotic partial nephrectomy: Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes from a propensity-score matching between two high-volume centers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553632,European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2018 12 16,"Aim of the study was to compare perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after off-clamp vs on-clamp robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN).",Long-term outcomes following minimally invasive and open esophagectomy in Finland: A population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553631,European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,2019 05 21,Studies of long-term survival after minimally invasive and open esophagectomy are needed.

There are no prominent risk factors for GIB but climatic conditions and life style are related to this infection in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore timely diagnosis and early treatment is a challenge. Herein, we present an unusual case of gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis in a 54-year-old male, initially misdiagnosed as colon cancer.

The pentacyclic BBPI scaffold was constructed from N-tert-butoxycarbonylpyrrole by sequential and regioselective functionalization of the pyrrole core using directed lithiation, conventional electrophilic substitution, and palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Further N-alkylation of the scaffold followed by selective deprotection of the O-isopropyl group produced a range of N-substituted BBPI derivatives. The BBPIs thus prepared exhibited potent topoisomerase I inhibitory activity in DNA relaxation assays. The activities of BBPIs were higher than those of lamellarin D and camptothecin; they showed potent and selective antiproliferative activity in the panel of 39 human cancer cell lines established by Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. COMPARE analyses indicated that the inhibition patterns of the BBPIs correlated well with those of the known topoisomerase I inhibitors such as SN-38 and TAS-103.

The temporal evolution reflects higher incidence during the winter season (January). The most common exposure factor among the cases was the consumption of dried pork sausage (50% of the cases interviewed). The 58 typed strains were all of the biotype 4, serotype O:3, except one O:9. We distinguished 21 pulsotypes grouped in 8 clusters with a similarity of 97%. Over a number of years, a substitution of some pulsotypes for others was observed. Yersiniosis has a high incidence in our area, with a clear seasonality of winter predominance. It affects very young children, in particular. The strains are of the same serotype, but the variety of pulsotypes changed over time. As an exposure factor for further analytical studies, the consumption of some pork products is proposed, without ruling out other factors."

The objectives of this position paper are firstly to emphasize the link between skeletal muscle loss and malnutrition-related conditions and secondly to raise awareness for the timely identification of loss of skeletal muscle mass and function in high risk populations. Thirdly to recognize the need to implement appropriate nutritional strategies for prevention and treatment of skeletal muscle loss and malnutrition across the healthcare continuum. Malnutrition needs to be addressed clinically as a muscle-related disorder and clinicians should integrate nutritional assessment with muscle mass measurements for optimal evaluation of these two interrelated entities to tailor interventions appropriately.

Experiments probing stress effects on hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents have revealed modulatory factors and physiological mechanisms by which acute stress can enhance long-term memory. However, extending these findings and mechanisms to understand when stress will enhance declarative memory in humans faces important challenges. This review synthesizes human and rodent studies of stress and memory, examining translational gaps related to measurements of declarative memory and stress responses in humans. Human studies diverge from rodent research by assessing declarative memories that may not depend on the hippocampus and by measuring peripheral rather than central stress responses. This highlights opportunities for future research across species, including assessing stress effects on hippocampal-dependent memory processes in humans and relating peripheral stress responses to stress effects on the function of memory-related brain regions in rodents. Together, these investigations will facilitate the translation of stress effects on memory function from rodents to humans and inform interventions that can harness the positive effects of stress on long-term memory.",Maternal reading fluency is associated with functional connectivity between the child's future reading network and regions related to executive functions and language processing in preschool-age children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553572,Brain and cognition,2019 05 01,"Reading is an acquired skill that relies on cognitive-control and language abilities. Home reading environment has been positively correlated with activation in parietal-temporal-occipital association cortex supporting mental imagery and narrative comprehension during a story-listening task in preschool-age children. However, the degree to which maternal reading ability influences early brain development, specifically neural circuits involved with language and reading, is not well understood. The current study explored the relationship between maternal reading ability and functional connectivity within the language network, between the language network and networks related to cognitive control and visual processing, as well as between the language network and the entire brain (network-to-voxel analysis) of preschool-age children during a resting state. Thirteen 4-year-old girls and their mothers participated in this study, involving cognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging, including a resting-state scan. Maternal reading ability was negatively correlated with functional connectivity within the child's language network at rest, and also with areas involved in visual processing, cognitive-control, and semantics.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of oral administration of antigen combined with SF-10 (antigen-SF-10) on systemic and local immunity. Oral administration of ovalbumin, a model antigen, combined with SF-10 enhanced ovalbumin uptake into intestinal antigen presenting MHC II+CD11c+ cells and their CD11b+CD103+ and CD11b+CD103- subtype dendritic cells, which are the major antigen presenting subsets of the intestinal tract, more efficiently compared to without SF-10. Oral vaccination with influenza hemagglutinin vaccine (HAv)-SF-10 induced HAv-specific IgA and IgG in the serum, and HAv-specific secretory IgA and IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal washes, gastric extracts and fecal material; their levels were significantly higher than those induced by subcutaneous HAv or intranasal HAv and HAv-SF-10 vaccinations. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay showed high numbers of HAv-specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells in the gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosal lymphoid tissues after oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10, but no or very low induction following oral vaccination with HAv alone. Oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10 provided protective immunity against severe influenza A virus infection, which was significantly higher than that induced by HAv combined with cholera toxin. Oral vaccination with HAv-SF-10 was associated with unique cytokine production patterns in the spleen after HAv stimulation; including marked induction of HAv-responsive Th17 cytokines (e.g., IL-17A and IL-22), high induction of Th1 cytokines (e.g., IL-2 and IFN-γ) and moderate induction of Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-5).

In this collaborative study, the impact of lower measurement volume on the accuracy and precision of particle count was evaluated using 2, 5, 10, and 25-μm polystyrene count standards for the validity of test with reduced sample volumes. Good accuracy (3000 particles/mL ± 10%) was obtained at all measurement volumes, and the inter-run variability (RSD) was the same levels between 5 and 1 mL. Although the inter-run variability increased at 0.2 mL, it was below 5%.

Fibroblasts are a main component of the myocardial stroma. We hypothesize that fibroblasts, by compacting the surrounding collagen network, support the self-organization of cardiomyocytes into a functional syncytium. With a focus on early self-organization processes in EHM, we studied the molecular and biophysical adaptations mediated by defined populations of fibroblasts and embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in a collagen type I hydrogel. After a short phase of cell-independent collagen gelation (30 min), tissue compaction was progressively mediated by fibroblasts. Fibroblast-mediated tissue stiffening was attenuated in the presence of cardiomyocytes allowing for the assembly of stably contracting, force-generating EHM within 4 weeks. Comparative RNA-sequencing data corroborated that fibroblasts are particularly sensitive to the tissue compaction process, resulting in the fast activation of transcription profiles, supporting heart muscle development and extracellular matrix synthesis. Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) measurements revealed nonlinear strain stiffening at physiological strain amplitudes (>2%), which was reduced in the presence of cells. The nonlinear stress-strain response could be characterized by a mathematical model. Collectively, our study defines the interplay between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes during human heart muscle self-organization in vitro and underscores the relevance of fibroblasts in the biological engineering of a cardiomyogenesis-supporting viscoelastic stroma. We anticipate that the established mathematical model will facilitate future attempts to optimize EHM for in vitro (disease modelling) and in vivo applications (heart repair).","Studying Transcriptional Enhancers: The Founder Fallacy, Validation Creep, and Other Biases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553552,Trends in genetics : TIG,2019 01 22,"Transcriptional enhancers play a major role in regulating metazoan gene expression.

Ram placements occurred between the early and late spring and there was analysis of whether this polymorphism is associated with other nucleotide substitutions. In each of the eight farms where the study was conducted (named F1-F8), 150 ewes (50 with A/A, A/G and G/G genotypes) were selected. In each group of 150 ewes, eight males were joined with ewes on the following dates: 25 March (T1) for F1-F2, 15 April (T2) for F3-F4, 5 May (T3) for F5-F6, and 1 June (T4) for F7-F8. The lambing dates and number of new born lambs were recorded until 220 days after joining rams with ewes. The ewes with G/G or A/G genotypes had a greater fertility rate compared with those with A/A in T1, T2 (P < 0.01), and in T3 and T4 (P < 0.05).

Here, we show that a pulvino-cortical circuit model, composed of the pulvinar and two cortical areas, captures several physiological and behavioral observations related to the macaque pulvinar. Effective connections between the two cortical areas are gated by the pulvinar, allowing the pulvinar to shift the operation regime of these areas during attentional processing and working memory and resolve conflict in decision making. Furthermore, cortico-pulvinar projections that engage the thalamic reticular nucleus enable the pulvinar to estimate decision confidence. Finally, feedforward and feedback pulvino-cortical pathways participate in frequency-dependent inter-areal interactions that modify the relative hierarchical positions of cortical areas. Overall, our model suggests that the pulvinar provides crucial contextual modulation to cortical computations associated with cognition.",Dissociating the effect of flavor and nicotine in smokeless tobacco products using electroencephalography: The case of wintergreen flavors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553545,Addictive behaviors,2019 02 01,"The increased consumption of tobacco products in recent years has been linked, among other factors, to the presence of added flavors. Although flavors are important in explaining consumption, their effects in the brain have until now been unexplored. In the present study, we investigated how electrophysiology can serve to dissociate the effects of nicotine and flavor. Participants attended 4 sessions (2-by-2 factorial design, with flavor and nicotine as within-subject factors), in each session an oddball task was performed before and after smokeless tobacco consumption. We explored the dissociation of neural responses to flavor and nicotine. While event-related potentials did not show modulation due to flavors, time-frequency showed a flavor-nicotine dissociation. Low-frequency activity (delta, theta and alpha) showed only effects of nicotine, and high-frequency activity (beta1, beta2 and gamma) showed effects only susceptible to flavor. Flavors in smokeless tobacco not only made the product more desirable but also triggered the allocation of cognitive resources. This long-lasting effect of flavor may enhance the addictive potential of the tobacco product. Further research is being developed to determine the precise role of flavors in contributing to addiction. This is the first study investigating the neural effects of flavor (specifically wintergreen) in smokeless tobacco products. By understanding the effects of flavors in the brain we can explain the precipitants of tobacco consumption behaviors, and the addictive potential of flavors.

In addition, analysis of risk factors for the disease was hardly performed with proper control for vaccination effects and potential differences in exposure to the virus. Data from the LSD epidemics in six Balkan countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Albania) affected during 2016 were analyzed to determine vaccine effectiveness (VE) and risk factors for LSD infection at the farm level. Vaccination was performed along the occurrence of the epidemics and thus vaccination status of some of the farms changed during the epidemic. To allow for this, left truncated and right censored survival analysis was used in a mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression model to calculate VE and risk factors for LSD. The results indicated of an average VE of 79.8% (95% CI: 73.2-84.7)) in the six countries, with the lowest VE of 62.5% documented in Albania and up to VE of more than 97% as documented in Bulgaria and Serbia. Analysis of time from vaccination to development of protective immunity showed that VE mostly developed during the first 14 days after vaccination. Data from Greece showed that the vaccination adjusted hazard ratio for LSD was 5.7 higher in grazing farms compared to non-grazing farms. However, due to a difference in geographical location of grazing and non-grazing farms and higher vaccination rate in non-grazing farms, this effect can be at least partly attributed to indirect protection due to herd immunity provided by surrounding vaccinated farms."

In response, the protein engineering community has begun to explore alternative high-binding protein scaffolds as antibody mimics. In this short review I will summarise the generation, modification, and application of emerging antibody fragments and synthetic antibody mimics, with a focus on their use as drug carriers. The review aims to highlight the advantages of antibody mimics, and how they could be employed to overcome the issues and limitations of traditional ADCs.",Enzymatic strategies for (near) clinical development of antibody-drug conjugates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553518,Drug discovery today. Technologies,2019 03 25,"Target-specific killing of tumor cells with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is an elegant concept in the continued fight against cancer. However, despite more than 20 years of clinical development, only four ADC have reached market approval, while at least 50 clinical programs were terminated early. The high attrition rate of ADCs may, at least in part, be attributed to heterogeneity and instability of conventional technologies. At present, various (chemo)enzymatic approaches for site-specific and stable conjugation of toxic payloads are making their way to the clinic, thereby potentially providing ADCs with increased therapeutic window.",Minireview: Addressing the retro-Michael instability of maleimide bioconjugates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553517,Drug discovery today. Technologies,2019 03 25,"Bioconjugation, the modification of biological macromolecules such as proteins, is an up and coming area in the field of chemical biology. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), combining the antigen-selectivity of natural antibodies with the cytotoxic potency of small molecule drugs, are a powerful therapeutic technology. Four such constructs are currently on the market for cancer therapy. However, the conjugation methodology employed in these therapeutics is far from ideal. Herein we provide an overview on methods that attempt to increase the safety and efficacy of ADCs via ""self-hydrolysing maleimides"" or by improving the stability of maleimide-conjugates by other means. We find that some very promising reagents have been reported, however the mechanism by which each of these reagents acts is not clear, thus limiting rational design for some strategies.","Recent, non-classical, approaches to antibody lysine modification.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553516,Drug discovery today.

Technologies,2019 03 25,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) constructed using site-selective labelling methodologies are likely to dominate the next generation of these targeted therapeutics. To this end, disulfide bridging has emerged as a leading strategy as it allows the production of highly homogeneous ADCs without the need for antibody engineering. It consists of targeting reduced interchain disulfide bonds with reagents which reconnect the resultant pairs of cysteine residues, whilst simultaneously attaching drugs. The 3 main reagent classes which have been exemplified for the construction of ADCs by disulfide bridging will be discussed in this review; bissulfones, next generation maleimides and pyridazinediones, along with others in development.",Drawing lessons from the clinical development of antibody-drug conjugates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553514,Drug discovery today. Technologies,2019 03 25,"The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) field has seen a remarkable expansion in the number of entrants in clinical studies. Many of these agents employ newer conjugation technologies that have been developed over the last decade that confer various attributes to the ADCs prepared with them, including stability, potency, and homogeneity. In many cases, these new ADCs appear demonstrably superior to earlier technologies in preclinical models of activity and toxicology, but the degree to which these improvements will translate to the clinic is only starting to be seen. Many of these technologies are now competing head-to-head by targeting the same antigen in similar patient populations, allowing for a direct comparison of their clinical performance properties. As lessons from these experiences feed back into discovery research, future iterations of ADC design may be expected to bring improved therapeutics into the clinic.","Body Mass Index, Change in Weight, Body Weight Variability and Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (from the ACCORD Trial).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553512,The American journal of cardiology,2019 01 28,"Weight management is highly recommended to patients with diabetes mellitus. However, this prescription is often characterized by weight fluctuations. It remains unclear the effects of weight fluctuations on outcomes in diabetes mellitus. We used the public use dataset from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial to assess the effects of baseline weight, change in weight, and body weight variability (BWV) on outcomes. The ACCORD trial participant's weights were documented annually during the trial. Our primary predictor variables were baseline weight, change in body weight (Initial - final) and BWV defined as average successive variability in weight (average absolute difference between successive values) during the trial. Cox proportional hazards model was used. Out of the 10,251 ACCORD participants, 911(8.9%), 2985(29.1%), and 6355(62%) were normal weight, overweight, and obese. After a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up, 10.2% had the primary outcome (nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke or CV death), 4.3% had heart failure, 7% died, and 60.7% reported a microvascular complication. BWV was associated with the primary outcome, heart failure, death, and microvascular events in our full models which included BMI [HR (95%CI): 1.25(1.15 to 1.36), 1.59(1.45 to 1.75), 1.74(1.63 to 1.85) and 1.18(1.13 to 1.22), p < 0.0001 respectively). Participants who died were in the quartile that gained the most weight. In this post hoc analysis of ACCORD trial, body weight variability was significantly associated with poor outcomes independent of CVD risk factors and BMI. Our study is consistent with significant risk associated with weight fluctuations in patients with diabetes mellitus."

Many target nervous system and neuromuscular ion channels and so rapidly affect the behaviour of animals to which the toxin is applied or injected. Other modes of action have also been identified. Wasps, bees, flies, beetles and ants generate a rich arsenal of channel-active toxins, some of which offer selective pharmacological probes that target particular ion channels, while others act on more than one type of channel. Philanthotoxins from the digger wasp have been fruitful in adding to our understanding of ligand-gated ion channels both in the nervous system and at neuromuscular junctions. Fire ants produce the toxic alkaloid solenopsin, a molecule which has stimulated attempts to generate synthetic compounds with insecticidal activity. Apamin from bee venom targets calcium-activated potassium channels, which can in turn influence the release of neuropeptides. Melittin, another bee venom component, is a membrane-acting peptide. The saliva of the assassin bug contains toxins that target the voltage-gated calcium channels of their insect prey. Certain beetles produce diamphotoxin, a haemolytic peptide toxin with traditional use as an arrow poison and others generate leptinotarsin with similar properties. Mastoparan is a powerful peptide toxin present in the venom of wasps. Its toxic actions can be engineered out leaving a potent antimicrobial molecule of interest. In this short review we describe the actions of selected insect toxins and evaluate their potential as neuroactive pharmacological tools, candidate lead molecules for insect control and therapeutic candidates with potential antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-cancer applications.","Neonicotinoids: molecular mechanisms of action, insights into resistance and impact on pollinators.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553491,Current opinion in insect science,2018 12 16,"Neonicotinoids are insecticides that target insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), exhibiting high selective toxicity to insects over vertebrates and good systemic activity in crop plants. For these reasons, neonicotinoids currently make up ∼30% of insecticide sales worldwide. However, due to their adverse impact on pollinators such as honey bees and bumble bees, neonicotinoids are being banned from the EU, and other countries may follow. It is therefore crucial to understand the mechanism underlying neonicotinoid actions on pollinators as well as on the nAChRs of pests, with a view to understanding their selectivity. Here we review the molecular mechanisms of neonicotinoid actions at an atomic level, through structural and resistance mechanism studies and propose relevant research topics for further studies on the future of pest management.",Opening the toolkit for genetic analysis and control of Anopheles mosquito vectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553490,Current opinion in insect science,2019 02 20,"Anopheles is the only genus of mosquitoes that transmit human malaria and consequently the focus of large scale genome and transcriptome-wide association studies.

Moreover, genome editing offers the potential to modify Anopheles population structure at local and global scale to provide complementary tools towards the ultimate goal of malaria elimination. Major breakthroughs in Anopheles genetic analysis came with the development of germline transformation and RNA interference technology. Yet, the field has been revolutionised again by precise genome editing now possible through site-specific nucleases.

Okaramines exhibit insecticidal activity on a broad range of insects. Hence, more insecticide leads were explored by fermenting the other fungi with okara, resulting in the isolations of meroterpenes and cyclic peptides as well as indole alkaloids with distinct skeletons. Most okaramines activate l-glutamate-gated chloride channels found only in invertebrate nervous systems and muscle cells. Other fungal products selectively modulate other invertebrate ligand-gated chloride channels. Recently, the okaramine biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated, providing new insights in structural features important for activity. Enhanced production of okaramine in okara points to the involvement of plant mediators in the production of insect modulators by plant associated microorganisms in the rhizosphere as a novel defense strategy.",Insect-inspired neuromorphic computing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553486,Current opinion in insect science,2018 12 16,"The steady improvement in the performance of computing systems seen for many decades is levelling off as the miniaturization of semiconducting technology approaches the atomic limit, facing severe physical and technological issues.

In this article, we argue that the nervous systems of insects in particular offer themselves as an ideal starting point for incorporation into realistic neuromorphic systems and review research in developing insect-inspired neuromorphic systems. We conclude with an exciting yet tangible vision of a full neuromorphic sensory-motor system where a liquid state machine modelling the function of the insect mushroom body links input to output and allows for amalgamation of the work discussed in a hierarchical framework of a full system inspired by the concept of how information flows through insects.","Synergistic agent and intracellular calcium, a successful partnership in the optimization of insecticide efficacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553485,Current opinion in insect science,2018 12 16,"Integrated Pest Management and Integrated Vector Management worldwide are developed in agriculture and public health to counteract and limit the exponential increasing development of insect resistance to insecticides.

Hans' algorithm and the immunohistochemical double expressor score (DES) for MYC and BCL2 were applied to all cases. A subset of fifty-eight cases were analyzed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific break apart probes for BCL6, MYC, BCL2, CCND1, BCL10 and MALT1 genes. Clinical records were available for all patients. The immunohistochemical study showed that, in our series of EN-DLBCLs, the Hans' subgroup and the DES differed significantly according to the site of origin. At FISH analysis, BCL6 and BCL2 were the most commonly rearranged genes in non-GC and in GC cases, respectively. Gastrointestinal lymphomas displayed the highest rate of gene rearrangements, often with MYC involvement. One testicular DLBCL showed BCL2/MYC double hit. At survival analysis, cerebral and testicular origin was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, Hans' subgroup and other immunohistochemical markers influenced patients' outcome.

In this study we evaluated the karyotypes obtained in a single institution to identify recurring cytogenetic abnormalities. We constructed evolutionary pathways to differentiate abnormalities present at the beginning of evolution from those that developed later in evolution. We then estimated genetic progression scores and the clinical impact of the cytogenetic abnormalities on survival. In addition, we also evaluated the clinical significance of MYC related abnormalities (translocations and numerical changes) in disease evolution and on survival.

The results showed that endogenous β-cells rarely regenerate in both conditions as evidenced by stagnant serum C-peptide levels and β-cell number in the pancreas, and the remaining α-cells did not transdifferentiate into β-cells by GABA treatment. Collectively, we concluded that monkey β-cells had relatively low regenerative potential compared with rodent counterpart and GABA treatment could not induce α-to-β-cell transdifferentitation.",Megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) mediates high glucose induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by activating LOX transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553442,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 20,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most devastating complications of diabetes mellitus. When exposed to high glucose (HG), retinal epithelial cells undergo profound alterations both morphologically and functionally in a well-conserved process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism governing HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells is not completely understood. Here we report that treatment with 25 mM glucose led to EMT in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) characterized by a simultaneous down-regulation of E-Cadherin (encoded by CDH1) and up-regulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (encoded by ACTA2). HG-induced EMT in RPEs was accompanied by augmented expression and enhanced nuclear enrichment of MKL1, a transcriptional modulator. In contrast, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or inhibition by CCG-1423 abrogated HG-induced EMT in RPEs. Of interest, MKL1 mediated the transcriptional activation of LOX, a mesenchymal marker, in RPEs in response to HG stimulation. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited by AP-1 to the proximal LOX promoter to promote LOX trans-activation likely through altering the chromatin structure. Finally, LOX depletion by siRNA or inhibition by aminopropionitrile in RPEs abolished HG-induced EMT. In conclusion, our data support a role for MKL1 in mediating HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells via epigenetic activation of LOX transcription.",Diuretic treatment of the patient with diabetes and heart failure. Role of SGLT2 inhibitors and similarities with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553441,Revista clinica espanola,2019 04 29,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have changed the concept of the effects that hypoglycemic drugs have on hearth failure (HF). For the first time, a therapeutic group has modified the evolution of HF. Its effect goes beyond glycemic control, and different theories have been postulated to justify this benefit. In the article we sent, we analyze the influence of the different pharmacological groups used in type 2 diabetes mellitus on HF, and we present the theory of the mechanism of action associated with the benefit of these drugs. In our opinion, this benefit in HF is secondary to its diuretic effect, specifically an effect very similar to carbon dioxide inhibitors. We think that our theory is novel, explains the mechanism of action and we have not found in the literature any article that explains the mechanism of action in such a precise way.",Preliminary investigation of teaching older adults the tuck-and-roll strategy: Can older adults learn to fall with reduced impact severity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553440,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 02,"Falls are common and potentially disastrous for older adults. A novel approach that could augment current fall prevention procedures is to teach older adults movement strategies to reduce the risk of injury. The purpose of the study was to determine whether older adults can learn a movement strategy (""tuck-and-roll"") that reduces fall impact severity. Learning was quantified with short-term acquisition, bilateral transfer and 1-week-retention. 14 healthy older individuals participated (63.9 ± 5.6 years) in the investigation. Participants were randomly assigned into either training group (n = 7) or active control group (n = 7). All participants performed standardized sideway falls at baseline, immediately post intervention and 1-week-retention tests. During the falling assessments, kinetic and kinematic impact severity parameters were measured. The results for short-term learning revealed that the training group showed greater reduction in hip impact force (33% reduction) than the control group (16% reduction). Furthermore, there was partial bilateral transfer effect and 1-week retention observed in the training group. The observations provide preliminary evidence that teaching tuck-and-roll strategy to older adults has potential effect. The observations provide preliminary evidence that older adults might reduce impact severity utilizing tuck-and-roll strategy during unpredictably-timed sideway falls.",Mechanotransduction of vocal fold fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells in the context of the vocal fold mechanome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553439,Journal of biomechanics,2019 06 11,"The design of cell-based therapies for vocal fold tissue engineering requires an understanding of how cells adapt to the dynamic mechanical forces found in the larynx. Our objective was to compare mechanotransductive processes in therapeutic cell candidates (mesenchymal stromal cells from adipose tissue and bone marrow, AT-MSC and BM-MSC) to native cells (vocal fold fibroblasts-VFF) in the context of vibratory strain. A bioreactor was used to expose VFF, AT-MSC, and BM-MSC to axial tensile strain and vibration at human physiological levels. Microarray, an empirical Bayes statistical approach, and geneset enrichment analysis were used to identify significant mechanotransductive pathways associated with the three cell types and three mechanical conditions. Two databases (Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were used for enrichment analyses. VFF shared more mechanotransductive pathways with BM-MSC than with AT-MSC. Gene expression that appeared to distinguish the vibratory strain condition from polystyrene condition for these two cells types related to integrin activation, focal adhesions, and lamellipodia activity, suggesting that vibratory strain may be associated with cytoarchitectural rearrangement, cell reorientation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In response to vibration and tensile stress, BM-MSC better mimicked VFF mechanotransduction than AT-MSC, providing support for the consideration of BM-MSC as a cell therapy for vocal fold tissue engineering. Future research is needed to better understand the sorts of physical adaptations that are afforded to vocal fold tissue as a result of focal adhesions, integrins, and lamellipodia, and how these adaptations could be exploited for tissue engineering.",Immune response in the relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice: The role of the NF-κB signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553438,Cellular immunology,2019 02 11,"Characteristics of the mouse model of relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (rEAE) closely resemble manifestations of multiple sclerosis in humans. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of inflammatory response, focusing on NF-κB pathway activation. Cytokine response in rEAE mice was multiphasic: the early phase was characterized by the increase in interferon-γ level in plasma. In the later stage, the level of interleukin-17, but not of interferon-γ, was increased. The early phase of rEAE was also accompanied by increased RelA/p65 phosphorylation at Ser276 in spleen cells, whereas the rEAE maintenance phase was characterized by RelA/p65 phosphorylation at Ser536 and IKK phosphorylation. The IKKα/β inhibitor reduced interleukin-17 and interferon-γ levels in plasma and alleviated rEAE symptoms. The IKKα/β inhibitor decreased IKK and p65(Ser536) phosphorylation, but doubled p65(Ser276) phosphorylation in rEAE mice. The increased RelA/p65(Ser276) phosphorylation coincided in time with the production of interferon-γ, Hsp72, and the early phase of IL-17 generation, whereas increased RelA/p65(Ser536) phosphorylation coincided with the activation of IKK, SAPK/JNK, and p53, as well as the late phase of IL-17 production, indicating the role of the RelA/p65 phosphorylation events in the induction and maintenance of rEAE.",Novel mTORC1 Mechanism Suggests Therapeutic Targets for COMPopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553437,The American journal of pathology,2019 03 29,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a large, multifunctional extracellular protein that, when mutated, is retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This retention elicits ER stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress, resulting in dysfunction and death of growth plate chondrocytes. While identifying the cellular pathologic mechanisms underlying the murine mutant (MT)-COMP model of pseudoachondroplasia, increased midline-1 (MID1) expression and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling was found. This novel role for MID1/mTORC1 signaling was investigated since treatments shown to repress the pathology also reduced Mid1/mTORC1. Although ER stress-inducing drugs or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in rat chondrosarcoma cells increased Mid1, oxidative stress did not, establishing that ER stress- or TNFα-driven inflammation alone is sufficient to elevate MID1 expression. Since MID1 ubiquitinates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of mTORC1, PP2A was evaluated in MT-COMP growth plate chondrocytes. PP2A was decreased, indicating de-repression of mTORC1 signaling. Rapamycin treatment in MT-COMP mice reduced mTORC1 signaling and intracellular retention of COMP, and increased proliferation, but did not change inflammatory markers IL-16 and eosinophil peroxidase. Lastly, mRNA from tuberous sclerosis-1/2-null mice brain tissue exhibiting ER stress had increased Mid1 expression, confirming the relationship between ER stress and MID1/mTORC1 signaling. These findings suggest a mechanistic link between ER stress and MID1/mTORC1 signaling that has implications extending to other conditions involving ER stress.","Tractor rollover fatalities, analyzing accident scenario.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553435,Journal of safety research,2018 12 16,"In many countries, traditional data sources for collecting injuries of workers covered by compulsory accident insurance have recently been integrated by new observatories whose results may differ.

We investigated food and water intake, body mass, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, plasma and liver biochemistry, hepatic protein and gene expression. There were no changes in body mass, food intake and glucose tolerance among the groups. The F group presented increased water intake and blood pressure associated with hepatic steatosis and elevated de novo lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation in the liver. Surprisingly, the C-MCT group also showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation in the liver, and the F-MCT group had no exacerbations of fructose-induced abnormalities, showing marked hepatic steatosis, lipogenesis de novo and hepatic inflammation.

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs); omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are known to have anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory properties respectively. The present study examines the effect of vitamin D deficiency on fatty acid composition and metabolism in a rat model. Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 8/group) as follows; control and vitamin D deficient (VDD). Diets (control: 1000 IU D3/kg diet; VDD: 0 IU D3/kg diet) were given from weaning and continued throughout pregnancy. Pregnant female rats were dissected on gestational day 20 to collect blood, liver and placenta. The VDD diet reduced maternal serum 25-hydroxyviatmin D3 levels (p < 0.001) as compared to control. Maternal vitamin D deficiency resulted in lower total weight gain and placental weight (p < 0.05 for both) during pregnancy. Animals from VDD group demonstrated higher arachidonic acid (AA) levels in both the liver and plasma (p < 0.05 for both) as compared to control. Liver, plasma and placental monounsaturated fatty acid levels (MUFA) were lower (p < 0.01 for all) while plasma total saturated fatty acids (SFA) (p = 0.05) were higher in the VDD group. Animals from the VDD group demonstrated lower ∆9-desaturase activity index (p < 0.01 for all) in the liver, plasma and placenta. The plasma ∆5-desaturase activity index (p < 0.05) was higher although no change was observed in the ∆6-desaturase activity index. However, the mRNA levels of liver ∆6-desaturase was lower (p < 0.05) in the VDD group. Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin D deficiency influences fatty acid desaturase activity and expression and therefore alters maternal fatty acid metabolism."

The reliability of the RSM models (first-order model, first model with interaction, the second-order model, and reduced model) was tested by fitting the data. A comparative analysis of the results derived from the models demonstrated that the reduced model was the best. According to modelling results, MCNCs dosage and contact time were found to be the most effective variables on the adsorption efficiency procedure, respectively. Also, pH had no significant effect on the adsorption uptake statistically. MCNC has the maximum adsorption efficiency (72%) when the contact time, adsorbent dosage, and initial concentration of CV were optimally set as 140 min, 1 g, and 77 mg/L, respectively. Quantity uptake of CV was evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models. Based on findings, Freundlich isotherm fitted well with the experimental results. Kinetic studies showed that the pseudo-first-order model fitted the best the experimental data, which indicated that the adsorption rate of CV molecules onto MCNC was time-dependent.

The CMF bio-adsorbent was applied to adsorb the heavy metal ions, such as Cu(II) and Ni(II), from aqueous solution. Results showed that the CMF adsorbent exhibited excellent adsorption capacity toward these ions and a higher selectivity for the Cu(II) removal based on surface complexation and electrostatic interaction mechanisms. Besides, the adsorption isotherm of Cu(II) fitted better with the Langmuir isotherm model. Moreover, the relationship between the charges and adsorption capacity of CMF to Cu(II) revealed that the enhanced adsorption capacity of CMF adsorbent can mainly attributed to its increased inner charges rather than surface charges, which can provide a new strategy for the further modification of cellulose-based adsorbent.",Fabrication of innovative thermoplastic starch bio-elastomer to achieve high toughness poly(butylene succinate) composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553390,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"Sustainable biodegradable polymers with high performances is the optimized alternatives for resolving environmental key issues evoked by petroleum-based polymer.

The toughness mechanism was explored by analyzing the properties variations for the TPS-TA and PBS matrix, and their interfacial adhesion, systematically. Effects of TA on the structure of TPS and compatibility for PBS were evaluated by FT-IR, viscosity measurement, DSC, DMA and SEM, respectively. They revealed that TA reduced the molecular weight of starch and shear viscosity of TPS were beneficial for TPS-TA uniformly dispersing in PBS matrix as ellipse feature with 0.5 um averaged diameter. Simultaneously, TA also served as coupling effect to improve the compatibility of TPS and PBS matrix, and induce the morphology of bio-composites to transform from ""sea-island"" structure to homogeneous phase. Interesting, TPS-TA could depress the crystallization capability of PBS by the results of DSC, XRD and POM, which evidenced that the variations in the crystallization properties of PBS matrix are not responded to the impact strength improvement of PBS/TPS-TA.

This strategy permitted the reduction of production times and avoided the use of organic solvents since biopolymer and acid were mixed in their solid form. Furthermore, the acid used as a crosslinker was citric acid, a natural policarboxylic acid, which promoted the reaction with chitosan, as shown by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). This crosslinking reaction led to the formation of homogeneous structures, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), indicating a good compatibility among all the components of the mixture and enhancing the mechanical properties of the resulting films. In particular, an increase of 80% for tensile strength and an increase of 3000% for elongation at break were observed for the crosslinked films. In addition to the homogeneous surface of citric acid-incorporated films, all the films showed hydrophobic character and the addition of citric acid led to a more amorphous structure.

Polyvinyl alcohol was used to further improve the electrolyte uptake of membrane, which was crucial for high electrical conductivity. The key merit of the as-prepared pCSA separator was embodied by its high porosity and wettability. Remarkable mechanical strength (58.7 MPa) and low thermal shrinkage stress (heating at 200 °C, 0.96 N) can be obtained by the fire resistant and tough SA in the composites. In addition, liquid electrolyte-soaked pCSA presented a high ionic conductivity of 1.34 mS cm-1 at 30 °C and an excellent interfacial compatibility with electrode. Due to its simple preparation and superior performance, pCSA separators may open up a new field of application for lithium-ion battery separators where high safety, low cost and biocompatibility are required.",Highly efficient hydrolysis of plant hemicelluloses by mixed-addenda Keggin-type (Mo-V-P)-heteropolyacids in diluted aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553386,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"Polyoxometalate (POM) catalyzed hydrolysis of wood and agro-crop hemicelluloses by mixed-addenda molybdic α-Keggin-type heteropolyacids (HPAs), such as molybdovanadophosphate heteropolyacids (Mo-V-P)-HPAs of series H(n+3)[PMo(12-n)VnO40] with n = 3 and 4 (so-called HPA-3 and HPA-4), have been assessed in comparison with conventional sulfuric acid catalysis. In very diluted (20 mM) aqueous solutions of (Mo-V-P)-HPAs, up to 90% of total biomass xylan was readily converted into soluble sugars (mono and oligosaccharides) after 60 min hydrolysis reaction at 130 °C, vs only ca. 25% conversion (as a max.) for sulfuric acid solutions. Low cellulose degradation in (Mo-V-P)-HPA solutions resulted in a significant improvement in the selectivity of hydrolysis (by up to 70%) compared with sulfuric acid. The oxidative capacity of (Mo-V-P)-HPAs caused increased dissolution of lignin during the hydrolysis reaction (by up to 13% over the sulfuric acid), thus providing favorable conditions for the sustainable recovery of cellulose fibers from the xylan-free residues in subsequent biorefining stages.",Gemcitabine anticancer activity enhancement by water soluble celecoxib/sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553385,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 21,"We investigated the complexation of celecoxib (CCB) into sulfobuthyl-ether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) for the realization of an inhalable dry-powder formulation containing gemcitabine (GEM) for lung anticancer therapy. Complexation increased the water solubility of CCB (0.003 mg/mL and 0.834 mg/mL for CCB free and complexed, respectively) and produced a quantitative dissolution of the drug within 15 min. The CCB/SBE-β-CD inclusion complex showed a high stability constant (8131 M-1) not influenced by the presence of GEM in solution. Two-dimensional NMR experiments and computational studies demonstrated that the pyrazole ring of CCB penetrates deeper into SBE-β-CD from the secondary rim. The aromatic rings are positioned at the edge of the cavity, establishing hydrogen bonds with the SBE-β-CD that stabilized the complex. CCB showed limited cytotoxic activity on A549 cell lines. Complexation significantly increased activity passing from 30% to 45% cell mortality. Moreover, CCB/SBE-β-CD strongly improved the cytotoxicity of GEM, observing about 60% of cell mortality for the combined formulation."

Thermal annealing offers a solution to address this problem. However, conventional characterization methods pose limitations regarding key structural features, especially for carbohydrate materials that possess similar biopolymer components. Herein, self-assembled chitosan-based sponges were prepared with and without annealing to compare their structural and physicochemical properties. The utility of Raman micro-imaging is reported with dye probe etching as an effective and facile method to reveal structural features for chitosan-based composite materials, before and after thermal annealing. We proposed that such composites undergo a structural change from a loosely packed to a more densely packed structure. As well, the multi-functional role of polyethylene oxide in the composites and the potential role of solvent etching was evaluated.

As reflected by a lowering of the glass temperature (Tg), the covalent grafting confers an improved mobility to the cellulose chains, by disrupting the initial H-bonds. In particular, it appears that the gain in free volume is tailored by the substituent structure and that acylating reagents consisting in a terminal bulky moieties spaced from CDA chains by a linear chain efficiently separate macromolecular chains without generating detrimental stiffening interactions (low Tg around 125 °C). Moreover, free-standing films easily prepared by solvent casting exhibit relevant water transport properties, which are closely dictated and tuned by the water solubility of the cellulose mixed ester.",A novel injectable in situ forming gel based on carboxymethyl hexanoyl chitosan/hyaluronic acid polymer blending for sustained release of berberine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553371,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 21,"An in situ forming gel based on simply blending carboxymethyl hexanoyl chitosan (CHC) with low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMW HA) was developed, without needing cross-linking, photopolymerization or thermal treatments. The CHC/LMW HA blends formed nanoparticles and then rapidly transformed into supermolecular hydrogels under stirring. The gel formation mechanism was examined by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The gels were injectable, cytocompatible and biodegradable, and showed shape-persistent behavior and adhesive property. Berberine, an anti-apoptotic and anti-arthritis naturally occurring compound, was encapsulated within the CHC/LMW HA gels. The gels demonstrated a pH-responsive characteristic which were able to release berberine in a sustained manner at pH 6.0 (simulating inflamed arthritic articular cartilage) and the degradation rates were accelerated at pH 7.4 (simulating healed normal tissue). The berberine-loaded gels effectively protected chondrocytes against sodium nitroprusside-induced apoptosis. The gels may be potentially useful as an injectable system for intra-articular drug delivery and cartilage tissue engineering.",LED 209 conjugated chitosan as a selective antimicrobial and potential anti-adhesion material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553370,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 21,"The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is becoming a global healthcare concern, and it urgently needs novel strategies to match the clinical challenge. In this work, we conjugated chitosan (CS) with LED 209, a highly selective inhibitor of QseC of GNB, to create the novel selective antimicrobial agent CS/LED. The data of FT-IR, NMR and elemental analysis for CS/LED conjugates proved the successful conjugation of CS with LED 209. Interestingly, the fluorescence signal detected in MDR-E. coli of CS/LED-FITC was about 2 times than that of CS-FITC at 3 h. The results shown that compared with CS, CS/LED exhibited higher selective antimicrobial on MDR-E. coli. Moreover, CS/LED exhibited the lower selectivity and cytotoxicity to mammalian cell than CS. Additionally, an unexpected enhancement of anti-adhesion activity against MDR-E. coli was determined by cellulose membrane coating CS/LED. The results demonstrated that CS/LED could reduce the adhesion of bacteria to the cellulose membrane by about 67.8%, while CS only reduced by about 45.3%. The dressings coated with CS/LED possessed the stronger ability to prevent microbial adhesion compared to the CS-coated dressing. Our present work firstly demonstrated that CS/LED had a highly selective activity and anti-adhesion activity against MDR-E. coli, which offered a potent and selective antimicrobial for combating multidrug-resistant GNB infections.",Testosterone- and vitamin-grafted cellulose ethers for sustained release of camptothecin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553368,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 21,"Camptothecin (CPT), a potent anticancer drug with known antiviral activity, is halted of clinical use.

Hereby, we propose the encapsulation of hydrophobic CPT in the inner core of cellulose nanoaggregates for sustained release with retaining of antiproliferative activity. Cellulose conjugates were synthesized by esterification of methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and (hydroxypropyl)methyl cellulose with testosterone, ergocalciferol and dl-α-tocopherol hemisuccinates. The degree of substitution attained ranged from 0.004 to 0.025 and no depolymerization was observed by size exclusion chromatography. ATR-FTIR and NMR spectroscopies confirmed grafting of testosterone and vitamins to celluloses. According to dynamic light scattering, it resulted in their self-assembly in aqueous medium as stable and slightly negatively charged nanoaggregates of 213 to 731 nm. Nanoaggregates formation was also assessed using transmission electron and atomic force microscopies. CPT was encapsulated in the cellulose nanoaggregates, achieving a content of 1.7-13.0 wt %.

Structures and properties of the adsorbents are characterized by SEM, EDXS, BET, XRD, FTIR XPS and Zeta potentials. The adsorption behavior of CCM-AC on tylosin is determined by batch and fixed-bed adsorption experiments, while their adsorption mechanism is also studied. The maximum adsorption capacity is 59.26 mg g-1, while the adsorption behavior is in accordance with the Langmuir equation and pseudo-second-order kinetics. These results confirm that the tylosin adsorption process is affected by chemical and physical interactions, and the adsorbent can be captured by tylosin with H-bond, electrostatic and π-π electron-donor-acceptor interaction.

Glycosidic angle C1'0 l'C2' was taken to be 114.0° and both O6 hydroxyl groups in inulobiose were fixed in a trans position, compelling the hydroxyl group to sterically favor comparison with the gauche orientation of sucrose structure.

The effect of carboxyethylation on the properties of cellulose materials and prepared MFC samples were investigated. Results showed that cellulose materials with different carboxyethyl content were obtained by controlling the chemical dosage. This reaction increased the water retention value, decreased the degree of polymerization and crystallinity, and changed the crystalline structure of cellulose. After pretreatment, the cellulose fibers were easier to be swelled and fibrillated, which greatly reduces the frequency of grinding. In addition, the diameter of the produced MFC decreased with the increase of carboxyl content. The charge density, suspension stability and transparency of MFC increased obviously due to the presence of carboxyethyl groups. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of carboxyethyl pretreatment for the preparation of MFC, which may help to enrich and promote the preparation and application of MFC.",Self-cross-linked melamine-formaldehyde-pectin aerogel with excellent water resistance and flame retardancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553364,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"Self-cross-linked aerogel based on pectin and melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) was fabricated via freeze-drying method using water as solvent, where pectin is structural material meanwhile acting as acid to catalyse the cross-linking of MF. The cross-linking reaction easily occurs without additional additives, which can be significantly accelerated at elevated temperatures, with a critical value of about 55 °C. The obtained aerogel shows network microstructures as observed with SEM. With increasing pectin content, the aerogel shows significantly increased compressive modulus. The compressive modulus of M10Pe5 arrives 23.2 MPa, the specific modulus of which arrives 188 MPa cm3/g, while pure MF aerogel are too fragile to keep intact after freeze-dried. The resulting aerogel has good thermal stability, excellent water resistance (can be second dried with limited strength loss) and low flammability.

DSC result indicated that two types of water, i.e., non-freezable water and freezable water, appeared in turn with the gradual increase of water content. Only the non-freezable water was responsible for the reduction of glass transition temperature (Tg), which leveled off at higher hydration levels. Structural analysis revealed that moisture could bring about a slight increase in the crystallinity of polymer due to alignment of hydrated and relaxed chitosan chains in the amorphous region. FTIR result showed that the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces existing in chitosan films varied slightly with water content. These observations suggest that changing the water content in such systems offers the possibility to control the microstructure as well as properties of polymers."

The networks were characterised using oscillatory analysis and drug release was performed using dissolution analysis (pH 7.4). Statistical modelling of the rheological properties and their relationship with drug release was performed using Analysis of Variance, Multivariate Analysis of Variance and stepwise regression. Modelling of drug release was performed using both the Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas-Sahlin models to understand the mechanism of drug release and the contributions of network swelling/erosion and diffusion on drug release. HEC and PVP were shown to significantly enhance the rheological properties of the networks. Furthermore, rheological synergy was observed whenever PVP was added to HEC and was due to non-covalent bond formation between these polymers. The magnitude of this synergy increased as functions of increasing concentrations of each polymer. Drug release was dependent on the concentration of HEC and independent of the presence of PVP. The release of metronidazole from networks composed of HEC 3% w/w and PVP (1-5% w/w) was controlled by network swelling/erosion whereas for the networks containing PVP and 5% and 10% w/w HEC, the dominant mechanism of drug release was diffusion. Limited correlation was observed between network rheological properties and drug release. It is suggested that this is due to dissociation of the HEC-PVP interactions and dissolution of PVP during drug release, resulting in a network structure whose properties are dominated by those of HEC. This is the first study that has statistically examined the role of binary polymer network viscoelasticity on drug release. Based on the findings of this study, caution should be shown when formulating aqueous networks with enhanced rheological properties as these effects may not necessarily contribute to other primary determinants of device performance, notably drug release.",Establishment of highly sensitive analytical method for chondroitin sulfate by flow injection chemiluminescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553351,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"A simple and sensitive flow injection chemiluminescence (FI-CL) method has been developed for the determination of chondroitin sulfate (CS).

Under optimum conditions, the calibration plot between CS concentration and the change of CL intensity was linear in the range of 25 ng/mL∼250 ng/mL. The limit of detection (LOD) was 5 ng/mL and the average relative standard deviation (RSD) of CL intensity was 2.5%.

Furthermore, the antioxidant property against hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and DPPH radicals was evaluated in vitro. 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl)-6-O-(2-aminobenzimidazole)acetyl chitosan chloride (2NPhMC) and 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl)-6-O-(1-butylimidazole)acetyl chitosan chloride (NBMC) showed more than 90% scavenging indices at 1.6 mg/mL. Besides, the antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea and Gibberella zeae was estimated using in vitro MIC and hypha measurements. Most of the quaternized chitosan derivatives especially with the long length alkyl chain and primary amino group showed an inhibitory index of > 85% at 1.0 mg/mL against Botrytis cinerea. Besides, the cytotoxicity of chitosan and all the quaternized chitosan derivatives was evaluated in vitro on HaCaT cells and all the quaternized chitosan derivatives bearing 6-O-imidazole exhibited low cytotoxicity.

The aim of the present study is to improve the understanding of the evolution of fibre properties and ultrastructure caused by this process at the plant cell wall scale. Initially, investigations of the mechanical performances of the flax cell walls by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in Peak Force mode revealed a significant increase (+33%) in the cell wall indentation modulus with retting time. Two complementary structural studies are presented here, namely using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). An estimation of the cellulose crystallinity index by XRD measurements, confirmed by NMR, shows an increase of 8% in crystallinity with retting mainly due to the disappearance of amorphous polymer. In addition, NMR investigations show a compaction of inaccessible cell wall polymers, combined with an increase in the relaxation times of the C4 carbon. This densification provides a structural explanation for the observed improvement in mechanical performance of the secondary wall of flax fibres during the field retting process.",Optical activity anisotropy of chitosan-based films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553347,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"The optical activity [α] of films of chitosan and chitosan acetate was studied.

The contribution of individual supramolecular structures to the overall optical activity of chitosan was estimated: [α]2 and [α]4 predominated for the fresh chitosan acetate films, while [α]4 did for the chitosan ones. The results of the numerical decomposition of indicatrices are in satisfactory agreement with X-ray diffractometry data.

In this paper, the microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) was used as a catalyst to graft the collagen peptide (COP) molecules on the amino group of carboxymethyl chitosan sulfate (CMCS) to improve the antioxidant effects. FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy were used to confirm the successful grafting of COP to CMCS. Degree of substitution (DS) of CMCS-COP could be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions. With the increase of concentration, the ability of each sample on scavenging capacity and reducibility tends to increase obviously. The results of anticoagulant experiments showed that the ability of CMCS and CMCS-COP with three different degrees of substitution on activated partial thrombin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) values were all increased to compare with the control group. No relevant cytotoxicity against NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts was found for the copolymers.

Thus, Ca-alginate was plasticized with PEG-methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and blended with the freeze-dried gel of A. vera and aqueous leaves extracts of M. oleifera. Ca-alginate-PEGMA scaffolds remained structurally stable almost four times longer than pure alginate materials, while a high porous architecture required for tissue scaffolding applications was maintained after alginate plasticization with PEGMA. A. vera increased the water uptake capability of the scaffolds and M. oleifera provided antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory properties and antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. Blending 1% (w/v) A. vera and 1% (w/v) M. oleifera with Ca-alginate-PEGMA, significantly increased the scaffolds cell proliferation (after 10 days of evaluation), compared with scaffolds without plant extracts. The experimental results showed that Ca-alginate-PEGMA/A. vera/M. oleifera biocomposites have great potential for wound healing applications.","Physicochemical properties, immunostimulatory activity of the Lachnum polysaccharide and polysaccharide-dipeptide conjugates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553344,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 03 21,"The physicochemical properties and the immunoregulatory actions in vitro of an exopolysaccharide from Lachnum (LEP) and its conjugation with a dipeptide (LEP-RH) were investigated aiming to improve their functional characteristics.

SEM results showed that LEP-RH had a rough surface and relatively loose distribution that different from LEP. Rheological studies of LEP and LEP-RH at the same concentration indicated that LEP and LEP-RH have similar shear-thinning behaviors and gel-like structures, while LEP-RH has a better thermal stability than LEP.

In the present work, iodine was complexed with hydroxylated lecithin (HL) to improve its stability and complexing efficiency for the composition with carboxymethly chitosan/sodium alginate. With the aid of microwave drying, hydroxylated lecithin complexed iodine/carboxymethly chitosan/sodium alginate (HLI/CMCS/SA) composite membranes with homogeneously distributions of HLI, high contents of activated iodine, good mechanical and swelling properties, proper water vapor permeability, pH controllable iodine release and excellent antibacterial properties were prepared.

Cheesman biomass as sustainable drug delivery biomaterial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553330,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 01 28,"Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) is one of the most important functional excipient in Pharmaceutical industries. A renewable biomass from Ensete glaucum (Roxb.) was investigated as a potential source of a novel functional MCC. MCC was prepared by a simple, dilute acid hydrolysis and characterized through FTIR, DSC, XRD, along with micromeritic studies. Functional properties such as packing, rearrangement, consolidation and compactibility of the prepared MCC were also evaluated in view of its application as drug delivery biomaterial. Results suggest that the prepared MCC exhibit properties comparable to commercially available standard MCC. From Kawakita and Heckel plots, it was observed that the new MCC consolidates better than the standard MCC. Disintegration efficiency test also indicates that the novel MCC functions as a better tablet disintegrant to the standard MCC indicating the potential of Ensete glaucum (Roxb.) as a green resource for preparation of the low cost, functional and sustainable carbohydrate polymer.",Conductive core-sheath calcium alginate/graphene composite fibers with polymeric ionic liquids as an intermediate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553329,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"In this study, polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) was synthesized and used in the wet spinning of calcium alginate (CaAlg) fiber. PIL was used as an intermediate to coat graphene with outer layer of CaAlg fiber to obtain conductive core-sheath CaAlg/Graphene (CaAlg/G-PIL) fibers. This proposed blend enhances the properties of the fiber due to the π-π and cation-π interactions between PIL and graphene, and the electrostatic interactions between PIL and CaAlg. The composition and chemical structure of the composite fibers were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The properties and applications of the composite fibers were characterized by tensile test and a series of electrical conductivity tests. The results show that the modification of PIL realizes non-covalent combination of CaAlg fiber with graphene, improving the electrical conductivity of the fiber.",Tough and conductive bio-based artificial nacre via synergistic effect between water-soluble cellulose acetate and graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553328,Carbohydrate polymers,2018 12 19,"Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural nacre, a binary artificial nacre with excellent mechanical performance, tensile strength and toughness was successfully constructed based on water-soluble cellulose acetate (WSCA) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO).

Treatment with PILs efficiently exposed the fibre surface, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition analysis revealed reductions in the lignin and hemicellulose contents in the treated fibres, promoting exposure of cellulose. The results correlated with the crystallinity index, which was greater in the treated fibres compared with that in the untreated fibres.

The effect of environmental relative humidity on the microstructure of CNC/PMMA nanofibers was investigated. Results showed that fiber surfaces of CNC/PMMA appeared smooth. Fibers had gradually decreasing diameters and lower diameter variations as CNC loading increased. The thermal property of CNC/PMMA nanofibers was also enhanced due to hydrogen bonding between PMMA molecular chains and CNC nanoparticles. Compared to pure PMMA fibers, the storage modulus and tensile strength of composite nanofibers were pronouncedly improved. By increasing relative humidity of the electrospinning environment, these nanofibers showed prominent nanoporous surfaces while the surface roughness and porosity of CNC/PMMA nanofibers increased. Furthermore, CNCs were critical to accelerating the evolution of pores and increasing surface roughness.

Three types of nanocellulose, including cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), bacterial cellulose fibers (BCs) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radical (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNs), were well-dispersed in the SA-PAM gel matrix. The hydrogels, obtained with a high water content (∼83%), exhibit a macroporous structure with a mean pore size of 60 ± 51 μm and high transparency. Comparative studies indicate that BCs are more effective for enhancing the hydrogels due to their higher aspect ratio, and the compressive strength of SA-PAM-BC hydrogel is 6.59 times higher than that of neat SA-PAM. Meanwhile, TOCNs are the best fillers for improving the adsorption capacity owing to the presence of a carboxyl group, and the adsorption capacity of SA-PAM-TOCN is more than 1.3-fold that in SA-PAM.

CNFs have been studied for their excellent oxygen and gas barrier properties; however, their performance rapidly decreases in the presence of moisture and higher humidity. CNCs are less sensitive to moisture due to their highly crystalline nature; however, coatings and films made of CNCs are much more prone to fracture due to their high brittleness. Our work demonstrates a unique composite barrier coating system of CNF and CNC that synergistically enables oil and grease resistance (a kit rating of 11) comparable to fluorochemicals. It also demonstrates a significant increase in air resistance (∼by a factor of about 300), and a reduction in oxygen transmission rate (∼by a factor of about 260) compared to uncoated paper.

The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) of the films increased with the increasing of KGM. The water contact angle was enhanced with the increasing of KGM, indicating the decrease of the film hydrophilicity. XRD and FTIR showed the interactions between gelatin and KGM. Gelatin solution with 0.15% KGM is suitable for preparing capsules. Drug dissolution test in vitro showed the shell rupture time is in range of 3-5 min, and 80% of the drugs were released within 10 min. Therefore, the composite materials made of tilapia scale gelatin and KGM can be utilized for hard capsules."

Two solvent systems, i.e., sodium hydroxide/urea and lithium hydroxide/urea, were used to dissolve the hydrolyzed cotton to prepare solutions for fiber regeneration by wet spinning. The diameter, morphology, thermal properties, crystallinity, and tensile properties of the regenerated fibers were characterized by SEM, TGA, XRD, and tensile testing. Results showed that, using this recycling method, fibers with tensile properties comparable to current commercial regular rayon fibers made from wood pulp could be produced, and dyes in the original cotton waste could be conserved to produce fibers with intrinsic colors, thus eliminating the need for dyeing processes.

Pharmacokinetic results indicate that PTX-loaded CR PMs could significantly enhance the oral bioavailability of PTX. Confocal imaging of intestinal sections verified many of CR PMs were absorbed as whole through the intestinal membrane. The cytotoxicity assays in Caco-2 cells and in vivo antitumor efficacy showed that PTX-loaded CR PMs had a stronger antitumor efficacy.

The structural stability of G-quadruplexes is greatly enhanced by the binding of monovalent cations such as Na+ or K+ into the interior axial channel. We computationally study the free energy of binding of Na+ and K+ ions to two intramolecular G-quadruplexes that differ considerably in their degree of rigidity and the presence or absence of terminal nucleotides. The goal of our study is two-fold. On the one hand, we study the free energy of binding every ion, which complements the experimental findings that report the average free energy for replacing Na+ with K+ ions. On the other hand, we examine the role of the G-quadruplex structure in the binding free energy. In the study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and the alchemical transformation method for the computation of the free energies. To compare the cation-dependent contribution to the structural stability of G-quadruplexes, we use a two-step approach to calculate the individual free energy difference ΔG of binding two Na+ and two K+ to two G-quadruplexes: the unimolecular DNA d[T2GT2(G3T)3] (Protein Data Bank ID 2M4P) and the human telomeric DNA d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] (PDB ID 1KF1). In contrast to the experimental studies that estimate the average free energy of binding, we find a varying difference of approximately 2-9 kcal/mol between the free energy contribution of binding the first and second cation, Na+ or K+. Furthermore, we found that the free energy of binding K+ is not affected by the chemical nature of the two quadruplexes. By contrast, Na+ showed dependency on the G-quadruplex structure; the relatively small size allows Na+ to explore larger configurational space than K+. Numerical results presented here may offer reference values for future design of cationic drug-like ligands that replace the metal ions in G-quadruplexes.",Preferential host-guest coordination of nonactin with ammonium and hydroxylammonium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553267,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"The biological activity of the macrocycle nonactin is intimately related to its ionophore properties and ability to act as a selective cation carrier. The competitive binding of small protonated amines constitutes a particularly key issue in the biochemistry of nonactin, which finds application in sensing and extraction technologies. In this study, isolated complexes of nonactin with ammonium and hydroxylammonium are investigated with infrared action spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The focus of the investigation is on the coordination achieved by the protonated guest with the oxygen atoms of either the oxolane groups or the carboxyl groups in the ester linkages of the macrocyle host and their relative contributions to the stability of the complexes. The experimental and computational data converge to a preferred coordination arrangement associated with a tight binding of the N-H δ+ bonds with the oxolane groups. In the

In contrast, symmetry is disrupted in the NH3OH+ complex, as it incorporates a bifurcated coordination of the -OH bond with a carbonyl group and an oxolane group of the host, involving also a more stretched arrangement of the nonactin backbone. These gas-phase conformations are in agreement with the structures postulated for these complexes in condensed phases, from previous Raman and crystallographic experiments.","Rotational spectroscopy of chiral tetrahydro-2-furoic acid: Conformational landscape, conversion, and abundances.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553266,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"The conformational landscape of tetrahydro-2-furoic acid (THFA), a chiral carboxylic acid which is often used as a precursor in syntheses of pharmaceuticals, was investigated using rotational spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. Extensive manual searches were carried out to identify possible conformers related to the relative orientations of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in the COOH functional group, the COOH rotation, and the ring puckering motions in the system. A large number of initial conformational geometries were generated in parallel using a joint semiempirical-molecular dynamics simulation program. The final geometry optimizations were carried out at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP, B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311++G(2d,p), and MP2/6-311G++(2d,p) levels of theory. Eight conformers within a relative energy span of 10 kJ mol-1 after zero-point energy corrections were identified. Rotational spectra of three conformers were detected experimentally and assigned, as were the spectra of all the 13C isotopologues of the most stable conformer. Based on the achieved experimental sensitivity and the predicted relative abundances at the sample source, some conformers are unexpectedly missing or experience significant depletion, whereas others show noticeable enrichment. Detailed analyses of the conformational conversion barriers were carried out to satisfactorily explain the observed phenomena. The combined experimental rotational spectroscopic and theoretical investigation provides significant insights into the complex conformational landscape of THFA.","Carbon dioxide capture in 2,2'-iminodiethanol aqueous solution from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553265,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"The reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with aqueous 2,2'-iminodiethanol (trivial name is diethanolamine: DEA) has been investigated using both blue moon ensemble and metadynamics approaches combined with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. A spontaneous direct proton transfer from DEA zwitterion (DEAZW) to DEA but not to H2O has been observed in straightforward AIMD simulation in the time scale of ps. The ab initio free-energy calculations reproduced the overall free-energy difference, predicting the ionic products DEA carbamate ion (DEAC) and the protonated DEA (DEAH). The computed free-energy barrier for the first reaction step, which is the CO2 binding (48 kJ mol-1), is found to agree reasonably well with the available experimental data (52-56 kJ mol-1). By contrast, the barriers for the next step, the deprotonation of zwitterion realized either via reaction with DEA or H2O, are underestimated by 25-35 kJ mol-1 compared to the experimental reference. A part of this error is attributed to the neglected reversible work needed to bring two reactants together, which might significantly contribute to the free-energy of activation of bimolecular reactions in a dilute solution. The computed free-energy profile is compared with our results [Y. Kubota et al., J. Chem. Phys. 146, 094303 (2017)] for the same reaction in 2-aminoethanol (trivial name is monoethanolamine: MEA)."

The anion photoelectron spectra of [Pt(H2O)]-, formed under different conditions, exhibit spectral features that are due to the anion-molecule complex, Pt-(H2O), and to the reaction intermediates, HPtOH- and H2PtO-, in which one and two O-H bonds have been broken, respectively. Additionally, the observations of PtO- and H2+ in mass spectra strongly imply that water splitting via the reaction Pt- + H2O → PtO- + H2 has occurred. Extending these studies to nickel and palladium shows that they too are able to activate single water molecules, as evidenced by the formation of the reaction intermediates, HNiOH- and HPdOH-. Computations at the coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbatively connected triples level of theory provide structures and vertical detachment energies (VDEs) for both HMOH- and H2MO- intermediates.

A possible method for efficiently sampling the conformational space of such a complex system is metadynamics (MetaD) with path collective variables (CVs). Here, we applied well-tempered MetaD with path CVs to one of the few GPCRs for which both inactive and fully active experimental structures are available, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), and assessed the ability of this enhanced sampling method to estimate the thermodynamic properties of receptor activation in line with those obtained by more computationally expensive adaptive sampling protocols. While n-body information theory analysis of these simulations confirmed that MetaD can efficiently characterize ligand-induced allosteric communication across the receptor, standard MetaD cannot be used directly to derive kinetic rates because transitions are accelerated by a bias potential. Applying the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) to the free-energy landscape of morphine-bound MOR reconstructed from MetaD, we obtained Markov state models that yield kinetic rates of MOR activation in agreement with those obtained by adaptive sampling. Taken together, these results suggest that the MetaD-MaxCal combination creates an efficient strategy for estimating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of GPCR activation at an affordable computational cost.",Entropic constraints on the steady-state fitness of competing self-replicators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553248,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"Recent developments in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics suggest that the history of entropy production in a system determines the relative likelihood of competing processes. This presents the possibility of interpreting and predicting the self-organization of complex active systems, but existing theories rely on quantities that are challenging to obtain. Here, we address this issue for a general class of Markovian systems in which two types of self-replicating molecular assemblies (self-replicators) compete for a pool of limiting resource molecules within a nonequilibrium steady state. We derive exact relations that show that the relative fitness of these species depends on a path function, ψ, which is a sum of the entropy production and a relative-entropy term. In the limit of infinite path length, ψ reduces to the entropy production. We demonstrate use of the theory by numerically studying two models inspired by biological systems, including a simplified model of a competition between strains of the yeast prion Sup35 in the presence of driven disaggregation by the ATPase Hsp104.",Common microscopic structural origin for water's thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553247,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"Water displays a vast array of unique properties, known as water's anomalies, whose origin remains subject to hot debate. Our aim in this article is to provide a unified microscopic physical picture of water's anomalies in terms of locally favored structures, encompassing both thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, which are often attributed to different origins. We first identify locally favored structures via a microscopic structural descriptor that measures local translational order and provide direct evidence that they have a hierarchical impact on the anomalies. At each state point, the strength of thermodynamic anomalies is directly proportional to the amount of locally favored structures, while the dynamic properties of each molecule depend on the local structure surrounding both itself and its nearest neighbors. To incorporate this, we develop a novel hierarchical two-state model. We show by extensive simulations of two popular water models that both thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies can be almost perfectly explained by the temperature and pressure dependence of these local and non-local versions of the same structural descriptor, respectively. Moreover, our scenario makes three unique predictions in supercooled water, setting it apart from other scenarios: (1) Presence of an ""Arrhenius-to-Arrhenius"" crossover upon cooling, as the origin of the apparent ""fragile-to-strong"" transition; (2) maximum of dynamic heterogeneity around 20 K below the Widom line and far above the glass transition; (3) violation of the Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation at ∼2Tg, rather than 1.2Tg typical of normal glass-formers. These predictions are verified by recent measurement of water's diffusion at very low temperatures (point 1) and discoveries from our extensive simulations (points 2-3). We suggest that the same scenario may generally apply to water-like anomalies in liquids tending to form locally favored structures, including not only other important tetrahedral liquids such as silicon, germanium, and silica, but also metallic and chalcogenide liquids.",Prediction of line shape parameters and their temperature dependences for CO2-N2 using molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553246,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"We show in this paper that requantized classical molecular dynamics simulations (rCMDSs) are capable of predicting various refined spectral-shape parameters of absorption lines of CO2 broadened by N2 with high precision. Combining CMDSs and a requantization procedure, we computed the auto-correlation function of the CO2 dipole moment responsible for the absorption transition. Its Fourier-Laplace transform directly yields the spectrum. Calculations were made for two temperatures, 200 and 296 K, at 1 atm and for a large range of Doppler widths, from the near-Doppler to the collision-dominant regimes. For each temperature and each line, the spectra calculated for various Doppler widths were simultaneously fit with the Hartmann-Tran (HT) profile. This refined profile, which takes into account the effects of the speed dependent collisional line broadening, the Dicke narrowing, and the collisional line mixing, was recommended as a reference model to be used in high-resolution spectroscopy (instead of the simplified Voigt model). The HT parameters retrieved from the rCMDS-calculated spectra were then directly compared with those deduced from high-precision measurements [J. S. Wilzewski et al., J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer 206, 296-305 (2018)]. The results show a very good agreement, even for those parameters whose influence on the spectra is very small. Good agreement is also obtained between measured and predicted temperature dependences of these parameters. This demonstrates that rCMDS is an excellent tool, highly competitive with respect to high quality measurements for precise line-shape studies.",Granularity impact on hotspot formation and local chemistry in shocked nanostructured RDX.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553245,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"The nanostructuration of energetic materials results in interesting properties. In particular, the detonation of carbon-rich explosives leads to the formation of nanodiamonds, the size of which is linked to the initial size of the explosive nanograins. This correlation could come from the role played by the granularity in the shock properties, especially the local temperature, which could be enhanced when the shock front crosses the various interfaces and nanoporosities of the material. More generally, the granularity-dependent reactivity also concerns some aspects of the sensitivity of energetic materials and subsequent inhibition or safety issues. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we perform classical and reactive molecular dynamics shock-simulations on cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), a common high-explosive. We design various nanogranular structures using the body-centered-cubic stacking of nanoparticles shaped as Kelvin cells (truncated octahedra) with slightly-bumped faces. The nanograin size and the bump radius allow to independently control the porosity value and its nanostructure. We show that the global shock properties, especially the temperature, are sensitive to the porosity value but not to the nanograin size. The porosity nanostructure has a local impact, enhancing the temperature heterogeneities between the inter- and intra-grain regions by a few hundred degrees and slowing down the thermal homogenization. For a given porosity, the larger the nanograins, the larger and the hotter the hotspots. In such hotspots, the local chemistry is significantly modified, resulting in a larger reactivity with a quicker formation of some final products. We suggest that the quicker consumption of heteroatoms (namely, H, O, and N) along with higher local temperatures is likely to impact the formation process of solid carbonaceous phases.",Rheological properties of super critical CO2 with CuO: Multi-scale computational modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553244,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"A multi-scale computational methodology based on the density functional theory and molecular dynamics has been used to investigate the rheological properties of super critical CO2 with CuO nano-particle (NP). Density functional theory which treats the electron density as the central variable has been used to explore the adsorption of CO2 molecules on the two most stable CuO surfaces [i.e., (111) and (011)] at absolute zero. The results of this theory would provide valuable information to make CuO NPs with the surface where the CO2 adsorption is maximum in order to have a stronger mono-layer of adsorbed CO2 molecules on the surface of the NP which is the most crucial factor in formation of a stable nanofluid. The results show that the CO2 molecule is adsorbed more strongly on the (011) surface with an adsorption energy of -99.06 kJ/mol compared to the (111) surface. A computational methodology based on molecular dynamics has been used to evaluate the enhancement of the rheological properties of the super-critical CO2 liquid based nanofluid at different temperatures and pressures. In this scale, first, the CO2 liquid has been modeled by employing the condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS) force field potential and the fluid properties computed are in excellent agreement with the literature and experiment values. Second, the nanofluid has been modeled in order to study the enhancement of the fluid properties with the CuO NPs. The charged optimized many-body force field potential has been employed to consider the effect of the charge transferring between the NPs and liquid molecules and breaking of existing bonds and the formation of new bonds. The COMPASS force field potential is also employed for the interactions between CO2 molecules. The combination of these potentials is quite a new approach for the study of the super-critical (SC)-CO2 based nanofluid. The results show that the viscosity of the SC-CO2 is enhanced between 1.3 and 2.5 times under the temperature and pressure conditions studied.",Geometric phase effects on photodissociation dynamics of diatomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553243,The Journal of chemical physics,2018 12 17,"We investigated the effect of the geometric phase (GP) on photodissociation dynamics at a light-induced conical intersection (LICI) through exact quantum dynamical calculations.

Phys. 116, 7094 (2002)] based on fundamental measure theory for hard spheres produces accurate results, although the functional does not satisfy the exactly known low-density limit. In addition, at low temperatures where particles start to form an amorphous tetrahedral network, quantitative differences between simulations and theory emerge due to the absence of geometrical information regarding the patch arrangement in the latter. Indeed, here we find that the theory fits better to simulations of the floating-bond model [E. Zaccarelli et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 174501 (2007)], which exhibits a weaker tetrahedral order due to more flexible bonds between particles. We also demonstrate that another common density functional approach by Segura et al.

Two pure rotational R(0) transitions (J = 1 - 0) with different hyperfine structure patterns were detected. One transition belongs to the (ortho)-NH3-(ortho)-N2 nuclear spin isomer in the ground K = 0 state reported earlier [G. T. Fraser et al., J. Chem. Phys. 84, 2472 (1986)], while another one is assigned to the (para)-NH3-(para)-N2 spin isomer in the K = 0 state not reported before (K is the projection of the total angular momentum J on the intermolecular axis). The complicated hyperfine structure arising from three quadrupole 14N nuclei of NH3-N2 was resolved for both transitions, and the quadrupole coupling constants associated with the NH3 and N2 subunits were precisely determined for the first time. These constants provided the dynamical information about the angular orientation of ammonia and nitrogen indicating that the average angle between the C3 axis of NH3 and the N2 axis is about 66°. The average van der Waals bond lengths are slightly different for (ortho)-NH3-(ortho)-N2 and (para)-NH3-(para)-N2 and amount to 3.678 Å and 3.732 Å, respectively. Similar results for the deuterated isotopologues, ND3-N2, NHD2-N2, and NH2D-N2, and their nuclear spin isomers were also obtained thus confirming and extending the analysis for the parent NH3-N2 complex."

The potentially most important dose-forming radionuclide-pathways combinations need to be identified to optimize filling these gaps. Few attempts have been made to classify the importance of isotopes with regard to radiation protection of the environment. A hierarchical approach is described here for radionuclides that are potentially present in generic ecosystems (freshwater, marine or terrestrial) and is applied for scenarios considering ecologically relevant chronic exposure. In each ecosystem, the top ten radionuclides that may contribute to doses were identified using a qualitative Chronic Hazard Index. Including quantitative aspects by incorporating discharge quantities changed the priority list, and increased the relative importance of radionuclides contributing most to the authorized releases of nuclear facilities (14C and 3H followed by 60C). The potentially most important dose-contributing radionuclides in the framework of environmental radiation protection under a chronic exposure situation included isotopes of about 20 elements. The five most important in order of decreasing importance were: carbon, hydrogen, caesium, cobalt and americium.

Hg circulation in these environments has been studied for 27 years and this review brings a synthesis of the dynamics that are now well established, so that future studies can focus on gaps and inconsistent results in the literature. The topics cover the methylation process of Hg, its transfer along the trophic chain and the impacts downstream from dams.

Synthesized materials: zeolite, rGO and ZrGO were evaluated as an adsorbent to remove arsenic from water. The results indicated that all three were able to adsorb arsenic from water but the removal efficiency of ZrGO was the best as it was able to bring down the arsenic concentration within the WHO permissible limits. The maximum adsorption capacity for 100 μg/L of initial arsenic concentration was found to be 49.23 μg/g. Results indicate that pseudo second order kinetics describes the arsenic adsorption on ZrGO. Adsorption isotherm study for ZrGO shows best fit for Redlich-Peterson model of adsorption.",Prevalence and clinical correlations of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553209,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 05 08,"Obsessive compulsive symptoms are often present in persons with schizophrenia.

This approach is currently emerging to overcome the bottleneck constraints faced during traditional drug discovery in grounds of financial support, timeline and resources. In this direction, several efforts were made for the construction of stratagems based on bioinformatics and computational tools to intensify the repurposing process off-late. Further, advanced research has succeeded in widening its boundaries in identification of gene targets and subsequent molecular interactions of the drugs depending on available omics data. Currently, the advent of data repositories like Connectivity Map (CMap), Library Integrated Network based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Side Effect Resource (SIDER), and Directionality Map (DMAP) has bestowed great oppurtunity to the researchers in improving their drug repurposing research exponentially.

However, the mechanism by which glycyrrhizin inhibits inflammation is unclear. Using a Con A-induced hepatitis model in mice, we found that administration of glycyrrhizin ameliorates Con A-induced liver injury, which manifests as reduction in the production of inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17, as well as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Blockade of IL-17 dramatically mitigates liver injury resulting from Con A challenge. Interestingly, at both the mRNA and protein levels, the endogenous alarmin inflammatory molecule high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is significantly decreased in mice injected with glycyrrhizin combined with Con A compared to those injected with Con A alone. In contrast, the administration of glycyrrhizin with Con A challenge up-regulates the production of IL-25. Furthermore, an increase in the proportion of protective lymphocyte subset, Gr-1+ CD11b+ (Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell, MDSCs), could be induced by increased IL-25 to restrain immune cell activation and favor the resolution of detrimental immune reactions caused by Con A challenge. The results indicate that glycyrrhizin plays a protective role in Con A-induced hepatitis. This protective role is particularly associated with reducing the production of IL-17 and enhancing the expression of IL-25. The present study may provide a new strategy for the treatment of acute hepatitis in the clinical setting.",Salvanic acid B inhibits myocardial fibrosis through regulating TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553195,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 22,Salvanic Acid B (Sal B) was proved to show significant effect against fibrosis and myocardial injury.

However, there is still no effective clinic strategies for the treatment of this disease. The acupoint stimulation with needle-scalpel is a widely used approach to treat orthopedic diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of acupoint stimulation around neck with needle-scalpel on delaying the degeneration of cervical intervertebral discs and hopefully provided an approach for the precaution and early intervention of CS. We firstly established a rat model of CS by cervical static-dynamic imbalance to mimics disc degeneration and then stimulated the acupoints around neck with needle-scalpel. The cervical intervertebral disc samples were collected to measure type I and II collagen by quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and western blot. The changes in micro-structure and ultra-structure of nucleus pulposus were analyzed under the optical microscope and electron microscope respectively. Acupoint stimulation with needle-scapelon increased type I collagen production and decreased type II collagen production, and improved the micro-structure and ultra-structure of nucleus pulposus. Our results suggest that acupoint stimulation around neck with needle-scapelon could inhibit intervertebral disc degeneration through modulating the extracellular matrix collagen system and improving the changed structure of nucleus pulposus.",The renoprotective effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on adenine-induced kidney disease in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553193,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 22,"We assessed the effect of treatment with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, on adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Six equal groups of rats were given either normal food or food mixed with adenine (0.25% w/w for five weeks) to induce CKD. Some of these groups were also simultaneously treated with sitagliptin (2.5 and 10 mg/kg/day, by gavage). Rats given adenine showed elevation of blood pressure, decreased body weight and increased relative kidney weight. Adenine also significantly increased plasma urea, creatinine, cystatin C, liver-type fatty acid-binding protein concentrations and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin activity by 404%, 354%, 667%, 91% and 281% respectively and reduced plasma α-Klotho by 50%. In addition, adenine significantly increased albumin/creatinine ratio and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity by 3553% and 400% respectively and reduced creatinine clearance by 91%. Adenine feeding also significantly elevated the plasma concentration of inflammatory cytokines (plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and transforming growth factor beta-1) and significantly reduced antioxidant indices (catalase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase). Histopathologically, adenine caused renal fibrosis, inflammation and atrophy. When given concomitantly with adenine, sitagliptin ameliorated all the measured adenine-induced physiological and biochemical changes but not the histopathological changes. Sitagliptin (10 mg/kg/day) reduced plasma urea and creatinine by 32% and 25% respectively and increased creatinine clearance by 248%. These findings suggest a renoprotective action of sitagliptin on adenine-induced CKD.","Networks of problems: social, psychological, and genetic influences on health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553192,Current opinion in psychology,2019 04 03,"An emerging idea in psychopathology conceives of disorders as networks of mutually-reinforcing symptoms that constitute the disorder rather than simply reflect it. This is similar to how social scientists already view socioeconomic status, and has affinities to how physical health problems compound in later life. Social, psychological, and physical conditions might therefore be thought of as networks of problems with 'causal bridges' that span different levels and bring low SES, mental health challenges, and physical health problems into pervasive relationships with one another. The network view suggests a more heterogeneous and less reductive view on genetic causes which accords with the highly diffuse causal architecture now known to be the hallmark of complex behaviors and traits.",Evaluation of an untargeted chemometric approach for the source inference of ignitable liquids in forensic science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553191,Forensic science international,2019 02 15,"Recent research efforts in the domain of fire debris analysis have been mainly oriented towards the development of innovative analytical procedures and chemometric approaches for the detection and classification of ignitable liquids in fire specimens according to the ASTM E1618. However, less attention has been brought to the question of the source inference of ignitable liquids. Infer the identity of source of ignitable liquids recovered from arson sites is still a challenging and ongoing research area. In this study, the objective is to link neat gasoline samples sharing a common source through the use of an untargeted chemometric approach applied to data acquired by automated thermodesorption (ATD)-GC-MS following passive headspace extraction onto Tenax TA tubes. To that end, 190 unique gasoline samples from 19 gas stations collected over a year were used. A general and automated chemometric methodology for data treatment involving the following main steps is proposed: feature detection, normalization by exhaustive calculation of ratios between areas of pairs of features and selection of most discriminant ratios. The ratio selection procedure used here is based on the calculation of similarity measurements between pairs of samples sharing a common source or not. The algorithm maximizes the separation of the distributions of similarity measurements for related and unrelated samples by selecting a subset of ratios maximizing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve. The approach presented here was successfully applied to neat gasoline samples in order to assess if two gasoline samples share a common source or not.",Nonlinear methods of vehicle velocity determination based on inverse systems and tensor products of Legendre polynomials in compact car class.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553190,Forensic science international,2019 02 15,"The article presents research on the methods of crash velocity determination based on the Compact car class. The database used in the research is provided by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and includes numerous frontal crash tests, which allowed the determination of the mathematical model parameters. Two methods are presented that enable the determination of vehicle velocity before the collision. The first researched method is the so-called inversed system method and is based on the assumption that the relationship between bk coefficient Cs is an inverse function. The second line of research focuses on the tensor product method, which is grounded in the Legendre polynomials, orthogonal on the interval [-1, 1] (Axler, 1997; Cheney and Kincaid, 2002). The article presents the calculation algorithm for both cases and the results with reference to the NHTSA database (Sharma et al., 2007; Siddall and Day, 1996). The application of the least square method provides more precise results in both cases than in previously researched solutions, with a slight advantage of the tensor product method. The obtained mean relative error of the velocity determination using the inverse system method is approximately 16,22% for the linear model and 10,58% for the nonlinear model. In the case of the tensor product method the errors for linear and nonlinear models are respectively 6,74% and 6,3%.",Immunophenotypic measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia: Is multicentric MRD assessment feasible?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553189,Leukemia research,2018 12 29,"Flow-cytometric detection of now termed measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has proven to have an independent prognostic impact. In a previous multicenter study we developed protocols to accurately define leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) at diagnosis. It has, however, not been demonstrated whether the use of the defined LAIPs in the same multicenter setting results in a high concordance between centers in MRD assessment. In the present paper we evaluated whether interpretation of list-mode data (LMD) files, obtained from MRD assessment of previously determined LAIPs during and after treatment, could reliably be performed in a multicenter setting. The percentage of MRD positive cells was simultaneously determined in totally 173 LMD files from 77 AML patients by six participating centers. The quantitative concordance between the six participating centers was meanly 84%, with slight variation of 75%-89%. In addition our data showed that the type and number of LAIPs were of influence on the performance outcome. The highest concordance was observed for LAIPs with cross-lineage expression, followed by LAIPs with an asynchronous antigen expression. Our results imply that immunophenotypic MRD assessment in AML will only be feasible when fully standardized methods are used for reliable multicenter assessment."

In this study, we followed the growth of Penicillium expansum on the surface of apple jam and Penicillium verrucosum on crème fraiche, as well as production and distribution of fungal metabolites throughout the sample (approx. 6 cm high divided into three equal layers), using a multianalyte method, over time (up to 28 days) and at 4, 8 and 15 °C. Growth rates and apparent lag times for P. expansum in apple jam at different temperatures were estimated by fitting to the Baranyi model. The growth rates were 1.7, 2.7 and 4.3 mm day-1 for storage at 4, 8 and 15 °C, respectively; apparent lag times decreased with increasing storage temperature and were 10.6, 7.9 and 2.6 days at corresponding temperatures. Patulin and roquefortine C were identified and quantified, among other fungal metabolites. Patulin was detected in all 2-cm layers of the apple jam at 15 °C. Concentrations in the upper two layers of the jar corresponded to exposures exceeding the health based guidance value (HBGV) for a normal serving size. Consequently, removal of the mouldy part is insufficient to avoid unhealthy exposure. In contrast to patulin, roquefortine C was also produced at 4 °C. The growth of P. verrucosum on crème fraiche was very restricted and could not be modelled. Despite the small colony (8 ± 0.5 mm in diameter), ochratoxin A and citrinin were detected after 21 days at 15 °C in the top 2 cm layer (including the fungal colony), and at concentrations in a normal serving corresponding to an exposure above the HBGV established by EFSA for both mycotoxins. Questiomycin A, an antibiotic, was also produced in crème fraiche but in contrast to the two mycotoxins, was detected throughout all layers of the crème fraiche and was produced also at 4 and 8 °C. As a complement to a previous study, we also present production and the distribution of major fungal metabolites in apple jam and crème fraiche for some additional fungal strains (P. crustosum, P. roqueforti and P. verrucosum on apple jam and P. expansum on crème fraiche).

The four clades could not be distinguished clearly by morphology or enzyme production patterns. The tenuazonic acid (TeA) production capability of 11 isolates was also determined and revealed a good agreement with the phylogeny results. All of the 11 isolates were revealed as TeA producers, indicating a potential toxicological risk to sorghum crops. This is the first study to provide a detailed morphological description of E. sorghinum isolates from sorghum grains in Brazil and it clearly confirms the wide genetic and phenotypic variability previously reported for this species in other countries.",Mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from human fetal liver release soluble factors with a potential role in liver tissue repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553176,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,2019 04 16,"We isolated a population of proliferating cells from cultured human fetal hepatocytes of 16-22 weeks gestational age. The cells shared a similar phenotype to that of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), including plastic adherence, antigen expression profile, and in vitro multilineage differentiation potential. Fetal liver (FL)-MSCs expressed the albumin gene, and harbored a subpopulation of CK18+ cells (20-40%), which defined their hepatic origin. However, when subjected to in vitro hepatic differentiation, FL-MSCs did not acquire significant liver functions. Quantitative analysis of conditioned medium (CM) collected from cultured cells revealed the presence of growth factors and chemokines with potential liver regenerative properties, the most relevant of which (concentration ≥3000 pg/ml) were SDF-1 alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1 beta, VEGF-A, Gro-alpha, and HGF. Culturing of FL-MSCs as spheroids significantly enhanced the secretion of HGF and bFGF (approximately 5-fold) compared with culture monolayers. Moreover, CM assessed in vitro induced capillary-like organization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts as target cells. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from CM induced similar cellular responses in vitro with high efficiency and in a dose-dependent manner. FL-MSCs underwent several in vitro subcultivations, and did not stimulate allogenic T-cell proliferation thus suggesting a low immunogenicity. Furthermore, 5-year cryopreservation did not affect cell viability (approximately 90% of viable post-thawed FL-MSCs). These observations support the feasibility of a cell bank establishment for allogenic transplantation. We concluded that FL-MSCs or they secreted factors may be a valid alternative to hepatocyte transplantation in liver cell-based therapies.","Association of language, behavior, and parental stress in young children with a language disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553175,Research in developmental disabilities,2019 04 22,"Several studies show that language problems, child behavior problems, and parental stress can co-occur in children.

In the most common approach, registration is used to warp the atlases to the target space and then the warped atlas labelmaps are fused into a consensus segmentation based on local appearance information encoded in form of patches. The registration step establishes spatial correspondence, which is important to obtain anatomical priors. Patch-based label fusion in the target space has shown to produce very accurate segmentations although at the expense of registering all atlases to each target image. Moreover, appearance (i.e., patches) and label information used by label fusion is extracted from the warped atlases, which are subject to interpolation errors. In this work, we revisit and extend the patch-based label fusion framework, exploring the role of extracting this information from the native space of both atlases and target images, thus avoiding interpolation artifacts, but at the same time, we do it in a way that it does not sacrifice the anatomical priors derived by registration. We further propose a common formulation for two widely-used label fusion strategies, i.e., similarity-based and a particular type of learning-based label fusion. The proposed framework is evaluated on subcortical structure segmentation in adult brains and tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI. Our results indicate that using atlas patches in their native space yields superior performance than warping the atlases to the target image. The learning-based approach tends to outperform the similarity-based approach, with the particularity that using patches in native space lessens the computational requirements of learning. As conclusion, the combination of learning-based label fusion and native atlas patches yields the best performance with reduced test times than conventional similarity-based approaches.",Ventilation/perfusion SPECT/CT in patients with severe and rigid scoliosis: An evaluation by relationship to spinal deformity and lung function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553172,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2018 12 24,Structural changes of the spine and chest wall associated with SRS result in poor cardiopulmonary function.

According to the 2016 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors meningiomas are classified into three grades: I, II, and III. Past studies have shown that the risk of meningiomas recurrence is strongly correlated with the molecular profile of the tumor. Extensive whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing has provided a large body of information about the mutational landscape of meningiomas. However, such a stratification of meningiomas based on mutational analysis alone has been proven not to satisfy the clinical need for distinction between patients who need (or do not need) an adjuvant treatment. Combined analysis of exome, transcriptome, methylome and future approaches for epigenetic aspects in meningiomas may allow researchers to unveil a more comprehensive understanding of tumor progression mechanisms and, consequently, a more personalized clinical approach for patients with meningioma. A better understanding of the genetics and clinical behavior of high-grade meningiomas is mandatory in order to better design future clinical trials.

Accordingly, investigating the dynamic structures of mutant variants could result in a profound understanding of such a specific resistance. Therefore, this work investigated structural properties sampled by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, umbrella sampling, and binding free energy calculations for both a wild-type and a cefotaxime-resistant T to S mutant of PBP1A. The T to S mutation significantly reduces the binding affinity of cefotaxime (a frequently clinically-administrated β-lactam antibiotic) as the PBP1A inhibitor. In the conventional MD simulations presented here, more fluctuations of the mutant's active site cleft margins were detected. The cleft of the mutant protein also opened remarkably more than the wild-type's cleft and displayed more flexibility. Thus, our findings have shown that flexibility of cleft margins of the active site in the mutant PBP1A immediately results in the catalytic cleft opening. In addition, binding free energy calculation suggests that reducing hydrophobic contacts and increasing the polar contribution in the binding energy may play an important role in cefotaxime resistance.",Molecular simulation of the structure of folate and antifolates at physiological conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553157,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2019 01 06,"The study is focused on description of folate and several antifolates at physiological conditions. Knowledge of the molecular structure and dynamics is important for understanding their biological activity and therapeutic application. They are modelled in saline by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and characterized in detail. In addition, quantum chemical calculations are used for determining the electronic structure of the six compounds. All molecules are highly flexible and have similar interactions with water. Specifics are found in some of their local backbone conformations, in the molecular shape, and in the electron density distribution. Most of the ligands have fairly folded geometry and prefer U- and Z-shapes. Two of them are quasi-linear. Key to the molecular shape are the bicyclic fragment, its bridge, and the charge of the terminal amino acid residue. Docking into the active site of folate receptor-α predicts a similar best binding pose for four of the ligands, which requires stretching of pterin and bending of glutamate/ornithine relative to the geometry in saline. The chemical modifications in the antifolates induce local electron density redistribution in comparison to folate, leading to increase of the positive charges of the neighboring fragments. The obtained results would help better tuning of the potential usage of the molecules in new bioactive materials, e.g., as vector-ligands for drug delivery.","Relationship between anxiety, depression, sex, obesity, and internet addiction in Chinese adolescents: A short-term longitudinal study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553156,Addictive behaviors,2019 01 08,"Associations between anxiety, depression and adolescent Internet addiction have been well documented in the literature; however, few published studies have examined these relationships considering the developmental trajectory courses of adolescent Internet addiction as well as the individual differences over time. Using a sample of 1545 Chinese adolescents and 3 waves of data over six months, we examined the longitudinal associations between anxiety and depression and Internet addiction, considering sex and obesity. We used latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) to examine the overall conditions of Internet addiction, and latent class growth modeling (LCGM) to determine adolescent developmental membership for Internet addiction. Both unconditional and conditional models were performed. Anxiety and depression were analyzed as time-varying variables, and sex and obesity as time-invariants in our conditional models. Overall, there was a linear decline in adolescent Internet addiction over the six months. Anxiety and depression positively predicted adolescent Internet addiction. Two developmental trajectory patterns for Internet addiction were determined (i.e., low/declining, high/declining). Anxiety was associated with adolescent Internet addiction for both groups of adolescents, but depression was associated with Internet addiction only for adolescents who followed a low/declining course of Internet addiction. Boys reported a higher mean score of Internet addiction at the initial status than girls, and boys also had a faster, declining rate of change over the six months than girls. Obesity was not a predictor of Internet addiction. The results spoke to the importance of considering mental health problems and sex in any intervention efforts to reduce adolescent Internet addiction. Limitations of the study were discussed.",Disrupted structural and functional brain networks in Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553155,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 15,"Studies have demonstrated that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with abnormal connections in either functional connectivity networks (FCNs) or structural connectivity networks (SCNs). However, the FCN and SCN of AD have usually been examined separately, and the results were inconsistent. In this multimodal study, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 46 patients with AD and 39 matched healthy controls (HCs). Graph-theory analysis was used to investigate the topological organization of the FCN and SCN simultaneously. Compared with HCs, both the FCN and SCN of patients with AD showed disrupted network integration (i.e., increased characteristic path length) and segregation (i.e., decreased intramodular connections in the default mode network). Moreover, the FCN, but not the SCN, exhibited a reduced clustering coefficient and reduced rich club connections in AD. The coupling (i.e., correlation) of the FCN and SCN in AD was increased in connections of the default mode network and the rich club. These findings demonstrated overlapping and distinct network disruptions in the FCN and SCN and a strengthened correlation between FCNs and SCNs in AD, which provides a novel perspective for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD.",Influence of hypertension on brain amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease signature neurodegeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553154,Neurobiology of aging,2019 05 15,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship of hypertension with beta-amyloid (Aβ) and neurodegeneration biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the modulating effect of apolipoprotein E-ε4 (APOE4). In total, 259 cognitively normal (CN) and 79 AD dementia older adults received clinical assessments including the evaluation for the presence of hypertension, [11C]-Pittsburgh-compound-B-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and APOE genotyping. We used a clinical stage-specific approach, separately focusing on CN and AD dementia stages. For the CN group, individuals with hypertension showed reduced AD signature cortical thickness compared with those without hypertension. Subsequent subgroup analyses showed that hypertension was associated with reduced AD signature cortical thickness only in APOE4 noncarriers, whereas hypertension was associated with elevated Aβ deposition in APOE4 carriers. Meanwhile, regardless of APOE4 status, AD dementia patients with hypertension had significantly lower Aβ deposition than those without hypertension. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hypertension contributes to AD primarily through the reduction of brain reserve. In case of APOE4 carriers, however, hypertension seems to additionally facilitate AD process through amyloid-dependent pathway.",Housefly larvae (Musca domestica) significantly accelerates degradation of monensin by altering the structure and abundance of the associated bacterial community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553153,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 13,"Vermicomposting of livestock manure using housefly larvae is a promising biotechnology for waste reduction and control of antibiotic pollution. Monensin (MON), an ionophore polyether antibiotic (IPA), is widely used in broiler feed to control coccidiosis. However, MON residues in litter have become a major source of pollution in the environment. In this work, we studied the efficiency of housefly larvae (Musca domestica) on monensin attenuation during a 12-day laboratory scale vermicomposting experiment. We observed a 94.99% reduction in MON concentration after four days in treatment groups, while it took twelve days to remove more than 94.71% of MON in the control group. We found that the bacterial community composition of the substrate was reshaped by housefly larvae. From the treatment groups, three MON-degrading bacterial strains were isolated and identified as Acinetobacter sp., Stenotrophomonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp. based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. These three strains were among dominant the bacteria in treated substrates, showing between 52.80% and 89.25% degradation of MON in mineral salt medium within 28 days. Furthermore, two MON-degrading bacteria (Stenotrophomonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp.) were more abundant in treatment groups and larvae gut groups compared with those in control groups. The abundance enhancement of MON-degrading bacteria was related to the change in ambient temperature and pH in the substrates, which were affected by housefly larvae activities. Our results confirm that housefly larvae can significantly accelerate degradation of MON in chicken manure by increasing the abundance of MON-degrading bacteria.",Gait initiation and partial body weight unloading for functional improvement in post-stroke individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553152,Gait & posture,2019 04 19,"To better understand gait initiation in individuals with stroke and suggest possible training strategies, we compared the gait initiation of individuals with stroke and age-matched controls, and we examined the influence of different amounts of body weight support (BWS) during the execution of gait initiation in individuals with stroke.",Idiopathic toe walking-A follow-up survey of gait analysis assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553151,Gait & posture,2019 04 19,"Toe-walking is a normal variant in children up to 3 years of age but beyond this a diagnosis of idiopathic toe-walking (ITW) must be considered. ITW is an umbrella term that covers all cases of toe-walking without any diagnosed underlying medical condition and before assigning these diagnosis potential differential diagnoses such as cerebral palsy, peripheral neuropathy, spinal dysraphism and myopathy must be ruled out. Gait laboratory assessment (GLA) is thought to be useful in the evaluation of ITW, and kinematic, kinetic and electromyography features associated with ITW have been described. However, the longer term robustness of a diagnosis based on GLA has not been investigated. The primary aim of this study was to examine if a diagnosis of ITW based on GLA features persisted.",The association between the longitudinal course of common mental disorders and subsequent physical activity status in young adults: A 30-year birth cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553149,Journal of psychiatric research,2018 12 31,"Low physical activity is a major public health concern. There has been extensive research examining the role of physical activity as a potentially modifiable risk factor for the onset of mental illness. However, fewer studies have reported how mental disorders affect future physical activity. Using data from a large birth cohort, the current study explored the association between the longitudinal course of common mental disorders (affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, as well as any common mental disorder) and subsequent physical activity status among young adults living in Australia. Prospective data from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, consisting of 1611 young adults, were analyzed. The longitudinal course of mental disorder diagnoses between ages 21 and 30 was derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Physical activity status at age 30 was estimated using International Physical Activity Questionnaire long form. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between the longitudinal course of common mental disorders between 21 and 30 years and subsequent physical activity status at age 30. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was no association between the longitudinal course of affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or any common mental disorder at ages 21 and 30 and physical activity status at age 30. Our findings suggest that there is no longitudinal association between the common mental disorder diagnoses and physical activity status among young adults living in Australia.",Excess copper promotes photoinhibition and modulates the expression of antioxidant-related genes in Zostera muelleri.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553148,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 02 15,"Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plants and as such is vital to many metabolic processes. Nevertheless, when present at elevated concentrations, Cu can exert toxic effects on plants by disrupting protein functions and promoting oxidative stress. Due to their proximity to the urbanised estuaries, seagrasses are vulnerable to chemical contamination via industrial runoff, waste discharges and leachates. Zostera muelleri is a common seagrass species that forms habitats in the intertidal areas along the temperate coast of Australia. Previous studies have shown the detrimental effects of Cu exposure on photosynthetic efficiency of Z. muelleri. The present study focuses on the impacts of sublethal Cu exposure on the physiological and molecular responses. By means of a single addition, plants were exposed to 250 and 500 μg Cu L-1 (corresponding to 3.9 and 7.8 μM, respectively) as well as uncontaminated artificial seawater (control) for 7 days. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, measured as the effective quantum yield (ϕPSII), the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were assessed daily, while Cu accumulation in leaf tissue, total reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of genes involved in antioxidant activities and trace metal binding were determined after 1, 3 and 7 days of exposure. Z. muelleri accumulated Cu in the leaf tissue in a concentration-dependent manner and the bioaccumulation was saturated by day 3. Cu exposure resulted in an acute suppression of ϕPSII and Fv/Fm. These two parameters also showed a concentration- and time-dependent decline. NPQ increased sharply during the first few days before subsequently decreasing towards the end of the experiment. Cu accumulation induced oxidative stress in Z. muelleri as an elevated level of ROS was detected on day 7. Lower Cu concentration promoted an up-regulation of genes encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-sod), ascorbate peroxidase (apx), catalase (cat) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx), whereas no significant change was detected with higher Cu concentration. Exposure to Cu at any concentration failed to induce regulation in the expression level of genes encoding metallothionein type 2 (mt2), metallothionein type 3 (mt3) and cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone (cox17). It is concluded that chlorophyll fluorescence parameters provide timely probe of the status of photosynthetic machinery under Cu stress. In addition, when exposed to a moderate level of Cu, Z. muelleri mitigates any induced oxidative stress by up-regulating transcripts coding for antioxidant enzymes."

One-year old coffee plants were grown in greenhouse conditions and treated with two foliar applications of 10 mg/L of Zn as either zinc sulfate monohydrate (ZnSO4 ‧ H2O) or zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnO NPs 20% w/t) and compared to untreated control plants over the course of 45 days. ZnO NPs positively affected the fresh weight and dry weight (FW and DW) of roots and leaves, increasing the FW by 37% (root) and 95% (leaves) when compared to control. The DW increase was 28%, 85%, and 20% in roots, stems, and leaves, respectively. The net photosynthetic rate increased 55% in response to ZnO NPs treatment at the end of experiment when compared to control. ZnO NPs-treated leaves contained significantly higher amounts of Zn (1267.1 ± 367.2 mg/kg DW) when compared to ZnSO4-treated plants (344.1 ± 106.2 mg/kg DW), while control plants had the lowest Zn content in the leaf tissue (53.6 ± 18.9 mg/kg DW). X-ray micro-analyses maps demonstrated the increased penetrance of ZnO NPs in coffee leaf tissue. Overall, ZnO NPs had a more positive impact on coffee growth and physiology than conventional Zn salts, which was most likely due to their increased ability to be absorbed by the leaf. These results indicate that the application of ZnO NPs could be considered for coffee systems to improve fruit set and quality, especially in areas where Zn deficiency is high.",Attentional priming: recent insights and current controversies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553136,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 21,"Humans possess a primitive memory system for attention deployments that allows quick reorientation of visual attention to stimuli that are relevant to behavior at any given moment. We review recent evidence regarding such attentional priming effects from a number of different perspectives. We discuss recent findings on the time course and duration of such effects, the potential interaction of priming and top-down attentional guidance; how priming can be used to probe the nature of visual representations and attentional templates; findings on the basic nature of priming effects and recent relevant findings on so-called serial dependencies that share many characteristics with attentional priming. Our discussion shows that priming effects are strong and occur on many levels of perceptual processing, and that these effects cannot and should not be thought of as reflecting the operation of any single type of mechanism. Additionally, our overview shows the utility of these paradigms in answering questions about how we represent statistical regularities of stimuli in our environment.",Intentional early delivery versus expectant management for preterm premature rupture of membranes at 28-32 weeks' gestation: A multicentre randomized controlled trial (MICADO STUDY).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553135,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,"Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM) exposes the fetus to preterm birth, and optimal timing for delivery is controversial.

Both novel therapeutic targets and approaches are needed to improve the overall survival of PDAC patients. MicroRNA-212 (miR-212) has been reported as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers, but its definitive role and exact mechanism in the progression of pancreatic cancer is unclear. In this study, we developed a new chimeric peptide (PL-1) composed of plectin-1-targeted PDAC-specific and arginine-rich RNA-binding motifs which could condense miRNA to self-assemble supramolecular nanoparticles. These nanoparticles could deliver miR-212 into PDAC cells specifically and efficiently which also showed good stability in RNase and serum. Moreover, we demonstrated that PL-1/miR-212 nanoparticles could dramatically enhance the chemotherapeutic effect of doxorubicin for PDAC both in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, combined miR-212 intervention by PL-1/miR-212 nanoparticles resulted in obvious decrease of USP9X expression (ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, X-linked, USP9X) and eventually enhanced the doxorubicin induced apoptosis and autophagy of PDAC cells. These findings provide a new promising anti-cancer strategy via PL-1/miR-212 nanoparticles and identify miR-212/USP9X as a new potential target for future systemic therapy against human PDAC.","Simultaneous quantification of the degree of hydrolysis, protein conversion rate and mean molar weight of peptides released in the course of enzymatic proteolysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553133,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 02 15,"This paper describes an original analytical methodology for a simultaneous measurement of the protein conversion rate, the mean molar weight of peptide and the degree of hydrolysis in the course of proteolysis by Size-Exclusion High-Performance Liquid Chromatography. Peak area of dead volume eluents reflects the non-converted protein. The protein conversion rate is thus determined by comparing the area at a given time to the initial area. The peptide signal allows determining the peptide molar weight distribution and degree of hydrolysis of hydrolysates. As a first step, the approach was tested on the hydrolysis of bovine serum albumin, lysozyme and rapeseed albumin by Alcalase 2.4L. Values of degree of hydrolysis were also determined by TNBS and pH-stat methods. Most of the hydrolysate obtained showed relative differences < 20% with the reference methods. The method was also adapted to fit the TNBS assay. 39 experimental validation tests were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography, TNBS and pH stat methods. 90% of the validation data show non-significant differences between the degree of hydrolysis predicted and the degree of hydrolysis measured by TNBS method. Hence, the proposed methodology can be efficient to study the process of enzymatic proteolysis while minimizing time and quantity of sample assay required.",Cladophora glomerata methanolic extract decreases oxidative stress and improves viability and mitochondrial potential in equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553132,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 13,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators of several cellular damage and thus associated with equine diseases such as inflammation and metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to evaluate the protective and antioxidant activities of methanolic extract prepared from Cladophora glomerata (C. glomerata) biomass, on equine adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (EqASCs), under experimental oxidative stress induced by H2O2. Pre-treatment of EqASCs cells with different concentrations of C. glomerata methanolic extract (1% and 5%) provided a clear protection against cellular damage triggered by H2O2. The cell's apoptotic status was significantly regulated, with promotion of cell viability, down-regulation of pro-apoptotic (p21, p53, Bax and Casp-9) genes expression, concomitant to up-regulation of the survival gene Bcl-2, this being supported by a mitigation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and significant minimization of mitochondrial dysfunction. The results also showed that C. glomerata extract significantly increased the antioxidant enzymes Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) activities, positively regulated the enzymes genes expression, and markedly reduced the protein carbonyls derivatives production. Finally, RT-qPCR analysis of the inflammatory related genes allowed to highlight a promising anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect of this extract. Due to the valuable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, C. glomerata may have potential benefits for the prevention of equine diseases associated with oxidative stress, including metabolic syndrome.",Anti-depressive effect of Shuangxinfang on rats with acute myocardial infarction: Promoting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells mobilization and alleviating inflammatory response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553131,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 13,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are recruited to injured site for cardiac self-repairing in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but the spontaneous mobilization of BM-MSCs is insufficient for self-repairing.

Shuangxinfang (Psycho-cardiology Formula, PCF) is a classical traditional Chinese medicine prescription. In this study, we explored its psycho-cardiology effects in rats with AMI and explore its potential mechanism. Our results showed PCF inhibited inflammation caused by injured myocardium, improved heart function and depression developed from myocardial infarction, and these might partly attribute to the higher BM-MSCs mobilization efficiency promoted by PCF.",Home monitoring with IT-supported specialist management versus home monitoring alone in patients with heart failure: Design and baseline results of the SUPPORT-HF 2 randomized trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553130,American heart journal,2019 02 20,SUPPORT-HF 2 tests the hypothesis that home monitoring with information technology-supported specialist management is more effective in optimizing medical therapy than is home monitoring alone for patients with heart failure.,Predictive factors associated with driving under the influence among Brazilian drug-using drivers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553128,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 02 27,"The incidence of driving under the influence of psychoactive substances (DUI) and its recidivism can be curtailed by the proper identification of specific and predictive characteristics among drug users. In this sense, interpersonal violence (IV), psychiatric comorbidity and impulsivity seem to play an important role in DUI engagement according to previous studies. There are, however, limited data originated from low and middle income countries. In the present study, drug-using Brazilian drivers reporting DUI (n = 75) presented a higher prevalence of bipolar disorders (BD; DUI: 8% vs. non-DUI: 0%, p < 0.001), lower prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; DUI: 0% vs. non-DUI: 12.6%, p < 0.001), and higher prevalence of childhood trauma (DUI: 65.3% vs. non-DUI: 46.8%, p = 0.022) than those not reporting DUI (n = 79). The evaluation of impulsivity though the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, which give impulsivity scores ranging from 30 to 120, showed higher impulsivity scores in the DUI group (80.4 ± 8) than in the non-DUI group (77.2 ± 10, p = 0.045). In general, subjects were young adults (mean age of 36 ± 9 years), Caucasians (58.4%), not married (61.0%), and with elementary schooling (40.3%) with no significant differences in demographic characteristics between drivers with and without DUI behavior. A multiple Poisson regression model showed that individuals reporting IV as perpetrators and history of childhood trauma were more likely to report DUI (PR: 1.66, 95%CI 1.22-2.7; PR: 1.57, 95%CI 1.02-2.42, respectively). The overlapping of violent situations (childhood trauma, IV and DUI) in some individuals presented here corroborates literature data suggesting that DUI can be an externalizing expression of a range of risky behavior, such as impulsiveness and aggressiveness. Moreover, while BD and higher impulsivity scores seem to act as risk factors for DUI, OCD was shown as a protective factor. These results corroborate the hypothesis that individuals with high risk for DUI could probably be identified by multidimensional assessment of cognitive, risky taking, and personality traits, which perhaps could facilitate the development of focused interventions.","Phylogenomics of Thecamoebida (Discosea, Amoebozoa) with the Description of Stratorugosa tubuloviscum gen. nov. sp. nov., a Freshwater Amoeba with a Perinuclear MTOC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553127,Protist,2019 04 23,"Thecamoebida Smirnov and Cavalier-Smith, 2011 (Discosea, Amoebozoa) has been molecularly understudied.

Although this species most closely morphologically resembles a large, rugose Thecamoeba, S. tubuloviscum gen. nov. sp. nov. can be differentiated from Thecamoeba spp. by the following: 1) the presence of definitive finger-like (lobate-like) subpseudopodia extending at both the anterior and lateral parts of the cell during locomotion; 2) a peculiar locomotive mechanism with two sections, frontal and back, of the cells moving in a pulling and piggyback movement, respectively; 3) the presence of fibrillar cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) organized by a prominent, perinuclear microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). A phylogenomic analysis of 511 genes assembled from transcriptomic data showed that this new genus was highly supported as sister to Stenamoeba. Despite the variance in gross morphology, Stenamoeba and S. tubuloviscum gen nov. sp. nov. both have MTOCs unlike two Thecamoeba spp., which display dot-like cytoplasmic MTs and lack an MTOC."

However, excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to repercussions in terms of mortality, morbidity, and financial and societal costs, especially with the lack of novel drugs to combat infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Unfortunately, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has increased significantly worldwide in the past decades, particularly in developing third-world countries. Hence, various key organisations have made AMR the focus of highly visible reports, conferences and actions. Nevertheless, the majority of investigations were initiated in the developed world. In Lebanon, as in other developing countries, AMR remains responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Whilst a large number of studies have targeted the AMR crisis in Lebanese clinical settings, its epidemiological situation in animals, foodstuffs and the environment is still unclear in this country. In this context, and in order to better survey, control and prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains in Lebanese non-clinical settings, this work reviewed the available data on the epidemiology of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from Lebanese extra-hospital sources.","Draft genome sequence of an Escherichia coli ST410 isolate co-harbouring blaCTX-M-15, blaCMY-42, blaOXA-1, aac(3)-IIa and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes with gyrA and parC mutations isolated from a paediatric patient in Poland.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553112,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 03 23,"Escherichia coli is one of the major causative agents of nosocomial infections.

Until now, rapid screening and identification of biologically active components from natural products remain a technical challenge. Bio-affinity chromatography (BAC) based approaches hold great promise in screening potential bioactive ligands from complex samples. In this review, we summarized recent development of BAC in natural products screening, with a particular emphasis on the reported bio-affinity stationary phases and chromatographic supports as well as the applications of BAC coupled with GC-MS or LC-MS.",Identification of BVDV2b and 2c subgenotypes in the United States: Genetic and antigenic characterization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553108,Virology,2019 03 20,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a ubiquitous pathogen of cattle, causes subclinical to severe acute disease. Two species of BVDV are recognized, BVDV1 and BVDV2 with BVDV1 divided into at least 21 subgenotypes and BVDV2 into 3-4 subgenotypes, most commonly using sequences from the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR). We report genomic sequencing of 8 BVDV2 isolates that did not segregate into the 2a subgenotype; but represented two additional BVDV2 subgenotypes. One BVDV2 subgenotype was previously recognized only in Asia. The other seven viruses fell into a second subgenotype that was first reported in Brazil and the U.S. in 2002. Neutralization assays using antiserum raised against vaccine strain BVDV2a 296c revealed varying degrees of neutralization of genetically diverse BVDV2 isolates. Neutralization titers decreased from 1.8 to more than a four log(2) decrease. This study illustrated the considerable genetic and antigenic diversity in BVDV2 circulating in the U.S.",An exploration of the psychometric properties of the SATAQ-4 among adolescent boys in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553107,Eating behaviors,2019 05 07,"Research among Western adult and adolescent males suggests that sociocultural influences are implicated in the drive for muscularity and weight-change behaviors. However, few studies have examined these relationships among adolescent boys from non-Western backgrounds. The current study sought to assess the psychometric properties of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ-4), a 22-item, 5-factor measure of sociocultural influence on appearance ideals, among Japanese (n = 984) adolescent boys. Relationships between appearance-related pressures, appearance ideal internalization, appearance-related teasing, drive for muscularity, and weight-change behaviors were also assessed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified a four factor solution (Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Media, and Pressures: Family/Peers) with 16 items in this sample. Correlational analyses supported the construct validity of the SATAQ-4. Thin internalization was associated with strategies to lose weight, while muscular internalization was associated with drive for muscularity and strategies to gain weight. Further, peer and parental appearance teasing was associated with perceived appearance pressures from family and peers, as well as weight change strategies. Overall, results suggested modification of the SATAQ-4 when used with Japanese samples, but supported its use to assess sociocultural influences. Additionally, the results highlight that sociocultural influences and muscularity concerns among Japanese adolescent boys are associated in similar ways with weight change strategies as has been established for adolescent males in Western countries.",Plasma and erythrocyte ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are associated with multiple inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553106,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019 01 14,The aim of this study was to assess the association of plasma and erythrocyte ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids with multiple oxidative stress biomarkers in breast cancer patients.,An enzyme-based electrochemical biosensor probe with sensitivity to detect astrocytic versus glioma uptake of glutamate in real time in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553105,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 15,"Glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is essential for regulation of thought, movement, memory, and other higher functions controlled by the brain. Dysregulation of glutamate signaling is associated with severe neuropathological conditions, such as epilepsy, and glioma, a form of brain cancer. Glutamate signals are currently detected by several types of neurochemical probes ranging from microdialysis-based to enzyme-based carbon fiber microsensors. However, an important technology gap exists in the ability to measure glutamate dynamics continuously, and in real time, and from multiple locations in the brain, which limits our ability to further understand the involved spatiotemporal mechanisms of underlying neuropathologies. To overcome this limitation, we developed an enzymatic glutamate microbiosensor, in the form of a ceramic-substrate enabled platinum microelectrode array, that continuously, in real time, measures changes in glutamate concentration from multiple recording sites. In addition, the developed microbiosensor is almost four-fold more sensitive to glutamate than enzymatic sensors previously reported in the literature. Further analysis of glutamate dynamics recorded by our microbiosensor in cultured astrocytes (control condition) and glioma cells (pathological condition) clearly distinguished normal versus impaired glutamate uptake, respectively. These results confirm that the developed glutamate microbiosensor array can become a useful tool in monitoring and understanding glutamate signaling and its regulation in normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, the developed microbiosensor can be used to measure the effects of potential therapeutic drugs to treat a range of neurological diseases.",Color-sensitive and spectrometer-free plasmonic sensor for biosensing applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553104,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 15,"A color-sensitive and spectrometer-free sensing method using plasmonic nanohole arrays and the color components, L* , a* , and b* , of the CIELAB defined by the international commission on illumination (CIE) is introduced for the analysis of optically transparent materials in the visible range. Spectral analysis based on plasmonic nanoparticles or nanostructures can be applied to real-time bio-detection, but complex optical instrumentations and low spatial resolution have limited the sensing ability. Therefore, we take an advantage of color image processing instead of spectral analysis which induces the distinctive color information of plasmonic nanohole arrays with different transparent materials. It guarantees high spatial resolution which is essential to bio-detection such as living cells. To establish our sensing platform, the color components, L* , a* , and b* , were extracted from photo images by an image sensor, statistically processed using a JAVA program, and finally utilized as three individual sensing factors. Additionally, our study on a correlation between the spacing of plasmonic sensors and the color sensitivity to the refractive index reveals geometrically optimal conditions of nanohole arrays. The weighted mean calculation with the three individual sensing factors offers an enhanced distinction of the optical difference for transparent materials. In this work, a color sensitivity of 156.94 RIU-1 and a minimum mean absolute error of 1.298×10-4 RIU were achieved. The difference in the refractive index can be recognized up to 10-4 level with the suggested sensing platform and the signal process. This unique color-sensitive sensing method enables a simple, easy-to-control, and highly accurate analysis without complicated measurement systems including a spectrometer. Therefore, our sensing platform can be applied as a very powerful tool to in-situ label-free bio-detection fields."

Different from traditional mechanical mixing, the solution-based fabrication strategy enables the sufficient blending of PTCDI as active component and carbon black as conductive agent in the PTCDI/CB composite.

Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic results demonstrate the occurrence of drug-RNA binding interaction as manifested through environment-sensitive prototropic equilibrium of NHM. However, the key finding of the present study lies in unraveling the complexities in the NHM-RNA binding thermodynamics. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) results reveal the presence of two thermodynamically different binding modes for NHM. An extensive temperature-dependence investigation shows that the formation of Complex I is enthalpically (ΔHI < 0) as well as entropically (TΔSI > 0) favored with the enthalpic (entropic) contribution being increasingly predominant in the higher (lower) temperature regime. On the contrary, the formation of Complex II reveals a predominantly enthalpy-driven signature (ΔHI < 0) along with unfavorable entropy change (TΔSI < 0) with gradually decreasing enthalpic contribution with temperature. Such differential dependences of ΔHI and ΔHII on temperature subsequently lead to opposing heat capacity changes underlying the formation of Complex I and II (ΔCpI<0andΔCpII>0). A negative ΔCp underpins the pivotal role of 'hydrophobic effect' (release of ordered water molecules) for the formation of Complex I, while a positive ΔCp marks the thermodynamic hallmark for 'hydrophobic hydration' (solvation of hydrophobic (or nonpolar) molecular surfaces in aqueous medium) for formation of Complex II. A detailed investigation of the effect of ionic strength enables a component analysis of the total free energy change (ΔG).",Energy and cost-efficient nano-Ru-based perovskites/RGO composites for application in high performance supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553090,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 15,"Nano-Ru-based perovskites RGO are prepared simultaneously in presence of various A-metal salts (A = Sr, Ba or Ca salts) using two different methods for reaction initiation. No further calcination step is needed for the formation of well-defined perovskite structure. Graphene oxide (GO) is used as a fuel to prepare various Ru-based perovskites for the first time. The resulted low-Ru content nanocomposites are used as supercapacitor electrodes in a neutral electrolyte (1.0 M NaNO3). The results show that the specific capacitance of the resulted nanocomposites strongly depends on the method of their preparation as well as the type of A-site of the nanocomposites. Ru-based perovskites RGO nanocomposites that are prepared by combustion method show higher specific capacitance than those prepared by microwave irradiation. The maximum specific capacitance of Sr-, Ba- and Ca-RG-C composites at scan rate 2 mV s-1 are 564 (598 mF cm-2), 460 (487 mF cm-2) and 316 (336 mF cm-2) F g-1, respectively. This value is higher than our previous work using a physical mixture between the individually prepared RGO and SrRuO3. Lowest values for specific capacitance are obtained when using CaRuO3/RGO prepared using microwave-assisted method (Ca-RG-M). The resulted A-RG-nanocomposites show very high cycling stability and good specific capacitance compared to other Ru-based structures previously reported in the literature. A correlation is defined between the structure and specific capacitance of the nanocomposites. It is confirmed that the nanocomposite size, morphology and distribution over the RGO matrix influence the supercapacitor characteristics.",Noble metal nanoparticle-functionalized Zr-metal organic frameworks with excellent photocatalytic performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553089,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 15,"Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized MOFs are attractive materials for photocatalytic reactions, and outstanding catalytic performances can be expected, especially when they have intrinsically matched crystal faces between metals and MOFs. This study discovered that the photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols to aldehydes was enhanced over Au/UiO-66-NH2 or Au/UiO-66 but suppressed over Pt loaded counterparts, whereas the reduction of Cr(VI) was boosted over both two catalysts. In reactions, the conversion of benzyl alcohol was 17.1% over UiO-66-NH2 and 7.6% over UiO-66, and an enhanced conversion was obtained over Au/UiO-66-NH2 (30.5%) and Au/UiO-66 (24.1%). However, the conversion was decreased over Pt/UiO-66-NH2 (9.3%) and Pt/UiO-66 (<1%). Experimental results revealed strong correlations between Zr-MOFs and loaded metal NPs, as Zr centers promoted the formation of Pt(200) planes that suppressed the production of ·O2- intermediates to oxidize aromatic alcohols, whereas Pt(200) exhibited no effect on the Cr(VI) reduction triggered by photo-induced electrons. The findings in this study on constructing noble metal NPs functionalized Zr-MOFs catalysts with specially-matched crystal structures and on distinguishing photocatalytic mechanisms on oxidation of alcohols and reduction of Cr(VI) would provide valuable information for designer (photo)catalysts based on MOFs and their applications in such as catalysis and environmental remediation.",,,,2019 02 15,,Delignification overmatches hemicellulose removal for improving hydrolysis of wheat straw using the enzyme cocktail from Aspergillus niger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553086,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"Based on a general understanding that hemicellulose removal is more efficient than delignification for biomass deconstruction, an Aspergillus niger strain producing high xylanase activity was screened out from seventeen strains by clear halo experiments. Low-cost enzyme cocktail with high xylanase activity was produced from wheat straw medium fermented by the Gyx086 strain. The enzyme cocktail with high xylanase activity could more effectively hydrolyze wheat straw than other biomasses. However, only 30% of total carbohydrates could be hydrolyzed to reducing sugar in untreated wheat straw. Further enzymatic hydrolysis and pretreated trials were carried out, the results indicated that hemicellulose removal was less effective than delignification for de-recalcitrance of wheat straw and the crystallinity is little interference with the hydrolysis process. Delignified wheat straw was near-completely hydrolyzed by the enzyme cocktail in 60 h. This study advanced the knowledge in promoting wheat straw as feedstock for bio-based industry.",Performance and microbial community of an electric biological integration reactor (EBIR) for treatment of wastewater containing ibuprofen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553085,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"Electric biological integration reactor (EBIR) was designed and built for the treatment of wastewater containing ibuprofen.

The optimal conditions for EBIR were 12.73 A/m2 current density (CD), 3.5 h hydraulic retention time and 0.08 mg/L influent ibuprofen concentration. In addition, microbial community structures were detected using an Illumina Miseq PE300 system, which were different at the phylum, class, and genus levels between EBIR and BAF.

The results showed that the onset TG temperature for blend biomass shifted slightly to lower values. Activation energy values were also found to decrease slightly after blending the biomass. Interestingly, the MS spectra of selected gases (H2O CH4, H2O, C2H2, C2H4 or CO, CH2O, CH3OH, HCl, C3H6, CO2, HCOOH, and C6H12) evolved from blend biomass showed decreased in the intensity as compared to their individual biomass.

The feasible fermentation time was shortened by 2 days, as compared with sole WAS or sole TR. Mechanism investigation showed that the addition of TR promoted solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidogenesis processes. The synergistic effect of microorganisms contained in TR and WAS may be responsible for the enhancement of lignocellulose hydrolysis and VFA generation. Appropriate amounts of mineral elements in TR benefited solubilization, the soluble iron and calcium in TR could contribute to the phosphorus removal in fermentation liquor."

Comprehensive characterization analysis indicated that pyrolytic temperature could manipulate the crystalline structure evolution of the MCs and influence their physicochemical and catalytic properties. The catalytic performances of the as-prepared samples pyrolyzed at 600 °C (MC-600) and 1000 °C (MC-1000) were evaluated, and MC-1000 exhibited far more excellent catalytic reactivity than MC-600 in PMS oxidation system. Such difference was mainly attributed to that Fe3O4 and Fe° are the dominant active ingredients of MC-600 and MC-1000, respectively. The electron spin resonance (ESR) tests and radical quenching experiments revealed that hydroxyl radical (•OH) and sulfate radical (SO4•-) predominated in the MC-600/PMS and MC-1000/PMS systems, respectively. The mechanisms of the MCs-mediated PMS activation process were elucidated, among which the role of iron mineral phase was emphatically explored. Furtherly, possible degradation by-products were identified by LC-MS, and potential degradation pathways were proposed. Ultimately, the effects of pivotal parameters (i.e. MC-1000 dosage, PMS concentration, initial pH, and water matrix species) on ATZ degradation were investigated to assess the applicability of the MC-1000/PMS system.",The Tethered Effect of Vestibular Schwannoma Tumor Shrinkage Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Secondary Trigeminal Neuralgia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553070,World neurosurgery,2019 03 29,"Compression of the trigeminal nerve by vessels and tumors causes trigeminal neuralgia.

Drawing from 207 families from mainland China, 2-wave data were reported in this study when the infants were 6 months (T1) and 14 (T2) months. Mothers (Mean age = 32.85 years, SD = 4.04) reported their CEA on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) at T1, and their negative expressiveness on the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire (SEFQ) at T2. The Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and a reverse categorization task were used to measure infant behavior problems and IC at T2, respectively. The results showed that T1 maternal CEA, rather than physical and sexual abuse, uniquely predicted T2 negative expressiveness. Maternal negative expressiveness significantly mediated the positive relations of maternal CEA and infant externalizing, internalizing and dysregulation problems. In addition, the moderated mediation model showed that the association between maternal negative expressiveness and infant dysregulation problems was moderated by infant IC. Specifically, the mediating pathway from maternal CEA to dysregulation problems through maternal negative expressiveness was significant, only for infants with poor IC. The results were robust even after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), maternal childhood physical and sexual abuse. The importance of mediating and moderating processes in understanding the effect of maternal emotional abuse during childhood on infant behavior problems is discussed.",Parent discipline in Thailand: Corporal punishment use and associations with myths and psychological outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553067,Child abuse & neglect,2019 01 15,"A basic human right of all children is protection from physical punishment in all settings.

Epidemiologic studies on diet and cancer have guided the search for some nutraceuticals acting as anti-cancer agents. Hesperetin (HRN), the aglycone of hesperidin, a glycoside found in citrus fruits, has been reported to have anti-cancer effects by apoptosis induction and inhibition of cell proliferation in cancer cells. However, poor solubility of HRN has limited its absorption while deviating from its therapeutic benefit. The present study aimed to develop nanocrystalline solid dispersions (NSD) of HRN and evaluating the oral bioavailability in rats.

The optimized NSD formulation showed an average particle size (Zavg) of 558.2 ± 68.1 nm and ~70% release in 30 min. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study also construed remarkable improvement (3.3 and 2.1-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-∞) in rate and extent of absorption and 4-fold reduction in Tmax by the optimized NSD formulation. In vivo chemoprevention study construed superior efficacy of the NSD formulation by reducing the tumor burden, delaying the onset of tumors and reducing the tumor weight and volume in DMBA-induced breast cancer rats. In conclusion, we present a simple NSD formulation of HRN with enhanced bioavailability and superior chemopreventive efficacy.",Improved anti-colorectal carcinomatosis effect of tannic acid co-loaded with oxaliplatin in nanoparticles encapsulated in thermosensitive hydrogel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553061,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 28,"Tannic acid, a hydrolysable tannin, exists commonly in food plants. Tannic acid has already been shown various anticancer mechanisms such as inhibiting the proliferation, inducing a higher apoptotic rate and slowing down the metastasis of different cancers. Moreover, tannic acid was reported to reduce the side effects caused by chemotherapeutics on patients. But whether the tannic acid can improve the treatment of oxaliplatin on colorectal carcinomatosis has yet been studied. In this study, we developed an injectable drug delivery system by physical incorporation of oxaliplatin (OXA) and tannic acid (TA) polymeric nanoparticles (OXA/TA NPs) into a thermo-sensitive hydrogel, OXA/TA NPs-hydrogel (OXA/TA NPs-H). The OXA/TA NPs-H was injected into the peritoneal cavity for the treatment of colorectal peritoneal carcinoma. Firstly, a water-in-oil-in-water double-emulsion (w/o/w) method and solvent-evaporation procedure were used in the preparation of the biodegradable OXA/TA NPs. Then, we prepared the biodegradable thermo-sensitive poly(3-caprolactone) (PCL)-10R5-PCL (PCLR) hydrogel with a low critical solution temperature (LCST) which undergoes gelation process at body temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the spherical profile of OXA/TA NPs. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra demonstrated that OXA and TA were both encapsulated into the OXA/TA NPs. In this study, intraperitoneal application of OXA/TA NPs-H restricted the growth of CT26 peritoneal colon cancer in vivo, improved the quality of life and prolonged the survival time of the model mice. Our study suggested that OXA/TA NPs-H might have potential application in the treatment of colorectal cancer.",Synthesis and characterization of nanostructured lipid-poloxamer organogels for enhanced skin local anesthesia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553060,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 28,"The aim of this study was to synthesize a novel drug delivery system using organogels (ORGs) and characterize its physicochemical properties, in vitro and ex vivo permeation abilities, cytotoxicity and in vivo local anesthetic effects. The ORG formulations contained a mixture of oleic acid-lanolin (OA-LAN), poloxamer (PL407), and the commonly used local anesthetic lidocaine (LDC). The main focus was to evaluate the impact of LAN and PL407 concentrations on the ORG structural features and their biopharmaceutical performance. Results revealed that LDC, OA, and LAN incorporation separately shifted the systems transitions phase temperatures and modified the elastic/viscous moduli relationships (G'/G″ = ~15×). Additionally, the formulation with the highest concentrations of LAN and PL407 reduced the LDC flux from ~17 to 12 μg·cm-2·h-1 and the permeability coefficients from 1.2 to 0.62 cm·h-1 through ex vivo skin. In vivo pharmacological evaluation showed that the ORG-based drug delivery system presented low cytotoxicity, increased and prolonged the local anesthetic effects compared to commercial alternatives. The data from this study indicate that ORG represent a promising new approach to effectively enhance the topical administration of local anesthetics."

The purpose of this work is to propose a controlled and flexible generative model for brain cell morphology and an efficient computational pipeline for the reliable and robust simulation of realistic cellular structures with application to numerical simulation of intra-cellular diffusion-weighted MR (DW-MR) signal features. Inspired by the advances in computational neuroscience for modelling brain cells, we propose a generative model that enables users to simulate molecular diffusion within realistic digital brain cells, such as neurons, in a completely controlled and flexible fashion. We validate our new approach by showing an excellent match between the morphology (no statistically different 3D Sholl metrics, P > 0.05) and simulated intra-cellular DW-MR signal (mean relative difference < 2%) of the generated digital model of brain cells and those of digital reconstruction of real brain cells from available open-access databases. We demonstrate the versatility and potential of the framework by showing a select set of examples of relevance for the DW-MR community. The computational models introduced here are useful for synthesizing intra-cellular DW-MR signals, similar to those one might measure from brain metabolites DW-MRS experiments. They also provide the foundation for a more complete simulation system that will potentially include signals from extra-cellular compartments and exchange processes, necessary for synthesizing DW-MR signals of relevance for DW-MRI experiments.",Physical exercise enhances adult cortical plasticity in a neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic injury: Evidence from BOLD-fMRI and electrophysiological recordings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553043,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Neuroplasticity is considered essential for recovery from brain injury in developing brains. Recent studies indicate that it is especially effective during early postnatal development and during the critical period. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and local field potential (LFP) electrophysiological recordings in rats that experienced neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury during the critical period to demonstrate that physical exercise (PE) can improve cortical plasticity even when performed during adulthood, after the critical period. We investigated to what extent the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-fMRI responses were increased in the contralesional spared cortex, and how these increases were related to the LFP electrophysiological measurements and the functional outcome. The balance of excitation and inhibition was assessed by measuring excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in stellate cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, which was compared with the BOLD-fMRI responses in the contralesional S1 cortex. The ratio of inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) to excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) at the thalamocortical (TC) input to the spared S1 cortex was significantly increased by PE, which is consistent with the increased BOLD-fMRI responses and improved functional outcome. Our data clearly demonstrate in an experimental rat model of HI injury during the critical period that PE in adulthood enhances neuroplasticity and suggest that enhanced feed-forward inhibition at the TC input to the S1 cortex might underlie the PE-induced amelioration of the somatosensory deficits caused by the HI injury. In summary, the results of the current study indicate that PE, even if performed beyond the critical period or during adulthood, can be an effective therapy to treat neonatal brain injuries, providing a potential mechanism for the development of a potent rehabilitation strategy to alleviate HI-induced neurological impairments.",Automatic labeling of cortical sulci for the human fetal brain based on spatio-temporal information of gyrification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553042,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Accurate parcellation and labeling of primary cortical sulci in the human fetal brain is useful for regional analysis of brain development. However, human fetal brains show large spatio-temporal changes in brain size, cortical folding patterns, and relative position/size of cortical regions, making accurate automatic sulcal labeling challenging. Here, we introduce a novel sulcal labeling method for the fetal brain using spatio-temporal gyrification information from multiple fetal templates. First, spatial probability maps of primary sulci are generated on the templates from 23 to 33 gestational weeks and registered to an individual brain. Second, temporal weights, which determine the level of contribution to the labeling for each template, are defined by similarity of gyrification between the individual and the template brains. We combine the weighted sulcal probability maps from the multiple templates and adopt sulcal basin-wise approach to assign sulcal labels to each basin. Our labeling method was applied to 25 fetuses (22.9-29.6 gestational weeks), and the labeling accuracy was compared to manually assigned sulcal labels using the Dice coefficient. Moreover, our multi-template basin-wise approach was compared to a single-template approach, which does not consider the temporal dynamics of gyrification, and a fully-vertex-wise approach. The mean accuracy of our approach was 0.958 across subjects, significantly higher than the accuracies of the other approaches. This novel approach shows highly accurate sulcal labeling and provides a reliable means to examine characteristics of cortical regions in the fetal brain.",Reduction of cerebral blood flow in community-based adults with subclinical cerebrovascular atherosclerosis: A 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553041,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF), one of the major metrics for cerebral perfusion, is associated with many brain disorders. Therefore, early characterization of CBF prior to occurrence of symptoms is essential for prevention of cerebral ischemic events. We hypothesized that large artery atherosclerosis might be a potential indicator for decline in cerebral perfusion. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between large artery atherosclerosis and CBF in asymptomatic adults. A total of 134 asymptomatic subjects (mean age, 56.2 ± 12.8 years; 54 males) were recruited and underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for brain and intracranial and extracranial carotid arteries. Presence or absence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis was determined on MR vessel wall images. The CBF was measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) imaging. The CBF values in internal carotid artery (ICA) (37.2 ± 5.8 vs. 39.0 ± 4.9 ml/100 g/min, P = 0.049) and vertebrobasilar artery (VA-BA) territories (42.0 ± 6.8 vs. 44.8 ± 7.0 ml/100 g/min, P = 0.023) were significantly reduced in subjects with cerebrovascular plaque compared to those without. Presence of cerebrovascular plaque was significantly associated with CBF of VA-BA territory before (odds ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-6.08; P = 0.005) and after adjusted for confounding factors including age, gender, body-mass-index, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, hyperlipidemia and history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-6.46; P = 0.019). In conclusion, presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis is independently associated with reduction in CBF measured by pCASL in asymptomatic adults, suggesting that cerebrovascular large artery atherosclerosis might be an effective indicator for impairment of cerebral microcirculation hemodynamics.",Synchronous occurrence of multiple distinct jaw lesions in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553040,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2018 12 22,"Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) is an X-linked overgrowth syndrome characterized by pre- and post-natal overgrowth, typical facial appearance and multiple visceral, skeletal, and neurological anomalies.

The contrasts that were examined with consonant-vowel syllables, were place of articulation, vowel length and voice-onset time (VOT) and our analysis focuses on the correspondence between the effect of attention on the electrophysiology and the decrement in behavioral results when noise was added to the stimuli. Normal-hearing subjects (n = 20) performed closed-set syllable identification in no noise, 0, 4 and 8 dB signal-noise ratio (SNR). Identification in noise decreased markedly for place of articulation, moderately for vowel length and marginally for VOT. The same syllables were used in two electrophysiology conditions, where subjects attended to the stimuli, and also while their attention was diverted to a visual discrimination task. Differences in global field power between the attention conditions from each contrast showed that that the effect of attention was negligible for place of articulation. They implied offset encoding of vowel length and were early (starting at 117 ms), and of high amplitude (>3 μV) for VOT. There were significant correlations between the difference in syllable identification in no noise and 0 dB SNR and the electrophysiology results between attention conditions for the VOT contrast. Comparison of the two attention conditions with microstate analysis showed a significant difference in the duration of microstate class D. These results show differential integration of attention and syllable processing according to speech contrast and they suggest that there is correspondence between the salience of a contrast in noise and the effect of attention on the evoked electrical response.",Sexual minority women and Cannabis use: The serial impact of PTSD symptom severity and coping motives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553032,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 03,"Sexual minority women (SMW) report greater rates of cannabis use. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity is related to greater cannabis use among SMW, and it is theorized that this is due to SMW using cannabis in an attempt to manage negative affectivity associated with PTSD symptoms. However, this is the first known study to test this hypothesis. Among undergraduate women who endorsed lifetime cannabis use (N = 439, 10.5% self-identified SMW), SMW reported greater rates of cannabis use, more frequent cannabis use, greater coping-motivated use, and greater PTSD symptom severity than heterosexual women. Serial mediation analyses revealed that SMW reported more frequent cannabis use via the serial effect of PTSD symptom severity and coping-motivated cannabis use. Given the high rates of trauma exposure and cannabis use among SMW, findings suggest that SMW could benefit from exposure-based interventions in addition to cognitive behavioral skills that would teach them more adaptive strategies to manage negative affect associated with trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms.",Zika virus diagnosis: challenges and solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553031,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 05 10,"Since its sudden appearance and link to microcephaly in 2015, the number of PubMed references for Zika virus (ZIKV) has risen from 181 to 5163, at time of writing, with a vast proportion focused on the consequences of ZIKV infection during pregnancy.

The origins of these marker proteins are still under debate, and so far their actions have only been describe separate from each other. This study will focus on the origins and actions of all three markers during pregnancy and outside pregnancy and will describe a scenario where all three markers act synergistically to rescue the mother from the deleterious effects of the debris that is released from the placenta during preeclampsia.

Molecular basis of disease,2018 12 28,"Lethal metastasis of primary breast tumors to lymph nodes has been found to be associated with the co-expression of chemokine CXCL13 and its receptor CXCR5. To date, however, the precise molecular events regulating the co-expression of CXCL13 and CXCR5 in the context of breast cancer progression have not been identified. Therefore, to extend our understanding of the drivers of breast cancer metastasis, we undertook a line of investigation in this study in which we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation of CXCL13 is mediated by the reciprocal activity of RelA and Nrf2, while CXCR5 is transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation within its promoter. Critically, we show that intra-tumoral CXCL13 and CXCR5 mRNA expression is positively correlated with intra-tumoral RelA expression within the primary tumor of breast cancer (BCa) patients (n = 98). We demonstrate a role for Nrf2 in the negative transcriptional regulation of cxcl13. Furthermore, using a luciferase assay and deletion analysis of the cxcl13 gene promoter, we demonstrate that RelA and Nrf2 directly act upon the cxcl13 promoter to regulate transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR, supported by in silico docking analyses, confirmed that RelA and Nrf2 both occupy multiple positions within the cxcl13 promoter. Collectively, in RelA high conditions, low Nrf2 and lack of cxcr5 promoter DNA-methylation govern CXCL13-CXCR5 co-expression within breast tumors, and thus drive disease progression and metastasis.",Crystal structure of GAPDH of Streptococcus agalactiae and characterization of its interaction with extracellular matrix molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553015,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 03 14,"GAPDH being a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway is one of the surface adhesins of many Gram-positive bacteria including Streptococcus agalactiae. This anchorless adhesin is known to bind to host plasminogen (PLG) and fibrinogen (Fg), which enhances the virulence and modulates the host immune system. The crystal structure of the recombinant GAPDH from S. agalactiae (SagGAPDH) was determined at 2.6 Å resolution by molecular replacement. The structure was found to be highly conserved with a typical NAD binding domain and a catalytic domain. In this paper, using biolayer interferometry studies, we report that the multifunctional SagGAPDH enzyme binds to a variety of host molecules such as PLG, Fg, laminin, transferrin and mucin with a KD value of 4.4 × 10-7 M, 9.8 × 10-7 M, 1 × 10-5 M, 9.7 × 10-12 M and 1.4 × 10-7 M respectively. The ligand affinity blots reveal that SagGAPDH binds specifically to α and β subunits of Fg and the competitive binding ELISA assay reveals that the Fg and PLG binding sites on GAPDH does not overlap each other. The PLG binding motif of GAPDH varies with organisms, however positively charged residues in the hydrophobic surroundings is essential for PLG binding. The lysine analogue competitive binding assay and lysine succinylation experiments deciphered the role of SagGAPDH lysines in PLG binding. On structural comparison with S. pneumoniae GAPDH, K171 of SagGAPDH is being predicted to be involved in PLG binding. Further SagGAPDH exhibited enzymatic activity in the presence of Fg, PLG and transferrin. This suggests that these host molecules does not mask the active site and bind at some other region of GAPDH.",The role of the wzy gene in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and pathogenesis of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553014,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 03 14,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes severe respiratory and systemic diseases in poultry. The wzy gene encodes the O-antigen polymerase (Wzy), which plays an important role in the synthesis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of bacteria. However, the function of the wzy gene in APEC remains unclear. Hence, in this study, a strain harboring a wzy gene mutant (DE17Δwzy) was constructed and the characteristics of this strain were analyzed. The results showed that mutant of wzy changed the phenotype of the LPS and affected serum agglutination of the O-antigen. Decreased motility and biofilm formation was also observed, but the endotoxin titer of the LPS in APEC was not affected. In addition, the wzy mutation significantly decreased the adherence and invasion to DF-1 cells, especially the survival abilities in duck serum and complement. Furthermore, an LD50 assay revealed that the virulence of mutant strain DE17Δwzy was attenuated 132-fold compared with wild-type strain DE17. Moreover, the bacterial load in the blood, liver, spleen, and kidneys of ducks infected with DE17Δwzy was decreased significantly compared with wild-type strain DE17 (p < 0.0001). These results confirmed that the wzy gene is associated with LPS biosynthesis and bacterial pathogenicity in APEC.",Evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of a novel Himalayan plant Reinwardtia indica dumort: Scientifically unexplored.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553013,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 03 14,"Reinwardtia indica (Lineceae) is a medicinal plant cultivated in the Himalayan region. It is effectively used in folk medicines for the treatment of various health complications. In the present study, the shade dried leaves and stem were extracted in three different solvents such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, and hydro-alcoholic. The antioxidant efficacy of these extracts was confirmed by using different in vitro assays: DPPH free radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation, metal ion chelating capability and reducing power determination. Total phenol content was maximum in hydro alcoholic extract of leaf (540.37 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) and stem (330.51 mg per g of gallic acid equivalents) while flavonoid content was maximum in ethanolic extract of leaf (305 mg per gram of rutin equivalents) and ethyl acetate extract of stem (170.6 mg per gram of rutin equivalents). The antioxidant activity of these extracts was positively correlated with their total phenol and flavonoid content. Among all tested extracts, ethanolic extract of leaf exhibit maximum zone of inhibition against all tested clinical isolates of bacterial (E. coli 11.00 ± 1.73 mm, P. aeurogenosa 11.67 ± 0.58 mm and S. aureus 10.33 ± 1.53 mm) and fungal (C. albicans 11.33 ± 1.10 mm) pathogens, while ethyl acetate extracts of the leaf and stem showed minimum inhibitory concentration against all tested microorganisms.

However, when cell suspensions are harvested, proteolytic enzymes often cause extracellular matrix damage and loss of intercellular junctions. To overcome this problem, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) were labeled with ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles. ASC patches were constructed using multilayered USPIO-labeled ASC sheets and porous polyglycolic acid scaffolds. To monitor the distribution and localization of bioengineered bladder patches in live animals, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after transplantation. The bladder regenerative potential of ASC patches was further evaluated by urodynamic and histological analysis. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that cell sheets adhered tightly to the scaffold. MRI showed hypointense signals that lasted up to 8 weeks at the site of USPIO-labeled ASC sheet transplants. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that these tissue-engineered bladder patches promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Urodynamic testing revealed that the ASC patch restored bladder function with augmented capacity. The USPIO-labeled ASC patch provides a promising perspective on image-guided tissue engineering and holds great promise as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets avoid enzymatic dissociation and preserve the cell-to-cell interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which exhibit great potential for tissue regeneration. In this study, we developed a bioengineered three-dimensional bladder patch comprising porous scaffolds and multilayered ASC sheets, and evaluated its feasibility for bladder regeneration in a rat model. Tissue-engineered bladder patches restored bladder function and promoted regeneration of urothelium, smooth muscle, neural cells and blood vessels. Moreover, ultrasmall super-paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)-labeled bladder patches can be dynamically monitored in vivo by noninvasive MRI for long periods of time. Therefore, The USPIO-labeled bladder patch provides a promising image-guided therapeutic strategy for bladder regeneration.",Exercise and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553010,Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,2019 02 24,"Insulin resistance is a determining factor in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

In this work, different vaginal films based on chitosan, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and blends of these polymers containing tioconazole, were developed and thoroughly characterized to improve the conventional therapeutics of vaginal candidiasis. Mechanical properties, swelling, adhesiveness, morphology, antifungal activity, hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The drug solid state in the films was analyzed by thermal and X-ray diffraction analysis. Films showed homogeneous surfaces and presented similar mechanical properties and adhesiveness. Time-kill studies displayed that films were more active than both tioconazole pure drug and traditional tioconazole ovule against Candida albicans, which is probably related to the fact that tioconazole is in amorphous state inside the films. Although all formulations proved to be hemocompatible, films based only on chitosan exhibited a certain degree of cytotoxicity and therefore they should be avoided. The system based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with 40% PEG 400 as plasticizer presented fast antimicrobial activity as well as the lowest swelling. Additionally, this formulation did not produce substantial hemolytic and cytotoxic effects, indicating that films based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose could be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.",Composite nanofibrous membranes of PLGA/Aloe vera containing lipid nanoparticles for wound dressing applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553008,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"Electrospun nanofibrous dressings present suitable characteristics to be used in wound healing, such as high porosity and high surface area-to-volume ratio.

Membranes with and without NLCs were composed of uniform fibers of about 1 µm in diameter. Their porosity was above 80% and their thickness was about 160 µm. Both dressings showed similar water vapour transmission rate 1100 g/m2day. The formulation containing NLCs presented a higher ultimate tensile strength (2.61 ± 0.46 MPa) and a higher water uptake. Both formulations were biocompatible in vitro. Furthermore, the cell adhesion assay demonstrated that both membranes had a low adherence profile, although it was lower with the dressing containing NLCs. Finally, their efficacy was evaluated in a full thickness wound healing assay conducted in db/db mice, where both enhanced healing similarly. Accordingly, the PLGA-AV-NLC membrane might be a promising strategy for the treatment of chronic wounds, since it improved handling in comparison to the formulation without NLCs."

These recipients readily experience human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or reactivation. Therefore, CMV represents a life-threatening pathogen in transplant recipients. To demonstrate the serostatus and course of IgG maturation against CMV in transplant patients, we measured the transition of anti-CMV IgG and its affinity (avidity index; AI) as criteria for antibody maturation. Among 31 lung transplant recipients, 26 were infected with CMV before transplantation and maintained anti-CMV IgG and high AI values throughout the study period. Four of the 31 experienced primary infection with CMV through the allograft, with two of the 4 recipients presented high AI values even after 6 month post-transplantation. A significant portion of donor-derived plasma cells were detectable in one recipient. These results suggested that the plasma cells from donors are carried in through the transplanted lung and lymph nodes and produce matured high-avidity IgG from the early stage of transplantation.",Novel predators and anthropogenic disturbance influence spatio-temporal distribution of forest antelope species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552995,Behavioural processes,2019 03 20,"Understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on species' behaviour is crucial for conservation planning, considering the extent of habitat loss. We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbances including agriculture, urbanisation, protected areas, and the presence of novel predators, on the temporal and spatial behaviour of sympatric forest antelope (Tragelaphus scriptus, Philantomba monticola, Sylvicapra grimmia, and Cephalophus natalensis) in an anthropogenic matrix containing forest fragments in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt of South Africa. We integrated land-use types with camera-trap data and compared activity patterns using circular statistics and occupancy modelling. Antelope species overlapped in temporal and spatial distribution and exhibited diurnal activity for 50% of the time. All species exhibited nocturnal activity for ∼25-33% of all observations, except for C. natalensis. Nocturnal activity varied between species and land-use types. The predators Canis familiaris, C. mesomelas and Caracal caracal negatively influenced occupancy of P. monticola, S. grimmia and C. natalensis. Humans negatively influenced temporal activity of P. monticola, and spatial distribution of T. scriptus and S. grimmia. C. familiaris had an overall negative influence on S. grimmia. We found spatial, and to a lesser extent temporal, segregation between species. However, plasticity in activity patterns existed, which varied in response to anthropogenic effects and novel predators.",Effects of cellular differentiation in human primary bronchial epithelial cells: Metabolism of 4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552994,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 01 14,"Many of the toxicants in tobacco smoke undergo biotransformation in the lungs of smokers, both to reactive and to detoxified derivatives. Human air-liquid-interface (ALI) airway tissue models have emerged as an advanced in vitro model for evaluating the toxicity of inhaled substances; however, the metabolic potential of these cultures has not been evaluated extensively. In this study, we compared the metabolic activities of an ALI tissue model to the undifferentiated normal human primary bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells from which it was derived. Measurement of the basal levels of gene expression for 84 phase I drug metabolism enzymes indicated that most genes were upregulated in ALI cultures compared to NHBE cells. Furthermore, the enzymatic activities of three cytochrome P450s involved in the bioactivation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were higher in the ALI cultures, and the bioactivation of 4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), as measured by the formation of two of its major metabolites, i.e., keto acid and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), was significantly greater in the ALI cultures. Finally, NNK was a direct-acting genotoxicant in the ALI cultures, while the genotoxicity of NNK was detected in NHBE cells only in the presence of an exogenous liver S9 activation system. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the greater metabolic potential of well-differentiated ALI cultures than primary NHBE cells, supporting the potential use of ALI airway cultures as an alternative in vitro model for evaluating inhaled toxicants that require metabolic transformation.",Paris saponin VII reverses chemoresistance in breast MCF-7/ADR cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552993,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2019 02 15,The development of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype is a main obstacle to the successful treatment of breast cancer.

In the present study, we discovered that DHX33 is highly expressed in 84% of all Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Knockdown of DHX33 led to significant reduced proliferation and migration in glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DHX33 regulated a set of critical genes involved in cell cycle and cell migration to promote glioblastoma development. Additionally, DHX33 was found to be induced by inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR whose activation has been detected in 50% of glioblastoma. Overexpression of wild type DHX33 protein, but not the helicase dead mutant, confers resistance to mTOR inhibitors in glioblastoma cells. DHX33 probably functions as a critical regulator to promote GBM development. Our results highlight its therapeutic potential in treating GBM.","A potential regulatory network among WDR86-AS1, miR-10b-3p, and LITAF is possibly involved in preeclampsia pathogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552989,Cellular signalling,2019 01 26,"Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific disorder, is a leading cause of perinatal maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Impaired migration and invasion of trophoblastic cells and an imbalanced systemic maternal inflammatory response have been proposed as possible causes of pathogenesis of PE. Comparative analysis of PE-affected placentas and healthy placentas has uncovered differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs, microRNAs, and mRNAs. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a regulatory network among these RNAs on PE pathogenesis. Long noncoding RNA WDR86-AS1, microRNA miR-10b-3p, and mRNA of protein LITAF were identified by screening of genes in existing databases with aberrant expression in PE-affected placentas and potential mutual interactions as revealed by TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar analyses. This study identified their expression in PE-affected and healthy placentas by RT-PCR. An in vitro experiment was performed on human trophoblast HTR-8/SVneo cells cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. MiR-10b-3p targets were identified in luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull-down assays. The mouse model of PE was set up using a soluble form of FLT-1 for in vivo testing. Lower levels of miR-10b-3p but higher expression of WDR86-AS1 and LITAF were observed in PE-affected placentas and trophoblast cells under hypoxia. WDR86-AS1 and LITAF mRNA were confirmed as targets of miR-10b-3p. WDR86-AS1 downregulated miR-10b-3p but promoted LITAF expression. Microarray analyses revealed that LITAF controlled the inflammatory responses and migration and proliferation of HTR-8/SVneo cells under hypoxia. Indeed, knockdown of WDR86-AS1 and LITAF or overexpression of miR-10b-3p attenuated the hypoxia-induced inhibition of cellular viability, migration, and invasion. Moreover, miR-10b-3p overexpression attenuated the pathological symptoms caused by soluble FLT-1 in vivo. In summary, the WDR86-AS1/miR-10b-3p/LITAF network is probably involved in PE pathogenesis.",ω-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and risk of allergic outcomes or sensitization in offspring: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552987,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2019 02 25,"Allergic diseases have increased worldwide in the last 2 decades, with children suffering the highest burden of the condition.
