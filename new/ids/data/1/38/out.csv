In this study, hydrolysis of 2R3'R-SGM, the highest pharmacologically active stereoisomer of SGM, was investigated in human and rat tissues. In both species, 2R3'R-SGM was metabolized to 2R3'R-SGa in plasma but was stable in liver and intestine. The half-life of 2R3'R-SGM was found to be 16.9 min and 9.8 min in human and rat plasma, respectively. The enzyme inhibition and stimulation experiments showed that plasma paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is responsible for the hydrolysis of 2R3'R-SGM in humans and rats. The PON1-mediated hydrolysis of 2R3'R-SGM was confirmed in the lipoprotein-rich fractions of human plasma. As PON1 is naturally attached to high-density lipoprotein, it might be absent in topical tissues where 2R3'R-SGM is applied, supporting its local stability and efficacy. The metabolic behavior of 2R3'R-SGM indicates that it is an ideal soft drug to be detoxified as soon as it moves into systemic circulation. Furthermore, the similarity of 2R3'R-SGM metabolism in humans and rats showed that the rat is a suitable animal for preclinical study.",Establishment of an Evaluation Method for Gene Silencing by Serial Pulmonary Administration of siRNA and pDNA Powders: Naked siRNA Inhalation Powder Suppresses Luciferase Gene Expression in the Lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954524,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 10,"In order to evaluate the in vivo effect of inhaled formulations, it is a gold standard to create a lung metastasis model by intravenously injecting cancer cells into an animal. Because the cancer grows from the blood vessel side, there is a possibility of underestimating the effect of an inhaled formulation administered to the lung epithelium side. In addition, the metastasis model has disadvantages in terms of preparation time and expense. The present study aimed to establish a new method to evaluate the effect of an inhaled small interfering RNA (siRNA) formulation that is more correct, more rapid, and less expensive. We investigated whether siRNA can suppress gene expression of plasmid DNA (pDNA) by serial pulmonary administration of siRNA and pDNA powders prepared by spray-freeze-drying. We revealed that formulations of dry siRNA powder significantly suppressed gene expression of pDNA powder compared with a control group with no siRNA. Naked siRNA inhalation powder with no vector showed the suppression of gene expression equivalent to that of an siRNA-polyethyleneimine complex without damaging tissues. These results show that the present method is suitable for evaluating the gene-silencing effect of inhaled siRNA powders.",Proteomic analysis and white spot syndrome virus interaction of mud crab (Scylla olivacea) revealed responsive roles of the hemocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954523,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 07,"White spot disease (WSD) is a highly virulent viral disease in shrimps. Clinical signs and high mortality of WSD is generally observed after a few days of infection by White Spot Syndrome virus (WSSV). Mud crabs are the major carrier and persistent host for the WSSV. However, an elucidation of viral interaction and persistent mode of WSSV infection in mud crab is still limited. We investigated the defensive role of mud crab (Scylla olivacea) hemocytes against WSSV infection by using comparative proteomic analysis coupled with electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS/MS). The proteomic maps of expressed proteins obtained from WSSV infected hemocytes revealed differential proteins related to various biological functions, including immune response, anti-apoptosis, endocytosis, phosphorylation signaling, stress response, oxygen transport, molting, metabolism, and biosynthesis. Four distinctive cell types of crab hemocytes: hyaline cells (HC), small granular cells (SGC), large granular cells (LGC) and mixed granular cells (MGC) were found susceptible to WSSV. However, immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated a complete replication of WSSV only in SGC and LGC. WSSV induced apoptosis was also observed in HC, SGC and MGC except for LGC. These results suggested that HC and MGC may undergo apoptosis prior to a complete assembly of virion, while SGC is more susceptible showing higher amplification and releasing of virion. In contrast, WSSV may inhibit apoptosis in infected LGC to stay in latency. This present finding provides an insight for the responsive roles of crustacean hemocyte cells involved in molecular interaction and defense mechanism against WSSV.",The skin as an immune organ: Tolerance versus effector responses and applications to food allergy and hypersensitivity reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954522,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 05 06,"Skin is replete with immunocompetent cells that modulate signaling pathways to maintain a salubrious immunogenic/tolerogenic balance. This fertile immune environment plays a significant role in the development of allergic responses and sensitivities, but the mechanisms underlying these pathways have been underappreciated and underused with respect to developing therapeutics. Among the complex repertoire of cells that promote tolerogenic pathways in the periphery, 2 key classes include dendritic cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Immature dendritic cells are the first line of defense, patrolling the periphery, sampling antigens, and secreting cytokines that suppress immune cells and promote the survival of Treg cells. Skin-homing Treg cells also play a critical role in mitigating the reactivity of immune cells, secreting high levels of cytokines that promote tolerance. Therapeutic approaches that capitalize on our knowledge of the rich cellular and molecular environment are emerging and show great promise. We will discuss the advantages and challenges of 5 such strategies and how these therapies might mitigate the atopic march by facilitating tolerance. We conclude that skin is a multifaceted structure that provides a fertile ground for therapeutic discovery. Accordingly, ongoing work in this domain will no doubt continue to deliver exciting progress for improved health outcomes.",Locoregional Control and Mild Late Toxicity After Reducing Target Volumes and Radiation Doses in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treated With Induction Chemotherapy (IC) Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy: 10-Year Results of a Phase 2 Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954521,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2019 05 12,"To evaluate the long-term locoregional control, failure patterns, and late toxicity after reducing the target volume and radiation dose in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).",Local Control After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954520,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2019 05 12,Numerous dose and fractionation schedules have been used to treat medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiation therapy.

Recent literature reviews have largely dealt with the plentiful functions of microglia in CNS homeostasis, development and pathology, and the influences of sex and the microbiome. In this review, the intriguing aspect of their physical plasticity during CNS development will get specific attention. Microglia move around (mobility) and reshape their processes (motility). Microglial migration into and inside the CNS is most prominent throughout development and consequently most of the data described in this review concern mobility and motility in the changing environment of the developing brain. Here, we first define microglia based on their highly specialized age- and region-dependent gene expression signature and associated functional heterogeneity. Next, we describe their origin, the migration route of immature microglial cells towards the CNS, the mechanisms underlying their invasion of the CNS, and their spatiotemporal localization and surveying behaviour inside the developing CNS. These processes are dependent on microglial mobility and motility which are determined by the microenvironment of the CNS. Therefore, we further zoom in on the changing environment during CNS development. We elaborate on the extracellular matrix and the respective integrin receptors on microglia and we discuss the purinergic and molecular signalling in microglial mobility. In the last section, we discuss the physiological and pathological functions of microglia in which mobility and motility are involved to stress the importance of microglial 'movement'.","The direct effect of lobeglitazone, a new thiazolidinedione, on pancreatic beta cells: A comparison with other thiazolidinediones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954516,Diabetes research and clinical practice,2019 05 31,"The direct effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) on pancreatic beta cells have been controversial.

This counting method is limited by the ability of many cells to enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state upon exposure to stressful conditions like dehydration and heating commonly used in probiotic product preparation. Alternative enumeration methods are available including flow cytometry (FC) which counts total live/dead cells by assessing cellular integrity and/or metabolic activity, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in which enumeration is correlated with the quantity of a nucleic acid target. These three methods were compared for enumerating three lactic acid bacteria (LAB): Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a Bacillus subtilis related strain in twenty samples of a mixed probiotic product ranging in age from one to 825 days post-production. Flow cytometry and qPCR enumerations were similar and much higher compared to plate counts at later storage times, suggesting that some strains in the population were entering the VBNC state and were only countable by FC and qPCR. We propose the use of FC and/or qPCR as an alternative to plate counts for more accurate enumeration of bacteria in probiotic products.",Provoked Vestibulodynia in Women with Pelvic Pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954496,Sexual medicine,2019 06 10,"Pelvic pain and vulvar pain are common conditions in women.

A better and comprehensive sequence assessment can be achieved by the inclusion of full gene sequences of all the common alleles at a given locus. The common alleles of DRB5 are under-characterized with the full exon-intron sequence of two alleles available. In the present study the DRB5 genes from 18 subjects alleles were cloned and sequenced; haplotype analysis showed that 17 of them had a single copy of DRB5 and one consanguineous subject was homozygous at all HLA loci. Methodological approaches including robust and efficient long-range PCR amplification, molecular cloning, nucleotide sequencing and de novo sequence assembly were combined to characterize DRB5 alleles. DRB5 sequences covering from 5'UTR to the end of intron 5 were obtained for DRB5*01:01, 01:02 and 02:02; partial coverage including a segment spanning exon 2 to exon 6 was obtained for DRB5*01:03, 01:08N and 02:03. Phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences showed that the DRB5 alleles group together and have distinctive differences with other DRB loci. Novel intron variants of DRB5*01:01:01, 01:02 and 02:02 were identified. The newly characterized DRB5 intron variants of each DRB5 allele were found in subjects harboring distinct associations with alleles of DRB1, B and/or ethnicity. The new information provided by this study provides reference sequences for HLA typing methodologies. Extending sequence coverage may lead to identify the disease susceptibility factors of DRB5 containing haplotypes while the unexpected intron variations may shed light on understanding of the evolution of the DRB region.",Acinetobacter baumannii orofacial cellulitis: report of 2 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954493,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",2019 05 21,"Acinetobacter baumannii infection of skin and soft tissues is uncommon and usually associated with trauma. The present report describes 2 pediatric cases of cellulitis in the orofacial region, caused by A. baumannii infection with a fatal outcome. A 12-year-old male patient, diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia, presented with an ulcerated lesion on the lip suggestive of local trauma. The condition progressed to cellulitis, epithelial necrosis, and nonspecific vesicles and blisters. The second case occurred in a 10-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. The patient's condition progressed to World Health Organization Grade IV mucositis and cellulitis. In both cases, hemoculture was positive for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. In conclusion, A. baumannii should be considered a potentially multidrug-resistant pathogen in the presence of skin and soft tissue cellulitis. Ulcerated oral lesions may place hospitalized pediatric patients at risk for A. baumannii infection.",Is there an association between family history of diabetes mellitus and long-term cardiovascular hospitalizations of offspring?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954492,Primary care diabetes,2019 04 07,Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was previously found to be an independent risk factor for long-term cardiovascular morbidity of parturients and their offspring. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between family history of diabetes mellitus (DM) in non-diabetic mothers and long-term pediatric cardiovascular hospitalizations of their offspring.,Evaluation of toxicokinetics of nonylphenol in the adult female Sprague-Dawley rats using a physiologically based toxicokinetic model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954491,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 05 15,"The physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model was firstly developed in female rats to quantitatively evaluate toxicokinetics of nonylphenol (NP). Changes in NP serum concentrations over time of single oral NP administration experiments in Sprague-Dawley rats and literature data were collected to establish and calibrate the PBTK model in the SimBiology framework. The calibrated model predicted the serum and tissue NP concentrations of repeat oral NP administration for model evaluation. NP concentrations in serum and tissues (liver, kidneys, adipose, brain, uterus and ovaries) were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The model output of the time course data (values are within the standard deviation defined for each data point) indicated proximity of predictions to reality. The coefficients of determination r2 were all greater than 0.9, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) were within 0.177-2.027, which means the model predicted and observed serum NP concentrations were in excellent agreement. The results indicated that the model could contribute to a simplification of the future exposure risk assessments of NP in a more realistic scenario and provided a better understanding of the disposition process of NP in human.",Emotional arousal elicited by irrelevant stimuli affects event-related potentials (ERPs) during response inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954488,Physiology & behavior,2019 05 15,"Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies using the Go/Nogo task have indicated that response inhibition is influenced by the arousal elicited by emotional stimuli, when those stimuli are relevant to response selection of Go and Nogo trials. Due to stimulus and task design issues, however, it is uncertain whether response inhibition is affected by emotional valence or arousal, when emotional stimuli are irrelevant to response selection. Therefore, the present study aimed to re-investigate this issue by circumventing limitations of previous research. To address this issue, thirty-one young adults (16 females and 15 males) were required to make motor responses to frequently-presented faces of one sex (Go trials) and to inhibit responses to less-frequently presented faces of the opposite sex (Nogo trials). Crucially, the faces were superimposed onto positive, negative and neutral pictures. The pictures were presented in a randomized order. The arousal values between positive and negative pictures were highly matched. Results showed that Nogo faces elicited smaller N2 but larger P3a amplitudes, when the faces were associated with positive and negative pictures as compared to neutral pictures. These findings suggest that response inhibition is influenced by emotional arousal, when emotional stimuli are irrelevant to response selection. Additionally, for Go faces, results showed smaller N2 but larger P3a amplitudes within negative pictures as compared to neutral and positive pictures, suggesting a role of emotional valence elicited by irrelevant stimuli on response execution.",Neuro-hormonal mechanisms underlying changes in reward related behaviors following weight loss surgery: Potential pharmacological targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954487,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 05 17,"Currently, the only available effective treatment option for obesity and its comorbidities is weight loss surgery (WLS). Long-term maintenance of weight loss after surgery cannot be explained by caloric restriction or malabsorption alone and has been attributed to unexplained changes in eating behavior. Whether these behavioral changes are related to altered taste or reward functions, or both, are subject to debate. In contrast to reduced food cravings and food addiction following WLS, recent clinical studies have revealed that bariatric surgery patients are prone to an increased risk for substance use disorder (SUD), especially alcohol use disorder (AUD). The substitution of drugs for previously stimulating foods, and the emergence of SUD after WLS, supported by preclinical studies, strongly suggest that manipulation of gut-brain signals may bring about changes in the reward system. This paper reviews current clinical and basic science research and discusses potential underlying mechanisms of reward-related behaviors. Specifically, it explores relevant neural and hormonal changes that present post WLS and their effects on dopaminergic reward pathway and highlights targets for potential pharmacological interventions. Special emphasis is given to recent work suggesting that different types of WLS procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have differential effects on alcohol consumption in humans and rats. These differential effects may hold the key not only to understanding increased substance use following WLS but may also help elucidate the contribution of gut-brain signals to regulation of reward, in general."

The pancreas expresses pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PNLIP), pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PNLIPRP2), and carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), which may leak into the visceral fat or systemic circulation during pancreatitis. We, thus, aimed to determine the pancreatic lipase(s) regulating lipotoxicity during AP. For this AP, associated fat necrosis was analyzed using Western blot analysis. Bile acid (using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and fatty acid (using gas chromatography) concentrations were measured in human fat necrosis. The fat necrosis milieu was simulated in vitro using glyceryl trilinoleate because linoleic acid is increased in fat necrosis. Bile acid requirements to effectively hydrolyze glyceryl trilinoleate were studied using exogenous or overexpressed lipases. The renal cell line (HEK 293) was used to study lipotoxic injury. Because dual pancreatic lipase knockouts are lethal, exocrine parotid acini lacking lipases were used to verify the results. PNLIP, PNLIPRP2, and CEL were increased in fat necrosis. Although PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 were equipotent in inducing lipolysis and lipotoxic injury, CEL required bile acid concentrations higher than in human fat necrosis. The high bile acid requirements for effective lipolysis make CEL an unlikely mediator of lipotoxic injury in AP. It remains to be explored whether PNLIP or PNLIPRP2 worsens AP severity in vivo.",Enhancer of Zeste 2 Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Subunit Is Required for Uterine Epithelial Integrity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954472,The American journal of pathology,2019 06 10,"Normal proliferation and differentiation of uterine epithelial cells are critical for uterine development and function. Enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2), a core component of polycomb repressive complexes 2, possesses histone methyltransferase activity that catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3. EZH2 has been involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key event in development and carcinogenesis. However, its role in uterine epithelial cell function remains unknown. To determine the role of uterine EZH2, Ezh2 was conditionally deleted using progesterone receptor Cre recombinase, which is expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the uterus. Loss of EZH2 promoted stratification of uterine epithelium, an uncommon and detrimental event in the uterus. The abnormal epithelium expressed basal cell markers, including tumor protein 63, cytokeratin 5 (KRT5), KRT6A, and KRT14. These results suggest that EZH2 serves as a guardian of uterine epithelial integrity, partially via inhibiting the differentiation of basal-like cells and preventing epithelial stratification. The observed epithelial abnormality was accompanied by fertility defects, altered uterine growth and function, and the development of endometrial hyperplasia. Thus, the Ezh2 conditional knockout mouse model may be useful to explore mechanisms that regulate endometrial homeostasis and uterine function.",Functional Organotypic Cultures of Prostate Tissues: A Relevant Preclinical Model that Preserves Hypoxia Sensitivity and Calcium Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954471,The American journal of pathology,2019 05 20,"In prostate cancer research, there is a lack of valuable preclinical models. Tumor cell heterogeneity and sensitivity to microenvironment signals, such as hypoxia or extracellular calcium concentration, are difficult to reproduce. Here, we developed and characterized an ex vivo tissue culture model preserving these properties. Prostate tissue slices from 26 patients were maintained ex vivo under optimized culture conditions. The expression of markers associated with proliferation, androgen-receptor signaling, and hypoxia was assessed by immunostaining. A macroscope was used to achieve real-time calcium fluorescence optical imaging. Tissue morphology was maintained successfully without necrosis for 5 days. Compared with native tumors and tissue cultured with androgens, androgen deprivation in the medium led to decreased expression of both androgen receptor and its target gene products, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Ex vivo cultured slices also were sensitive to hypoxia because carbonic anhydrase IX and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1) protein levels increased in 1% oxygen.

In practice,2019 05 11,"Severe asthma is complex and heterogeneous; ad hoc outpatient assessment can be suboptimal. Systematic evaluation improves outcomes and is recommended by international guidelines. Electronic templates improve physician performance and clinical processes, and may be useful in severe asthma systematic evaluation. We developed the Severe Asthma Global Evaluation (SAGE) electronic platform to streamline this process, via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). It incorporates: a questionnaire battery for patient completion before clinical consultation; asthma and comorbidity modules; a clinical summary page in an asthma management module; a nurse educator module; a structured panel discussion record; and an automatically generated report incorporating all key data. SAGE incorporates 282 clinician input fields, with a typical consultation requiring completion of 169. To streamline the process SAGE contains 34 autocalculations and 20 decision support tools. It incorporates all 95 core variables of the International Severe Asthma Registry, with which it is directly compatible. SAGE improves symptom control and exacerbations in patients with difficult asthma. In conclusion, we developed and validated an electronic platform that facilitates a comprehensive but streamlined systematic evaluation of severe asthma that is available for free download via REDCap. Its use enhances management of patients with severe asthma and facilitates audit and international research collaboration.",Is It Time for a Patient-Centered Quality Measure of Asthma Control?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954466,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology. In practice,2019 04 07,"Quality measures play a prominent role in the US health care system. They are used to monitor and report performance across health plans, providers, and health systems and are a foundational element of value-based payment. Measuring the quality of asthma care has been challenging because of a lack of reliable data to assess clinical processes and track patient-specific outcomes. Existing asthma Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures rely on administrative claims-derived data on dispensed medications. These are proxy measures of appropriate prescribing but are not reflective of comprehensive asthma care. The increase in the volume and specificity of longitudinal clinical data in electronic health records, movement toward electronic quality measures, and advances in electronic clinical data systems enable the development of more meaningful measures. A patient-reported measure of asthma control would incorporate key clinical indicators such as a validated age- and culturally appropriate test, and would reflect the combined outcome of medical management, self-management education, reduction of environmental exposures, and appropriate support services. Although there is a current quality measure that includes a test of asthma control (the Optimal Asthma Control Measure), work is needed to address questions about usability, patient literacy, and the influence of setting on self-reported scores. Comprehensive reliability and validity testing of both clinical data and stratification across risk groups will be needed to determine whether a measure based on standardized assessments of asthma control indeed promote improved clinical outcomes.",In vitro SOD-like activity of mono- and di-copper complexes with a phosphonate substituted SALAN-type ligand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954465,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 05,"SALEN- and SALAN-based complexes with catalytically active metal centers are very promising small molecules to be utilized as part of antioxidant therapies. Here we discuss a modified SALAN-type molecule armed with two phosphonate groups that significantly increase its water solubility and aid to furnish mono- or dinuclear complexes with Cu2+ ions. The regulation of the SOD-mimicking (i.e., catalytic) disproportionation reaction of the superoxide radical anion (O2•-) at pH ~7.5 could be achieved by adjusting the metal-to-ligand stoichiometry as confirmed by McCord-Fridovich and pulse radiolysis tests. The higher antioxidant activity of the dicopper complex can be explained by the better access of O2•- to the copper centers and their more positive Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox potential. Simultaneously the analysis of in vitro effect on cells morphology indicates that cytotoxicity is also affected by the metal-to-ligand ratio, however, the active complex molecules do not show notable cytotoxicity that, together with the observed SOD-like activities, makes them potential candidates for antioxidant therapies.",Hesperidin inhibits synovial cell inflammation and macrophage polarization through suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway in complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954464,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 05,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by synovitis. Synovitis can cause joint injury by releasing inflammatory factors and metalloproteinases (MMPs). Therefore, it is necessary to find drugs that can control synovitis in the process of RA. Herein, we investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Hesperidin (HSN) on fibroblast-like synovial (FLS) cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the protective action of M1 polarization level of synovial macrophages on antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in order to elucidate the reduction of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs and the inhibition of macrophage activation. The functional effect of HSN on LPS-induced mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs in FLS cells as well as on LPS-induced macrophage M1 and M2 polarization markers was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) or Western blot analyses, respectively. AIA in 2-month-old mice was generated using intraperitoneal injection with HSN (20 mg/kg/day) or LY294002 (20 mg/kg/day). The results show HSN significantly inhibited the LPS-induced gene expression of the inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, treatment with HSN relieved the antigen-induced arthritis and reduced the protein levels of MMP3, MMP9, and MMP13 in FLS and inhibited the polarization of macrophages to M1. Based on the results of our analyses, we concluded that HSN has significant anti-inflammatory activities and reduces the potential of MMPs in rheumatoid arthritis and the degree of polarization of macrophages to M1. Through the study of signaling pathways, we established that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by HSN may show therapeutic effects in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis."

These include intermittent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and periodic nocturnal dry cough. Increased symptoms often coincide with colds. Confirming a diagnosis of asthma in children can be difficult and recent reports highlight that misdiagnosis, including over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common. Recent UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend diagnostic algorithms for children from five years and adults to support a clinical suspicion of asthma.

Indeed fibrotic remodeling, particularly in cardiorenal disease states, contributes to disease progression and thus, has been a key target for drug discovery and development. Although the pGC-B/cGMP system has been perceived as a promising anti-fibrotic pathway, its therapeutic potential is limited due to the rapid degradation and catabolism of CNP by neprilysin (NEP) and natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPRC). The goal of this study was to bioengineer and test in vitro and in vivo a novel pGC-B activator, C53. Here we established that C53 selectively generates cGMP via the pGC-B receptor and is highly resistant to NEP and has less interaction with NPRC in vitro. Furthermore in vivo, C53 had enhanced cGMP-generating actions that paralleled elevated plasma CNP-like levels, thus indicating a longer circulating half-life compared to CNP. Importantly in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) and renal fibroblasts (HRFs), C53 exerted robust cGMP-generating actions, inhibited TGFβ-1 stimulated HCFs and HRFs proliferation chronically and suppressed the differentiation of HCFs and HRFs to myofibroblasts. The current findings advance innovation in drug discovery and highlight C53 as a novel pGC-B activator with sustained in vivo activity and anti-fibrotic actions in vitro. Future studies are warranted to explore the efficacy and therapeutic opportunity of C53 targeting fibrosis in cardiorenal disease states and beyond.",Investigation of the susceptibility trends in Japan to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates: A longitudinal analysis from 1994 to 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954447,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2019 04 07,"The susceptibilities of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents were surveyed to obtain an accurate understanding of trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance. The samples were collected from across Japan, biennially or triennially, between 1994 and 2016 and a defined level of resistance to fluoroquinolone was determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones over the period examined. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was 81.3-93.5% and 83.2-94.2%, respectively, which was markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, while sitafloxacin-resistant methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were isolated at 0.3-0.7% and 16.9-36.5%, respectively. The rate of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli increased from around 2-3% between 1994 and 1998 to around 35% in 2016, but the rate of fluoroquinolone-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae stayed high at over 94.6% during the study period. Although no fluoroquinolone-resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. was detected from 1994 to 2002, the resistance rate increased slightly after 2004 and reached to 1.9%-4.7% in 2016. The rate of fluoroquinolone-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections improved during the period examined from 41.8-67.0% to 91.2-94.2%, and from 78.9-88.5% to 90.1-94.6%, respectively. Against Acinetobacter spp., the susceptibility rate of fluoroquinolones was almost constant at around 90%, but one multidrug-resistant isolate was detected in 2013.

Using in vitro and in vivo models and histological and molecular analyses, we determined the role of Zfhx3 transcription factor in mammary gland development driven by Pg/PR signaling. Postnatal deletion of Zfhx3 in mouse mammary epithelial cells attenuated side-branching morphogenesis and alveologenesis. These effects were undetectable in the absence of Pg/PR signaling. During the estrus cycle, Zfhx3 expression corresponded to that of Pg, being at the highest level at the diestrus stage; Zfhx3 deletion inhibited mammary gland branching more potently at diestrus than estrus stage. Loss of Zfhx3 not only attenuated the expansion of stem/progenitor cells driven by Pg/PR signaling, but also impaired the function of Pg/PR signaling in the transcriptional activation of multiple genes. In addition, Pg/PR signaling significantly expanded PR- and Zfhx3-positive epithelial cells, and induced the physical association of ZFHX3 with PR. These findings establish Zfhx3 as an integral transcription factor of Pg/PR signaling in driving side-branching and alveologenesis during mammary gland development."

Hosts recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate both innate and acquired immune responses. However, S. suis has evolved multiple mechanisms to escape host defenses. Pathogenic proteins, such as enolase, double-component regulatory systems, factor H-combining proteins and other pathogenic and virulence factors, contribute to immune escape by evading host phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), complement-mediated immune destruction, etc. SS2 can prevent neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation to avoid being trapped by porcine neutrophils and disintegrate host immunoglobulins via IgA1 hydrolases and IgM proteases. Currently, the pathogenesis of arthritis and meningitis caused by SS2 infection remains unclear, and further studies are necessary to elucidate it.

Individuals who intend to abuse or divert prescriptions can feign symptoms easily and effectively. Efforts to identify such faking behavior have been lacking because most drug abuse screening tools and self-reported symptom inventories are known to have poor sensitivities to faking. This paper makes the case for the potential of subtle scales in the identification of faking behavior. Subtlety in scale development is the degree to which the psychopathological meaning of an item can be determined in an a priori fashion. Scales containing subtle items, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, have traditionally shown only moderate sensitivity to faking due to the lack of a tailored and focused approach. This paper provides a guide for the development of a subtle scale that is tailored to a specific condition and using sound measurement theory, a theoretical framework, and knowledge derived from literature. The Accuracy of Knowledge framework proposed by Lanyon is presented along with its application to the development of a subtle scale. Further, specific recommendations have been provided for the various steps involved in the development of a subtle scale including item development, sample selection, item refinement, and scale scoring. Use of well-developed subtle scales can present opportunities to reduce overprescribing, over-diagnosis, and help in the early identification of abuse behavior for targeted interventions.

Therefore, MnP is indispensable in the polymer and paper industries. Previous attempts of MnP expression in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies which required in vitro refolding. Aiming to investigate the bacterial production of MnP, we have revealed an interesting mechanism underlying chaperone-assisted maturation of this enzyme to its active form. Since we previously found that in vitro expression of MnP in E. coli system depends on disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, we chose SHuffle T7 Express, an E. coli constitutively expressing DsbC, as the host for in vivo expression of MnP. Initially, only a low amount of the enzyme was present in the soluble fraction, with no detectable peroxidase activity. Co-expression of MnP with different chaperone revealed that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE contributed the most to the solubility improvement, however, remained in a complex with the MnP, preventing the enzyme to assume its active conformation. We resolved this by in vitro maturation, involving incubation of the MnP-chaperone complex with hemin, ATP, and ATP regeneration system. While ATP enables the chaperones to finish the refolding cycle and release the MnP in its correctly folded form, hemin supports the formation of the holo-enzyme with fully recovered peroxidase activity. We believe that the findings of this paper will serve as an important clue for establishing the bacterial production of fungal peroxidases in the future.",Language development in children with congenital heart disease aged 12-24 months.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954376,European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,2019 06 10,"This longitudinal study aims to describe the trajectory of language development in children with CHD aged 12-24 months assessed through an early monitoring and individualized intervention program. We also sought to determine whether early language performances, at 12 months of age, predict 24-month language abilities. We conducted developmental assessments of 49 children with CHD using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Developmental, third edition (Bayley-III) at 12 and 24 months, and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MBCDI) at 12, 18 and 24 months. Compared to normative populations, CHD patients showed significantly lower mean scores in both receptive and expressive language scales of the Bayley-III and the MBCDI at 12 months, whereas at 18 and 24 months only expressive language scores were reduced. No differences were found in the cognitive scale. Communicative gestures at 12 months were significantly predictive of language skills at 24 months of age. Our findings indicate specific vulnerability of language outcome, especially in expressive skills, rather than a global cognitive impairment in our patients with CHD. We recommend using communicative gestures as an early marker of language development to improve our ability to detect language delays in this population.",Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and angiogenesis: from cancer to cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954375,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,2019 04 30,"Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated activity that is vital during embryonic development and for normal physiological repair processes and reproduction in healthy adults. Pathological angiogenesis is a driving force behind a variety of diseases including cancer and retinopathies, and inhibition of angiogenesis is a therapeutic option that has been the subject of much research, with several inhibitory agents now available for medical therapy. Conversely, therapeutic angiogenesis has been mooted as having significant potential in the treatment of ischemic conditions such as angina pectoris and peripheral arterial disease, but so far there has been less translation from lab to bedside. The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) are a family of seven proteins essential for the binding and transport of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF). It is being increasingly recognised that IGFBPs have a significant role beyond simply modulating IGF activity, with evidence of both IGF dependent and independent actions through a variety of mechanisms. Moreover, the action of the IGFBPs can be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the cell type and environment. Specifically the IGFBPs have been heavily implicated in angiogenesis, both pathological and physiological, and they have significant promise as targeted cell therapy agents for both pathological angiogenesis inhibition and therapeutic angiogenesis following ischemic injury. In this short review we will explore the current understanding of the individual impact of each IGFBP on angiogenesis, and the pathways through which these effects occur.",The mesenchymal stem cell secretome: A new paradigm towards cell-free therapeutic mode in regenerative medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954374,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,2019 04 30,"Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been shown to be a promising candidate for cell-based therapy. The therapeutic potential of MSCs, towards tissue repair and wound healing is essentially based on their paracrine effects. Numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies of MSCs have yielded encouraging results. Further, these cells have been shown to be relatively safe for clinical applications. MSCs harvested from numerous anatomical locations including the bone marrow, adipose tissue, Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord etc., display similar immunophenotypic profiles. However, there is a large body of evidence showing that MSCs secrete a variety of biologically active molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines. Despite the similarity in their immunophenotype, the secretome of MSCs appears to vary significantly, depending on the age of the host and niches where the cells reside. Thus, by implication, proteomics-based profiling suggests that the therapeutic potential of the different MSC populations must also be different. Analysis of the secretome points to its influence on varied biological processes such as angiogenesis, neurogenesis, tissue repair, immunomodulation, wound healing, anti-fibrotic and anti-tumour for tissue maintenance and regeneration. Though MSC based therapy has been shown to be relatively safe, from a clinical standpoint, the use of cell-free infusions can altogether circumvent the administration of viable cells for therapy. Understanding the secretome of in vitro cultured MSC populations, by the analysis of the corresponding conditioned medium, will enable us to evaluate its utility as a new therapeutic option. This review will focus on the accumulating evidence that points to the therapeutic potential of the conditioned medium, both from pre-clinical and clinical studies. Finally, this review will emphasize the importance of profiling the conditioned medium for assessing its potential for cell-free therapy therapy.",[Primary care in Denmark].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954373,Semergen,2019 04 07,"Scandinavian countries have one of the best health services, as well as quality of life, in all Europe.

Neurology,2019 05 24,"Stroke represents a massive public health problem. Carotid atherosclerosis plays a fundamental part in the occurence of ischaemic stroke. European and US guidelines for prevention of stroke in patients with carotid plaques are based on quantification of the percentage reduction in luminal diameter due to the atherosclerotic process to select the best therapeutic approach. However, better strategies for prevention of stroke are needed because some subtypes of carotid plaques (eg, vulnerable plaques) can predict the occurrence of stroke independent of the degree of stenosis. Advances in imaging techniques have enabled routine characterisation and detection of the features of carotid plaque vulnerability. Intraplaque haemorrhage is accepted by neurologists and radiologists as one of the features of vulnerable plaques, but other characteristics-eg, plaque volume, neovascularisation, and inflammation-are promising as biomarkers of carotid plaque vulnerability. These biomarkers could change current management strategies based merely on the degree of stenosis.",Does trunk and hip muscles strength predict the performance during a core stability test?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954371,Brazilian journal of physical therapy,2019 04 07,A better understanding about the relationship between trunk and hip muscles strength and core stability may improve evaluation and interventions proposed to improve core stability.,Renal resistive index as a predictive factor of delayed graft function: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954370,"Transplantation reviews (Orlando, Fla.)",2019 04 07,"Delayed graft function represents a major complication of kidney transplantation, leading to high rates of short and long-term morbidity.

More than 90 disease-causing variants have been identified in the fah gene. We investigated the molecular defect in a patient who presented atypical symptoms for the disease. No immunoreactive FAH was found in the liver and RNA analysis by RT-PCR suggested the presence of splicing mutations. Indeed, the patient was revealed to be a compound heterozygote for IVS6-1 g- > t and two new variants, namely p.V259L and p.G398E. Using splicing minigene constructs transfected in HeLa cells, the c.775G > C variant (p.V259L) was shown to affect partially exon 9 splicing thereby allowing the production of some full-length double-mutant FAH transcripts. The p.G398E variant had a major impact on enzyme activity, which was worsened by the p.V259L variant. Surprisingly, the double mutant protein was expressed to similar level as the wild-type protein upon transfection in HeLa cells but was absent in the patient liver extract, suggesting a higher propensity to be degraded in the hepatocellular context.",Assessment of conversational pragmatics: A screening tool for pragmatic language impairment in a control population of children aged 6-12 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954368,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,2019 04 28,"Pragmatics can be defined as the way in which language is used to communicate in a given social context. Although there is a lack of a standardized assessment, healthcare professionals find themselves confronted with pragmatic language skill impairments in children with neurodevelopmental disorders or brain injuries. The characterization of language use causes problems in social interactions, which has clinical implications in daily life. However, this is still underestimated because there is currently no quick, easy-to-use screening device to rank these deficits. We have developed a pragmatic deficits screening chart that has been tested on a control population of children aged 6-12 years. The chart comprises 26 items exploring seven areas of pragmatics (intentionality, governance of exchange, organization of information, adaptation strategies, conversational implicit language, nonverbal skills, and paralinguistic aspects). Parents select one of four possible answers to describe how frequently their child demonstrates each type of behavior (""never, rarely, sometimes, often""). We distributed 1666 charts; 760 were returned, of which 552 could be analyzed. Internal consistency as measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.88) was satisfactory. There was no influence of age on total score, nor of the department/type of schooling. The population distribution was non-Gaussian so the results are presented in percentiles. We propose a first-line screening tool that is quick and easy to complete by family, which facilitates referral to specialists for further investigations into the etiological implications of pragmatic language impairment."

To aid physicians involved in the treatment of these patients in clinical decision making, the PSOGI executive committee proposed to create a consensus statement on PMP and PM. This manuscript describes the methodology of the consensus process. The Delphi technique is a reliable method for attaining consensus on a topic that lacks scientific evidence through multiple voting rounds which feeds back responses to the participants in between rounds. The GRADE system provides a structured framework for presenting and grading the available evidence. Separate questionnaires were created for PMP and PM and sent during two voting rounds to 80 and 38 experts, respectively. A consensus threshold of 51.0% was chosen. After the second round, consensus was reached on 92.9%-100.0% of the questions. The results were presented and discussed in the plenary session at the PSOGI 2018 international meeting in Paris. A third round for the remaining issues is currently in progress.

Therefore, we hypothesized that luteolin may also improve the abnormal glucolipid metabolism of hypertrophic myocardial cells. This study aimed to investigate the effect and possible molecular mechanisms of luteolin. Hypertrophic H9c2 cells were induced by angiotensin II/hypoxia and simultaneously treated with 2 to 8 μg/mL luteolin for 24 h. Luteolin might dose-dependently decrease intracellular total protein, atrial natriuretic peptide, and free fatty acid levels, and increase supernatant glucose levels. Western blot assay showed that luteolin could inhibit the expressions of intracellular hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) proteins, and increase the expressions of intracellular peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT-1A), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4) proteins. These findings demonstrate that luteolin can improve abnormal glucolipid metabolism in angiotensin II/hypoxia-induced hypertrophic H9c2 cells, and its mechanisms are related to the inhibition of HIF-1α expression and subsequent modulation of PPARα-mediated target genes, including CPT-1A, PDK-4, and GLUT-4."

Forty-two adult patients with a skeletal class III deformity corrected by Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy with a surgery-first approach were studied. Dental models were set and used to measure the surgical occlusal contact, including contact distribution, contact number, and contact area. Cone beam computed tomography was used to measure the surgical change (amount and rotation) and post-surgical skeletal stability. The relationship between skeletal stability and surgical occlusal contact or surgical change was evaluated. No relationship was found between maxillary or mandibular stability and surgical occlusal contact. However, a significant relationship was found between maxillary and mandibular stability and the amount and rotation of surgical change. The results suggest that in the surgical-orthodontic correction of skeletal class III deformity with a surgery-first approach, the post-surgical skeletal stability is not related to the surgical occlusal contact but is related to the surgical change.","Proline-based hydroxamates targeting the zinc-dependent deacetylase LpxC: Synthesis, antibacterial properties, and docking studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954331,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 04 21,"The Zn2+-dependent deacetylase LpxC is an essential enzyme in Gram-negative bacteria, which has been validated as antibacterial drug target.

Since symptom constellation, course, and outcome are heterogeneous in these patients, current research initiatives are striving to establish stratified diagnostic and treatment approaches. In the past two decades, Dirk Hellhammer and his team introduced Neuropattern, a new diagnostic concept, which is based on conceptual endophenotypes of the stress response network. We explore how to use this concept in clinical practice in order to ultimately determine whether it brings any value over standard care. In view of the novelty of the concept and the difficulties dealing with such a concept at a practical level, it was necessary to initiate an exploratory study to determine key factors for planning future clinical trials. We report results and knowledge gained from an exploratory single-site study investigating the use and potential benefits of Neuropattern in standard care. Inpatients (ICD-10 diagnosis F32, F33; Nö=ö178) were allocated to either treatment as usual (standard group, SG) or a novel Neuropattern oriented exploratory treatment (intervention group, IG). Symptom severity was assessed with psychometric tests at admission to hospital, during the first six weeks, and upon discharge from the hospital. In addition, direct and indirect costs were assessed for the 3-month-intervals prior to and after the hospital stay. Compared to the SG, depression scores of patients in the IG showed a faster decline once psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment were based on an individualized explanatory model. The patients in the IG with an F33 diagnosis showed a more pronounced reduction of depression severity during the stay in the hospital and a stronger and quicker reduction of general symptom severity. Comparing the average depression scores at the start of the study and after six weeks, symptom severity was reduced in all Neuropattern groups. Some limitations of the study have to be mentioned: The study was not blinded, was single-site, included highly depressed inpatients only, and was conducted for no longer than 8 months. The results highlight some important issues regarding taking the Neuropattern approach to the bedside and researching its efficacy and effectiveness to support personalized treatments in clinical care.","Role of mental health in the attitude toward same-sex marriage among people in Taiwan: Moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954329,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,2019 04 07,"The aims of the study were to examine the role of mental health in peoples' attitude toward same-sex marriage in Taiwan, as well as the moderating effects of gender, age, and sexual orientation on the association between mental health and attitude toward same-sex marriage.",WASP (Write a Scientific Paper): Qualitative research and evidence based practice: implications and contributions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954328,Early human development,2019 05 19,"Qualitative methodologies are commonly used in the social sciences.

For decline over time in each cognitive domain, we normalized intraindividual slopes within each cohort, accounting for baseline age, sex, and years of education. Normalized slope for each domain was used in cohort-specific genome-wide analyses after including top principal components as covariates followed by genome-wide and gene-based meta-analyses. Both analyses revealed a novel WDFY2 locus at genome-wide (p = 3.37E-08) and gene-wide (p = 7.10E-07) significance levels for the attention/processing speed domain. In the GTEx eQTL analysis, genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism was associated with RNA expression levels of WDFY2 in several brain regions: cerebellar hemisphere (p = 1.07E-04), cerebellum (p = 6.92E-04), hippocampus (p = 2.18E-03) and cortex (p = 2.29E-02), and in whole blood (p = 4.41E-05).

The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of BHBA against epilepsy. C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to lithium chloride and pilocarpine to induce epilepsy and then were administrated with 300 mg/kg/day BHBA for 30 days. The learning impairment was evaluated via Morris Water Maze. Neuron loss and cell apoptosis were detected through Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. The levels of oxidative stress-related factors were determined by commercial kits. The protein expression levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p-AMPK, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic Bax were measured through Western blots. It was found BHBA improved epilepsy- caused learning deficiency and attenuated epilepsy-mediated neuron loss and cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. BHBA ameliorated oxidative stress via decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde plus strengthening the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. BHBA also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and upregulated PPARα in the epileptic hippocampus. In conclusion, BHBA attenuates neuronal damage in epileptic mice, which is associated with its anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects as well as the activation of AMPK and PPARα.",An improved acridine orange staining of DNA/RNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954273,Acta histochemica,2019 05 20,"New tools are desirable to examine the metabolic state of individual cells within tissues. We proposed a fluorescence-based procedure consisting of acridine orange staining and fast green counterstaining (AO-FG) to improve the selectivity of the former for nucleic acids (acridine orange stains both DNA and RNA with different fluorescence colors), with no interference from proteins. We compared this test with the biochemical quantification of the relative amounts of RNA and DNA in selected rat ventral prostate samples and PC3 cells. The epithelium of the prostate gland is highly active metabolically for the production of secretions. Differences in AO-RNA staining were revealed and correlated with the metabolic state of the epithelium. Specificity was confirmed by RNase A. To assess how AO-FG staining correlates with the metabolic state of the cell, we cultured PC3 cells in different concentrations of glucose and measured the ratios between the amounts of RNA and DNA. In parallel, similar cultures were subjected to AO-FG, and the staining pattern correlated closely (r2=0.886) with the obtained biochemical results. The results confirmed that the combined use of AO and FG is useful for detecting DNA and RNA simultaneously, as well as for assessing quantitatively the transcriptional activity of individual cells and their changes in response to experimental manipulation.",Full-length human surfactant protein A inhibits influenza A virus infection of A549 lung epithelial cells: A recombinant form containing neck and lectin domains promotes infectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954271,Immunobiology,2019 06 16,"Hydrophilic lung surfactant proteins have emerged as key immunomodulators which are potent at the recognition and clearance of pulmonary pathogens. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a surfactant-associated innate immune molecule, which is known to interact with a variety of pathogens, and display anti-microbial effects. SP-A, being a carbohydrate pattern recognition molecule, has a wide range of innate immune functions against respiratory pathogens, including influenza A virus (IAV). Some pandemic pH1N1 strains resist neutralization by SP-A due to differences in the N-glycosylation of viral hemagglutinin (HA). Here, we provide evidence, for the first time, that a recombinant form of human SP-A (rfhSP-A), composed of α-helical neck and carbohydrate recognition domains, can actually promote the IAV replication, as observed by an upregulation of M1 expression in lung epithelial cell line, A549, when challenged with pH1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes. rfhSP-A (10 μg/ml) bound neuraminidase (NA) (∼60 kDa), matrix protein 1 (M1) (∼25 kDa) and M2 (∼17 kDa) in a calcium dependent manner, as revealed by far western blotting, and direct binding ELISA. However, human full length native SP-A downregulated mRNA expression levels of M1 in A549 cells challenged with IAV subtypes. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed that transcriptional levels of TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IFN-α and RANTES were enhanced following rfhSP-A treatment by both IAV subtypes at 6 h post-IAV infection of A549 lung epithelial cells. In the case of full length SP-A treatment, mRNA expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were downregulated during the mid-to-late stage of IAV infection of A549 cells. Multiplex cytokine/chemokine array revealed enhanced levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α due to rfhSP-A treatment in the case of both IAV subtypes tested, while no significant effect was seen in the case of IL-12. Enhancement of IAV infection of pH1N1 and H3N2 subtypes by truncated rfhSP-A, concomitant with infection inhibition by full-length SP-A, appears to suggest that a complete SP-A molecule is required for protection against IAV. This is in contrast to a recombinant form of trimeric lectin domains of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) that acts as an entry inhibitor of IAV.",Minimally Invasive Facial Cosmetic Procedures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954270,Otolaryngologic clinics of North America,2019 05 11,"Minimally invasive procedures including neurotoxins, dermal fillers, deoxycholic acid, lasers, peels, and microneedling offer powerful, less permanent adjuncts to surgery that are highly effective in select patients.

At the herd level, DD is often assessed while cows are standing in a milking parlor, and lesions are most commonly evaluated using the M-score. The objective of this study was to examine the interobserver agreement for M-scores of the feet of standing cattle, based on digital color photographs of dairy cattle hind feet. A total of 88 photographs and written descriptors of the M-score were sent to 11 scorers working at 10 different institutions in 5 countries. The scorers received no formal training immediately before scoring the photographs; however, all regularly used the M-score to score DD. The answers for 36 photographs were excluded from the analysis because the photograph either had more than 1 M-stage as mode or not all scorers assigned an M-score to it. The M-scores of the 11 scorers from 52 photographs were available for analysis. Interobserver agreement was tested using Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC1) and the mode was assumed correct. Overall, moderate agreement emerged for the M-score (AC1 = 0.48). For the individual M-stages, almost perfect agreement existed for M0 (AC1 = 0.99), M1 (AC1 = 0.92), and M3 (AC1 = 0.82), and substantial agreement for M2 (AC1 = 0.61), M4 (AC1 = 0.65), and M4.1 (AC1 = 0.71). This outcome indicates the degree of individual variation in M-scoring in this context by unstandardized, experienced European observers, particularly for the M2, M4, and M4.1 stages. Standardized training is likely to improve the consistency of M-scoring and thus the generalizability of future DD research results on this important endemic disease.",Prevalence of abomasal lesions in Danish Holstein cows at the time of slaughter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954266,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Abomasal lesions in cattle are challenging to diagnose because the clinical signs are often subtle and nonspecific. An increasing number of studies suggests that abomasal lesions are commonly found in cattle of all ages, but the number of recent prevalence studies in dairy cows is limited. The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of abomasal lesions in a population of Danish Holstein dairy cattle in Denmark. An abattoir survey of 1,327 dairy cows apparently suitable for slaughter was performed in 2016 and 2017. Abomasal lesions are usually classified using a standardized protocol with the following types: abomasal ulcer type I: erosions and nonperforating ulcers; type II: ulcers with arterial bleeding; type III: perforating ulcer with localized peritonitis; and type IV: perforating ulcer with diffuse peritonitis. A further subdivision of the nonperforating abomasal ulcers type I were classified as subtype Ia: erosions; subtype Ib: small ulcers with localized hemorrhage; subtype Ic: ulcers with a crater-like appearance; and subtype Id: retention of the mucosa due to tissue loss with either radial wrinkles converging at a central point or perforations of the spiral folds. Type I abomasal lesions were found in 84% of the examined cows. No ulcers with arterial bleeding (type II) or perforating ulcers with diffuse peritonitis (type IV) were found, but one perforating abomasal ulcer (type III) was observed. The total number of lesions found was 7,418 and when the lesion subtypes were evaluated individually the majority of subtypes Ia and Ic were found in the pyloric area (85 and 94%, respectively), whereas lesion subtypes Ib and Id dominated the fundus/corpus area (71 and 67%, respectively). When considering lesion subtypes according to parity, there was a high prevalence of subtype Ib across the 3 groups of parity (51, 58, and 55% for parity 1, 2, and ≥3, respectively). The prevalence of lesion subtype Id seemed to increase with increasing parity, and the prevalence of lesion subtype Ia seemed to decrease with increasing parity. The prevalence of abomasal lesions was higher than that shown in similar studies of cattle at the time of slaughter. However, the expectedly most painful cases were rare, with only one perforating and no arterial bleeding ulcers found. The etiology of the different subtype I lesions is still unknown, and further investigations are needed to establish the possible influence these lesions might have on welfare and production."

We performed country-wise comparisons of 123,415 lactations from Original Braunvieh (OB) and Grey Cattle (AL) with Braunvieh (BV; Brown Swiss blood >60%) in Switzerland; AL with BV (Brown Swiss blood >50%) in Austria; Polish Black and White (ZB), Polish Red and White (ZR), and Polish Red (RP) with Polish Holstein Friesian (PHF) in Poland; and Swedish Red (SRB) with Swedish Holstein (SH) in Sweden. Average milk yields were substantially lower for local compared with commercial breeds in all countries; differences ranged from 750 kg (Sweden) to 1,822 kg (Austria), albeit on very different average levels. Local breeds showed a longer productive lifetime by 0.64, 0.83, 1.42, and 0.20 lactations in Switzerland, Austria, Poland, and Sweden, respectively, again on very different levels in each country. Regarding fertility traits, calving interval was shorter in local than in commercial breeds by 13 (Sweden), 14 (Switzerland), and 20 d (Austria, Poland). Insemination index was lower in certain local breeds by 0.15 (Switzerland), 0.14 (Austria), 0.21 (Poland), and 0.13 (Sweden). Several local breeds showed a lower proportion of cows with >100,000 somatic cells/mL. This was the case in Switzerland (OB 24.2%; BV 35.8%), Austria (AL 25.3%; BV 36.9%), and Sweden (SRB 42.4%; SH 43.4%). In contrast, the respective proportion in Poland exceeded 82% in all breeds except the commercial PHF (76.1%). In Sweden, lactations with veterinary treatments were considerably less prevalent in SRB (15.6%) than in SH (21.7%). In Austria, breeds differed only in treatments for udder disorders, which favored AL. In conclusion, the markedly lower milk yields of local breeds are partly counterbalanced by (somewhat inconsistent) advantages in longevity, fertility, and health traits across 4 European countries. This indicates that the robustness of local breeds can contribute to improved sustainability of organic dairy systems.",Genetic evaluation of test-day milk yields from smallholder dairy production systems in Kenya using genomic relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954253,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Efforts to improve dairy production in smallholder farming systems of East Africa over the past decade have had limited impact because of the lack of records on performance to guide targeted breeding programs. Estimates of genetic parameters in these systems are lacking. Using data generated through a project (""Germplasm for Dairy Development in East Africa"") in Kenya and a genomic relationship matrix from genotypic records, we examined the potential impact of different models handling contemporary groups or herd effects on estimates of genetic parameters using a fixed regression model (FRM) for test-day (TD) milk yields, and the covariance structure for TD milk yield at various stages of lactation for animals using a random regression model (RRM). Models in which herd groups were defined using production levels derived from the data fitted the data better than those in which herds were grouped depending on management practices or were random. Lactation curves obtained for animals under different production categories did not display the typical peak yield characteristic of improved dairy systems in developed countries. Heritability estimates for TD milk yields using the FRM varied greatly with the definition of contemporary herd groups, ranging from 0.05 ± 0.03 to 0.27 ± 0.05 (mean ± standard error). The analysis using the RRM fitted the data better than the FRM. The heritability estimates for specific TD yields obtained by the RRM were higher than those obtained by the FRM. Genetic correlations between TD yields were high and positive for measures within short consecutive intervals but decreased as the intervals between TD increased beyond 60 d and became negative with intervals of more than 5 mo. The magnitude of the genetic correlation estimates among TD records indicates that using TD milk records beyond a 60-d interval as repeated measures of the same trait for genetic evaluation of animals on smallholder farms would not be optimal. Although each individual smallholder farmer retains only a few animals, using the genomic relationship between animals to link the large number of farmers operating under specified environments provides a sufficiently large herd-group for which a breeding program could be developed.",The detection of intramammary infections using online somatic cell counts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954252,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Timely and accurate identification of cows with intramammary infections is essential for optimal udder health management. Various sensor systems have been developed to provide udder health information that can be used as a decision support tool for the farmer. Among these sensors, the DeLaval Online Cell Counter (DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden) provides somatic cell counts from every milking at cow level. Our aim was to describe and evaluate diagnostic sensor properties of these online cell counts (OCC) for detecting an intramammary infection, defined as an episode of subclinical mastitis or a new case of clinical mastitis. The predictive abilities of a single OCC value, rolling averages of OCC values, and an elevated mastitis risk (EMR) variable were compared for their accuracy in identifying cows with episodes of subclinical mastitis or new cases of clinical mastitis. Detection of subclinical mastitis episodes by OCC was performed in 2 separate groups of different mastitis pathogens, Pat 1 and Pat 2, categorized by their known ability to increase somatic cell count. The data for this study were obtained in a field trial conducted in the dairy herd of the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Altogether, 173 cows were sampled at least once during a 17-mo study period. The total number of quarter milk cultures was 5,330. The most common Pat 1 pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. The most common Pat 2 pathogens were Corynebacterium bovis, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The OCC were successfully recorded from 82,182 of 96,542 milkings during the study period. For episodes of subclinical mastitis the rolling 7-d average OCC and the EMR approach performed better than a single OCC value for detection of Pat 1 subclinical mastitis episodes. The EMR approach outperformed the OCC approaches for detection of Pat 2 subclinical mastitis episodes. For the 2 pathogen groups, the sensitivity of detection of subclinical mastitis episodes was 69% (Pat 1) and 31% (Pat 2), respectively, at a predefined specificity of 80% (EMR). All 3 approaches were equally good at detecting new cases of clinical mastitis, with an optimum sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90% (single OCC value).",Is percutaneous pinning an outdated technique for distal radius fractures?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954251,Injury,2019 05 27,"Distal radius fracture is a very common injury representing 17.5% of all fractures seen in the emergency room. However, the most effective treatment is still unclear and controversially debated. For ten years, we have been facing a true revolution by the increasing use of open reduction and fixation by volar locking plates as an alternative to previous less invasive treatment such as closed reduction and percutaneous k-wire pinning. Several meta-analyses have compared the clinical results after closed reduction and percutaneous pinning and volar locking plate fixation. Volar locking plate fixation achieves better early functional recovery, better radiological outcomes and less minor complications. However, long-term results were similar for both fixation methods. In addition, worse radiological outcomes and more minor complications after closed reduction and percutaneous pinning seem not to be clinically relevant. Interestingly, volar locking plate fixation continues to be a more dominant treatment method compared to percutaneous pinning in operative care of distal radius fractures. Surgeon characteristics such as age, profession as well as location and type of the clinic seem to play a role in the decision for the surgical treatment method. It appears that implant cost plays a minor role in treatment choice between closed reduction and percutaneous pinning and volar locking plate fixation.",The mechanical and biochemical properties of tail tendon in a rat model of obesity: Effect of moderate exercise and prebiotic fibre supplementation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954249,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 03,"The worldwide trajectory of increasing obesity rates is a major health problem precipitating a rise in the prevalence of a variety of co-morbidities and chronic diseases. Tendinopathy, in weight and non-weight bearing tendons, in individuals with overweight or obesity has been linked to metabolic dysfunction resulting from obesity. Exercise and dietary fibre supplementation (DFS) are common countermeasures to combat obesity and therefore it seems reasonable to assume that they might protect tendons from structural and mechanical damage in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a DIO, DIO combined with moderate exercise, DIO combined with DFS (prebiotic oligofructose), and DIO combined with moderate exercise and DFS on the mechanical and biochemical properties of the rat tail tendon. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats, fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet were randomized into a sedentary, a moderate exercise, a DFS, or a moderate exercise combined with DFS group for 12 weeks. Additionally, six lean age-matched animals were included as a sedentary control group. DIO in combination with exercise alone and with exercise and DFS reduced the Young's Modulus but not the collagen content of the rat tail tendons compared to lean control animals. However, no differences in the mechanical and biochemical properties of the rat tail tendon were detected between the DIO and the lean control group, suggesting that DIO by itself did not impact the tail tendon. It seems that longer DIO exposure periods may be needed to develop overt differences in our DIO model.",Study of bovine sperm motility in shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954248,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 03,"To elucidate the process whereby sperm arrive at an egg in the female reproductive organs, it is essential to investigate how rheological properties of the fluid around mammalian spermatozoa affect their motility. We examined the motility and flagellar waveform of bovine sperm swimming in a fluid with similar rheological properties as mammalian cervical mucus. The results indicated that the surrounding rheological properties largely affected the flagellar waveform of mammalian spermatozoa; in particular, shear-thinning viscoelastic fluid increased the progressive motility of the sperm. To investigate the influence of flagellar waveform on sperm motility in more detail, the waveform was expressed as a function and the progressive thrust of the sperm was calculated based on the empirical resistive force theory. The results of this study showed that the progressive thrust increased with the curvature of the flagellar tip. Moreover, we calculated the thrust efficiency of motile sperm. Results showed that the thrust efficiency in shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids was larger than that in Newtonian fluids, regardless of viscosity. This suggests that motile sperm in cervical mucus move efficiently by means of a motion mechanism that is suited to their surrounding environment.",The association between left main coronary artery calcium and cardiovascular-specific and total mortality: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954247,Atherosclerosis,2019 04 18,"Left main (LM) coronary artery disease is associated with greater myocardial infarction-related mortality, however, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring does not account for disease location.

A,2019 06 03,"A direct immersion solid-phase microextraction (DI-SPME) approach for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based on hybrid fiber coating of ionic liquid and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is presented. To fabricate the task-specific coating for the enrichment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (IL) and POSS were rapidly photoinitiated copolymerized within 5 min on a stainless steel fiber. The high efficient extraction of target analytes can be attributed to a combined result of multiple interactions including the strong CF⋯HC pseudohydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, hydrophobic force, and molecular sieve effect. A wide linear range (0.04-400 ng L-1) with low detection limits in the range of 0.004 and 0.5 ng L-1 were obtained for PAHs by GC-MS. The applicability of this coupling method was successfully demonstrated by the analysis of trace PAHs in real river water and soil samples, with satisfied recoveries (84.2-108.6%) and relative standard deviations (<8.1%). Compared to the other commercial fiber-based SPME methods, the IL/POSS hybrid coating-based SPME is much cheaper, thermally stable and capable of eliminating possible deleterious effects as well."

Though much attention has been given to the neural structures that underlie the long-term consolidation of a contextual fear memory, the molecular mechanisms regulating fear generalization remain unclear. We observed that retrieval of contextual fear in a novel context at a remote time point increased coupling of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and c-Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Disrupting nNOS-PSD-95 coupling in the ACC decreased the expression of Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and inhibited contextual fear generalization at a remote time point. Together, our findings reveal nNOS-PSD-95 interaction in the ACC could be a promising target to prevent or reverse contextual fear generalization.",Interaction between LDL-mimetic liposomes and acid-treated carbon nanotube electrode during Cu2+-mediated oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954226,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 21,"Oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) causes atherosclerosis. Detection of oxidation of LDL-mimetic liposomes using an electrode might serve as a convenient tool in the search of antioxidants for the prevention of atherosclerosis. This report proposes a reaction mechanism between LDL-mimetic liposomes and an acid-treated carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode. Oxidation of the liposomes, mediated by Cu2+, was monitored by the change in electrode potential, and the fluorescence intensity generated by diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as control. The electrode potential and fluorescence intensity increased concomitantly during oxidation, followed by a gradual decrease. Although the electrical potential peaked faster than the fluorescence intensity, addition of CNT to the DPPP reaction accelerated the latter, suggesting the role of CNT as an accelerator of liposome oxidation. Atomic force microscopy showed increased binding of liposomes to CNT along with liposomal deformation. Further, binding of Cu2+ to the liposome-bound CNT surface was observed by quartz crystal microbalance. In conclusion, the interaction of liposomes with Cu2+ and CNT surface explains the rapid response of the electrode in liposome oxidation.",Axin-1 binds to Caveolin-1 to regulate the LPS-induced inflammatory response in AT-I cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954225,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 21,"Caveolin-1 has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study was designed to identify Caveolin-1-interacting proteins to reveal the molecular mechanisms of ARDS. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using Caveolin-1 as the bait, and Axin-1 was identified as a binding partner for Caveolin-1. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the binding domains were located in the N-terminal region (1-100 aa) of Caveolin-1 and the C-terminal region (710-797 aa) of Axin-1. Caveolin-1 gene knockout or Axin-1 knockdown significantly decreased the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatants of alveolar type I (AT-I) epithelial cells treated with LPS. Disrupting the interaction between Caveolin-1 and Axin-1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology led to a significant increase in TNF-α and IL-6 from AT-I cells, along with a significant reduction in β-catenin expression. In conclusion, Axin-1 functions as an adaptor of Caveolin-1 and affects the production of inflammatory cytokines in AT-I cells challenged with LPS via β-catenin-mediated negative regulation.","Lectin activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine candidates PSE17-1, PSE41-5 and PSE54.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954224,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 21,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial infections most commonly in immunocompromised, cystic fibrosis (CF) and burns patients. The pilin and Pseudomonas lectins 1 (PA-IL) and 2 (PA-IIL) are known glycan-binding proteins of P. aeruginosa that are involved in adherence to host cells, particularly CF host airways. Recently, new P. aeruginosa surface proteins were identified by reverse vaccinology and tested in vivo as potential vaccine antigens. Three of these, namely PSE17-1, PSE41-5 and PSE54, were screened for glycan binding using glycan arrays displaying glycan structures representative of those found on human cells. Surface plasmon resonance was used to confirm the lectin activity of these proteins, and determined affinities with several host glycans to be in the nanomolar range. PSE17-1 binds hyaluronic acid and sialyl Lewis A and X. PSE41-5 binds terminal β-linked galactose structures, Lewis and ABO blood group antigens. PSE54 binds to ABO blood group antigens and some terminal β-linked galactose. All three proteins are novel lectins of P. aeruginosa with potential roles in infection of host cells.",Reduced VMAT2 expression exacerbates the hyposmia in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954223,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 27,"Hyposmia occurs during the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD), while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Discussed are altered dopamine content and impairment of neurogenesis of olfactory bulbs (OB), which has been suggested to be linked to olfactory dysfunction. Given that mouse with reduced vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression is now deemed as a relatively new PD animal model simulating motor and nonmotor symptoms, it may provide a new insight into investigating the mechanisms of hyposmia in the context of PD. In this study, we examined the effect of subacute administration of MPTP on mice with a reduced expression of VMAT2, focusing on the histopathological and biochemical alterations, specifically, TH expression level, dopamine content as well as neurogenesis in OB. Interestingly, mice with a reduced VMAT2 expression displayed more obvious olfactory impairment in response to MPTP administration accompanied by markedly decreased dopaminergic interneurons in OB. Furthermore, neurogenesis in OB was also further impaired after MPTP due to reduced VMAT2 expression. We therefore demonstrated that reduced expression of VMAT2 contributed to the impairment of hyposmia, pathologically, the degeneration of extranigral systems and reduced neurogenesis might be the underlying mechanisms.",Enhanced tumor uptake and activity of nanoplex-loaded doxorubicin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954222,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 10,"Doxorubicin (Dox) has widespread use as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, but Dox is limited by several side effects including irreversible cardiomyopathy. Although liposomal Dox formulations, such as Doxil, mitigate side effects, they do not prolong survival in many patients. As a result, efforts have continued to discover improved formulations of Dox. We previously found that a peptide-based nanoplex delivered plasmid DNA efficiently to tumors in murine models. Unlike the majority of nanoparticles that depend solely on enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) for their transport into the tumor, our peptide-based nanoplex has a potential advantage in that its uptake primarily depends on neuropilin-1 receptor targeting. Because Dox binds to DNA, we tested whether this delivery platform could effectively deliver Dox to tumors and reduce their size. The nanoplexes increased the levels of Dox in tumors by about 5.5-fold compared to aqueous (free) Dox controls. Consistent with enhanced levels in the tumor, the nanoplex-Dox treatment had significantly greater anti-tumor activity. Whereas low dose free Dox did not reduce the size of tumors compared to untreated controls, the low dose nanoplex-Dox reduced the size of tumors by nearly 55% (p < 0.001). The high dose nanoplex-Dox also inhibited the size of tumor significantly more than the comparable high-dose free Dox (p < 0.001). Furthermore, apoptosis and proliferation markers (Ki67) of tumors observed in the different treatment groups correlated with their ability to inhibit tumor size. This study shows the efficacy of an NRP-1 targeted nanoplexes to deliver Dox to tumors in vivo and lays the groundwork for more complex and effective formulations.",Circular RNA circ-FOXM1 facilitates cell progression as ceRNA to target PPDPF and MACC1 by sponging miR-1304-5p in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954221,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 21,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been considered as key regulators in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, the study of circRNAs involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains largely unclear. In this study, we aim to explore the clinical significance, regulatory effect and mechanism of circ-FOXM1 in NSCLC. The results indicated that circ-FOXM1 overexpression was observed in NSCLC tissues and closely associated with lymph node invasion, higher TNM stage, and unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown and ectopic expression of circ-FOXM1 significantly inhibited and promoted the growth, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, respectively. Mechanistically, miR-1304-5p was discovered as a direct target of circ-FOXM1. Circ-FOXM1 upregulated the level of pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) and metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) by sponging miR-1304-5p, thereby increasing the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells. Taken together, this work revealed that circ-FOXM1/miR-1304-5p/PPDPF/MACC1 signaling was essential for the development and progression of NSCLC."

Edema, pathological evolution of venous insufficiency, favors the appearance of venous ulcers as the main complication. Leg ulcers can be treated with compression, the Unna's boot being one of them, and noncompression therapies (conventional dressing). Bioelectrical impedance analysis accurately measures the patient's body fluids. The objective of this study was to evaluate the edema evolution of the venous ulcer-affected lower limb by means of electric bioimpedance with the use of Unna's boot and noncompressive dressing. Fifteen legs with active ulcers were treated from September 2014 to December 2016. The legs were treated with Unna's boot and noncompression therapies on different days with randomized order of events. Bioimpedance was performed in the morning and afternoon to evaluate the increase in edema over the day. All patients were female with ages ranging from 50 to 76 years (mean age: 63 years). According to bioimpedance, the volume of the legs increased with both types of therapy. However, compression therapy was significantly more effective than noncompression therapy.

Relevant studies were surveyed with experimental and quasiexperimental designs that assessed the interventions for reducing back pain after coronary angiography. Data were extracted from studies and assessed. Totally 9 studies with 1062 participants which evaluated the interventions for reducing back pain after coronary angiography were included. The findings of these studies suggest that early ambulation and modified positioning were effective to reduce back pain in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The use of early ambulation 2-4 hours after angiography and changing the patients' position along with modified positioning cause a reduction in the back pain of the patients.",Effect of social support on the treatment adherence of hypertension patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954198,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 04 07,"This descriptive study was conducted to determine the effect of social support on drug treatment adherence in patients with hypertension. The sample of this study consisted of 259 patients who met the research criteria, agreed to participate in the research, and admitted to the cardiology clinic of a university hospital in Turkey between January and June 2017. Data were collected by ""Patient Information Form"", ""Adherence to Drug Treatment Self-Efficacy Scale"", and ""Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale"". It was determined that 48.3% of the patients participating in the study were in the 61-75 age group, 58.7% were female, 91.9% were married, and 66.4% were living in the city. It was also found that 71% of the patients had at least one relative or person with hypertension in the family, 79.2% were using at least one blood pressure medication, 61% adhered to his/her diet, and 72.2% adhered to the disease. The average score of the Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale was calculated as 64.24 ± 16.89, whereas the total score average of the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale was calculated as 53.74 ± 23.30.

Little is known about associated factors that help to improve this outcome. The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with functional recovery among patients with PAD after lower extremity bypass, such as postoperative period, social support, and depression. Data were collected in a University Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. A sample of 77 patients with PAD receiving lower extremity bypass treatment was recruited into the study. The interview questionnaires consisted of demographic characteristics, Medical Outcome Study social survey, Thai Geriatric Depression Scale, and Walking Impairment Questionnaire. Reliability of each instrument was 0.97, 0.87, and 0.92, respectively. Pearson's correlation was performed to identify the factors associated with functional recovery. The mean values of age, postoperative period, and walking ability score were 63.92 years (standard deviation [SD] = 11.21), 4.19 years (SD = 3.52), and 62.52 (SD = 13.83). Functional recovery and social support were significantly associated with depression (r = -0.272, P < .05; r = -0.463, P < .01, respectively). The postoperative period was also significantly associated with social support (r = 0.247, P < .03).In conclusion, psychological factors were significantly related to functional recovery among patients with PAD after lower extremity bypass. Therefore, health-care providers should consider these factors during discharge planning, and screening depression score as baseline should be performed.",Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: Following the evidence from suspicion to certainty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954195,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 04 07,"Accurate, timely and cost-effective identification of pulmonary embolism remains a diagnostic challenge.

In this study, we aimed to compare the potential risk of in-hospital DVT by stroke subtypes. This study is based on a prospective cohort (in-hospital medical complication after acute stroke [iMCAS] registry) enrolling patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In-hospital DVT was diagnosed by clinical manifestations and verified by compression Doppler ultrasound. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between stroke subtypes and occurrence of DVT. A total number of 1,771 patients were enrolled in the iMCAS. The mean age was 57.1 ± 12.9 years, and 27.5% were female patients. The median length of stay was 14 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11-16). The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission for patients with AIS, ICH, and SAH was 4 (IQR: 2-8), 4 (IQR:1-10), and 0 (IQR:0-0), respectively. In-hospital DVT after AIS, ICH, and SAH was 1.9%, 5.7%, and 7.9%, respectively. The median time from stroke onset to DVT formation after AIS, ICH, and SAH was 10.5 days (IQR: 3.8-14.5), 7.5 days (IQR:4.0-9.5), and 7.0 days (IQR:5.0-12.5), respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with ICH (odds ratio = 7.350; 95% confidence interval = 2.411-22.13; P < .001) and SAH (odds ratio = 11.92; 95% confidence interval = 5.192-27.38; P < .001) had significantly higher risk of in-hospital DVT than those patients with AIS. In conclusion, patients with hemorrhagic stroke (ICH and SAH) have significantly higher risk of in-hospital DVT than patients with AIS. Further studies on pathophysiologic mechanisms are warranted.","Translation, reliability, and validation of the Turkish version of the Lymphedema Quality-of-Life tool in Turkish-speaking patients with lower limb Lymphedema.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954192,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 04 07,"The aim of this study was to translate the original English version of the Lymph Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (LYMQoL) into Turkish language and test its reliability and validity in patients with lower limb lymphedema (LLL). A total of 119 patients (86 women and 33 men) with LLL were enrolled in this study. The Turkish version of the Nottingham Health Profile was used to evaluate the criterion validity of related domains in LYMQoL. The LYMQoL was performed after seven days to evaluate its test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha value was found to be 0.94 for internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficient score for test-retest reliability was found to be 0.95. The intraclass correlation coefficient score of domains ranged between 0.83 and 0.92. For the criterion validity, ""functional aspects"" and ""symptoms"" domains moderately correlated significantly with the Nottingham Health Profile total score. Kappa values ranged from 0.356 to 0.715. According to the factor analysis, four factors that explain the 71% of the cumulative variance were found. In conclusion, this study indicates that the Turkish version of the LYMQoL is a reliable valid tool for the evaluation of disease-specific health-related quality of life in patients with LLL. It can be safely used in both clinical routine and research."

Yet selecting the proper collective variable becomes increasingly challenging as the systems under study become more complex. Recent advancement of new descriptions of collective molecular coordinates has included graph-theoretical metrics, including social permutation invariant and PageRank (PR) coordinates, based upon the network of interactions about molecules and atoms within a system. Herein we continue the development of PR by (1) presenting a new formulation that is continuous along a reaction path, (2) illustrating that the fluctuations in PR are demonstrative of the fundamental motions of the atoms/molecules, and (3) providing the analytical derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates. The latter is subsequently combined with a harmonic bias to create the potential of mean force (PMF). As an example, we first consider the transformation of tetrahedral [Al(OH)4](aq)- to octahedral [Al(OH)4(H2O)2](aq)- using the PR PMF. Second, we explore the interchange of contact ion pair and solvent separated ion pairs of aqueous Na⋯OH, where the distance-biased PMF is projected onto PR space.

However, typically, the large dimensionality of biological systems studied makes them prohibitively expensive to work in fully Markovian regimes. In this case, coarse graining can be introduced to capture the key dynamical processes-slow degrees of the system-and reduce the dimension of the problem. Here, we introduce several possible options for such Markovian coarse graining, including previously commonly used choices: the local equilibrium and the Hummer Szabo approaches. We prove that the coarse grained lower dimensional MSM satisfies a variational principle with respect to its slowest relaxation time scale. This provides an excellent framework for optimal coarse graining, as previously demonstrated. Here, we show that such optimal coarse graining to two or three states has a simple physical interpretation in terms of mean first passage times and fluxes between the coarse grained states. The results are verified numerically using both analytic test potentials and data from explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of pentalanine. This approach of optimizing and interpreting clustering protocols has broad applicability and can be used in time series analysis of large data.",A strong dependence of the CH3 internal rotation barrier on conformation in thioacetic acid: Microwave measurements and an energy decomposition analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954056,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"Rotational spectra of thioacetic acid (CH3COSH) have been observed by pulsed-nozzle Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Spectroscopic constants are reported for both the syn and anti conformers of the parent species, as well as the 34S and 13C carbonyl isotopologues. Transitions arising from the lowest A and E internal rotor states of the methyl group have been observed and analyzed. Experimental values of the three-fold internal rotation barrier, V3, for the syn and anti conformers of the parent isotopologue are 76.300(12) and 358.056(51) cm-1, respectively, indicating a large effect of the S-H orientation on the CH3 internal rotation potential. M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) calculations are in good agreement with these results. The block localized energy decomposition method has been applied to understand the origins of this strong dependence of V3 on conformation. The results indicate that π conjugation from the SH to the carbonyl group and steric repulsion between the SH and the methyl group in the anti form are main contributors to the difference.",Interaction of hydrogen with actinide dioxide (111) surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954055,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"The interaction of atomic and molecular hydrogen with actinide dioxide (AnO2, An = U, Np, Pu) (111) surfaces has been investigated by DFT+U, where noncollinear 3k antiferromagnetic behaviour and spin-orbit interactions are considered.

The energy of atomic hydrogen adsorption on the UO2 (0.82 eV), NpO2 (-0.10 eV), and PuO2 (-1.25 eV) surfaces has been calculated. The dissociation of molecular hydrogen is not observed, shown to be due to kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors. As a barrier to the formation of a second hydroxyl group, an unusual charge distribution has been shown. This could be a limitation of a (1·1) unit cell method or an artefact of the systems.

Theoretical foundation for cluster linear target states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954052,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"Cluster perturbation (CP) theory was developed in Paper I [F. Pawłowski et al., J. Chem. Phys. 150, 134108 (2019)] for a coupled cluster (CC) target state and is extended in this paper to comprehend a cluster linear (CL) target state, for which the embedding of a CC parent state in the target excitation space is described using a linear parametrization. The theory is developed for determining the energy and molecular properties for a CL state. When CP theory is applied to a CL target state, a series of corrections is determined in orders of the CC parent-state similarity-transformed fluctuation potential, where the zeroth-order term is the energy or molecular property of the CC parent state and where the series formally converges to the energy or molecular property of the CL target state. The determination of energies and molecular properties is simpler for a CL state than for a CC state because the CL state is linearly parametrized. The amplitude equations are quadratic for a CL target state, while quartic for a CC target state, and molecular property expressions for a CL target state have the same simple structure as for a configuration interaction state. The linear parametrization introduces non-size-extensive contributions in the energy and molecular property expressions. However, since the linear parametrization describes the embedding of the CC parent state in the target excitation space, the energy and molecular properties for a CL state are weakly size-extensive. For the energy, weak size-extensivity means that non-size-extensive contributions enter in sixth and higher orders in the CP energy series, whereas for molecular properties, weak size-extensivity means that non-size-extensive contributions enter in second and higher orders. Weak size-extensivity therefore has a little or vanishing effect on calculated energies or molecular properties. The determination of the CP energy and molecular property corrections does not require that amplitude or response equations are solved explicitly for the target state and it becomes computationally tractable to use low-order corrections from these series to obtain energies and molecular properties of CL target state quality. For three simple molecules, HF, N2, and CH2, the accuracy of the CL approach for ground-state energies is tested using a parent state including single and double excitations (i.e., the CC singles-and-doubles state, CCSD) and a target state that includes triple excitations. It is found that the size-extensive fifth-order CL energies deviate by less than 0.0001 hartree from the energies of a target CC that includes triple excitations (i.e., the CC singles-doubles-and-triples state, CCSDT). CP theory with a CL target state therefore becomes a very attractive replacement of standard CC theory for high-accuracy energy and molecular property calculations, in which triple and higher excitation levels are considered.",Cluster perturbation theory.

It is demonstrated that the second-order model CPS(D-2) is identical to the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles, CIS(D) model. The third-order model, CPS(D-3), provides excitation energies of coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) quality in the sense that the difference between CPS(D-3) and CCSD excitation energies is of the same size or smaller than the effect of adding triples corrections to CCSD excitation energies. We further show that the third-order corrections can be efficiently implemented, in particular, when the resolution of the identity approximation is used for integrals. We also show that the CPS(D-3) excitation energies can be determined for system sizes that are far beyond what can be considered in conventional CCSD excitation energy calculations.","Highly-accurate density-virial-coefficient values for helium, neon, and argon at 0.01 ○C determined by dielectric-constant gas thermometry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954050,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"The dielectric-constant gas thermometer of Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) developed for measuring the Boltzmann constant with a relative uncertainty of 1.9 parts per million was used for determining the virial coefficients of the three noble gases, helium, neon, and argon, at the triple point of water (0.01 ○C).

In the method, the interaction region and asymptotic regions are applied with the local optimal coordinate system, i.e., hyperspherical and corresponding Jacobi coordinates. The IARD method is capable of efficiently and accurately accomplishing a calculation with a grid box for the Jacobi coordinate R extending several hundred bohrs for both reactant and product arrangements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the IARD method with the reaction of H + HD, which is the simplest direct reaction, and F + HD, which is a typical reaction involving resonances with products of extremely slow translational energy and requires extremely long absorbing potential in all channels."

II. Excitation energies for a coupled cluster target state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954037,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"In cluster perturbation (CP) theory, we consider a target excitation space relative to a Hartree-Fock state and partition the target excitation space into a parent excitation space and an auxiliary excitation space. The zeroth-order state is in CP theory a coupled cluster (CC) state in the parent excitation space, and the target state is a CC state in the target excitation space. In this paper, we derive CP series for excitation energies in orders of the CC parent-state similarity-transformed fluctuation potential where the zeroth-order term in the series is an excitation energy for the CC parent state response eigenvalue equation and where the series formally converge to an excitation energy for the CC target state response eigenvalue equation. We give explicit expressions for the lowest-order excitation energy corrections. We also report calculations for CP excitation energy series for various parent and target excitation spaces and examine how well the lower-order corrections can reproduce the total excitation energies. Considering the fast local convergence we have observed for the CP excitation energy series, it becomes computationally attractive to use low-order corrections in CP series to obtain excitation energies of CC target state quality. For the CPS(D-n) series, the first-order correction vanishes, the second-order correction becomes the CIS(D) model, and for the CPS(D-3) model, our calculations suggest that excitation energies of CCSD quality are obtained. The numerical results also suggest that a similar behavior can be seen for the low-order excitation energy corrections for CP series where the parent state contains more than a singles excitation space, e.g., for the CPSD(T) model. We therefore expect the low-order excitation energy corrections in CP series soon to become state-of-the-art models for determining excitation energies of CC target state quality.",Approximate high mode coupling potentials using Gaussian process regression and adaptive density guided sampling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954036,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"We present a new efficient approach for potential energy surface construction. The algorithm employs the n-mode representation and combines an adaptive density guided approach with Gaussian process regression for constructing approximate higher-order mode potentials. In this scheme, the n-mode potential construction is conventionally done, whereas for higher orders the data collected in the preceding steps are used for training in Gaussian process regression to infer the energy for new single point computations and to construct the potential. We explore different delta-learning schemes which combine electronic structure methods on different levels of theory. Our benchmarks show that for approximate 2-mode potentials the errors can be adjusted to be in the order of 8 cm-1, while for approximate 3-mode and 4-mode potentials the errors fall below 1 cm-1. The observed errors are, therefore, smaller than contributions due to missing higher-order electron excitations or relativistic effects. Most importantly, the approximate potentials are always significantly better than those with neglected higher-order couplings.","Two-body interatomic potentials for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe from ab initio data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954035,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 08,"A new method is reported for developing accurate two-body interatomic potentials from existing ab initio data.

It was hypothesized that PLE treatment (25-100 μg/mL) would reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as increase collagen production in UVB-irradiated HDF. The results confirmed this theory, with collagen production increasing in the PLE treatment group in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, regulators of cellular ROS accumulation, including HO-1 and NOQ-1, were activated by Nrf2, which was mediated by PLE. Hence, intracellular levels of ROS were also reduced in the PLE treatment group in a dose-dependent manner.

However, oxidative stress responses to hypoxia-normoxia shift in aquatic insects are still poorly understood. Here, we exposed caddisfly Stenopsyche marmorata larvae to 30-min hypoxic followed by 1-d normoxic exposure, with experiments being repeated at 14 °C (Exp.1) and 20 °C (Exp.2), respectively. Exp.1 was conducted in December 2016 using overwintering larvae, and Exp.2 was conducted in June 2016 using non-wintering larvae. The responses of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and energy reserves were investigated. The hypoxia-normoxia shift considerably inhibited CAT and ORAC in Exp.1. In addition, the energy reserves were decreased in response to exposure to severe hypoxia-normoxia. However, LPO was not induced under these conditions. It is conceivable that regulating antioxidant defense enzymes and utilizing energy reserves may suppress the expected increases in LPO. In contrast, the hypoxia-normoxia shift in Exp.2 had almost no effect on oxidative stress response, with only ORAC being induced. Exp.1 had a lower dissolved oxygen partial pressure and a larger difference in the oxygen partial pressure between hypoxia and normoxia than Exp.2. The severity of hypoxia-normoxia shift and the differences in the life cycles (overwintering or non-wintering) may cause the difference in the response of ORAC in Exp.1 and Exp.2. This study revealed that the effect of the hypoxia-normoxia shift on oxidative stress response in aquatic insects and the strength of the impact of the shift on oxidative stress response may be influenced by water temperature and life cycles.",In Situ In Vivo radiolabeling of polymer-coated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles to track their biodistribution in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954015,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"The imaging of healthy tissues and solid tumors benefits from the application of nanoparticle probes with altered pharmacokinetics, not available to low molecular weight compounds. However, the distribution and accumulation of nanoprobes in vivo typically take at least tens of hours to be efficient. For nanoprobes bearing a radioactive label, this is contradictory to the requirement of minimizing the radiation dose for patients by using as-short-as-feasible half-life radionuclides in diagnostics. Thus, we developed a two-stage diagnostic concept for monitoring long-lasting targeting effects with short-lived radioactive labels using bone-mimicking biocompatible polymer-coated and colloidally fully stabilized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAP NPs) and bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Within the pretargeting stage, the nonlabeled nanoparticles are allowed to circulate in the blood. Afterward, 99mTc-1-hydroxyethylidene-1.1-diphosphonate (99mTc-HEDP) is administered intravenously for in situ labeling of the nanoparticles and subsequent single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) visualization. The HAP NPs, stabilized with tailored hydrophilic polymers, are not cytotoxic in vitro, as shown by several cell lines. The polymer coating prolongs the circulation of HAP NPs in the blood. The nanoparticles were successfully labeled in vivo with 99mTc-HEDP, 1 and 24 h after injection, and they were visualized by SPECT/CT over time in healthy mice.",Production of 3D printed polylactide scaffolds with surface grafted hydrogel coatings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954014,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"The aim of this work was to elaborate the 3D printed polylactide (PLA) polymeric scaffolds and, subsequently, study the possibility of coating thereof with a biomedical polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogel through the previously patented protocol. Such materials have a potential to be applied in biomedical engineering, e.g. for tissue regeneration. PVP layer according to the present paper could constitute a useful biocompatible supporting layer for drug delivering implant surfaces of any shape. Polylactide (PLA) both in forms of flat foils and 3D-printed scaffolds was used to be coated with PVP layer with the Fenton-type reaction that enables the polymeric scaffold grafting with hydrogel in two easy steps. The study revealed that PVP was successfully grafted to PLA substrates. Most optimal parameters for PVP grafting process were selected. The PLA-PVP materials were found to be hydrophilic and non-toxic which is promising considering their biomedical application. The method comprising well-tested PLA scaffolds printing and then grafting them with PVP layer has a promising potential to be brought in to the industrial production due to its simplicity.",Cationic poly(cyclodextrin)/alginate nanocapsules: From design to application as efficient delivery vehicle of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen to podocyte in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954013,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Most of the drug molecules are partially insoluble in aqueous solution and then may accumulate in fat tissues hampering efficient therapy. Innovative drug delivery strategies have emerged in industry or academia over the last decades, however preserving the activity of the encapsulated drug, having high drug loading capacity and controlling drug release kinetics, are still challenging. In this context, we explored the preparation of new nanocarriers, namely nanocapsules, via a templating method, and using polysaccharides exhibiting biological functions. Cationic poly(cyclodextrin) (P(CD+)) and alginate (alg-) were initially self-assembled layer-by-layer on colloidal gold nanoparticles. Removal of gold nanoparticles was then induced thorough cyanide-assisted hydrolysis, enabling the recovery of nanocapsules. A hydrophobic drug known to allow the mutation of genes inside cells, namely 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, was loaded within the nanocapsules' shell via inclusion with the cyclodextrin cavities. The so-designed nanomaterials were incubated with immortalized podocytes to investigate i) their incorporation inside cells and ii) their efficiency for in vitro 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-induced CreERT2 recombination. This work undoubtedly highlights a proof-of-concept for drug delivery using polysaccharides-based capsules with host properties.",Layer-by-layer coated porous 3D printed hydroxyapatite composite scaffolds for controlled drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954012,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 31,"Interconnected porous scaffolds are widely used in the applications of tissue repair and regeneration. Sustained local delivery of drugs and growth factors around the implanted scaffolds could accelerate the growth of cells and contribute to the regeneration of damaged tissues. In this study, porous hydroxyapatite composite scaffolds were prepared through 3D bio-printing for bone tissue engineering and were subsequently coated with chitosan and sodium hyaluronate by layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition. It was found that the LBL coating on the porous scaffolds could reduce the swelling ratio of scaffolds in size and increase the compressive strength by about 70%. The degradation rate of the scaffolds slowed down due to the LBL coating. Rhodamine B (RHB) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were chosen as model drugs in order to understand the loading and release behaviors of the scaffolds. Small RHB molecules could penetrate deep into the LBL coated scaffolds and released a little slower than that without coating. Meanwhile, large BSA molecules showed faster release rate compared to that without coating. In addition, there was no significant cytotoxicity effect of these composite scaffolds towards MC-3T3E1 cells and the scaffolds provided proper conditions for cell adhesion and proliferation, indicating that the printed hydroxyapatite composite scaffolds exhibit a great potential in hard tissue engineering as a sustained delivery system.",Role of Y-family translesion DNA polymerases in replication stress: Implications for new cancer therapeutic targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954011,DNA repair,2019 06 10,"DNA replication stress, defined as the slowing or stalling of replication forks, is considered an emerging hallmark of cancer and a major contributor to genomic instability associated with tumorigenesis (Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015). Recent advances have been made in attempting to target DNA repair factors involved in alleviating replication stress to potentiate genotoxic treatments. Various inhibitors of ATR and Chk1, the two major kinases involved in the intra-S-phase checkpoint, are currently in Phase I and II clinical trials [2]. In addition, currently approved inhibitors of Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) show synthetic lethality in cells that lack double-strand break repair such as in BRCA1/2 deficient tumors [3]. These drugs have also been shown to exacerbate replication stress by creating a DNA-protein crosslink, termed PARP 'trapping', and this is now thought to contribute to the therapeutic efficacy. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a mechanism whereby special repair DNA polymerases accommodate and tolerate various DNA lesions to allow for damage bypass and continuation of DNA replication (Yang and Gao, 2018). This class of proteins is best characterized by the Y-family, encompassing DNA polymerases (Pols) Kappa, Eta, Iota, and Rev1. While best studied for their ability to bypass physical lesions on the DNA, there is accumulating evidence for these proteins in coping with various natural replication fork barriers and alleviating replication stress. In this mini-review, we will highlight some of these recent advances, and discuss why targeting the TLS pathway may be a mechanism of enhancing cancer-associated replication stress. Exacerbation of replication stress can lead to increased genome instability, which can be toxic to cancer cells and represent a therapeutic vulnerability.",Effects of CO2 restriction on growth of Nitzschia closterium: Evidence from stable isotopes and fatty acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954010,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"Algae blooms frequently occur in the coastal areas of China, and pose numbers of adverse effects to marine environment. Nitzschia closterium is one of the algal species associated with algae blooms and was selected as the target algae of this work. This study was the first attempt to investigate the effect of carbon source restriction on the growth of N. closterium during marine phytoplankton blooms. Experiments were implemented in the CO2-restricted (include three nutritional conditions) and CO2-unrestricted systems, respectively. The stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) and fatty acids (FAs) profiles were measured. Here we hypothesized that the deficient carbon source could lead to the changes of stable isotope ratios and FAs profiles in the N. closterium. The results showed that the δ13C of N. closterium enriched under the CO2 restriction during the culture time (the isotopic difference greater than 27.8‰), whereas depleted under CO2-unrestricted system. Furthermore, within the CO2 restriction, δ15N showed the enrichment trend with increasing culture time under the nitrogen deficiency conditions, where leveled off under the nitrogen non-deficiency conditions. A total of 12 FAs in N. closterium were detected. Within CO2 restriction, FA 20:5n-3c was the predominant congener in all the three conditions. In addition, FA 16:1n-7c was highest in nitrogen deficient, while FA 16:3 was highest in phosphorus deficient condition. Consequently, the deficient carbon sources leaded to inhibit the FA (14:0, 16:0, 16:1n-7c, 16:3, 18:0, 18:3n-3c) synthesis. Overall, the present study provided the new approach to investigate the forming mechanisms of marine phytoplankton blooms by using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions as well as FAs profiles.",Comparison of modes of action among different trophic levels of aquatic organisms for pesticides and medications based on interspecies correlations and excess toxicity: Theoretical consideration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954009,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"Pesticides and medications have adverse effects in non-target organisms that can lead to different modes of action (MOAs). However, no study has been performed to compare the MOAs between different levels of aquatic species. In this study, theoretical equations of interspecies relationship and excess toxicity have been developed and used to investigate the MOAs among fish, Daphnia magna, Tetrahymena pyriformis and Vibrio fischeri for pesticides and medications. The analysis on the interspecies correlation and excess toxicity suggested that fungicides, herbicides and medications share the similar MOAs among the four species. On the other hand, insecticides share different MOAs among the four species. Exclusion of insecticides from the interspecies correlation can significantly improve regression coefficient. Interspecies relationship is dependent not only on the difference in interaction of chemicals with the target receptor(s), but also on the difference in bio-uptake between two species. The difference in physiological structures will result in the difference in bioconcentration potential between two different trophic levels of organisms. Increasing of molecular size or hydrophobicity will increase the toxicity to higher level of aquatic organisms; on the other hand, chemical ionization will decrease the toxicity to higher level organisms. Hydrophilic compounds can more easily pass through cell membrane than skin or gill, leading to greater excess toxicity to Vibrio fischeri, but not to fish and Daphnia magna.","Understanding the inhibitory mechanism of antialgal allelochemical flavonoids from genetic variations: Photosynthesis, toxin synthesis and nutrient utility.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954008,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"Flavonoids are natural polyphenolic compounds from plants. As a new biotechnological algaecide, the molecular mechanism of plant flavonoids on the inhibition of Microcystis aeruginosa is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the variation of expressions of photosynthesis-related genes, microcystin synthesis-related genes and the genes involved in N and P acquisition in M. aeruginosa under the flavonoids stress. The results showed that the expression of psbD1, psaB and rbcL related to photosynthesis were influenced by three flavonoids but with different changing tendencies. The transcription of mcyA, mcyD and mcyH related to microcystin synthesis were decreased after 5-d of exposure, which could block microcystin synthesis. Meanwhile, flavonoids treatments resulted in the inhibition of N and P acquisition related genes transcription to affect the absorption of N and P in algal cells, and further influenced the physiological metabolic process of M. aeruginosa.",Effect of rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide on manure-derived Cu and Zn speciation distribution and bioavailability in rice-soil system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954007,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 17,"Pot experiment was conducted to examine the effects of rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on transformation of Cu, Zn from pig manure in soils and its resulting impacts on the growth of Cu and Zn uptake by a rice plant. Results showed that the exogenous application of H2O2 signiﬁcantly improved the rice biomass and yield. Addition of H2O2 into the soils led to reduced uptake of soil-borne Cu and Zn by the rice plants and this had a signiﬁcant effect on reducing the accumulation of Zn in rice grains. It was indicated that the increased pH in soil might play important role in reducing Cu and Zn content in rice. Furthermore, Cu and Zn content in exchangeable form and carbonate bounded form dramatically decreased in soil, on the contrary, the organic combination state increased significantly in H2O2 treatment. The findings point to a potential research direction that rainwater-borne H2O2 in nature may help to change morphology of heavy metals in natural soil environments, but further study is still needed to explore the related mechanisms in Cu and Zn in manures and paddy rice ﬁeld receiving rainwater-borne H2O2."

The analysis is guided by the concept of 'micropublic places' and builds on research about changing spaces of care and three types of spatial, symbolic and public-private boundary logics. Using ethnographic methods, we map three hybridization strategies that challenged spatial separations of functions, professional diagnostic labels, and public-private distinctions While these hybridization strategies have been analyzed separately in literature about specific vulnerable groups like psychiatric patients, this analysis shows how they combined to form new spaces of care.","Investigating the influence of organic acid marinades, storage temperature and time on the survival/inactivation interface of Salmonella on chicken breast fillets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953995,International journal of food microbiology,2019 05 31,"The aim of this work was to study the influence of lemon and vinegar marinades on Salmonella inoculated on chicken fillets and stored under different storage temperatures for nine days in the presence of indigenous microbiota. In addition to this, model development for the determination of the inactivation boundaries and the prediction of pathogens response was attempted. The different acid concentrations in the marinades, the type of acid, the storage temperature as well as the duration of storage impacted the levels of pathogens and background flora. The higher tested concentrations (2% and 4% v/v for acetic and citric acid) were more effective against Salmonella and spoilage microorganisms than the lower ones (0.5 and 1% v/v for acetic and citric acid), while the intermediate concentrations (1, 1.5 and 2, 3% v/v for acetic and citric acid, respectively) presented differentiations of particular interest to the microbial responses to acidic stress. The aforementioned parameters also differentiated Salmonella serovars persistence and spoilage microorganisms dominance. Regarding model development, the probability of inactivation of Salmonella was satisfactorily predicted particularly in the case of acetic acid marination while in model validation, the majority of the vinegar marinated samples were correctly classified, whereas, in case of lemon marination, a higher number of misclassifications was observed, indicating a partial weakness of the model to predict the pathogens response at interface concentrations.","Plasmids contribute to food processing environment-associated stress survival in three Listeria monocytogenes ST121, ST8, and ST5 strains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953994,International journal of food microbiology,2019 05 31,"Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen responsible for the disease listeriosis and is commonly isolated from food and food production facilities. Many L. monocytogenes strains contain plasmids, though the contributions of plasmids to survival in food production environments are unknown. Three L. monocytogenes ST5, ST8, and ST121 strains containing plasmids, which harbor putative stress response genes, were cured of their plasmids. Wildtype (WT) and plasmid-cured strains were exposed to disinfectant, oxidative, heat, acid, or salt stress. After stress exposure, cells were plated for colony forming unit (CFU) counts to determine survivors. L. monocytogenes WT strains exposed to 0.01% (vol/vol) H2O2, 1% (vol/vol) lactic acid, and 15% (wt/vol) NaCl, pH 5 showed significantly higher counts of survivors compared to the plasmid-cured strains. The number of survivors for the ST5 WT strain exposed to 10 μg/mL benzalkonium chloride (BC) was significantly higher than in the plasmid-cured strain. The ST8 and ST5 strains were exposed to elevated temperature (50° and 55 °C respectively); only the ST5 WT strain had significantly higher numbers of survivors than the plasmid-cured strains. Our data revealed that L. monocytogenes ST5, ST8, and ST121 plasmids contribute to tolerance against elevated temperature, salinity, acidic environments, oxidative stress and disinfectants.",Quantitative STEM imaging of electron beam induced mass loss of epoxy resin sections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953993,Ultramicroscopy,2019 05 31,"In sample preparation of biological samples for electron microscopy, many types of embedding media are widely used. Unfortunately, none of them is perfectly resistant to beam induced damage. The article is focused on mass loss measuring of pure epoxy resin EMbed 812 that replaced Epon - the most widely used embedding resin for biological electron microscopy, in a form of ultrathin sections with thicknesses ranging from 30 to 100 nm. The STEM imaging was performed in a quantitative way which allowed us to estimate the mass loss directly up to the total dose of 3000 e-/nm2. For data acquisition we used SEM equipped with a commercial STEM detector working at a relatively low acceleration voltage of 30 kV. In this study we estimated the influence of various factors which can affect the endurance of the epoxy resin EMbed 812 ultrathin sections under an electron beam, such as the sample aging, differences between storing the samples in forms of ultrathin sections and whole blocks, ultrathin sections thicknesses, temperature of the sample, probe current, and one or two-sided carbon coating of ultrathin sections. The aim of this work is to investigate beam induced mass loss at electron energies of SEM and find out how to reduce the mass loss.",Including aesthetic and recreational values in cost-effectiveness analyses of land use change based nitrogen abatement measures in Denmark.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953992,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"In recent years there has been an increased focus on including aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity in cost-effectiveness analyses of nitrogen (N) abatement measures. Side-effects such as aesthetic and recreational benefits generated by the land use changes implied by some N abatement measures, such as afforestation and constructed wetlands, are included in ecosystem service approaches, but seldom explicitly in cost-effectiveness analyses. While several studies have estimated these values for e.g. forests and wetlands, per se, few have studied how these effects are valued by the general population when generated through the implementation of land use changes driven by measures aimed at reducing the loss of nitrogen from agriculture. The land use changes implied by the N abatement measures have different characteristics to that of the evaluations of forests for recreation or larger wetlands created or maintained for biodiversity, mainly because the area affected varies considerably in size and shape. In this paper, we estimate the welfare economic impacts of some of the potential side-effects, such as recreational and aesthetic effects, of three N abatement measures related to agricultural land use change: afforestation, constructed wetlands or energy crops. We incorporate the value of these side-effects in a standard cost-effectiveness analysis and discuss the policy implications. This allows us to evaluate to what extent the inclusion of these side-effects change the ranking of the measures and the cost levels used. We thereby provide a more holistic approach to the cost-effectiveness analysis of land use change based N abatement measures, and discuss the challenges relating to the spatial aspects that arise when accounting for the value of the analyzed side-effects. The analysis shows that public access to the area largely determine whether the selected measures are perceived as positive or negative. The impact of the analyzed side-effects on the cost-effectiveness analysis critically depends on the size of the affected population, as the value of the side-effects are measured per household.",Does open-beach ship-breaking affect the mineralogical composition of soil more adversely than typical industrial activities?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953991,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"In Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan the ship breaking (SB) sector dismantles end-of-life ships on open beaches, exposing the environment to the resulting pollution, especially the soil and water. Because SB occurs in the vicinity of other poorly-regulated activities in industrial zones (IZ) in these countries, there is some ambiguity concerning the relative roles played by SB and IZ in the accumulation of hazardous materials in the soil. In the absence of comparative studies, this study investigated the relative levels of soil contamination due to SB or IZ in the same geographic region by taking soil samples from SB and unrelated IZs in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The technogenic input of sixty-four chemical elements into the soil at the SB or IZ were compared with off-site reference values or the natural content of these elements in the Earth's crust and surface. The magnitude of soil contamination by ecotoxic elements, the corresponding bioavailability, and the ecological risks were assessed based on the regulatory reference values (RRVs) and with other approaches using data aggregation. Among the different potentially toxic elements, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were found to be above the maximum allowable concentration (p < 0.05) in both SB and IZ. Moderate-to-high soil contamination from SB and moderate-to-considerable soil contamination in the IZ were observed. However, the element-bioavailability as ascertained via solid-phase speciation or weak-acid induced leaching, and the evaluation of associated ecological risk both indicated a low hazard quotient for soils from both SB and IZ. The outcome of the current research marked both SB and IZ soils as contaminated but not polluted, yet remediation is suggested. The level of contamination in SB soils was relatively higher than that of IZ. The comparative results presented in this study for the first time will hopefully be useful as a reference for future ecological and geochemical studies concerning the environmental contamination associated with both ship recycling on open beaches and other typical industrial activities.",Coerced resilience in fire management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953990,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"Mechanisms underlying the loss of ecological resilience and a shift to an alternate regime with lower ecosystem service provisioning continues to be a leading debate in ecology, particularly in cases where evidence points to human actions and decision-making as the primary drivers of resilience loss and regime change. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coerced resilience as a way to explore the interplay among social power, ecological resilience, and fire management, and to better understand the unintended and undesired regime changes that often surprise ecosystem managers and governing officials. Philosophically, coercion is the opposite of freedom, and uses influence or force to gain compliance among local actors. The coercive force imposed by societal laws and policies can either enhance or reduce the potential to manage for essential structures and functions of ecological systems and, therefore, can greatly alter resilience. Using a classical fire-dependent regime shift from North America (tallgrass prairie to juniper woodland), and given that coercion is widespread in fire management today, we quantify relative differences in resilience that emerge in a policy-coerced fire system compared to a theoretical, policy-free fire system. Social coercion caused large departures in the fire conditions associated with alternative grassland and juniper woodland states, and the potential for a grassland state to emerge to dominance became increasingly untenable with fire as juniper cover increased. In contrast, both a treeless, grassland regime and a co-dominated grass-tree regime emerged across a wide range of fire conditions in the absence of policy controls. The severe coercive forcing present in fire management in the Great Plains, and corresponding erosion of grassland resilience, points to the need for transformative environmental governance and the rethinking of social power structures in modern fire policies.",A mixed separation-immobilization method for soluble salts removal and stabilization of heavy metals in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953989,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"This work presents the results of a treatment process of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash using a solution of sodium carbonate as a stabilizing agent. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by means of leaching test for waste characterization according to European Standard, with special focus on soluble chlorides and heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu). Chemical, XRD and DTA/DTG analysis were used to gain insight into the chemical changes induced in the fly ash by the treatment. In the fresh fly ash, the total dissolved solids and chloride concentration exceed the acceptance limits for hazardous waste whereas fresh fly ash was classified as hazardous waste concerning Pb. The carbonated fly ash was considered as non-hazardous waste according to all studied parameters. XRD and DTA/DTG analysis of treated fly ash showed that chlorine compounds have been transferred into the liquid phase during the stabilization process. The chloride removal from the ash was complete and fast irrespective of the sodium carbonate concentration and solid/liquid ratio in the stabilization process within the range studied. The treated fly ash was mainly composed by calcite and portlandite and the chemical analysis after the leaching test demonstrated that more than 98% of heavy metals remained in the treated fly ash. Therefore, the stabilization procedure of MSWI fly ash with a solution of carbonate ions achieved the separation of soluble salts and the leaching stabilization of heavy metals simultaneously in one step.",New process for conversion of hazardous industrial effluent of ceramic industry into nanostructured sodium carbonate and their application in textile industry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953988,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"Increase in industrialization as a tool to become global leader has led to an exponential rise in environmental pollution. The present study describes a process developed to extract nanocrystalline sodium carbonate from chemical industry effluents, which contributes to wealth creation from hazardous waste. Sodium carbonate is a high demand product because of its applications in detergents, dyeing, glass, and paper manufacturing. In the present work, we have extracted nanostructured sodium carbonate using industrial waste (alkaline solution of silicates, obtained from ceramic industry) and carbon dioxide (a major component of flue gas effluent from power plants). Here we have collected waste from ceramic industries, which is highly corrosive (pH 13-14) and disposal of such waste is dangerous to the environment and needs to be taken special care. Pure carbon dioxide has been purged in collected industrial waste to get nanoparticles and flakes structure of sodium carbonate at room temperature. The use of the nanostructured sodium carbonate in the dyeing of textiles was encouraging. Significantly, higher dyeing efficacy was observed compared to the fabric dyed in the absence of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The nanocrystalline particles show much better color strength than bulk sodium carbonate when K/S value was compared. Na2CO3 with the minimum particle size (26 nm) results in the maximum color strength (K/S = 14.49).",Life cycle assessment (LCA) of food waste treatment in Hong Kong: On-site fermentation methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953987,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"""Smart Food Waste Recycling Bin"" (S-FRB) systems have recently been developed to facilitate the transformation of food waste into an end-product suitable for use as an energy resource following circular economy principles.

This paper utilizes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the environmental impacts associated with this S-FRB technology and identify environmental hotspots to reduce these impacts. In this paper, we have conducted an on-site pilot-scale study for 2 months at a canteen located at the City University of Hong Kong, which resulted in a 90% reduction in the mass of food waste treated in the S-FRB system. Based on this pilot-scale study hypothetical scenarios were developed to determine potential environmental impacts potential scaled-up deployments of the S-FRB instrument based on varied assumptions. Examination of the LCAs of these different scenarios demonstrated the potential for further reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions during food waste treatment. Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and Energy Return on Investment (EROI) were also investigated to understand the energy balance energy of the S-FRB technology. Finally, using current waste treatment methods in Hong Kong as a benchmark, the environmental impacts of the S-FRB are compared with the conventional food waste treatment approaches such as landfilling and organic waste treatment facilities (OWTF)."

However, redox-independent functions of thioredoxins have been described in different organisms, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet unknown. We report here the characterization of the first generated endogenous redox-inactive thioredoxin in an animal model, the TRX-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that TRX-1 dually regulates the formation of an endurance larval stage (dauer) by interacting with the insulin pathway in a redox-independent manner and the cGMP pathway in a redox-dependent manner. Moreover, the requirement of TRX-1 for the extended longevity of worms with compromised insulin signalling or under calorie restriction relies on TRX-1 redox activity. In contrast, the nuclear translocation of the SKN-1 transcription factor and increased LIPS-6 protein levels in the intestine upon trx-1 deficiency are strictly redox-independent. Finally, we identify a novel function of C. elegans TRX-1 in male food-leaving behaviour that is redox-dependent. Taken together, our results position C. elegans as an ideal model to gain mechanistic insight into the redox-independent functions of metazoan thioredoxins, overcoming the limitations imposed by the embryonic lethal phenotypes of thioredoxin mutants in higher organisms.",The neural and cognitive architecture for learning from a small sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953964,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 04,"Artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of fantastic exploits, yet they are still grossly inefficient compared with the brain's ability to learn from few exemplars or solve problems that have not been explicitly defined.

The brain does not directly solve difficult problems, it is able to recast them into new and more tractable problems.

EMT can be activated by external triggers such as cytokines or metabolic parameters (e.g. hypoxia). Since extracellular acidosis is a common finding in tumors, the aim of the study is to analyze its impact on the expression of EMT markers in vitro and in vivo as well as the functional impact on cell adhesion. Therefore, three tumor and two normal epithelial cell lines were incubated for 24 h at pH 6.6 and the expression of EMT markers was studied. In addition, mRNA expression of transcription and metabolic factors related to EMT was measured as well as the functional impact on cell adhesion, either during acidic incubation or after priming cells in an acidic milieu. E-cadherin and N-cadherin were down-regulated in all tumor and normal cell lines studied, whereas vimentin expression increased in only two tumor and one normal cell line. Down-regulation of the cadherins was seen in total protein and to a lesser extent in surface protein. In vivo an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin expression was found. Acidosis up-regulated Twist1 and Acsl1 but down-regulated fumarate hydratase (Fh). Cell adhesion during acidic incubation decreased in AT1 prostate carcinoma cells whereas preceding acidic priming increased their subsequent adhesion. Low tumor pH is able to modulate the expression EMT-related proteins and by this may affect the stability of the tissue structure.","A time series analysis of the relationship between apparent temperature, air pollutants and ischemic stroke in Madrid, Spain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953949,Environmental research,2019 05 13,"The understanding of the role of environment on the pathogenesis of stroke is gaining importance in the context of climate change. This study analyzes the temporal pattern of ischemic stroke (IS) in Madrid, Spain, during a 13-year period (2001-2013), and the relationship between ischemic stroke (admissions and deaths) incidence and environmental factors on a daily scale by using a quasi-Poisson regression model. To assess potential delayed and non-linear effects of air pollutants and Apparent Temperature (AT), a biometeorological index which represents human thermal comfort on IS, a lag non-linear model was fitted in a generalized additive model. The mortality rate followed a downward trend over the studied period, however admission rates progressively increased. Our results show that both increases and decreases in AT had a marked relationship with IS deaths, while hospital admissions were only associated with low AT. When analyzing the cumulative effects (for lag 0-14 days), with an AT of 1.7 °C (percentile 5%) a RR of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05-1.37) for IS mortality and a RR of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.91-1.29) for morbidity is estimated. Concerning gender differences, men show higher risks of mortality in low temperatures and women in high temperatures. No significant relationship was found between air pollutant concentrations and IS morbi-mortality, but this result must be interpreted with caution, since there are strong spatial fluctuations of the former between nearby geographical areas that make it difficult to perform correlation analyses.",A comparative analysis of black spot identification methods and road accident segmentation methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953947,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 05 19,"Indicating road safety-related aspects in the phase of planning and operating is always a challenging task for experts. The success of any method applied in identifying a high-risk location or black spot (BS) on the road should depend fundamentally on how data is organized into specific homogeneous segments. The appropriate combination of black spot identification (BSID) method and segmentation method contributes significantly to the reduction in false positive (a site involved in safety investigation while it is not needed) and false negative (not involving a site in safety investigation while it is needed) cases in identifying BS segments. The purpose of this research is to study and compare the effect of methodological diversity of road network segmentation on the performance of different BSID methods. To do this, four commonly applied BS methods (empirical Bayesian (EB), excess EB, accident frequency, and accident ratio) have been evaluated against four different segmentation methods (spatial clustering, constant length, constant traffic volume, and the standard Highway Safety Manual segmentation method). Two evaluations have been used to compare the performance of the methods. The approach first evaluates the segmentation methods based on the accuracy of the developed safety performance function (SPF). The second evaluation applies consistency tests to compare the joint performances of the BS methods and segmentation methods. In conclusion, BSID methods showed a significant change in their performance depending on the different segmentation method applied. In general, the EB method has surpassed the other BSID methods in case of all segmentation approaches.",Cr(VI) removal from a synthetic solution using a novel carbonaceous material prepared from oily sludge of tank bottom.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953946,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"A novel carbonaceous material (NCM), prepared by the pyrolyzation of the oily sludge of tank bottom, was proposed to remove Cr(VI) from a synthetic solution for the first time. The effects of initial Cr(VI) concentration, NCM dosage and initial solution pH on Cr(VI) removal and the adsorption kinetics, the adsorption isothem were investigated. The removal mechanism was studied by comparing the surface properties of NCM before and after the Cr(VI) removal. The results showed that NCM can effectively remove Cr(Ⅵ) from the synthetic solution with the increase of solution pH at equilibrium. At the initial Cr(Ⅵ) concentrations of 40, 100, 150 and 250 mg/L and NCM dosages of 1, 3, 6 and 8 g/L with initial solution pH of 2, the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) was 95.5, 96.8, 95.2 and 81.2%, and the solution pH at equilibrium reached 2.3, 3.5, 5.8 and 7.5, respectively. NCM was suitable for Cr(Ⅵ) removal while the initial Cr(VI) concentration was less than 100 mg/L and initial solution pH was lower than 2.5. Most of Cr(VI) was removed by the reduction of Fe2+ and S2- in NCM to Cr(III) and with the generation of stable FeCr2O4. Some Cr(VI) may be removed by reacting with Fe2+ and Ca2+ to produce CaCrO4 and FeCrO4 on the NCM surface. The dissolution of CaAl2Si2O8 and CaS in the solution increased the solution pH at equilibrium. NCM has been proved to be a material with dual functions both chemical reduction and adsorption.",Exploration of sources of OVOCs in various atmospheres in southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953945,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) are critical atmospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors and radical sources, while understanding of OVOC sources in the atmosphere, especially with large anthropogenic emissions, still has large uncertainties.

Four critical OVOCs, i.e., methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and acetaldehyde, five groups of aromatic hydrocarbons, isoprene and acetonitrile were measured with a high time resolution. The featured relative abundance and diurnal variations of the OVOCs indicated that methanol, acetone and MEK had prominent contributions from urban industrial activities, while acetaldehyde was closely related to the photochemical formation at all three sites. The photochemical age-based parameterization method was improved locally and then applied to quantify different sources of daytime OVOCs: anthropogenic secondary and biogenic sources (together 60-73%) were always the dominant source for acetaldehyde in various atmospheres; in addition to a significant background for methanol, acetone and MEK, anthropogenic primary emissions (mostly industrial) were their dominant source at SZ-U (38-73%), while biogenic sources played the key role for them at NL-B (30-43%); biomass burning contributed a small fraction of 5-17% for the four OVOCs at the three sites.",Exposure to Aroclor 1254 persistently suppresses the functions of pancreatic β-cells and deteriorates glucose homeostasis in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953944,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of persistent organic pollutants that have been shown to be related to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

After stopping exposure for 90 d, treated mice returned to normoglycemia and normal FSIL. After re-exposure of these recovered mice to Aroclor 1254 for 30 d, fasting plasma glucose showed 15%, 28% and 16% increase in the 5, 50 and 500 μg kg-1 treatments, FSIL exhibited 35%, 27%, 30% and 32% decrease in the 0.5, 5, 50 or 500 μg kg-1 groups respectively, and there was no change in pancreatic β-cell mass.

The massive increase in plastics production, combined with a shift to single-use, disposable plastics and widespread mismanagement of plastic waste, has created a huge ""tragedy of the commons"" (Hardin, 1968) in our oceans, seas and waterways. Plastics pollution is now a global externality that damages ecosystems, curtails biodiversity and ultimately has the potential to affect everyone on the planet. Although waste output is often modelled separately from environmental pollution in research, in the case of plastics, the waste problem has become one of global pollution. In this paper, we model the relationship between mismanaged plastic waste1 and income per capita for 151 countries, and for the first time find empirical support for the environmental Kuznets curve using plastics pollution data. Further, we find support for the hypothesis that a key instrument for reducing plastics pollution is investment in scientific and technological research.

Stimulus intensity, safety and efficacy of a TMS treatment are dependent of the correct assessment of the CMT. Given that TMS in dogs could serve as a natural animal model, an accurate and reliable technique for the measurement of the CMT should be available for dogs. Using a visual descending staircase paradigm (Rossini paradigm), the CMT repeatability was assessed and compared to the electromyographic (EMG) variant. The influence of a HF-rTMS treatment on the CMT was examined. Subsequently, the CMT was measured under sedation and general anaesthesia. Finally, the coil-cortex distance was associated with the CMT, weight, age and gender. During one year the CMT was measured three times, during which it remained constant, although a higher CMT was measured (40% higher machine output) when using EMG (P-value < .001) and under general anaesthesia (P-value = .005). On average, a 40% and 12% higher machine output were registered. An aHF-rTMS protocol does not influence the CMT. Males have on average a 5.2 mm larger coil cortex distance and an 11.81% higher CMT. The CMT was positively linearly associated (P-value < .05) with the weight and age of the animals. Only within female subjects, a positive linear association was found between the CMT and the coil-cortex distance (P-value = .02). Using the visual Rossini paradigm, the CMT can be reliably used over time and during a TMS treatment. It has to be kept in mind that when using EMG or assessing the CMT under general anaesthesia, a higher CMT is to be expected. As in humans, every parameter that influences the coil-cortex distance may also influence the CMT."

In the present study, we found that homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein translation inhibitor of plant alkaloid in China, exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against FLT3-ITD (+) cell lines and primary leukemia cells, and a remarkable synergistic anti-leukemia action was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mouse models when co-treated with the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor IPI504. Mechanistically, HHT combined with IPI504 synergistically inhibited the growth of leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. This synergistic action resulted in a prominent reduction of total and phosphorylated FLT3 (p-FLT3) as well as inhibition of its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT5, AKT, ERK and 4E-BP1. Furthermore, co-treatment of HHT and IPI504 led to a synergistic or additive effect on 55.56%(10/18) of acute myeloid leukemia cases tested, including three relapsed/refractory patients.

Bi2Se3 is a model compound, and 209Bi NMR is employed here to investigate the bulk properties of the material with focus on the quadrupole splitting. It will be shown that this splitting measures the energy band inversion induced by spin-orbit coupling in quantitative agreement with first-principle calculations. Furthermore, this quadrupole interaction is very unusual as it can show essentially no angular dependence, e.g., even at the magic angle the first-order splitting remains. Therefore, it is proposed that the magnetic field direction is involved in setting the quantization axis for the electrons, and that their life time leads to a new electronically driven relaxation mechanism, in particular for quadrupolar nuclei like 209Bi. While a quantitative understanding of these effects cannot be given, the results implicate that NMR can become a powerful tool for the investigation of such systems.",Methodology for the non-destructive characterization of jadeite-jade for archaeological studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953922,"Spectrochimica acta.

Because of daptomycin high protein binding and its high molecular weight, the optimisation of the extraction protocol and analytical conditions were deeply investigated, and several parameters were taken into account: in particular the type of extraction, internal standard, the type of organic modifier, pH of the aqueous solution, and gradient. The use of a protein precipitation protocol coupled to a C8-reverse phase LC-MS/MS allows for a reliable quantification of daptomycin in both plasma (in the range of 19-199 μg/mL) and breast milk (in the range of 0.12-0.32 μg/mL).

The recoveries varied, depending on the matrix, between 1% and 100%, but nevertheless, a high accuracy was obtained even at the lowest recoveries. A reduction of sample mass could significantly increase method recoveries and therefore it is highly recommended to take less matrix. We confirmed that using the ISTD closest in terms of functional group and carbon chain length is a suitable method for the quantification of PFASs that lack a corresponding ISTD. The newly described method was, depending on the matrix, similar in terms of sensitivity and reliability compared to a frequently used method and could be used simultaneously in future monitoring studies. Therefore, we recommend to select the purification method based on the target analytes as well as the sample matrix. CAPSULE: The newly described method was similar in terms of sensitivity and reliability compared to a frequently used method and a selection of purification methods should be based on the target analyte and sample matrix.",Miniaturized imprinted solid phase extraction to the selective analysis of Coenzyme Q10 in urine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953919,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 05 20,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an important cofactor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and a potent endogenous antioxidant. CoQ10 deficiency is currently associated with numerous diseases like mitochondrial and neurodegenerative pathologies, in which the earliest diagnosis and treatment with CoQ10 supplementation becomes paramount for patient's treatment. Consequently, the determination of CoQ10 levels in different biological matrices positions as a fundamental tool. Urine is an attractive and non-invasive alternative source to tissue, blood or other biofluids for CoQ10 analysis. However, it poses an analytical challenge, as it generally requires a complex sample preparation, with multiple steps. In this work we developed and validated a molecularly imprinted polymer solid phase extraction (MIP-SPE) followed by a HPLC-MS/MS method for the analysis of CoQ10 in urine. The MIP-SPE method developed is simple and fast compared to previously traditional reported methods, with reduced processing time, improved sample cleaning and excellent recovery values, along with its inherent high selectivity. The developed chromatographic method was validated according to FDA guidelines, and demonstrated to be suitable for the analysis of CoQ10 in urine samples with LOQ and LOD values of 0.6 ng/mL and 0.2 ng/mL of CoQ10 in urine respectively. Recovery values at three concentration levels were higher than 90.0%.The proposed method is amenable to be applied in pediatric patients due to the low sample requirement and useful for diagnosis and post-treatment control.",Quantification of residual AEBSF-related impurities by reversed-phase liquid chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953918,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 05 20,"During research of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) for HIV-1 infection, site-specific clipping was observed during cell culture incubation. Protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), was supplemented to the cell culture feeding to mitigate clipping as one of the control strategies. It led to the need and development of a new assay to monitor the free AEBSF-related impurities during the purification process. In this work, a reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC-UV) method was developed to measure the total concentration of AEBSF and its major degradant product, 4-(aminoethyl) benzenesulfonic acid (AEBS-OH). This quantitative approach involved hydrolysis pre-treatment to drive all AEBSF to AEBS-OH, a filtration step to remove large molecules, followed by RPLC-UV analysis. The method was qualified and shown to be capable of measuring AEBS-OH down to 0.5 μM with good accuracy and precision, which was then applied for process clearance studies. The results demonstrated that a Protein A purification step in conjunction with a mock ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step could remove AEBSF-related impurities below the detection level. Overall, this study is the first to provide a unique approach for monitoring the clearance of free AEBSF and its related degradant, AEBS-OH, in support of the bNAb research.",Selective dorsal rhizotomy improves muscle forces during walking in children with spastic cerebral palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953917,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",2019 05 15,"Selective dorsal rhizotomy aims to reduce spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.

Recent advances in material science and the discovery of new microorganisms capable of extracellular electron transfer to the electrodes have widened the integration opportunities of MEC in mainstream and side-stream urban wastewater treatment. This review addresses recent developments in the integration of MEC with other processes such as membrane filtration, anaerobic ammonium oxidation and anaerobic digestion, as well as discusses current challenges and new integration opportunities.",Environmental contamination following the Grenfell Tower fire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953902,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"The Grenfell Tower fire in central London, started within a flat, engulfed the whole 24 storey building in flames, killed 72 people and spread toxic effluent via the plume and particulate deposits. Soil samples from 6 locations up to 1,2 km from the Tower, together with semi-burnt fire debris and char samples, were collected 1 and 6 months after the fire. Additionally, dust samples and condensates were collected from a flat 160 m away from the Tower after 17 months. Samples were analysed for common potentially toxic components of fire effluents and synthetic vitreous fibres. Samples collected within 140 m of the Tower showed, amongst other toxicants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin concentrations 60 times greater than UK urban reference soil levels; benzene levels were 40 times greater; levels of 6 key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were approximately 160 times greater. PAHs levels are approximately 20 times greater than those reported from nearby Hyde Park before the fire. To explain the presence of these pyrogenic contaminants char and partially burnt debris were also collected and analysed. Benzene, PAHs, isocyanates and phosphorus flame retardants were found. Hydrogen cyanide and synthetic vitreous fibres were present in both soil and debris. Particulate and pyrogenic contamination in the immediate vicinity is clearly evident, and may have leached out of fire debris, char and dust. Further analysis of the area around the Tower is necessary to understand potential health risks.",Correlating effluent concentrations and bench-scale experiments to assess the transformation of endocrine active compounds in wastewater by UV or chlorination disinfection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953901,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Transformation of endocrine active compounds (EACs) by either chlorination (Cl-D) or UV disinfection (UV-D) was studied by field sampling and bench-scale validation studies. Field testing assessed concentration of 13 EACs in effluent at two Chicago area 250 MGD wastewater reclamation plants (WRP) over two years. One WRP uses chlorination/dechlorination while the other employs UV disinfection. Target compounds included bupropion, carbamazepine, citalopram, duloxetine, estradiol, estrone, fluoxetine, nonylphenol, norfluoxetine, norsertraline, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Concentrations of 9/13 target compounds were partially reduced after disinfection (5-65% reduction). None of the target compounds were fully transformed by either chlorination or UV treatment at the WRP scale. In bench-scale experiments each compound was spiked into deionized water or effluent and treated in a process mimicking plant-scale disinfection to validate transformations. Correlation was observed between compounds that were transformed in bench-testing and those that decreased in concentration in post-disinfection WRP effluent (10/13 compounds). A survey of potential reaction products was made. Chlorination of some amine containing compounds produced chloramine by-products that reverted to the initial form after dechlorination. Transformation products produced upon simulated UV disinfection were more diverse. Laboratory UV-induced transformation was generally more effective under stirred conditions, suggesting that indirect photo-induced reactions may predominate over direct photolysis.",Hydraulics characteristics of forward osmosis membrane module boundary based on FBG sensing technology: Hydraulic properties and operating condition optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953900,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"To obtain more information on the hydraulic properties of membrane interface, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology was imported to investigate the effect of feed solution (FS) flow rate, draw solution (DS) flow rate and cross-flow direction on the membrane flux and membrane shear-force distribution of forward osmosis (FO) process. Results from experimental work demonstrated that a non-uniform spatial variation of the shear-force distribution exists along the membrane, and higher shear force is distributed in the middle position which resulted in higher diffusion load on the particular location of the membrane rind. Besides, increasing the inlet flow simply to a certain value didn't result in a higher shear force and lower the effect of concentration polarization (CP). Compared to co-current mode, counter-current mode showed the better hydraulic characteristics of higher shear-force, faster scouring frequency and consistent shear-force distribution, which will enhance the utilization of membrane and exhibit higher flux by increasing the inlet flow. Moreover, with the increase of FS and DS flow, the stress distribution showed more uniformed. Higher FS flow is more beneficial to FO process which will reduce ECP and improve flux in comparison to increasing DS flow which will produce adverse influence on ICP and diminish flux.","Neurotoxicity of BPA, BPS, and BPB for the hippocampal cell line (HT-22): An implication for the replacement of BPA in plastics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953899,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a plastic additive, is ubiquitous in the environment and has endocrine disrupting effects. As many countries have prohibited the manufacture and sale of plastic products with BPA, BPA analogs have been used to replace BPA during production, including bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol B (BPB). To investigate the toxicities of BPA and its analogs on neurons, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, Annexin V-FITC (fluorescein) apoptosis detection assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay were conducted to comprehensively assess the influence of different concentrations of BPA, BPB, and BPS on ROS, apoptosis, damage, and proliferation for hippocampal HT-22 cells, respectively. Results showed that 6 h of exposure to bisphenols (BPs) could increase the ROS levels, 24 h and 48 h of exposure could induce higher apoptosis and LDH leakage rates for HT-22 cells, and 7 d of exposure could inhibit the cell proliferations. In addition, non-monotonic dose-response relationships were observed between the concentrations of bisphenols and the toxic effects mentioned above. The neurotoxic effects of BPA, BPB and BPS on HT-22 cells were in the increasing order of BPS, BPA, and BPB. In conclusion, these results showed that exposure to BPA and its analogs may result in adverse effects on hippocampal neuronal cell lines. BPS is a surrogate with lower neurotoxicity to replace BPA in production of plastic utensils.","Exposure of liver cell culture from the orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, to benzo[a]pyrene and light results in oxidative damage as measured by antioxidant enzymes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953898,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Among the various toxicants discharged into aquatic environments, benzo (a) pyrene (BaP) has been shown to effect on the antioxidant system of fish and the evaluation of its impact on biota is of considerable concern. The aim of the present study was to use the primary hepatocyte culture obtained from the orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, to evaluate the adverse effects of benzo (a) pyrene (BaP) on cell viability and liver antioxidant system. BaP was selected for its high ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. The liver was minced by a scalpel and digested in the PBS solution with 0.1% collagenase IV at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the cell suspension was transferred to a plate contained an equal amount of Leibovitz's L-15 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU mL-1 of penicillin and 100 μg mL-1 streptomycin. 5 mL of cell suspension were plated into sterile 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks at the density of 1.5 × 106 cell/ml L-15 and incubated at 30 °C for two weeks. The medium was renewed after 24-48 h. The number of the liver cells was adjusted to 4 × 106 after two weeks. 10-4 mol l-1 was verified by MTT assay as the IC50 of BaP. Then, hepatocytes were exposed to three concentrations of BaP (10-5, 2 × 10-5, 3 × 10-5 mol L-1) and incubated for 24 h. Samples were collected after 6, 12 and 24 h and the amounts of SOD, CAT, GPx, LPO, LDH, AST, ALT, ALP and total protein were analyzed. The results showed that, 10-5 mol L-1 of BaP was not significantly toxic to cultivated hepatocytes, however, the sensitivity of cells to BaP increased in a dose-related pattern. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH) significantly increased, though the amount of LPO, total antioxidant power and total protein decreased dose-dependently in BaP-exposed cells. In conclusion, according to the finding of the present study, BaP has a high potential to induce the oxidative stress in primary liver cell culture of E. coioides.",The effects of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers on metabolic profile following exposure to zebrafish (Danio rerio) as well as the histopathological changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953897,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole are the worldwidely used fungicides. However, limited information is known about the toxicological effects of their enantiomers on aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish were separately exposed to 100 and 1000 μgL-1 hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers for 21 d 1H NMR-based metabolomics analysis showed that the exposure of low and high dose of hexaconazole enantiomers altered energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of zebrafish, with the different metabolic profiles resulted from the same dose of (+)-hexaconazole and (-)-hexaconazole. Similar to hexaconazole enantiomers, the metabolic profiles, including the changes related to energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were demonstrated in low and high dose epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups. There are differences in the metabolic profiles of zebrafish between exposed to (+)-epoxiconazole and (-)-epoxiconazole of the same dose. The results of histological examination revealed that the exposure of both enantiomers for hexaconazole and epoxiconazole resulted in the similar histopathological changes. The exposure of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers at low and high dose resulted the vacuolization and swell in the liver of the female and male zebrafish. Compared to female zebrafish, more liver damage was found in male zebrafish in the hexaconazole enantiomers exposure groups. The reduction of spermatids was observed in hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers treatment groups of both doses. Hexaconazole enantiomers exposure of low and high dose resulted the increase in the number of mature eggs, while such effect was not observed in epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure groups. Hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers exposure resulted in no changes in brains of female and male zebrafish. As a result, both triazole-based chiral bactericides, hexaconazole and epoxiconazole, have similar toxicological effects but their mechanisms of action are not exactly the same. The above results will play an important part in making the differences in toxic effects of hexaconazole and epoxiconazole enantiomers clear. What's more, it is an indispensable part for an integrated environmental risk assessment.",Evaluation of transformation products from chemical oxidation of micropollutants in wastewater by photoassisted generation of sulfate radicals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953896,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"In this research, the degradation of seven different micropollutants (MPs) and the formation of their transformation products (TPs) have been assessed during the application of different advanced oxidation processes: photolytic and photocatalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS). The results were compared with those obtained from the photolytic experiments using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant. A significant abatement of almost all MPs was achieved, even with very low UV-C contact time (9 and 28 s). The degradation of atenolol (ATN) and caffeine (CFN) ranged from 84 to 100% with a dose of 0.5 mM of any oxidant. The efficiencies for bisphenol-A (BPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DCF), ibuprofen (IBP), and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) varied depending on the oxidation system and operating conditions (oxidant dose and UV-C contact time), leading to the photolysis of PMS to higher efficiencies than PS and H2O2. In all cases, the abatement of MPs ranged from 63 to 83%, even with the lowest PMS dosage. Moreover, the addition of Fe(II) as a catalyst enhanced the removal efficiency, reaching almost total removal, especially over CBZ, DCF, and IBP. The Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal ranged between 44 and 62%, suggesting the transformation of MPs in intermediate compounds. The identification of transformation products was carried out for each micropollutant and each oxidation treatment, being observed some transformation products specific of oxidation by sulfate radicals. For example, m/z 165.0432 only appeared after PMS/Fe(II)/UV-C on the degradation of BFA, m/z 251.082 appeared after photolytic activation of PMS and PS on CBZ removal, and m/z 128.0452 was observed after any sulfate radical oxidation treatment, but not after photolysis of H2O2.",Assessment of PM2.5 and PAH content in PM2.5 emitted from mobile source gasoline-fueled vehicles in concomitant with the vehicle model and mileages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953895,Chemosphere,2019 05 07,"This study investigates the PM2.5 emission and analyses the PAHs content in PM2.5 emitted from gasoline-fueled vehicles.

In this study, fifteen vehicles were randomly taken for sampling, where sixteen priority PAHs concentration were investigated. The study was performed on the vehicles with different Euro standard emission by taking into consideration the European legislative levels for vehicles on the toxic gaseous emission. Among all the PAHs outflow components of PM2.5 radiated in the exhaust of gasoline engines, the average concentration of total PAHs discharged was 0.377ng/L-fuel, while the total BaPeq concentration was 0.00993ng/L-fuel."

However, common optical tweezers suffer from the lack of long-range forces. Consequently, their application areas are predominantly limited to target manipulation instead of biological diagnostics. To solve this problem, we herein report an all-in-one approach by combining optical forces and convective drag forces generated through localized optothermal effect for long-range target manipulation. The device consists of a 2D array of gold coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-wells, which are immersed by colloidal particles or cell solution. Upon excitation of a 785-nm laser, the hydrodynamic convective force and optical forces will drag the targets of interest into their designated micro-wells. Moreover, the plasmonic thermal dissipation provides a constant temperature environment for following cell analysis procedures of cell isolation, lysis and isothermal nucleic acid amplification for the detection of genetic markers. With the merits of fabrication simplicity, short sample-to-answer cycle time and the compatibility with optical microscopes, the reported technique offers an attractive and highly versatile approach for on-site single cell analysis systems.","Anti-tubulin agents of natural origin: Targeting taxol, vinca, and colchicine binding domains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953881,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 28,"Microtubules are a protein which is made of α- and β-heterodimer.

Various natural occurring molecules are well known for their anti-tubulin effect such as vinca, paclitaxel, combretastatin, colchicine etc. These microtubule-targeted drugs are acted through two processes (i) inhibiting depolymerization of tubulin (tubulin stabilizing agents) and (ii) inhibiting polymerization of tubulin (tubulin destabilizing agents). Now days, various binding domains have been explore through which these molecules are binding to tubulin but the three major binding domain of tubulin are taxol, vinca and colchicine binding domain. The present article mainly focus on the classification of various naturally occurring compounds on the basis of their inhibition processes (depolymerization and polymerization) and the site of interaction (targets taxol, vinca and colchicine binding domain) which has been hitherto reported. By placing all the naturally occurring taxol, vinca and colchicine binding site analogues at one place makes a better understanding of the tubulin interactions with known natural tubulin binders that would helps in the discovery of new and potent natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic analogues for treating cancer.",Changes in microbial composition on the crust by different air flow velocities and their effect on sensory properties of dry-aged beef.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953880,Meat science,2019 04 12,"Beef rumps (middle gluteal) were dry aged for 28 days using different air flow velocities of 0, 2.5, and 5 m/s (DA0, DA2.5, and DA5, respectively).

One hundred twenty one adolescents (33 BD-1, 30 EOSSD, 58 healthy controls) were evaluated for the presence of 79 prodromal symptoms, divided into 7 prodromal symptom clusters. Great than 2 subsyndromal manic symptoms and ADHD comorbidity were significantly more specific for BD than schizophrenia; brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms (BLIPS) were more likely to be part of EOSSD. In contrast, attenuated psychotic symptoms, and negative symptoms were not specifically related to the diagnosis of EOSSD. In conclusion, subsyndromal manic symptoms, BLIPS, and ADHD might be useful for predicting the trajectory of an emerging affective disorder versus schizophrenia and thus valuable for early detection, and intervention strategies.","Anxiety symptoms across twenty-years in schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953876,Psychiatry research,2019 05 07,"Anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are common in both mood and psychotic disorders.

The patients were recruited at an index phase of hospitalization, and then reassessed longitudinally at six subsequent follow-ups over 20-years. The sample was well characterized with symptom, recovery and functioning data being available. This study found that in the earlier years of illness, self-reported anxiety was greater in schizoaffective and major depression patients than bipolar patients. The three groups were similar for anxiety symptoms during the 20-year course of their illness. Last, we found in all patients, self-reported anxiety in the early years predicted having a period of recovery and lower global functioning in the future.

Biased attention and interpersonal rejection are important for the development of SAD and MDD, but little research has examined how these processes may lead to MDD. We hypothesized that interpersonal rejection would result in SAD symptoms being associated with more ""depression-like"" attention biases. Participants (n = 164) completed a measure of SAD symptoms and an eye tracking task before and after a task in which they were randomized to be socially included or rejected. SAD symptoms, inclusion or rejection condition, and the interaction term were entered into separate hierarchical linear regressions predicting change in attention for five emotional faces. Rejection condition significantly moderated the effects of SAD on change in attention to sad, happy, and neutral faces. SAD predicted increased attention to sad faces and decreased attention to happy faces in the rejection condition, but not in the inclusion condition. SAD predicted increased attention to neutral faces in the inclusion condition, but not in the rejection condition. There were no significant effects for angry or disgust. Results suggest that SAD symptoms are associated with more depression-like attention biases in the context of interpersonal rejection.",Mental health in spouses of U.S. Gulf War veterans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953873,Psychiatry research,2019 05 07,"Veterans' spouses are at risk for mental distress and substance use. We examined long term psychological functioning in spouses from a national cohort of 1991 Gulf War era veterans. From clinical interviews, spouses of deployed veterans (n = 488) did not have a greater prevalence of post-war mental disorders compared to spouses of non-deployed veterans (n = 536); however, in couples that were living together since the war, there was an increased risk of anxiety disorders or any one disorder. On questionnaires, the impact varied but was most consistently observed in more severe depression and greater functional impairment in spouses of deployed compared to non-deployed veterans. If a veteran developed post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, the matched spouse was more likely to develop post-war anxious/depressive disorders or any one mental disorder, respectively. Veteran combat exposure did not similarly increase the risk of spouse post-war mental disorders. Greater spouse self-reported symptomatology was observed in spouses of veterans with anxious/depressive disorders even when controlling for deployment. In summary, the war conferred greater risk for spouse mental disorders and distress for spouses of veterans with mental health disorders, with some increased risk for spouses of deployed veterans, especially in couples together since the war."

Impaired sentence repetition is a core feature of logopenic variant PPA, although the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this impairment and its significance as a diagnostic criterion remain poorly understood. Sentence repetition abilities of 12 people with dementia, using an adapted error classification schema, were analyzed, along with digit span abilities, a measure frequently used to assess working memory capacity, to explore error patterns and correlations. Participants with semantic variant PPA showed the greatest performance on sentence repetition and digit span in comparison to the logopenic variant PPA and Alzheimer's disease participants. Sentence repetition errors were characterized by middle omissions for semantic variant PPA, ending omissions and phonological errors for logopenic variant PPA, and ending omissions and unrelated word substitutions for Alzheimer's disease. Significant correlations were found between sentence repetition and digit span abilities.

In this study, a friendly and inexpensive biosorbent to simultaneously remove Cd(II) and As(V) from aqueous solution was synthesized by ultrasonic biochar and nanoscale TiO2 (TD), and the obtained sorbent was named as BCTD. The maximum sorption capacities of Cd (72.62 mg/g) and As (118.06 mg/g) were much higher than that of other carbon-materials. Both experiments showed that the Cd(II) and As(V) adsorption capacity was above 70% at pH = 5. The Cd(II) and As(V) adsorption on BCTD had a competitive effect in binary metal solutions at above 100 mg/L. The BET, SEM-EDS, FTIR and XPS analyses proved that ultrasonically reacting enhanced the surface area and pore volume of biochar and TD was supported on the biochar surface and inner pores successfully, and the dominant sorption mechanism by BCTD was the ion exchange and complexation.",One-step pyrolysis of lignin and polyvinyl chloride for synthesis of porous carbon and its application for toluene sorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953860,Bioresource technology,2019 04 22,"The aim of this work aims to synthesize the high performance porous carbons from lignin and rice husk (RH) via one-step pyrolysis with KOH and PVC. And those porous carbons were evaluated for toluene sorption. The unactivated biochars had ultralow specific surface area (SBET). By co-pyrolysis of biomass with KOH, the SBET of bio-carbon was significantly improved. The addition of PVC can further enhance the SBET. Additionally, the SBET of lignin-carbons was higher than that of RH-carbons. It was attributed to the destruction of pore structures in the RH chars with high salts by the washing process. Compared with the RH carbons, the lignin carbons had a higher micro-porosity. As for toluene sorption, the maximum breakthrough time (2195 min) and sorption capacity (263.4 mg g-1) were achieved using LPKC. The textural properties (e.g., pore volume, micro-porosity, and hierarchically porous structure) can take significant effects on the sorption process.","Age-sex specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water: A national and subnational study in Iran, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953859,Water research,2019 05 04,"National and subnational burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water apportioned by sex, age group, province, and community type in Iran, 2017 were quantified based on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The attributable burden of disease was estimated using four input data: (1) effect size of elevated drinking water fluoride levels for dental and skeletal fluorosis, (2) population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels, (3) the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis, and (4) age-sex distribution of population. The attributable burden of disease was only related to dental fluorosis, because the fluoride levels were lower than the threshold value for skeletal fluorosis (4.0 mg/L) in all of the cases. The national attributable prevalence (per 100,000 people), DALYs, and DALY rate in 2017 were calculated to be 60 (95% uncertainty interval 48-69), 3443 (1034-6940), and 4.31 (1.29-8.68), respectively. The national attributable burden of disease was not significantly different by sex, but was affected by age and community type in a manner that the highest DALY rate was related to the age group 10-14 y (6.06 [1.82-12.21]) and over 66% of the national attributable DALYs occurred in rural communities. The attributable burden of disease occurred only in 10 out of 31 provinces and about 94% of the attributable DALYs were concentrated in four provinces Fars (1967 [592-3964]), Bushehr (414 [124-836]), West Azarbaijan (400 [120-808]), and Hormozgan (377 [113-761]). Implementation of fluoride-safe drinking water supply schemes in the four leading provinces can prevent most of the national health losses and partly compensate the increasing trend of disease burden from oral conditions at the national level.",Multiple-pathway arsenic oxidation and removal from wastewater by a novel manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953858,Water research,2019 05 04,"Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a powerful biotechnology to remove various heavy metal(loid)s from wastewater, but not including arsenic (As). In this study, a novel manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge (Mn-AGS) was developed to remove As from organic wastewater. Eight sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of As removal by Mn-AGS. The immobilized As in the granular sludge was characterized by sequencing extraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Raman spectroscopy. Oxidation pathways for As and their contributions in Mn-AGS were evaluated by seven batch experiments under different conditions. The results indicated that As removal efficiency was much higher by Mn-AGS than by AGS. In Mn-AGS, As(III) was efficiently oxidized into As(V) (74.6%-82.6%) and then mostly bound on amorphous ferrihydrite and biogenic Mn oxides (bio-MnOx) (56.2%-65.0%), while metal arsenates, such as ferric arsenate, were not detected. Importantly, As removal was greatly improved by a small addition of Fe(II) in Mn-AGS. This might be primarily caused by Fenton reactions, because this improvement was removed when H2O2, self-generated in Mn-AGS, was scavenged by exogenous catalase (CAT). This study provided a novel extension of the traditional AGS technology to treat As in organic wastewater with an acceptable degree of efficiency.",Effects of food waste addition on biofilm formation and sulfide production in a gravity sewer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953857,Water research,2019 05 04,"The conversion of food waste (FW) into the sewage system is regarded as a promising method of relieving the burden of solid waste management. However, knowledge about its effects on sewer processes is limited, particularly in terms of biofilm formation and sulfide production. In this study, a gravity sewer system was set up to investigate the effects of the addition of FW on biofilm formation, the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) population, and the sulfide production potential. The sewer biofilm characteristics changed with long-term FW addition, and a greater thickness (by 32%), an increased dry density (by 13%), and more extracellular polymeric substance (by 141%) were observed. The thicker and denser biofilm limited oxygen diffusion, enlarged the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm, promoted an increase in the SRB population, and enhanced the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer. Substantial differences in the H2S profiles in the biofilm samples with and without the addition of FW were observed via microelectrode analysis. A model-based investigation of sewer biofilm formation with and without the addition of FW was conducted with a dynamic sewer biofilm model to gain further insights into sewer biofilm processes. The results suggest that the addition of FW can promote sulfide production and SRB growth in a sewer biofilm, which can be significantly affected by the ratio of FW to sewage. It is worth further investigations of the impacts of FW addition on the potential sulfide production in pressure sewers.","Impact of copper sulphate, potassium permanganate, and hydrogen peroxide on Pseudanabaena galeata cell integrity, release and degradation of 2-methylisoborneol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953856,Water research,2019 05 04,"Frequent off-flavor events caused by geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol have caused concern among consumers about the quality of potable water. Pseudanabaena galeata, a filamentous cyanobacterium, is a known producer of 2-methylisoborneol in lakes and reservoirs. The use of algicides to control cyanobacteria must consider the potential release of contaminants into the water. This is the first study to systematically investigate the effectiveness of copper sulphate (CuSO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the cell viability and integrity of Pseudanabaena galeata. Following algicide or oxidant treatment, the release and degradation of 2-methylisoborneol was also examined. It is evident that all of these chemicals can decrease Pseudanabaena galeata viability and damage cell membranes and the filamentous Pseudanabaena galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial Microcystis aeruginosa. Of the three compounds used, KMnO4 showed the stronger ability to compromise cell integrity and 5.0 mg/L KMnO4 could induce 91 ± 1.5% lysis of Pseudanabaena galeata within 2 h. It was found that H2O2 had the potential to degrade 2-methylisoborneol with 16.0 ± 0.4% degraded by 20.0 mg/L H2O2 within 8 h. In contrast, 2-methylisoborneol could not be degraded by CuSO4 (dosage: ≤ 1.5 mg/L; reaction time: ≤ 8 h) and KMnO4 (dosage: ≤ 5.0 mg/L; reaction time: ≤ 3 h) basically. Results showed that the oxidation capacity of H2O2 against Pseudanabaena galeata was enhanced under sunlight. The results will help drinking water utilities to better understand the risk of Pseudanabaena galeata lysis and 2-methylisoborneol release during raw water treatment.",Chemical characterization methods for the analysis of structural extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953855,Water research,2019 05 04,"Biofilm structure and functionality depend on extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), but analytical methods for EPS often lack specificity which limits progress of biofilm research. EPS were extracted from aerobic granular sludge and analyzed with frequently applied colorimetric methods. The colorimetric methods were evaluated based on their applicability for EPS analysis. EPS fractions of interest were proteins, sugars, uronic acids and phenolic compounds. The applied methods (Lowry method, bicinchoninic acid assay, phenol sulfuric acid method, carbazole sulfuric acid method) were investigated in terms of their sensitivity towards the selected standard compound. Interference of compounds present in EPS with the colorimetric methods was further evaluated. All methods showed to be highly depending on the choice of standard compound and susceptible towards interference by compounds present in EPS. This study shows that currently used colorimetric methods are not capable of accurately characterizing EPS. More advanced methods are needed to be able to draw conclusions about biofilm composition, structure and functionality.","Indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate in water using zero-valent titanium anode: Factors, kinetics, and mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953854,Water research,2019 05 04,"In this study, indirect electrochemical reduction with zero-valent titanium (ZVT) as anode successfully achieved the selective nitrate removal from simulated groundwater. The maximum nitrate removal efficiency and N2 selectivity reached to 83.4% and 78.5% after 12 h, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the gaseous by-products (NO and N2O) were negligible and the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Decreasing the pH value of electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization efficiency and nitrate removal. The chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate. During the electrochemical reaction, the ZVT lost electrons to generate the reducing agents (Ti3+ and Ti2+), which could afford electrons for nitrate reduction and form the solid by-products TiO2.4Cl0.2N0.1. A 2-stage strategy, indirect electrochemical reduction + hypochlorite treatment (pre-reduction + post-oxidation), was developed to completely remove nitrate and the long-term performance of nitrate reduction was comprehensively evaluated. The effluent nitrate steadily kept at 8.8 mg N/L during 120 h continuous operation when the influent nitrate concentration was 25.9 mg N/L. Simultaneously, nitrite concentration was lower than 0.01 mg N/L, and ammonium and Ti ions were not detected in the effluent.",A quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) approach to predict biodegradation rates of aromatic chemicals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953853,Water research,2019 05 04,"The objective of this work was to develop a QSBR model for the prioritization of organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors. To do this, we first categorized the chemicals into three groups (Group 1: simple aromatic chemicals with a single ring, Group 2: aromatic chemicals with multiple rings and Group3: Group 1 plus Group 2) based on molecular descriptors, estimated the first order biodegradation rate of the chemicals using rating values derived from the BIOWIN3 model, and finally developed, validated and defined the applicability domain of models for each group using a multiple linear regression approach. All the developed QSBR models complied with OECD principles for QSAR validation. The biodegradation rate in the models for the two groups (Group 2 and 3 chemicals) are associated with abstract molecular descriptors that provide little relevant practical information towards understanding the relationship between chemical structure and biodegradation rates. However, molecular descriptors associated with the QSBR model for Group 1 chemicals (R2 = 0.89, Q2loo = 0.87) provided information on properties that can readily be scrutinised and interpreted in relation to biodegradation processes. In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that QSBRs can be an alternative tool to estimate the persistence of chemicals, some of which can provide further insights into those factors affecting biodegradation."

Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses were performed. Sequence analysis identified 74 sequence types among C. neoformans var. neoformans (VNIV), 65 among C. neoformans var. grubii (56 VNI, 8 VNII, 1 VNB), and 5 among the C. gattii species complex (4 VGI and 1 VGIV) isolates. ST23 was the most frequent genotype (22%) among VNI isolates which were mostly grouped in a large clonal cluster including 50% of isolates. Among VNIV isolates, a predominant genotype was not identified. A high percentage of autochthonous STs were identified in both VNI (71%) and VNIV (96%) group of isolates. The 16 European C. gattii species complex isolates analyzed in the present study originated all from the environment and all belonged to a large cluster endemic in the Mediterranean area. Population genetic analysis confirmed that VNI group of isolates were characterized by low variability and clonal expansion while VNIV by a higher variability and a number of recombination events. However, when VNI and VNIV environmental isolates were compared, they showed a similar population structure with a high percentage of shared mutations and the absence of fixed mutations. Also linkage disequilibrium analysis reveals differences between clinical and environmental isolates showing a key role of PLB1 allele combinations in host infection as well as the key role of LAC1 allele combinations for survival of the fungus in the environment.

However, currently, there is no consensus on the underlying functional features of the triple networks associated with mindfulness. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that (a) the partial regression coefficient (i.e., slope): from the SN to the DMN, mediated by the CEN, would be one of the potential mindfulness features in the real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) setting, and (b) this slope level may be enhanced by rtfMRI-NF training. Sixty healthy mindfulness-naïve males participated in an MRI session consisting of two non-rtfMRI-runs, followed by two rtfMRI-NF runs and one transfer run. Once the regions-of-interest of each of the triple networks were defined using the non-rtfMRI-runs, the slope level was calculated by mediation analysis and used as neurofeedback information, in the form of a thermometer bar, to assist with participant mindfulness during the rtfMRI-NF runs. The participants were asked to increase the level of the thermometer bar while deploying a mindfulness strategy, which consisted of focusing attention on the physical sensations of breathing. rtfMRI-NF training was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial design, in which participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The participants in the experimental group received contingent neurofeedback information, which was obtained from their own brain signals, whereas the participants in the control group received non-contingent neurofeedback information that originated from matched participants in the experimental group. Our results indicated that the slope level from the SN to the DMN, mediated by the CEN, was associated with mindfulness score (rtfMRI-NF runs: r = 0.53, p = 0.007; p-value was corrected from 10,000 random permutations) and with task-performance feedback score (rtfMRI-NF run: r = 0.61, p = 0.001) in the experimental group only. In addition, during the rtfMRI-NF runs the level of the partial regression coefficient feature was substantially increased in the experimental group compared to the control group (p < 0.05 from the paired t-test; the p-value was corrected from 10,000 random permutations). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a partial regression coefficient feature of mindfulness in the rtfMRI-NF setting obtained by triple network mediation analysis, as well as the possibility of enhancement of the partial regression coefficient feature by rtfMRI-NF training.","Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional connectivity by targets (REACT): A novel, multimodal analytical approach informed by PET to study the pharmacodynamic response of the brain under MDMA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953835,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"One of the main limitations of pharmacological fMRI is its inability to provide a molecular insight into the main effect of compounds, leaving an open question about the relationship between drug effects and haemodynamic response. The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on functional connectivity (FC) using a novel multimodal method (Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets - REACT). This approach enriches the resting state (rs-)fMRI analysis with the molecular information about the distribution density of serotonin receptors in the brain, given the serotonergic action of MDMA. Twenty healthy subjects participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A high-resolution in vivo atlas of four serotonin receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4) and its transporter (5-HTT) was used as a template in a two-step multivariate regression analysis to estimate the spatial maps reflecting the whole-brain connectivity behaviour related to each target under placebo and MDMA. Results showed that the networks exhibiting significant changes after MDMA administration are the ones informed by the 5-HTT and 5-HT1A distribution density maps, which are the main targets of this compound. Changes in the 5-HT1A-enriched functional maps were also associated with the pharmacokinetic levels of MDMA and MDMA-induced FC changes in the 5-HT2A-enriched maps correlated with the spiritual experience subscale of the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. By enriching the rs-fMRI analysis with molecular data of voxel-wise distribution of the serotonin receptors across the brain, we showed that MDMA effects on FC can be understood through the distribution of its main targets. This result supports the ability of this method to characterise the specificity of the functional response of the brain to MDMA binding to serotonergic receptors, paving the way to the definition of a new fingerprint in the characterization of new compounds and potentially to a further understanding to the response to treatment.",Distinct patterns of default mode and executive control network circuitry contribute to present and future executive function in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953834,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Executive function (EF) performance in older adults has been linked with functional and structural profiles within the executive control network (ECN) and default mode network (DMN), white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden and levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Here, we simultaneously explored the unique contributions of these factors to baseline and longitudinal EF performance in older adults. Thirty-two cognitively normal (CN) older adults underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline and annually for three years. Neuroimaging and AD pathology measures were collected at baseline. Separate linear regression models were used to determine which of these variables predicted composite EF scores at baseline and/or average annual change in composite ΔEF scores over the three-year follow-up period. Results demonstrated that low DMN deactivation, high ECN activation and WMH burden were the main predictors of EF scores at baseline. In contrast, poor DMN and ECN WM microstructure and higher AD pathology predicted greater annual decline in EF scores. Subsequent mediation analysis demonstrated that DMN WM microstructure uniquely mediated the relationship between AD pathology and ΔEF. These results suggest that functional activation patterns within the DMN and ECN and WMHs contribute to baseline EF while structural connectivity within these networks impact longitudinal EF performance in older adults.",Multi-branch convolutional neural network for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953833,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"In this paper, we present an automated approach for segmenting multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from multi-modal brain magnetic resonance images. Our method is based on a deep end-to-end 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for slice-based segmentation of 3D volumetric data. The proposed CNN includes a multi-branch downsampling path, which enables the network to encode information from multiple modalities separately. Multi-scale feature fusion blocks are proposed to combine feature maps from different modalities at different stages of the network. Then, multi-scale feature upsampling blocks are introduced to upsize combined feature maps to leverage information from lesion shape and location. We trained and tested the proposed model using orthogonal plane orientations of each 3D modality to exploit the contextual information in all directions. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on two different datasets: a private dataset including 37 MS patients and a publicly available dataset known as the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset, consisting of 14 MS patients.

In this study, we aimed to identify genetic and neurostructural abnormalities at birth in a non-human primate model of ASD, the common marmoset with maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), which has been reported to display social recognition deficit in adulthood. Using a comprehensive gene expression analysis, we found that 20 genes were significantly downregulated in VPA-exposed neonates. Of these, Frizzled3 (FZD3) and PIK3CA were identified in an axon guidance signaling pathway. FZD3 is essential for the normal development of the anterior commissure (AC) and corpus callosum (CC); hence, we performed diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging with a 7-Tesla scanner to measure the midsagittal sizes of these structures. We found that the AC size in VPA-exposed neonates was significantly smaller than that in age-matched controls, while the CC size did not differ. These results suggest that downregulation of the genes related to axon guidance and decreased AC size in neonatal primates may be linked to social brain dysfunctions that can happen later in life.",Comparison of in vitro synergistic effect between clarithromycin and azithromycin in combination with amikacin against Mycobacterium intracellulare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953831,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 04 06,The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro synergistic effect between clarithromycin and azithromycin in combination with amikacin against Mycobacterium intracellulare.

A large volume of work has already been devoted to ARGs in aquatic ecosystems. However, ARG dispersal patterns in air remain to be largely unknown despite of its greater role in transmission. This work aims to investigate time-resolved airborne spread of ARGs and their corresponding subtype bacterial carriers in highly polluted air. Time-resolved air samples (20 m3 each with three samples) were collected using a high volume sampler (1 m3/min) every 4 h continuously (both day and night) during low (14-93 μg/m3) and high PM2.5 (36-205 μg/m3) pollution times (over 6 days with a total of 69 air samples) in Beijing. All air samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequence analysis for 39 ARG subtypes. Pure culturable bacterial isolates from Beijing and Shijiazhuang were Sanger sequenced for species identification and also subjected to high throughput ARG subtype detection. ARG and its subtype relative abundances in the air were observed to differ greatly (up to 3 folds for abundance) both day and night, and the blaTEM gene was found to lead the ARG abundance. For an early morning time, the multi-drug resistant NDM-1 gene was detected up to 30% of total ARG abundance in highly polluted air. Identified as a major NDM-1 and vanB gene carrier, Bacillus halotolerans were also shown to disseminate more ARG subtypes. On another front, tnpA and intI1 were shown to vary greatly in abundance, while the sul3 gene was found widespread among the culturable Bacillus isolates in the air. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed different gene co-occurrence networks for different PM2.5 pollution episodes, e.g., tnpA and intI1 for gene transfer and integration, respectively, were found more abundant for the high PM2.5 pollution episode. This study highlights a serious yet previously unidentified public health threat from time-resolved airborne spread of ARGs. Further work is urgently warranted to track the sources of ARGs for their optimized control during high PM2.5 pollution episodes.",Bisphenol-A exposure induced neurotoxicity in glutamatergic neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953815,Environment international,2019 05 13,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a lipophilic, organic, synthetic compound that has been used as an additive in polycarbonate plastics manufacturing since 1957. Studies have shown that BPA interferes with the development and functions of the brain, but little is known about the effects of BPA on human glutamatergic neurons (hGNs) at the molecular and cellular levels. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure to BPA to hGNs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The results showed that chronic exposure of different concentrations of BPA (0, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 μM) to hGNs for 14 days reduced neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner. Using presynaptic protein synaptophysin and postsynaptic protein PSD-95 antibodies, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting results indicated that BPA exposure altered the morphology of dendritic spines and increased synaptophysin and PSD-95 expression. Furthermore, BPA exposure at concentrations higher than 1.0 μM resulted in the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) expression and deterioration of dendritic spines. In addition, our results suggested that these BPA mediated neurotoxicity effects were due to an increased production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via increased nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), 3-nitrotyrosine expression and Ca2+ influx. These results imply that hESC-based neuronal differentiation is an excellent cellular model to examine BPA-induced neurotoxicity on human neurons at the cellular and molecular level.",Does air pollution really impact the onset of spontaneous pneumothorax?

Thus, biomimetic-based repair strategies must restore the mechanical integrity of the AF to help support and restore native spinal loading and motion. Accordingly, an annulus fibrosus repair patch (AFRP); a collagen-based multi-laminate scaffold with an angle-ply architecture has been previously developed, which demonstrates similar mechanical properties to native outer AF (oAF). To further enhance the mimetic nature of the AFRP, interlamellar (ILM) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) was incorporated into the scaffolds. The ability of the scaffolds to withstand simulated impact loading and resist herniation of native IVD tissue while contributing to the restoration of spinal kinematics were assessed separately. The results demonstrate that incorporation of a GAG-based ILM significantly increased (p < 0.001) the impact strength of the AFRP (2.57 ± 0.04 MPa) compared to scaffolds without (1.51 ± 0.13 MPa). Additionally, repair of injured functional spinal units (FSUs) with an AFRP in combination with sequestering native NP tissue and a full-thickness AF tissue plug enabled the restoration of creep displacement (p = 0.134), short-term viscous damping coefficient (p = 0.538), the long-term viscous (p = 0.058) and elastic (p = 0.751) damping coefficients, axial neutral zone (p = 0.908), and axial range of motion (p = 0.476) to an intact state. Lastly, the AFRP scaffolds were able to prevent native IVD tissue herniation upon application of supraphysiologic loads (5.28 ± 1.24 MPa). Together, these results suggest that the AFRP has the strength to sequester native NP and AF tissue and/or implants, and thus, can be used in a composite repair strategy for IVDs with focal annular defects thereby assisting in the restoration of spinal kinematics.",Understanding static and dynamic bending size-dependencies in the design of a nanofibrous scaffold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953807,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 05 10,"From a series of experimental measurements and supplemented by results from a computational model, we investigated the static and dynamic size dependent behaviors of a single-strand polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber. For the static bending, the fiber stiffness showed a dramatic increase as the fiber diameter is reduced and for the dynamic bending, the resonant frequency exhibited a very similar trend. Employing the strain gradient (SG) theory, we formulated a model that not only accurately captures the magnitude of the experimentally observed size dependent response but it is also, able to correctly predict the onset of the inverse square behavior. Both our experimental data and SG model results showed that the damping term is unaffected by the size-dependency. We introduced an experimentally calibrated fiber length scale parameter to predict the onset and rise of the size dependent response and an effective elastic modulus to characterize the stiffness increase. This understanding of the pronounced enhancement in nanofibers can be used to design a nanofibrous scaffold to keep its structural integrity intact against a sudden static pull of a seeded cell or when subjected to a dynamic loading environment from say, the pulsating peripheral blood."

At 5 years' follow-up, the patient's sensory recovery was assessed through static and moving two-point discrimination, light touch sensation, pain perception, hot and cold temperature perception, an electrophysiological study and sweat test. An S3+ sensory recovery on the British Medical Research Council scale, as modified by Mackinnon and Dellon, was noted together with a good perception in the palm compared to decreased perception in the volar surface of the proximal phalanx. These findings prove that the RFF can provide good functional coverage of the palm together with good sensitivity by end-to-side reinnervation.",Circulating Inflammation Proteins Associated With Lung Cancer in African Americans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953795,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,2019 05 07,Lung cancer incidence is higher among African Americans (AAs) compared with European Americans (EAs) in the United States.

Pathogenic variants in the C-terminus of NFKB2 have been identified in the subset of CVID patients whose immunodeficiency is associated with ectodermal dysplasia and central adrenal insufficiency. We describe 2 unrelated CVID pedigrees with 4 cases of pathogenic stop gain variants (c.1903C > T) in the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of NF-κB2, leading to a premature truncation of the protein at p.Arg635Term (R635X). By immunophenotyping and functional ex vivo B- and T-cell experiments we characterized the variant by reduced class-switched memory B-cell counts and immature plasmablasts, unable to produce IgG and IgA. Features of a poor proliferative T-cell response and reduced expansion of CD4+CXCR5+ T cells was only observed in the two clinically affected index cases without any clear clinical correlate. In conclusion, pathogenic stop variants in the ARD of NFKB2 can cause 'infection-only' CVID with an abnormal B-cell phenotype and a variable clinical penetrance.",Characteristics of regulatory T-cell populations before and after Ty21a typhoid vaccination in children and adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953793,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2019 06 16,"Typhoid fever, caused by the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S.

Forty-two healthy males (16 in the IMT smokers group [IMTS], 16 in the IMT nonsmokers group [IMTN], and 10 in the placebo group) participated in the present study. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, IMTS and IMTN underwent 4 weeks of 30 breaths twice daily at 50% (+5% increase each week) of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), while the placebo group maintained 30 breaths twice daily at 15% MIP using an IMT device. The data were analyzed with repeated measures for one-way analysis of variance, 3 × 2 mixed factor analysis of variance, and least significant difference tests. Respiratory muscle strength (MIP and maximal expiratory pressure [MEP]) and pulmonary functions significantly improved after a 4-week period (between the pre and posttests) in the IMTN and IMTS groups (p < 0.05). The mean difference and percentage differences showed significant alterations in the respiratory muscle strength, forced and slow pulmonary capacities, and pulmonary volume between the IMTN and IMTS groups (p < 0.05). There were significant changes in the expiratory muscle strength (MEP), slow vital capacity (SVC), and forced pulmonary measurements (forced expiratory volume after 1 s and maximal voluntary ventilation) between IMTN and IMTS groups in favor of smokers (p < 0.05). These results show that greater improvements occurred in smokers after IMT. Increased respiratory muscle strength may be the underlying mechanism responsible for this improvement. Additionally, the benefits of IMT were greater in smokers than nonsmokers. This difference between smokers and nonsmokers may potentially be explained by higher influence of exercise on smokers' lung microbiome, resulting in greater reversal of negative effects.",Particle motion and sound pressure in fish tanks: A behavioural exploration of acoustic sensitivity in the zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953790,Behavioural processes,2019 06 10,"Underwater sound fields can be complex, both in open water and small tank environments.

We also tested 2) whether the acoustic response tendency of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) was correlated to the sound field conditions at their position at the moment of sound on-set. We found no correlation between the intensity, quality, or directionality of the behavioural response and the sound pressure or the directivity and ellipticity of particle motion. There was a negative correlation, however, between the tendency to freeze and the particle velocity level.

The architecture of the root system to a large extent depends on the repeated formation of new lateral roots. In this review, we discuss lateral root development from a systems biology perspective. We focus on studies combining experiments with computational modeling that have advanced our understanding of how the auxin-centered regulatory modules involved in different stages of lateral root development exert their specific functions. Moreover, we discuss how these regulatory networks may enable robust transitions from one developmental stage to the next, a subject that thus far has received limited attention. In addition, we analyze how environmental factors impinge on these modules, and the different manners in which these environmental signals are being integrated to enable coordinated developmental decision making. Finally, we provide some suggestions for extending current models of lateral root development to incorporate multiple processes and stages. Only through more comprehensive models we can fully elucidate the cooperative effects of multiple processes on later root formation, and how one stage drives the transition to the next.",Regulation of Resource Partitioning Coordinates Nitrogen and Rhizobia Responses and Autoregulation of Nodulation in Medicago truncatula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953787,Molecular plant,2019 06 14,"Understanding how plants respond to nitrogen in their environment is crucial for determining how they use it and how the nitrogen use affects other processes related to plant growth and development. Under nitrogen limitation the activity and affinity of uptake systems is increased in roots, and lateral root formation is regulated in order to adapt to low nitrogen levels and scavenge from the soil. Plants in the legume family can form associations with rhizobial nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and this association is tightly regulated by nitrogen levels. The effect of nitrogen on nodulation has been extensively investigated, but the effects of nodulation on plant nitrogen responses remain largely unclear. In this study, we integrated molecular and phenotypic data in the legume Medicago truncatula and determined that genes controlling nitrogen influx are differently expressed depending on whether plants are mock or rhizobia inoculated. We found that a functional autoregulation of nodulation pathway is required for roots to perceive, take up, and mobilize nitrogen as well as for normal root development. Our results together revealed that autoregulation of nodulation, root development, and the location of nitrogen are processes balanced by the whole plant system as part of a resource-partitioning mechanism.",Early immunologic changes during the onset of atopic dermatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953783,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2019 05 12,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), which is commonly called eczema, is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease.

There is evidence that cancer and its treatment can accelerate aging. Tau is a microtubule associated protein that contributes to microtubule stability thereby playing a key role in neuronal function. Clustering of tau is commonly observed in the aged brain and is related to cognitive decline. We hypothesized that chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment is associated with accelerated development of tau clustering in the brain as a sign of accelerated aging. We show for the first time that treatment of adult (7-8 month-old) male C57BL/6 mice with cisplatin results in reduced cognitive function and a marked increase in the number of large endogenous tau clusters in the hippocampus when assessed 4 months later. In contrast, we detected only few small tau clusters in the hippocampus of age-matched 11-12 month-old control mice. Astrocyte GFAP expression was increased in close vicinity to the tau clusters in cisplatin-treated mice. We did not detect changes in the microglial marker Iba-1 in the brain of mice treated with cisplatin. The accelerated formation of Tau-1 clusters in cisplatin-treated mice was associated with a decrease in the levels of the post-synaptic marker PSD95 and of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in the hippocampus. We demonstrate here for the first time that chemotherapy markedly accelerates development of signs of tauopathy and loss of synaptic integrity in the hippocampus. These findings provide a mechanistic link between chemotherapy cognitive decline and accelerated aging in cancer survivors.",Toll-like receptor 9 antagonism modulates astrocyte function and preserves proximal axons following spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953770,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 13,"Increasing evidence indicates that innate immune receptors play important, yet controversial, roles in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injury. Despite many advances, the contributions of toll-like receptors (TLRs) to spinal cord injury (SCI) remain inadequately defined. We previously reported that a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) antagonist, oligodeoxynucleotide 2088 (ODN 2088), administered intrathecally, improves the functional and histopathological outcomes of SCI. However, the molecular and cellular changes that occur at the injury epicenter following ODN 2088 treatment are not completely understood. Following traumatic SCI, a glial scar, consisting primarily of proliferating reactive astrocytes, forms at the injury epicenter and assumes both beneficial and detrimental roles. Increased production of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) by reactive astrocytes inhibits the regeneration of injured axons. Astrocytes express TLR9, which can be activated by endogenous ligands released by damaged cells. It is not yet known how TLR9 antagonism modifies astrocyte function at the glial scar and how this affects axonal preservation or re-growth following SCI. The present studies were undertaken to address these issues. We report that in female mice sustaining a severe mid-thoracic (T8) contusion injury, the number of proliferating astrocytes in regions rostral and caudal to the lesion border increased significantly by 30- and 24-fold, respectively, compared to uninjured controls. Intrathecal ODN 2088 treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating astrocytes by 60% in both regions. This effect appeared to be, at least partly, mediated through the direct actions of ODN 2088 on astrocytes, since the antagonist decreased proliferation in pure SC astrocyte cultures by preventing the activation of the Erk/MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, CSPG immunoreactivity at the lesion border was more pronounced in vehicle-treated injured mice compared to uninjured controls and was significantly reduced following administration of ODN 2088 to injured mice. Moreover, ODN 2088 significantly decreased astrocyte migration in an in vitro scratch-wound assay. Anterograde tracing and quantification of corticospinal tract (CST) axons in injured mice, indicated that ODN 2088 preserves proximal axons. Taken together, these findings suggest that ODN 2088 modifies the glial scar and creates a milieu that fosters axonal protection at the injury site.",Relationships between neural activation during a reward task and peripheral cytokine levels in youth with diverse psychiatric symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953769,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 06 10,"Inflammation has been hypothesized to contribute to reward dysfunction across psychiatric conditions, but little is known about this relationship in youth. Therefore, the present study investigated the associations between general and specific markers of inflammation and neural activation during reward processing, including anticipation and attainment, in youth with diverse psychiatric symptoms.",Worsening cognitive performance is associated with increases in systemic inflammation following hematopoietic cell transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953767,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 29,"Cognitive decline is a frequently cited concern among patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and patients often experience neurocognitive deficits (i.e., stable or worsening neurocognitive performance) throughout the transplant course. Deficits can be most severe during the acute transplant period (i.e., 90 days after transplantation), when patients also typically experience elevated systemic levels of inflammation. Previous studies have identified inflammation as a likely mechanism underlying neurocognitive deficits, primarily in women with breast cancer; however, longitudinal studies have been limited. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the relationship between changes in systemic inflammation and changes in cognition from pre- to post-transplant in patients receiving allogeneic HCT.",Mouse T cells express a neurotransmitter-receptor signature that is quantitatively modulated in a subset- and activation-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953766,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 10,"Neurotransmitters are known to modulate the course of an immune response by targeting cells in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Increasing evidence suggests that T cells, by expressing specific neurotransmitter receptors (NR) are directly regulated by them, leading to altered activation and skewed differentiation of the adaptive immune response. Given that gene expression in T cells changes in lineage- and activation-dependent fashion, it is expected that sensitivity to neurotransmitters may also vary along these lines. Here we generate an important resource for further analysis of this tier of immunoregulation, by identifying the distinct profile of NR transcripts that are expressed by peripheral T cells in mice, at different states of activation and differentiation. We find that only about 15% of the total annotated NR genes are transcribed in these T cells and most of them do not change in different subsets of T cells (CD8, CD4 - Naïve vs Memory vs Treg), or even when T cells migrate to different tissues. We suggest that the T cell-expressed NRs, found across all these subsets identifies a core, constitutive NR signature for the T cell lineage. In contrast, a very limited number (<2) of NRs were observed to mark each of the post-activation T cell states, suggesting that very specific neurotransmitter signals are available to modulate T cell responses in vivo in these subsets.",Altered gut microbiota and endocannabinoid system tone in vitamin D deficiency-mediated chronic pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953765,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 20,"Recent evidence points to the gut microbiota as a regulator of brain and behavior, although it remains to be determined if gut bacteria play a role in chronic pain. The endocannabinoid system is implicated in inflammation and chronic pain processing at both the gut and central nervous system (CNS) levels. In the present study, we used low Vitamin D dietary intake in mice and evaluated possible changes in gut microbiota, pain processing and endocannabinoid system signaling. Vitamin D deficiency induced a lower microbial diversity characterized by an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes. Concurrently, vitamin D deficient mice showed tactile allodynia associated with neuronal hyperexcitability and alterations of endocannabinoid system members (endogenous mediators and their receptors) at the spinal cord level. Changes in endocannabinoid (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol) levels were also observed in the duodenum and colon. Remarkably, the anti-inflammatory anandamide congener, palmitoylethanolamide, counteracted both the pain behaviour and spinal biochemical changes in vitamin D deficient mice, whilst increasing the levels of Akkermansia, Eubacterium and Enterobacteriaceae, as compared with vehicle-treated mice. Finally, induction of spared nerve injury in normal or vitamin D deficient mice was not accompanied by changes in gut microbiota composition. Our data suggest the existence of a link between Vitamin D deficiency - with related changes in gut bacterial composition - and altered nociception, possibly via molecular mechanisms involving the endocannabinoid and related mediator signaling systems.",Novel contamination-free wet milling technique using ice beads for poorly water-soluble compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953764,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 01,"The aim of this study is to establish a contamination-free milling method using ice beads instead of conventional hard beads such as metal or ceramics. Ice beads, which melt after the milling process to form water, would solve the contamination issue attributed to bead breakage or abrasion. The technique/method for preparing spherical ice beads of mono-dispersed size ranging from 150 to 3000 μm was newly developed. An oscillation beads milling apparatus was used for pulverization. In the initial stages of ice beads milling, the process is dry, but as time passes, the surface of the ice beads begins to melt, resulting in a transition to wet beads milling. It was found that ice beads are an effective milling media for beads milling, and that milling efficiency is strongly affected by the temperature of the coolant, with the peak efficiency occurring when the temperature was set to -2 °C and ice beads around 1500 μm in diameter were used. The spray-dried powder obtained from suspension after ice beads milling had dissolution improvement equivalent to that obtained after zirconia beads milling, resulting from its spontaneous rapid dispersion into nanosuspension.",Dermal delivery of therapeutic DNAzymes via chitosan hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953763,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 01,"Biopharmaceutical development is progressing rapidly. It is imperative that novel drug delivery systems are designed to protect the integrity of the biopharmaceutical, and, at the same time, transport and distribute the drug efficaciously to the target site. Administration of highly specific and sensitive molecules, like therapeutic proteins or nucleic acid-based drugs, present distinct challenges. In this study, we investigate the topical drug delivery of 10-23 DNAzymes; short single-stranded oligonucleotides with RNA-cleaving properties. We developed different hydrogel formulations based on chitosan. These natural-based polymers are particularly suitable for biopharmaceuticals due to their high biocompatibility and biodegradability. We tested these hydrogels for penetration enhancement and for protective efficacy against DNAzymes degradation. Additionally, we examined the physicochemical characteristics and the storage stability of several hydrogel preparations. The formulations developed in this study demonstrate adequate antimicrobial activity, even without the addition of preservatives. A DNAse II degradation assay confirmed their ability to prevent enzymatic degradation of the oligonucleotide. The recovery of intact oligonucleotides in full thickness porcine skin samples indicated that hydrogel formulations composed of DNA/chitosan polyplexes provided satisfactory skin penetration.",Peptide generated anisotropic gold nanoparticles as efficient siRNA vectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953762,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 01,"Based on the cell penetrating ability of tryptophan-containing peptides, eight linear hexapeptides have been designed, synthesized and explored their efficiency toward the synthesis of gold nanoparticles under sunlight. The peptide generated gold nanoparticles (LP-GNPs) have been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques. The binding ability of LP-GNPs toward siRNA, evaluated by gel electrophoresis indicates that sequence-selective-GNPs without any surface modifications exhibit strong affinity toward negatively charged biomolecules. Cellular uptake studies suggest that LP-GNPs exhibit significant uptake of fluorescence-labeled siRNA inside the cells as evidenced from Fluorescence Microscopy. In vitro gene silencing efficiency using newly generated GNPs revealed that above mentioned LP-GNPs efficiently down-regulate the level of GAPGH gene in colon cancer cells. Comparative gene silencing efficiency results indicate that anisotropic LP7-GNPs exhibit comparable efficacy to other existing carrier systems, such as Lipofectamine 2000 in presence of serum, mimicking in-vivo system. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that peptide-GNPs based delivery system for siRNA emerges to be effective to deliver RNAi therapeutics, uncovering new avenue in oncotherapy.",Heritability and genetic variance of dementia with Lewy bodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953760,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 15,"Recent large-scale genetic studies have allowed for the first glimpse of the effects of common genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), identifying risk variants with appreciable effect sizes. However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants."

Reciprocal roles of estrogen receptor α and β in insulin resistance?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953748,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 05 15,"The adipokine lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is linked to insulin resistance. Its expression in human adipose tissue (AT) can be regulated in a sex-specific manner by a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, suggesting an underlying role of sex steroids. We show that 17-β-estradiol (E2) dose-dependently increased LCN2 gene expression in subcutaneous AT from postmenopausal women. This was also seen in the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) α antagonist alone but not with ERβ antagonist, suggesting that E2 effects on LCN2 are mediated via ERβ pathway. Dexamethasone alone or E2+dexamethasone had no significant effect on LCN2. However, E2+dexamethasone increased LCN2 expression with ERα-blockade. Dexamethasone reduced ERα but increased ERβ expression. Dexamethasone can regulate LCN2 expression via inhibition of ERα and stimulation of ERβ and may contribute to the development of glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance in human AT. In conclusion, ERβ and ERα pathways have opposite effects on LCN2 expression and they interact with glucocorticoid action.",Musa basjoo regulates the gut microbiota in mice by rebalancing the abundance of probiotic and pathogen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953747,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 02,"Musa basjoo is a kind of popular slimming fruit in southern China. However, even though the trophic component and physiological effect are well studied, its internal mechanism in reconstructing gut microbiota remains unclear. In this study, maturity of M. basjoo were divided into four levels. Results indicated that M. basjoo in level Ⅱ (with 35% maturity) represented the greatest increase in the growth in vitro of probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum FMNP01 and Lactobacillus casei FMNP02. After feeding M. basjoo with the middle dose (2.67 g/kg·BW) to mice for 21 days, gut microbiota from mice feces was isolated and sequenced. Results of 16SrDNA sequencing showed that the scattered genera of gut microbiota were significantly gathered. The amounts of different pathogens were decreased, while probiotics such as genera Bacteroides and Roseburia were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Results of function prediction indicated that the reconstruction of gut microbiota may due to the change in carbohydrate transportation, biosynthesis of cell wall, cell membrane, and cell envelope. This study has drawn a basic mechanism in reconstructing gut microbiota by feeding M. basjoo and lay out a foundation for further reach on the interaction between human as diner and M. basjoo as food.","The lung microbiome, vitamin D, and the tuberculous granuloma: A balance triangle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953746,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 02,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has the extraordinary ability to persist for decades within granulomas in the human host. These histopathological structures involved in both protection and pathogenesis, are subject to various influences from the host systemically and through micro-niche environments. Despite the fact that vitamin D (VD) has a key role in macrophage activation and mycobacterial clearance in the early stages of Mtb infection, the overall role of VD in granuloma maintenance or functionality has been scarcely studied. VD deficiency has long time been known to influence on gut microbiota composition, and recent studies have shown that it can also impact on respiratory microbiome. The human microbiota plays an important role in pathogen colonization resistance, and it has been proposed to play a potential role in TB pathogenesis. In this article, we have reviewed current knowledge on the interaction between VD, the lung microbiome and TB, and propose mechanisms by which the tuberculous granuloma's outcome could be modulated by these two factors. The determinants of the final fate of lung granulomas are still unclear, and deciphering the underlying drivers of Mtb infection outcome within those structures is of critical importance.","Candida albicans cell wall mannoprotein synergizes with lipopolysaccharide to affect RAW264.7 proliferation, phagocytosis and apoptosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953745,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 02,"With the widespread use of invasive surgery, immunosuppressive therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics, there has resulted a corresponding increase in severe systemic infections as produced by Candida albicans (C.albicans), as it combines with bacterial infections. Such infections often result in high rates of mortality. In this report, we examined the effects of the C. albicans cell wall mannoprotein (MP) on macrophage immunity. The MTS assay was used to detect cell proliferation activity and neutral red staining to observe cell phagocytosis. The Griess method was used to detect NO secretion in culture supernatants and apoptosis of macrophages were determined with use of FITC-Annexin V and PI staining. mRNA and protein expressions of JAK2, STAT3, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS in RAW264.7 cells were determined with use of RT-PCR and western blot. MP significantly promoted the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells, inhibited their phagocytic capacity, but exerted no significant effects on apoptosis of macrophages. In addition, MP not only up-regulated the expression of cytokines, but also the expressions of p-stat3 and p-jak2. Interestingly, when MP was combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a markedly accentuated release of inflammatory cytokines was observed. MP promotes macrophage inflammation induced by LPS and participates in the inflammatory response. One of the potential mechanisms of this effect involves MP activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells, which enables macrophages to transform from M0 to M1 and promote the occurrence of inflammation.",Unbiased Pathogen Detection and Host Gene Profiling for Conjunctivitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953744,Ophthalmology,2019 05 21,"The etiology of conjunctivitis is often misdiagnosed.

While mammals poorly regenerate most tissues, teleost fish and urodele amphibians possess remarkable regenerative capacity. Earlier work demonstrated that genes driving regeneration are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that a key factor in diverse tissue regeneration is not the presence or absence of regeneration-driving genes but the mechanisms controlling activation of these genes after injury. Thus, understanding the regulatory events of tissue regeneration could provide the means for unlocking latent capacities for tissue regeneration. After injury, cells undergo extensive epigenetic changes to establish new transcriptional programs for tissue regeneration. Gene transcription in eukaryotes is a complicated process that requires specific interactions between trans-acting regulators and cis-regulatory DNA elements. Among cis-regulatory elements, enhancers are essential to control precise gene expression. Recently, multiple regeneration/injury-associated enhancers have been identified in several model organisms. In this review, we highlight recently discovered regeneration/injury enhancers and their specific characteristics. We also discuss how abnormal regulation of regeneration enhancers influences animal development and physiology. Investigation of regeneration enhancers potentially allows us to begin understanding the fundamental biology of tissue regeneration and inspires new solutions for manipulating regenerative ability.",Upregulation of proteoglycans in the perilesion perimeter in ventral horns after spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953739,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 28,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in pronounced focal tissue damage with subsequent formation of a glial scar that blocks axon regeneration and regrowth. Cellular changes and the composition of the extracellular matrix in regions distal from the injured area remain poorly characterized. In the present study, in the spinal cord distal to the damaged area (perilesion perimeter) there were minimal gross histological changes, but there were pronounced alterations in the extracellular proteoglycans even at 30 days after SCI. These abnormalities coincided with the appearance of reactive astrocytes and a reduction in main astrocytic glutamate transporter 1. Proteoglycan levels exhibited different kinetics and changes after SCI in areas near neuronal cell bodies and in areas distal from them. The results of the study suggest that SCI induces widespread changes in the spinal cord that may be responsible for neuronal dysfunction far from the damaged area and further aggravation of the SCI."

The antioxidant activities of the purified LmSAP protein were evaluated using various in vitro and in vivo assays. LmSAP has an excellent DPPH scavenging ability and exhibits notable reducing power capacity and led to a decrease in TBARS values. The LmSAP showed an important antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic strains tested. In fact, the Inhibition Zone (IZ), Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and The Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MCB) recorded were in the range of 14-22 mm, 62-250 μg/ml and 125-250 μg/ml, respectively.

A similar trend was also noticed for enzyme activity with respect to GdnHCl concentrations. To establish the role of copper ion in the catalytic activity of laccase, a complete removal of copper was carried out and addition of copper was found to restore the structure and activity during the refolding process. The apo form was also reconstituted by addition of zinc ion which restored nearly 84% of enzyme activity, indicating non-essential role of copper in maintaining conformation and activity.

In the vitro digestion model, the complex could maintain better solubility and steady of iron than FeSO4. In the cell assay, FVP-Fe(III) showed lower cytotoxicity and better absorption. The transport amount of FVP-Fe(III) was 1.5-fold of FeSO4 at same concentration and 1.8-fold of FeSO4 at same time. The transport was mediated by the peptide transporter (pepT1) active transport pathway and the efflux of the sample was mainly mediated by multidrug-resistance proteins (MRP) transporter. The results of this study suggested that the polysaccharide obtained from F. velutipes could be developed a new kind of iron delivery for further study.","Non-classical secretion of 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzymes without signal peptides in Escherichia coli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953720,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"1,4-α-Glucan branching enzyme (GBE, EC. 2.4.1.18), which plays a key role in the synthesis of starch and glycogen, has been overexpressed in E. coli as an intracellular enzyme by many researchers. In this study, it was found that the GBEs from Geobacillus thermoglucosidans and Rhodothermus obamensis were secreted into the culture medium when they were expressed separately, in E. coli. This occurred despite the absence of any signal peptide. In fact, although bioinformatics tools predicted that both of these proteins would localize to the cytoplasm, a high level of expression and non-classical secretion was found to achieve without addition of the inducer isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Further experiments revealed that secretion was a two-step process that occurred via the periplasmic space. Results excluded the involvement of the Sec pathway or the TAT pathway. Instead, the findings indicated a relationship between cell membrane integrity and the secretion of the two GBEs, and suggested that their N-termini play an essential role in their expression and secretion.",Over-expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) and flavohemoglobin (FHb) genes greatly enhances pullulan production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953719,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Overexpression of the optimized Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene and the native flavohemoglobin (FHb) gene in Aureobasidium melanogenum P16 rendered a V6 strain and a F44 strain to overproduce pullulan compared to that produced by their wild type strain P16.

Inflammation leads to the adipose tissue dysfunction and further increases the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that α3-nAChR could regulate the disorder of adipose functions. Adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice after α3-nAChR was antagonized and in adipocytes after α3-nAChR gene was silenced. Results showed that in high fat diet-fed ApoE-/- mice with α3-nAChR blocked and in IL-6-stimulated adipocytes with α3-nAChR gene silenced the productions of leptin, resistin, triglyceride, cholesterol and low density lipoprotein were significantly increased but the generations of adiponectin and high density lipoprotein were markedly deceased. Meanwhile, the release of inflammatory cytokines was notably augmented. Moreover, the activation of JAK2/STAT3 was involved in the α3-nAChR-dependent signaling pathways in the regulation of adipose tissue dysfunction. A way may be paved for further investigations for the regulatory role of α3-nAChR in inflammatory and metabolic diseases.",Vasculature submucosal changes at early stages of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953717,Bone,2019 04 30,"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), a rare, but potentially severe side effect of anti-resorptive medications, presents as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region lasting for at least 8 weeks. While clinical experience and animal models concur in finding that systemic antiresorptive treatment in conjunction with local risk factors, such as tooth extraction or dental disease may lead to ONJ development, the subclinical molecular changes that precede bone exposure remain poorly understood. The identification of these changes is not only important in understanding disease pathophysiology, but could provide potential for treatment development. Here, we evaluated the early stages of ONJ utilizing a model of experimental periodontitis (EP) in mice treated with two different types of antiresorptives, targeting potential changes in vasculature, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Antiresorptive treatment in animals with EP increased levels of empty osteocytic lacunae and increased ONJ prevalence compared to Veh animals. The arteriole and venule network seen around EP areas was diminished in animals treated with antiresorptives. Higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1) were observed 1-week following EP in treated animals. Finally, levels of hypoxia, oxidative stress, and apoptosis remained high in antiresorptive treated animals with EP through the duration of the experiment. Together, our data point to subclinical vasculature organizational disturbances that subsequently affect levels of hypoxia, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the area of developing ONJ.",Analysis of Apical Membrane Antigen (AMA)-1 characteristics using bioinformatics tools in order to vaccine design against Plasmodium vivax.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953716,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 04 28,"Plasmodium vivax, an intracellular protozoan, causes malaria which is characterized by fever, anemia, respiratory distress, liver and spleen enlargement. In spite of attempts to design an efficient vaccine, there is not a vaccine against P. vivax. Notable advances have recently achieved in the development of malaria vaccines targeting the surface antigens such as Apical Membrane Antigens (AMA)-1. AMA-1 is a micronemal protein synthesized during the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium species and plays a significant role in the invasion process of the parasite into host cells. P. vivax AMA-1 (PvAMA-1) can induce strong cellular and humoral responses, indicating that it can be an ideal candidate of vaccine against malaria. Identification and prediction of proteins characteristics increase our knowledge about them and leads to develop vaccine and diagnostic studies. In the present study several valid bioinformatics tools were applied to analyze the various characteristics of AMA-1 such as physical and chemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, B- cell and T-cell prediction and other important features in order to introduce potential epitopes for designing a high-efficient vaccine. The results demonstrated that this protein had 57 potential PTM sites and only one transmembrane domain on its sequence. Also, multiple hydrophilic regions and classical high hydrophilic domains were predicted. Secondary structure prediction revealed that the proportions of random coil, alpha-helix and extended strand in the AMA-1 sequence were 53.74%, 27.22%, and 19.4%, respectively. Moreover, 5 disulfide bonds were predicted at positions 14-21aa, 162-192aa, 208-220aa, 247-265aa and 354-363aa. The data obtained from B-cell and T-cell epitopes prediction showed that there were several potential epitopes on AMA-1 that can be proper targets for diagnostic and vaccine studies. The current study presented interesting basic and theoretical information regarding PvAMA-1, being important for further studies in order to design a high-efficiency vaccine against malaria.",Survivorship of wild caught Mepraia spinolai nymphs: The effect of seasonality and Trypanosoma cruzi infection after feeding and fasting in the laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953715,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 04 28,"Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Vector survival is an important variable affecting vectorial capacity to determine parasite transmission risk. The aims of this study are to evaluate vector survival under fasting/starvation conditions of wild-caught Mepraia spinolai after feeding and fasting, the pathogenicity of T. cruzi infection, the parasite burden and seasonal variation in parasite discrete typing units (DTU). The survivorship of M. spinolai nymphs after two continuous artificial feedings was evaluated, assessing their infection with microscopic observation of fecal samples and PCR. Later, insects were fasted/starved until death. We performed qPCR analyses of parasite load in the fecal samples and dead specimens. T. cruzi genotyping was performed using conventional PCR amplicons and hybridization tests. Infection rate was higher in M. spinolai nymphs in summer and spring than in fall. Parasite burden varied from 3 to 250,000 parasites/drop. Survival rate for starved nymph stage II was lower in insects collected in the spring compared to summer and fall. TcII was the most frequent DTU. Mainly metacyclic trypomastigotes were excreted. We conclude that M. spinolai infection rate in nymphs varies among seasons, suggesting higher transmission risk in warmer seasons. However, nymphs stage II collected in spring are more sensitive to starvation compared to other seasons. TcII in single or mixed infection does not seem relevant to determine vector pathogenicity. These results of vector survivorship after fasting/starvation are important to determine the competence of M. spinolai as a vector of T. cruzi, since they excrete metacyclic trypomastigotes and the parasitism with T. cruzi seems to be poorly pathogenic to the vector under a severe fasting/starvation condition.",Spinal Nerve Tolerance to Single-Session Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953713,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2019 05 12,This study was performed to determine the dose-related incidence of neuropathy from single-session irradiation of the C6-C8 spinal nerves using a pig model and to test the hypothesis that the spinal nerves and spinal cord have the same tolerance to full cross-sectional irradiation.

This study investigated the feasibility of generating synthetic MPRAGE images from mGRE images using a deep convolutional neural network. Tissue segmentation results derived from the synthetic MPRAGE showed good agreement with those from actual MPRAGE (DSC = 0.882 ± 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean susceptibility values obtained with the regions of interest from synthetic and actual MPRAGEs and high correlation between the two measurements.",Ultrafast multi-slice chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging scheme based on segmented spatiotemporal encoding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953697,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 02,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is an important magnetic resonance molecular imaging technology. However, long acquisition time limits its clinical application, especially when multi-slice CEST imaging is needed. Though single-shot EPI can be used to accelerate CEST imaging, images are often distorted under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In this work, we propose a new method called CEST-SeSPEN for ultrafast multi-slice CEST imaging based on segmented spatiotemporally encoded (SeSPEN) MRI. Experiments were performed on creatine phantom and hen egg. The results show that CEST-SeSPEN can provide good CEST contrast images. Its acquisition time is much shorter than other multi-slice CEST methods currently available. It may be used in challenging situation where high temporal resolution and robustness to field inhomogeneity are vital.","Temporary inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex impairs the formation, but not the retrieval of social odor recognition memory in rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953696,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 05 22,"The hippocampus, medial dorsal thalamus and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices are essential for visual recognition memory whereas the neural substrates underlying olfactory recognition memories are less well characterized. In the present study we combined chemogenetic inactivation with a social odor recognition memory (SORM) task to test the hypothesis that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in recognition memory. We demonstrate that temporary chemogenetic inactivation of the mPFC prior to an encoding session impairs social odor recognition memory, whereas silencing the mPFC just prior to the recognition session was without effect. Our data support the critical role of the mPFC in the formation rather than retrieval of social odor memory.",In vitro assessment of CeO2 nanoparticles effects on intestinal microvilli morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953695,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 06 08,"Some nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to disrupt intestinal microvilli morphology in vitro, an alteration that could potentially affect nutrient absorption and barrier properties. This study aimed at evaluating the potential effect of CeO2 NPs (4-8 nm, citrate stabilized) on Caco-2 microvilli morphology. In addition to the standard Caco-2 cell clone, the C2BBe1 clone was used, as it is considered to develop a more homogeneous cellular morphology. Semiautomated microvilli density quantification and a new cell scoring approach were used to evaluate scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The quantification method made use of the whole micrograph surface, avoiding the need to choose subareas for analysis, and increasing the representativeness of the results when compared to previous studies. The main advantage of the scoring system is that it informs on the intercellular variability within a cell preparation. Benzalkonium was used as a positive control inducing toxicity and morphological alterations on microvilli. After three-week differentiation, Caco-2 cells were exposed to 100 μg/mL of CeO2 NPs for 24 h. The integrity of the membrane was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and thereafter processed for its observation by SEM. Results showed that both the standard Caco-2 clone and the C2BBe1 clone present notable morphological heterogeneity. The two evaluation approaches were able to identify morphological effects caused by the positive control, but did not detect statistically significant morphological alterations after exposure to CeO2 NPs.",Anti-biofilm and antimicrobial effects of zerumbone against Bacteroides fragilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953693,Anaerobe,2019 06 02,"Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) can form biofilms in the colon mucosal membrane and may promote chronic infection and tumor formation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zerumbone extracted from Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith, on B. fragilis biofilm formation. Inhibitory effects of zerumbone on planktonic cell growth and biofilm formation were examined by crystal-violet biofilm assays and XTT metabolic assays. Results showed that zerumbone significantly inhibited biofilm formation and eradicated established biofilms. Furthermore, B. fragilis biofilms inhibited by zerumbone were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. qRT-PCR was used to support the phenotypic results and to investigate the expression levels of an efflux pump-related gene (bmeB). Specifically, among the efflux pump-related genes, zerumbone significantly suppressed the expression level of bmeB12.

Alkylation stress response mechanisms also occur in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) the pathogen responsible for tuberculosis. The effect of alkylating agents on the cellular growth of MTB was investigated using methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) as methyl donor demonstrating that limited doses of alkylating agents might affect MTB cell viability. A global investigation of Mycobacterium smegmatis response to alkylating stress was then pursued by differential proteomics to identify the most affected cellular pathways. Quantitative analysis of proteomic profiles demonstrated that most of the proteins upregulated in the presence of alkylating agents are involved in biofilm formation and/or cell wall biosynthesis. Tailored experiments confirmed that under stress conditions M. smegmatis elicits physical defence mechanisms by increasing biofilm formation. Among the upregulated proteins, we identified the GlmU bifunctional enzyme as a possible factor involved in biofilm production. Experiments with both conditional deletion and overexpressing glmU mutants demonstrated that down regulation of GlmU decreased M. smegmatis capabilities to produce biofilm whereas overexpression of the enzyme increased biofilm formation. These results were supported by inhibition of GlmU acetyltransferase activity with two different inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of this enzyme in the M. smegmatis defence mechanisms.",Effect of the optimized selective enrichment medium on the expression of the p60 protein used as Listeria monocytogenes antigen in specific sandwich ELISA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953690,Research in microbiology,2019 05 02,"This paper presents the effects of the composition of different media (i.e., Tryptic soy broth (TSB), Brain heart infusion (BHI), Listeria enrichment broth (LEB), Fraser broth (FB) and University of Vermont medium (UVM)) on the detection of a short peptide fragment PepD specific to the p60 protein (p60) of L. monocytogenes by a monoclonal antibody (anti-PepD mAb). Expression of the p60 obtained was demonstrated to be proportional to the cellular growth of Listeria monocytogenes regardless of the tested growth medium. However, the early growth of L. monocytogenes and the expression of the p60 were negatively affected by the presence of selective agents present in LEB, FB and UVM. Among those three selective enrichment media commonly used for L. monocytogenes, LEB allowed a better expression of L. monocytogenes p60 after an incubation period of 18 h. Optimization of the LEB revealed that the dextrose concentration was the critical factor for improving the expression of p60 and promotes the early expression of p60. Moreover, an optimal dextrose concentration of 0.5% (w/v) in LEB, coupled with anti-PepD mAb immobilized to solid support, reduced the detection of p60 from 18 h to 9 h for an initial concentration of L. monocytogenes of 108 CFU/ml.","TRPC channels: Regulation, dysregulation and contributions to chronic kidney disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953689,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Mutations in the gene encoding canonical transient receptor potential-6 (TRPC6) channels result in severe nephrotic syndromes that typically lead to end-stage renal disease. Many but not all of these mutations result in a gain in the function of the resulting channel protein. Since those observations were first made, substantial work has supported the hypothesis that TRPC6 channels can also contribute to progression of acquired (non-genetic) glomerular diseases, including primary and secondary FSGS, glomerulosclerosis during autoimmune glomerulonephritis, and possibly in type-1 diabetes. Their regulation has been extensively studied, especially in podocytes, but also in mesangial cells and other cell types present in the kidney. More recent evidence has implicated TRPC6 in renal fibrosis and tubulointerstitial disease caused by urinary obstruction. Consequently TRPC6 is being extensively investigated as a target for drug discovery. Other TRPC family members are present in kidney. TRPC6 can form a functional heteromultimer with TRPC3, and it has been suggested that TRPC5 may also play a role in glomerular disease progression, although the evidence on this is contradictory. Here we review literature on the expression and regulation of TRPC6, TRPC3 and TRPC5 in various cell types of the vertebrate kidney, the evidence that these channels are dysregulated in disease models, and research showing that knock-out or pharmacological inhibition of these channels can reduce the severity of kidney disease. We also summarize several areas that remain controversial, and some of the large gaps of knowledge concerning the fundamental role of these proteins in regulation of renal function.","DNA repair fidelity in stem cell maintenance, health, and disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953688,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Increased lifetime and frequent replication set them vulnerable for both exogenous and endogenous agents-induced DNA damage compared to normal cells. To counter these damages and preserve genetic information, stem cells have evolved with various DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. Furthermore, upon experiencing irreparable DNA damage, stem cells mostly prefer early senescence or apoptosis to avoid the accumulation of damages. However, the failure of these mechanisms leads to various diseases, including cancer. Especially, given the importance of stem cells in early development, DNA repair deficiency in stem cells leads to various disabilities like developmental delay, premature aging, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, degenerative diseases, etc. In this review, we have summarized the recent update about how DNA repair mechanisms are regulated in stem cells and their association with disease progression and pathogenesis."

General subjects,2019 04 28,"Change in the intracellular redox state is a consequence of various metabolic reactions, which simultaneously regulates various physiological phenomena in cells. Monitoring the redox state in living cells is thus very important for understanding cellular physiology. Various genetically encoded fluorescent redox sensors have therefore been developed. Recently, we developed oxidation-sensitive fluorescent proteins named Oba-Q (Sugiura, K., et al. (2015) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 457, 242-248), which exhibit dramatic quenching under oxidizing conditions. To extend the range of uses of redox sensor proteins, we refined these proteins based on the molecular architecture applied to Oba-Q, and successfully produced several redox sensor proteins based on CFP and YFP. Interestingly, some of these sensor proteins showed the reverse changes in emission compared with Oba-Q, implying remarkable fluorescence quenching under reducing conditions. We named this type of sensor protein Re-Q, reduction-sensed quenching protein. The cause of the redox-dependent fluorescence quenching could be clearly explained based on the crystal structure of Re-Q in the reduced and oxidized forms. In addition, by introducing suitable mutations into the sensors, we produced Oba-Q and Re-Q mutants exhibiting various midpoint redox potentials. This series of proteins can cover a wide range of redox potentials in the cell, so they should be applicable to various cells and even intracellular organelles. As an example, we successfully measured the redox responses in different cell compartments of cultured mammalian cells simultaneously against the anticancer reagents Kp372-1.",The Effects of Mobile Phone Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields on β-Amyloid-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human and Rat Primary Astrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953670,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) is implicated in the development of pathological reactions associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and death of brain cells. Current pharmacological approaches to treat AD are not able to control the deposition of Aβ and suppression of Aβ-induced cellular response. There is a growing body of evidence that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) causes a decrease of beta-amyloid deposition in the brains and provides cognitive benefits to Alzheimer's Tg mice. Herein, we investigated the effects of mobile phone radiofrequency EMF of 918 MHz on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), activity of NADPH-oxidase, and phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 kinases in human and rat primary astrocytes in the presence of Aβ42 and H2O2. Our data demonstrate that EMF is able to reduce Aβ42- and H2O2-induced cellular ROS, abrogate Aβ₄₂-induced production of mitochondrial ROS and the co-localization between the cytosolic (p47-phox) and membrane (gp91-phox) subunits of NADPH oxidase, while increasing MMP, and inhibiting H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 in primary astrocytes. Yet, EMF was not able to modulate alterations in the phosphorylation state of the MAPKs triggered by Aβ42. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms of cellular and molecular responses of astrocytes on RF-EMF exposure and indicate the therapeutic potential of RF-EMF for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Implicitly and explicitly assessed anxiety: No relationships with recognition of and brain response to facial emotions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953669,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Trait anxiety, the disposition to experience anxiety, is known to facilitate perception of threats. Trait anxious individuals seem to identify threatening stimuli such as fearful facial expressions more accurately, especially when presented under temporal constraints. In past studies on anxiety and emotion face recognition, only self-report or explicit measures of anxiety have been administered. Implicit measures represent indirect tests allowing to circumvent problems associated with self-report. In our study, we made use of implicit in addition to explicit measures to investigate the relationships of trait anxiety with recognition of and brain response to emotional faces. 75 healthy young volunteers had to identify briefly presented (67 ms) fearful, angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions masked by neutral faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Implicit Association Test, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were applied as implicit and explicit measures of trait anxiety. After corrections for multiple testing, neither implicitly nor explicitly measured anxiety correlated with recognition of emotional facial expressions. Moreover, implicitly and explicitly assessed anxiety was not linked to brain response to emotional faces. Our data suggest links between discrimination accuracy and brain response to facial emotions. Activation of the caudate nucleus seems be of particular importance for recognizing fear and happiness from facial expressions. Processes of somatosensory resonance appear to be involved in identifying fear from facial expressions. The present data indicate that, regardless of assessment method, trait anxiety does not affect the recognition of fear or other emotions as has been proposed previously.","ITE, an endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand, suppresses endometrial cancer cell proliferation and migration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953668,Toxicology,2019 05 24,"Identification of new molecular targets for the treatment of endometrial cancer (EC) is an important clinical goal, especially for the patients which were resistant to conventional therapies.

Brain delivery was evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional cerebral blood flow. Intranasal insulin administration has been hypothesised to exploit nose-to-brain pathways and deliver drug directly to the brain tissue whilst limiting systemic exposure. Three nasal pump-actuator configurations were compared for delivery of 400 IU/mL insulin solution by measuring droplet size distribution, plume geometry, spray pattern and in vitro deposition in a nasal cast. The device with optimal spray properties for nose to brain delivery (spray angle between 30° and 45°; droplet size between 20 and 50 μm) also favoured high posterior-superior deposition in the nasal cast and was utilised in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy male volunteers showed statistically significant decreases in regional cerebral blood flow within areas dense in insulin receptors (bilateral amygdala) in response to intranasally administered insulin (160 IU) compared to saline (control). These changes correspond to the expected effects of insulin in the brain and were achieved using a simple nasal spray device and solution formulation. We recommend that a thorough characterisation of nasal delivery devices and qualitative/quantitative assessment of the administered dose is reported in all studies of nose to brain delivery so that responses can be evaluated with respect to posology and comparison between studies is facilitated.",Amelioration of the nigrostriatal pathway facilitated by ultrasound-mediated neurotrophic delivery in early Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953664,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 06,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents most drugs from gaining access to the brain parenchyma, which is a recognized impediment to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Focused ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with systemically administered microbubbles, opens the BBB locally, reversibly and non-invasively. Herein, we show that neither FUS applied over both the striatum and the ventral midbrain, without neurotrophic factors, nor intravenous administration of neurotrophic factors (either through protein or gene delivery) without FUS, ameliorates the damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in the sub-acute MPTP mouse model of early-stage PD. Conversely, the combination of FUS and intravenous neurotrophic (protein or gene) delivery attenuates the damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, by allowing the entry of these agents into the brain parenchyma.

While immunotherapy provides patients a new treatment option, the therapy is effective in less than half of the treated patients. To attain greater insight into the tumor-immune microenvironment, NSCLC tumors were analyzed by IHC and RNA-seq. IHC was used to identify NSCLC tumors that contain low, moderate, or high levels of CD8+ positive cells as a manifestation of an active anti-tumor immune response. Gene expression analysis identified an emergent gene signature that is associated with high and moderate levels of CD8 in NSCLC. In addition, the NSCLC tumors also express a unique combination of genes that may indicate complex anti-tumor immune responses (INFG-related genes, STATs, CXCL9, OX40, PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO1, and CD47). Several NSCLC tumors also express the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and at least one additional immune inhibitory molecule (IDO1, PD-L2, or others), which may explain the lack of a therapeutic response to treatments that disrupt only one immune checkpoint pathway.",Concise approach for screening long non-coding RNAs functionally linked to human breast cancer associated genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953646,Experimental and molecular pathology,2019 05 24,"Cancer research studies using next-generation sequencing have revealed a number of genes of which aberrant expression is associated with various cancers. Recently, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been highlighted due to its tissue-specific expression and cell cancerization functions, such as the regulation of key tumor suppressors. In this study, we suggest a very efficient approach to survey lncRNAs putatively associated with breast cancer. We targeted lncRNAs linked with breast cancer associated genes (BCAGs) and analyzed their expression pattern in human breast cancer cell lines. A total of 337 BCAGs were retrieved from literature review and the existence of 121 lncRNAs were identified from the 15 kb up- and downstream regions of the list of genes. Twenty lncRNAs' expression were detectable in human breast cancer cell lines with different expression patterns. Interestingly, the expression of three lncRNAs, two up-regulated (RAD51C v.4, LOC105371849) and one down-regulated (LOC102724064), were closely correlated with adjacent BCAGs (RAD51C, HEATR6 and BRMS1) in breast cancer cell lines. We thus demonstrated association between the lncRNA and its adjacent BCAG using LOC105371849-HEATR6, of which the function and regulation in breast cancer are still unknown. Knockdown of LOC105371849 by siRNA decreased the expression of HEATR6 mRNA in the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line. In conclusion, this study provides a better understanding about the biological roles of lncRNAs in breast cancer and may be useful in the investigation of proper targets for diagnostic and/or therapeutic breast cancer markers using public databases.",Toll-like receptor 4 promotes high glucose-induced catabolic and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes in an NF-κB-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953645,Life sciences,2019 05 22,"Diabetes is an independent risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA), and hyperglycaemia-induced inflammation is considered to play an important role in their connection. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulates inflammatory responses in several pathological conditions including diabetes and OA. However, its role in diabetes-associated OA is poorly understood. In this study, we found that TLR4 expression was higher in OA cartilage from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than that from non-T2DM patients. Similarly, its expression was induced in primary mouse chondrocytes treated with high glucose, which suggests that TLR4 upregulation in T2DM-associated OA cartilage may originate from hyperglycaemia stimulation. We further discovered that TLR4 promoted high glucose-induced catabolic and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes, and mechanistically, these effects could be explained by the exacerbated activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, since its inhibition by Bay 11-7082 abrogated TLR4 effects on high glucose-treated chondrocytes. Taken together, these findings may reveal a promotive role of TLR4 in regulating hyperglycaemia-induced catabolism and inflammation in T2DM-associated OA, and also implicate that TLR4 inhibition might be of therapeutic significance in treating T2DM-associated OA.",Geniposide ameliorated fluoxetine-suppressed neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953644,Life sciences,2019 05 13,"Fluoxetine (FXT), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the most common psychiatric medications clinically prescribed; while over-produced serotonin may suppress neurite development.

While many rodent studies focused primarily on the detrimental effects of early-life stress, human literature suggests that genetic susceptibility may not be restricted to negative environments; it may also enhance the beneficial effects of positive rearing conditions. To examine this interaction in a controlled setting, heterozygous mineralocorticoid receptor knockout (MR+/-) mice and control litter mates were exposed to a limited nesting/bedding (LN, impoverished), standard nesting (SN, control) or communal nesting (CN, enriched) paradigm from postnatal day 2-9 (P2-P9). Offspring was monitored for puberty onset between P24-P36 and, in females, maternal care-giving (i.e. as F1) during adulthood, after which basal corticosterone was measured. Different home-cage environments resulted in profound differences in received maternal care and offspring body weight. In male offspring, LN resulted in delayed puberty onset that was mediated by body weight and unpredictability of maternal care received during early development. In female offspring, rearing condition did not significantly alter sexual maturation and had little effect on their own maternal care-giving behavior. Genotype did affect maternal care: female MR+/- offspring exhibited a less active nursing style and upregulated fragmentation during adulthood, irrespective of early life conditions. Basal corticosterone levels were highest in MR+/- mice with a background of LN. Overall, we found a gene-by-environment interaction with respect to basal corticosterone levels, but not for sexual maturation or maternal behavior."

In contrast, milder forms of HADHB mutations cause the later onset of progressive axonal peripheral neuropathy (approximately 50-80%) and myopathy with or without episodic myoglobinuria. The mechanisms linking neuronal defects in these diseases to the loss of HADHB function currently remain unclear. Drosophila has the CG4581 (dHADHB) gene as a single human HADHB homologue. We herein established pan-neuron-specific dHADHB knockdown flies and examined their phenotypes. The knockdown of dHADHB shortened the lifespan of flies, reduced locomotor ability and also limited learning abilities. These phenotypes were accompanied by an abnormal synapse morphology at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and reduction in both ATP and ROS levels in central nervous system (CNS). The Drosophila NMJ synapses are glutamatergic that is similar to those in the vertebrate CNS. The present results reveal a critical role for dHADHB in the morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic neurons including peripheral neurons.

In this review, we present novel biomarkers of high potential, especially those found in blood, urine or saliva, which could lead to a more comfortable patient experience and better time- and cost-effectivity, compared to the currently used diagnostic methods. We focus on biomarkers that might allow for the detection of Alzheimer's disease before its clinical manifestations. Such biomarkers might be helpful for better understanding the etiology of the disease and identifying its risk factors. Moreover, it could be a base for developing new treatment or at least help to prolong the presymptomatic stage in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Recent research is overturning the conventional wisdom, and there is now overwhelming evidence that various non-pathogenic microorganisms can stably or transiently inhabit hemolymph in a diversity of insects. Most is known about Spiroplasma, especially in Drosophila species, and secondary symbionts of the Enterobacteriaceae, notably Hamiltonella defensa, in aphids. These bacteria require many nutrients, representing a likely drain on host nutritional resources, and they persist in the hemolymph by a combination of evasion and tolerance of insect immune effectors. These traits can be costly to the insect host. For some hemolymph microorganisms, these costs are balanced by other traits beneficial to the insect, notably protection against natural enemies mediated by specific toxins or competition for key nutrients. Three key priorities for future research are: to investigate the prevalence and taxonomic diversity of hemolymph microorganisms in insects; to establish the role of host nutritional and immune factors as determinants of the abundance and proliferation rates of hemolymph microorganisms; and to integrate the developing understanding of these microorganisms and their impacts (both costs and benefits) on insect nutrition and immune function into the wider study of insect physiology.",Fat body lipolysis connects poor nutrition to hypopharyngeal gland degradation in Apis mellifera.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953617,Journal of insect physiology,2019 06 04,"The hypopharyngeal glands (HGs) of honey bee nurse workers secrete the major protein fraction of jelly, a protein and lipid rich substance fed to developing larvae, other worker bees, and queens. A hallmark of poorly nourished nurses is their small HGs, which actively degrade due to hormone-induced autophagy. To better connect nutritional stress with HG degradation, we looked to honey bees and other insect systems, where nutrient stress is often accompanied by fat body degradation. The fat body contains stored lipids that are likely a substrate for ecdysteroid synthesis, so we tested whether starvation caused increased fat body lipolysis. Ecdysteroid signaling and response pathways and IIS/TOR are tied to nutrient-dependent autophagy in honey bees and other insects, and so we also tested whether and where genes in these pathways were differentially regulated in the head and fat body. Last, we injected nurse-aged bees with the honey bee ecdysteroid makisterone A to determine whether this hormone influenced HG size and autophagy. We find that starved nurse aged bees exhibited increased fat body lipolysis and increased expression of ecdysteroid production and response genes in the head. Genes in the IIS/TOR pathway were not impacted by starvation in either the head or fat body. Additionally, bees injected with makisterone A had smaller HGs and increased expression of autophagy genes. These data support the hypothesis that nutritional stress induces fat body lipolysis, which may liberate the sterols important for ecdysteroid production, and that increased ecdysteroid levels induce autophagic HG degradation.",Geniposide alleviates hypoxia-induced injury by down-regulation of lncRNA THRIL in rat cardiomyocytes derived H9c2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953616,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 24,"Geniposide (GEN) is an iridoid glycoside extracts from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis with antioxidant and anti-inflammarory properties. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of GEN on a cell model of myocardial infarction (MI). After transfection, hypoxia-stimulated H9c2 cells were treated with GEN. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by Cell Counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Cell cycle-, apoptosis- and signal pathway related proteins were examined by Western blot. The expression of THRIL was determined by qRT-PCR. In addition, in vivo experiments were performed in rats. Then the infarct size and the left ventricular (LV) end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV fractional shortening (LVFS) were monitored. Results showed that treating H9c2 cells with GEN attenuated hypoxia-induced cell damage as cell viability was increased, and cell apoptosis was repressed. Meanwhile, THRIL was found to be down-regulated by GEN. The cardioprotective effects of GEN on H9c2 cells were attenuated when THRIL was overexpressed. Besides this, the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, JAK1 and STAT3 were up-regulated by GEN while down-regulated by THRIL overexpression. Moreover, GEN decreased infarct size and LVEDD, while increased LVEF and LVFS. Taken together, this study demonstrated that GEN alleviated cardiomyocytes damage and cardiac dysfunction possible through down-regulation of THRIL.",Gambogic acid attenuates liver fibrosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways via inhibiting HSP90.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953615,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 04 22,"Gambogic acid (GA), a major ingredient of Garcinia hanburryi, is known to have diverse biological effects.

The rat and human hepatic stellate cell lines (HSCs) lines were chose to evaluate the effect of GA in vitro. Our results indicated that GA could significantly ameliorate liver fibrosis associated with improving serum markers, decrease in extracellular matrix accumulation and HSCs activation in vivo. GA significantly inhibited the proliferation of HSC cells and induced the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Moreover, GA triggered autophagy at early time point and subsequent initiates mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathway resulting in HSC cell death. The mechanism of GA was related to inhibit heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and degradation of the client proteins inducing PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways inhibition.

Successful management of allergic diseases necessitates identifying their specific causes (i.e. identify the causative agent(s) and the route of contact to allergen: airborne, or skin contact) to avoid further exposure. Identification of sensitization by a sensitive and validated measurement of specific-IgE is an important step in the diagnosis. However, only a limited number of environmental and occupational allergens are available on the market for use in sIgE testing. Accordingly, specific in-house testing by individual diagnostic and laboratory centers is often required. Currently, different immunological tests are in use at various diagnostic centers that often produce considerably divergent results, mostly due to lack of standardized allergen preparation and standardized procedures as well as inadequate quality control. Our review and meta-analysis exhibited satisfactory performance of s IgE detection test for most high molecular weight (HMW) allergens with a pooled sensitivity of 0.74 and specificity of 0.71. However, for low molecular weight (LMW) allergens, pooled sensitivity is generally lower (0.28) and specificity higher (0.89) than for HMW tests. Major recommendations based on the presented data include diagnostic use of sIgE to HMW allergens. A negative sIgE results for LMW agents does not exclude sensitization. In addition, the requirements for full transparency of the content of allergen preparations with details on standardization and quality control is underlined. Development of standard operating procedures for in-house sIgE assays, and clinical validation, centralized quality control and audits are emphasized. There is also a need for specialized laboratories to provide a custom service for the development of tests for the measurement of putative novel occupational allergens that are not commercially available.

Indeed, it is unclear whether the processes that underlie cognitive dysfunction in these disorders are unique to each disease or represent a common neurobiological process that varies in severity. Here we used latent profile analysis (LPA) across 3 distinct cognitive domains (cognitive control, episodic memory, and visual integration; using data from the CNTRACS consortium) to identify distinct profiles of patients across psychotic illnesses. LPA was performed on a sample of 223 psychosis patients (59 with Type I bipolar disorder, 88 with SZ, and 76 with schizoaffective disorder). Seventy-three healthy control participants were included for comparison but were not included in sample LPA. Three latent profiles (""Low,"" ""Moderate,"" and ""High"" ability) were identified as the underlying covariance across the 3 domains. The 3-profile solution provided highly similar fit to a single continuous factor extracted by confirmatory factor analysis, supporting a unidimensional structure.

However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from postmortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labeling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory, and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ.

Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis and changed the way we diagnose and treat disease leading to more precise, predictable and powerful health care that is customized for the individual patient. Genetic, genomics, and epigenetic alterations appear to be contributing to different diseases. Deep clinical phenotyping, combined with advanced molecular phenotypic profiling, enables the construction of causal network models in which a genomic region is proposed to influence the levels of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. Phenotypic analysis bears great importance to elucidat the pathophysiology of networks at the molecular and cellular level. Digital biomarkers (BMs) can have several applications beyond clinical trials in diagnostics-to identify patients affected by a disease or to guide treatment. Digital BMs present a big opportunity to measure clinical endpoints in a remote, objective and unbiased manner. However, the use of ""omics"" technologies and large sample sizes have generated massive amounts of data sets, and their analyses have become a major bottleneck requiring sophisticated computational and statistical methods. With the wealth of information for different diseases and its link to intrinsic biology, the challenge is now to turn the multi-parametric taxonomic classification of a disease into better clinical decision-making by more precisely defining a disease. As a result, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to this vast data set. The advancements in digital health opportunities have also arisen numerous questions and concerns on the future of healthcare practices in particular with what regards the reliability of AI diagnostic tools, the impact on clinical practice and vulnerability of algorithms.

The aim of this study was to investigate their most common sites and morphological characteristics, and to propose possible reasons. MATERIAL AND METHODS Scapulae with bony spurs on the coracoid process were selected from 377 intact and dry Chinese scapulae. The distribution, height, and transverse and longitudinal diameter of the bony spurs were measured in each coracoid process. RESULTS We selected 71 scapulae, 36 left and 35 right, that had bony spurs, from 377 scapulae. The bony spurs were most commonly located at the attachment point of the superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL) (31, 23.66%), while the trapezoid ligament (TL) accounted for the smaller proportion (8, 6.11%). The TSL was the highest, with the minimum transverse and longitudinal diameter, while the TL had the greatest transverse and longitudinal diameters. Only the TSL and TL had a statistically significant difference between the left and the right bony spur regarding the longitudinal diameter (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Bony spurs are more likely to form at the attachment points of ligaments and tendons on the coracoid process, which has a greater risk of traction injuries or attachment points avulsion fractures.","Modeling Infectious Diseases in Mice with a ""Humanized"" Immune System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953434,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"Human immune system (HIS) mice are created by transplanting human immune cells or their progenitor cells into highly immunodeficient recipient mouse hosts, thereby ""humanizing"" their immune systems. Over past decades, the field of HIS mice has evolved rapidly, as modifications of existing immunodeficient mouse strains have been developed, resulting in increasing levels of human tissue engraftment as humanization is optimized. Current HIS mouse models not only permit elevated levels of human cell engraftment but also demonstrate graft stability. As such, HIS mice are being extensively used to study the human innate and adaptive immune response against microbial infections in vivo. Compared to nonhumanized animal models, which are frequently infected with surrogate or adapted microbes, the HIS mouse models allow the analysis of interactions between human immune cells and bona fide pathogenic microbes, making them a more clinically relevant model. This article reviews the development of HIS mice and covers the different strategies used to humanize mice, as well as discussing the use of HIS mice for studying bacterial infections that cause human disease.",Customizing Host Chromatin: a Bacterial Tale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953433,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"Successful bacterial colonizers and pathogens have evolved with their hosts and have acquired mechanisms to customize essential processes that benefit their lifestyle.

Modifications of chromatin, either on histone proteins or on DNA itself, are common targets during bacterium-host cross talk and are the focus of this article.",The Interplay between Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium and the Intestinal Mucosa during Oral Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953432,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"Bacterial infection results in a dynamic interplay between the pathogen and its host. The underlying interactions are multilayered, and the cellular responses are modulated by the local environment. The intestine is a particularly interesting tissue regarding host-pathogen interaction. It is densely colonized by commensal microbes and a portal of entry for ingested pathogens. This necessitates constant monitoring of microbial stimuli in order to maintain homeostasis during encounters with benign microbiota and to trigger immune defenses in response to bacterial pathogens. Homeostasis is maintained by physical barriers (the mucus layer and epithelium), chemical defenses (antimicrobial peptides), and innate immune responses (NLRC4 inflammasome), which keep the bacteria from reaching the sterile lamina propria. Intestinal pathogens represent potent experimental tools to probe these barriers and decipher how pathogens can circumvent them. The streptomycin mouse model of oral Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection provides a well-characterized, robust experimental system for such studies. Strikingly, each stage of the gut tissue infection poses a different set of challenges to the pathogen and requires tight control of virulence factor expression, host response modulation, and cooperation between phenotypic subpopulations. Therefore, successful infection of the intestinal tissue relies on a delicate and dynamic balance between responses of the pathogen and its host. These mechanisms can be deciphered to their full extent only in realistic in vivo infection models.",Electron Cryotomography of Bacterial Secretion Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953431,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"In biology, function arises from form. For bacterial secretion systems, which often span two membranes, avidly bind to the cell wall, and contain hundreds of individual proteins, studying form is a daunting task, made possible by electron cryotomography (ECT). ECT is the highest-resolution imaging technique currently available to visualize unique objects inside cells, providing a three-dimensional view of the shapes and locations of large macromolecular complexes in their native environment. Over the past 15 years, ECT has contributed to the study of bacterial secretion systems in two main ways: by revealing intact forms for the first time and by mapping components into these forms. Here we highlight some of these contributions, revealing structural convergence in type II secretion systems, structural divergence in type III secretion systems, unexpected structures in type IV secretion systems, and unexpected mechanisms in types V and VI secretion systems. Together, they offer a glimpse into a world of fantastic forms-nanoscale rotors, needles, pumps, and dart guns-much of which remains to be explored.",The Wolbachia Endosymbionts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953430,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"The Wolbachia endosymbionts encompass a large group of intracellular bacteria of biomedical and veterinary relevance, closely related to Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia. This genus of Gram-negative members of the Alphaproteobacteria does not infect vertebrates but is instead restricted to ecdysozoan species, including terrestrial arthropods and a family of parasitic filarial nematodes, the Onchocercidae. The Wolbachia profoundly impact not only the ecology and evolution but also the reproductive biology of their hosts, through a wide range of symbiotic interactions. Because they are essential to the survival and reproduction of their filarial nematode hosts, they represent an attractive target to fight filariasis. Their abilities to spread through insect populations and to affect vector competence through pathogen protection have made Wolbachia a staple for controlling vector-borne diseases. Estimated to be present in up to 66% of insect species, the Wolbachia are probably the most abundant endosymbionts on earth. Their success resides in their unique capacity to infect and manipulate the host germ line to favor their vertical transmission through the maternal lineage. Because the Wolbachia resist genetic manipulation and growth in axenic culture, our understanding of their biology is still in its infancy. Despite these limitations, the ""-omics"" revolution combined with the use of well-established and emerging experimental host models is accelerating our comprehension of the host phenotypes caused by Wolbachia, and the identification of Wolbachia effectors is ongoing.",Shigella Pathogenesis: New Insights through Advanced Methodologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953429,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"Shigella is a genus of Gram-negative enteropathogens that have long been, and continue to be, an important public health concern worldwide.

Collectively, the T4SSs translocate DNA and monomeric and multimeric protein substrates to bacterial and eukaryotic cell types. T4SSs are composed of two large subfamilies, the conjugation machines and the effector translocators that transmit their cargoes through establishment of direct donor-target cell contacts, and a third small subfamily capable of importing or exporting substrates from or to the milieu. This review summarizes recent mechanistic and structural findings that are shedding new light on how T4SSs have evolved such functional diversity. Translocation signals are now known to be located C terminally or embedded internally in structural folds; these signals in combination with substrate-associated adaptor proteins mediate the docking of specific substrate repertoires to cognate VirD4-like receptors. For the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm system, recent work has elucidated the structural basis for adaptor-dependent substrate loading onto the VirD4-like DotL receptor. Advances in definition of T4SS machine structures now allow for detailed comparisons of nanomachines closely related to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 T4SS with those more distantly related, e.g., the Dot/Icm and Helicobacter pylori Cag T4SSs. Finally, it is increasingly evident that T4SSs have evolved a variety of mechanisms dependent on elaboration of conjugative pili, membrane tubes, or surface adhesins to establish productive contacts with target cells. T4SSs thus have evolved extreme functional diversity through a plethora of adaptations impacting substrate selection, machine architecture, and target cell binding.",Salmonella Single-Cell Metabolism and Stress Responses in Complex Host Tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953427,Microbiology spectrum,2019 05 08,"Systemic Salmonella enterica infections are a major cause of mortality worldwide and are becoming increasingly untreatable. Recent single-cell data from a mouse model of typhoid fever show that the host immune system actually eradicates many Salmonella cells, while other Salmonella organisms thrive at the same time in the same tissue, causing lethal disease progression. The surviving Salmonella cells have highly heterogeneous metabolism, growth rates, and exposure to various stresses. Emerging evidence suggests that similarly heterogeneous host-pathogen encounters might be a key feature of many infectious diseases. This heterogeneity offers fascinating opportunities for research and application. If we understand the mechanisms that determine the disparate local outcomes, we might be able to develop entirely novel strategies for infection control by broadening successful host antimicrobial attacks and closing permissive niches in which pathogens can thrive. This review describes suitable technologies, a current working model of heterogeneous host-Salmonella interactions, the impact of diverse Salmonella subsets on antimicrobial chemotherapy, and major open questions and challenges."

Bioinformatic annotations and functional experiments were applied to reveal the potential biological mechanisms. Finally, SLC1A3 rs1049522 showed significant association with ADHD risk in two stages with CA genotype vs AA genotype, odds ratio (OR) = 0.694 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.570-0.844) and dominant model, OR = 0.749 (95% CI = 0.621-0.904) in the combined stage. Besides, rs1049522 was found to be related to ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptom, and rs1049522-C showed increased SLC1A3 mRNA expression in the cerebellar cortex. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further indicated that rs1049522-C allele enhanced SLC1A3 expression by disrupting the hsa-miR-3171 binding site. In conclusion, SLC1A3 variant rs1049522 was implicated in ADHD susceptibility in a Chinese Han population probably by enhancing the SLC1A3 expression in a miRNA-mediated manner.",Microfluidic chip technology applied to fine-needle aspiration cytology samples for IGH clonality assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953406,Diagnostic cytopathology,2019 04 29,"Most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) can be diagnosed using a combination of fine-needle cytology (FNC) and flow cytometry together with immunoglobulin light chain restriction and/or specific phenotypic profiles. However, 5%-15% of B-cell NHLs lack these specific diagnostic features. In such cases, the diagnosis of NHL may be supported by molecular clonality testing based on the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) assay of clonality by polyacrylamide heteroduplex analysis or by automated capillary electrophoresis via GeneScan analysis. Chip-based microfluidic technology (MT), based on miniaturized parallel capillary electrophoresis structures, is a viable alternative to capillary electrophoresis analysis, being less costly and cumbersome. In this study, we evaluated the performance of MT platform in IGH clonality assessment in a series of lymph node FNC samples.",Ellagic acid ameliorates cisplatin induced hepatotoxicity in colon carcinogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953405,Environmental toxicology,2019 06 04,"The clinical application of cisplatin (CP), one of the most extensively used antineoplastic drug, is restricted by its numerous side effects. CP's antitumor potential resides in the free generation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress. This stress is a source of the side effects associated with its use. Ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenol is known to possess multiple health benefits owing to its antioxidant properties. EA is largely metabolized by the colon microbiota of different mammals and therefore was a polyphenol of choice in the present study. The present study was thus carried out to explore the protective potential of EA on CP induced hepatotoxicity in colon tumor bearing mice. The administration of EA (10 mg/kg bwt po daily for 6 weeks) significantly ameliorated the toxicity caused by CP (5 mg/kg bwt ip once a week for 4 weeks). Activities of liver marker enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase were brought back to normal. EA cotreatment also led to a marked reduction in the extent of peroxidative damage to liver tissue as was evident from the improvement in the histopathological changes observed and FT-IR analysis. The present study, therefore, suggests that the administration of EA reduces the CP-induced hepatotoxicity, thereby emerging out as a potential candidate for chemopreventive action.",The role of glutamate receptors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: From physiology to disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953404,"American journal of medical genetics.

As the receptors of the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), glutamate receptors (GluRs) are strongly linked to normal brain functioning and pathological processes. Extensive investigations have been made about the structure, function, and regulation of GluR family, describing evidences that support the disruption of these mechanisms in mental disorders, including ADHD. In this review, we briefly described the family and function of GluRs in the CNS, and discussed what is recently known about the role of GluRs in ADHD, that including GluR genes, animal models, and the treatment, which would help us further elucidate the etiology of ADHD.",Effects of IGF-1 isoforms on muscle growth and sarcopenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953403,Aging cell,2019 06 10,"The decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength occurring in aging, referred as sarcopenia, is the result of many factors including an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation, changes in metabolic/hormonal status, and in circulating levels of inflammatory mediators. Thus, factors that increase muscle mass and promote anabolic pathways might be of therapeutic benefit to counteract sarcopenia. Among these, the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been implicated in many anabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. IGF-1 exists in different isoforms that might exert different role in skeletal muscle. Here we study the effects of two full propeptides IGF-1Ea and IGF-1Eb in skeletal muscle, with the aim to define whether and through which mechanisms their overexpression impacts muscle aging. We report that only IGF-1Ea expression promotes a pronounced hypertrophic phenotype in young mice, which is maintained in aged mice. Nevertheless, examination of aged transgenic mice revealed that the local expression of either IGF-1Ea or IGF-1Eb transgenes was protective against age-related loss of muscle mass and force. At molecular level, both isoforms activate the autophagy/lysosome system, normally altered during aging, and increase PGC1-α expression, modulating mitochondrial function, ROS detoxification, and the basal inflammatory state occurring at old age. Moreover, morphological integrity of neuromuscular junctions was maintained and preserved in both MLC/IGF-1Ea and MLC/IGF-1Eb mice during aging. These data suggest that IGF-1 is a promising therapeutic agent in staving off advancing muscle weakness.",Rutaecarpine prevents hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy involving the inhibition of Nox4-ROS-ADAM17 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953402,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019 06 10,"Rutaecarpine attenuates hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in the rats with abdominal artery constriction (AAC); however, its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Our previous study indicated that NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) promotes angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy through the pathway between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) in primary cardiomyocytes. This research aimed to determine whether the Nox4-ROS-ADAM17 pathway is involved in the protective action of rutaecarpine against hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. AAC-induced hypertensive rats were adopted to evaluate the role of rutaecarpine in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect gene expression. Rutaecarpine inhibited hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy in AAC-induced hypertensive rats. These findings were confirmed by the results of in vitro experiments that rutaecarpine significantly inhibited Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in primary cardiomyocytes. Likewise, rutaecarpine significantly suppressed the Nox4-ROS-ADAM17 pathway and over-activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway in the left ventricle of AAC-induced hypertensive rats and primary cardiomyocytes stimulated with Ang II. The inhibition of Nox4-ROS-ADAM17 pathway and over-activation of ERK1/2 might be associated with the beneficial role of rutaecarpine in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, thus providing additional evidence for preventing hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy with rutaecarpine.",The changing landscape of vestibular schwannoma diagnosis and management: A cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953401,The Laryngoscope,2019 04 06,"To assess the current state of the diagnosis and management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) as well as treatment trends, and to evaluate the role of treatment setting and various specialists in treatment plan."

The traditional treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy are not satisfactory because of severe side effects and/or relapse. Genetically engineered T-cell-based immunotherapy for malignant cancer shows promise in recent clinical trials. T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells targeting New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) have been employed in a number of clinical trials for late stage melanoma, synovial sarcoma, multiple myeloma and other malignancies. Owing to the significant efficacy and controllable side effect, NY-ESO-1 has been considered as one of the most ideal TCR-engineered T cell therapy (TCR-T) cell target for solid tumors, including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the incidence of NY-ESO-1 expression and its relationship with immunosuppressive microenvironment of NSCLC are largely unclear. In this study, we analyzed the expression of NY-ESO-1 and two key immune regulators, Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in 156 NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that NY-ESO-1 positive rate is 28.1% (44/156) and significantly higher in distal metastasis (P = 0.012) and late stage (P = 0.019) NSCLC patients. In addition, we found that NY-ESO-1 expression was positively associated with Foxp3 level but not IDO. These findings implied the potential role of NY-ESO-1 in tumor immune escape of NSCLC and indicated the requirement to remove Treg cells in TCR-T cell therapy for NSCLC patients.",Influence of surgical margin completeness on risk of local tumour recurrence in canine cutaneous and subcutaneous soft tissue sarcoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953384,Veterinary and comparative oncology,2019 06 03,"The present peer-reviewed veterinary literature contains conflicting information regarding the impact of surgical margin completeness on risk of local tumour recurrence in canine soft tissue sarcoma (STS). This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to answer the clinical question: ""Does obtaining microscopically tumour-free surgical margins reduce risk for local tumour recurrence in canine cutaneous and subcutaneous STS?"" A total of 486 citations were screened, 66 of which underwent full-text evaluation, with 10 studies representing 278 STS excisions ultimately included. Cumulatively, 16/164 (9.8%) of completely excised and 38/114 (33.3%) of incompletely excised STS recurred. Overall relative risk of 0.396 (95% confidence interval = 0.248-0.632) was calculated for local recurrence in STS excised with complete margins as compared to STS excised with incomplete margins. Risk of bias was judged to be low for all studies in terms of selection bias and detection bias but high for all studies in terms of performance bias and exclusion bias. The results of the present meta-analysis, coupled with the results of individual previous studies, strongly suggest that microscopically complete surgical margins confer a significantly reduced risk for local tumour recurrence in canine STS.

A series of experiments were therefore performed using artificial rainfall events in a greenhouse environment to assess the ecological implications of FWU in A. marina seedlings. One-hour artificial rainfall events resulted in an increased leaf water potential, a reversed sap flow, and a rapid diameter increment signifying a turgor-driven growth of up to 30.1 ± 5.4 μm. Furthermore, the application of an artificial rainfall event with deuterated water showed that the amount of water absorbed by the leaves and transported to the stem was directly and univocally correlated to the observed growth spurts. The observations in this process-based study show that FWU is an important water acquisition mechanism under certain circumstances and might be of ecological importance for the establishment of A. marina seedlings. Distribution of mangrove trees might hence be more significantly disturbed by climate change-driven changes in rainfall patterns than previously assumed.",A review: Nanofibrous scaffold in possible prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953379,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,2019 04 15,"Nanofibrous scaffolds have potential to improve coronary stent applications by promoting endothelial recovery on the stent surface and aids regeneration of cardiac tissues.

Herein, this study was conducted to explore the effect of SDF-1/CXCR4 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in MM cell adhesion-mediated chemoresistance. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to detect expressions of SDF-1α and IL-6 in MM patients and healthy controls. RPMI-8226 cells and isolated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were stimulated using recombinant SDF-1α and IL-6. Effect of cocultured BMSCs and RPMI-8226 cells on chemosensitivity and apoptosis of RPMI-8226 cells was analyzed. Effect of doxorubicin on the adhesion rate of RPMl-8226 cells to BMSCs was analyzed by calcitonin test. Effect of SDF-1α-induced upregulation of IL-6 on chemotherapeutic resistance and apoptosis of RPMI-8226 cells in adhesion state was analyzed. Cell adhesion model was treated with recombinant protein SDF-1α and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P13K) inhibitor Wortmarmin. The levels of P13K and protein kinase B (AKT) and its phosphorylation as well as the expression of IL-6 were analyzed. SDF-1α was positively correlated with IL-6. Recombinant human SDF-1α increased IL-6 expression and induced IL-6 secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner in BMSCs, which was inhibited by IL-6 and SDF-1α neutralizing antibodies. Coculture of MM cells with BMSCs increased the drug resistance and inhibited the apoptosis on MM cells. SDF-1α-induced IL-6 upregulation mediates chemoresistance and apoptosis of RPMI-8226 cells in adhesion state. SDF-1α may up-regulate the expression of IL-6 by activating the P13K/AKT signaling pathway. SDF-1/CXCR4 may up-regulate the expression of IL-6 through the activation of the P13K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby affecting the chemoresistance mediated by adhesion in MM cells.",Effects of sodium alginate-based coating pretreatment on drying characteristics and quality of heat pump dried scallop adductors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953363,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 11,"Drying efficiency and quality maintenance are the major concerns of both manufactures and consumers. Heat pump drying (HPD) is suitable for heat sensitive foodstuffs due to its ability to independently control the drying operation parameters. However, lower drying rate and energy efficiency in the later period of HPD are the bottlenecks that restrain its application. A novel approach using hydrocolloids as pretreatment coatings prior to drying was designed to solve these problems. The effects of sodium alginate (SA) coating, drying temperatures and air velocities on the drying characteristics and quality attributes of scallop adductors were evaluated.",miR-218-5p regulates skin and hair follicle development through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting SFRP2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953362,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 06,"The hair follicle is a complex biological system involved in a dynamic process governed by gene regulation. MicroRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. We demonstrated that the expression of miR-218-5p and SFRP2 showed the opposite relationship in catagen and telogen phases and that miR-218-5p promoted the growth of hair shafts. The luciferase reporter assays confirmed that SFRP2 is the direct target of miR-218-5p. The expression of miR-218-5p may decrease the expression of SFRP2, which activates the Wnt signaling pathway, including the regulation of downstream genes and β-catenin/T-cell-specific factor transcriptional activity. Moreover, miR-218-5p enhanced apoptosis, but inhibition of miR-218-5p decreased apoptosis and inhibited RAB-9 cell proliferation. In this study, we show that miR-218-5p positively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by targeting SFRP2 and acts as a dynamic governor during skin and hair follicle development.",Prosaposin is a biomarker of mesenchymal glioblastoma and regulates mesenchymal transition through the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953361,The Journal of pathology,2019 05 21,"Mesenchymal glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of GBM. Our previous study found that neurotrophic factor prosaposin (PSAP) is highly expressed and secreted in glioma and can promote the growth of glioma. The role of PSAP in mesenchymal GBM is still unclear. In this study, bioinformatic analysis, western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of PSAP in different GBM subtypes. Human glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells were studied in vitro and in vivo, revealing that mesenchymal GBM expressed and secreted the highest level of PSAP among four subtypes of GBM, and PSAP could promote GBM invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like processes in vivo and in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis and western blotting showed that PSAP mainly played a regulatory role in GBM invasion and EMT-like processes via the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. In conclusion, the overexpression and secretion of PSAP may be an important factor causing the high invasiveness of mesenchymal GBM. PSAP is therefore a potential target for the treatment of mesenchymal GBM. Copyright © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",The miR-27a-3p/USP25 axis participates in the pathogenesis of recurrent miscarriage by inhibiting trophoblast migration and invasion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953360,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 06,"Insufficient invasion ability of trophoblasts might be associated with the development of recurrent miscarriage (RM). Ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) can regulate the processes of invasion and migration in different types of cancer cells. However, the effect of USP25 on trophoblasts and its roles in the development of RM are unknown. In this study, we first analyzed the USP25 expression in placental villous tissues from RM patients, and then assessed the roles of USP25 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and migration of trophoblasts. Furthermore, bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the mechanism of microRNA on USP25 expression, and regulation of USP25 expression in trophoblasts was assessed following transfection with microRNA mimics or inhibitor. The results showed that the expression of USP25 in the placental villous tissues was downregulated in RM patients. Knockdown of USP25 suppressed the EMT process, the invasion and migration capability of trophoblast cells, while overexpression of USP25 exhibited opposite results. Mechanistically, miR-27a-3p could regulate USP25 expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of USP25 in trophoblasts. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results found the expression of miR-27a-3p were negatively related to USP25 in RM patients. MiR-27a-3p mimics inhibited but miR-27a-3p inhibitor enhanced the migration and invasion capability of trophoblasts. Furthermore, sh-USP25 counteracted the promotion of invasion and migration mediated by the miR-27a-3p inhibitor. Taken together, these data indicate that USP25 downregulation by miR-27a-3p contributes to the EMT process, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of trophoblast cells, and these findings might provide potential biomarkers for RM.",A study on the protective effects of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide-induced mucosal immunity against lung injury in a mouse acute respiratory distress syndrome model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953359,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 17,"This study aims to determine the feasibility of using oligodeoxynucleotides with unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sequences (CpG ODN) as an immunity protection strategy for a mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is a prospective laboratory animal investigation. Twenty-week-old BALB/c mice in Animal research laboratory were randomized into groups. An ARDS model was induced in mice using lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). CpG ODN was intranasally and transrectally immunized before or after the 3rd and 7th days of establishing the ARDS model. Mice were euthanized on Day 7 after the second immunization. Then, retroorbital bleeding was carried out and the chest was rapidly opened to collect the trachea and tissues from both lungs for testing. CpG ODN significantly improved the pathologic impairment in mice lung, especially after the intranasal administration of 50 μg. This resulted in the least severe lung tissue injury. Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 concentrations were lower, which was second to mice treated with the rectal administration of 20 µg CpG ODN. In contrast, the nasal and rectal administration of CpG ODN in BALB/c mice before LPS immunization did not appear to exhibit any significant protective effects. The intranasal administration of CpG ODN may be a potential treatment approach to ARDS. More studies are needed to further determine the protective mechanism of CpG ODN.",Traumatic stress and the autonomic brain-gut connection in development: Polyvagal Theory as an integrative framework for psychosocial and gastrointestinal pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953358,Developmental psychobiology,2019 04 06,"A range of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder frequently co-occur with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Risk of these pathologies is particularly high in those with a history of trauma, abuse, and chronic stress. These scientific findings and rising awareness within the healthcare profession give rise to a need for an integrative framework to understand the developmental mechanisms that give rise to these observations. In this paper, we introduce a plausible explanatory framework, based on the Polyvagal Theory (Porges, Psychophysiology, 32, 301-318, 1995; Porges, International Journal of Psychophysiology, 42, 123-146, 2001; Porges, Biological Psychology, 74, 116-143, 2007), which describes how evolution impacted the structure and function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The Polyvagal Theory provides organizing principles for understanding the development of adaptive diversity in homeostatic, threat-response, and psychosocial functions that contribute to pathology. Using these principles, we outline possible mechanisms that promote and maintain socioemotional and GI dysfunction and review their implications for therapeutic targets.",AIM2 promotes non-small-cell lung cancer cell growth through inflammasome-dependent pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953357,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 06,"The human absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is considered as a DNA recognizer.

Besides, AIM2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of cell proliferation was triggered by the accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase. Knockdown of AIM2 reduced the inflammasome formation, while overexpression of AIM2 or stimulation by poly(dA:dT) induced the inflammasome formation. Interestingly, blockade of the inflammasome by caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 or ASC small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the effects brought by AIM2 shRNA and AIM2 plasmid.

In the present study, we downloaded several microarray analyses results from GEO attempting to identify miRNAs and possible downstream targets that may be involved in TGF-β1 function in CFs and to detect the cellular and molecular functions of the identified miRNA-mRNA axis. Here, we identified miR-675 as a downregulated miRNA by TGFβ1 by bioinformatics analyses and experimental verification. Upon TGFβ1 stimulation, the protein levels of Α-SMAΑ-SMA, collagen I, and POSTN, and the secreted collagen in the cell culture supernatant significantly increased, whereas the miR-675 expression decreased. Smads mediate TGFβ1-induced suppression on miR-675 via binding miR-675 promoter region. miR-675 overexpression could inhibit, whereas miR-675 inhibition could enhance TGFβ1-induced mouse CFs (MCF) remodeling and proliferation. TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβR1), a critical receptor in TGFβ1/Smad signaling, is a direct downstream target of miR-675. TGFβR1 overexpression significantly reverses the effect of miR-675 overexpression on MCF remodeling and proliferation. In summary, miR-675 targets TGFβR1 to attenuate TGFβ1-induced MCF remodeling and proliferation. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of the Smads/miR-675/TGFβR1 axis modulating TGFβ1-induced MCF remodeling and proliferation."

We used a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group as a reporter group for 1 H NMR study of conformational changes in proteins, utilizing high-intensity 1 H NMR signals near 0 p.p.m. The β2 -adrenergic receptor was labeled with TMS groups at two cysteines located at the cytoplasmic ends of helices VI and VII. Binding of various ligands led to changes in 1 H NMR signals, which manifested that helix VI is sensitive to G protein-specific activation, whereas helix VII is sensitive to β-arrestin-specific activation. Thus, the TMS group is a useful reporter group in NMR for studying conformational changes in membrane proteins such as GPCRs.","Improved structure-stability and packaging characters of crosslinked collagen fiber-based film with casein, keratin and SPI.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953342,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 05 16,"To improve the structure-stability and packing characters of collagen fiber, we manufactured crosslinked collagen fiber (CColF)-based edible films using transglutaminase (TGase).

Forty mature male albino rats were divided into two equal groups (n = 20/each). The first group received 1 ml saline solution intraperitoneally (i.p.). The second group received single i.p. injection of 75 μg 50 nm AuNRs/kg/bwt. Five rats from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post treatment and blood samples were collected for hormonal and biochemical analysis. Testes were collected from each group at each time point for histopathology, morphometric, and transmission electron microscope analyses of testis and epididymis. Results indicated that i.p. injection of AuNRs did not produce any histopathological changes. Morphometric analysis of testicular samples revealed that the height of lining epithelium was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in AuNR group on days 3 and 14 post treatment, and the minor axis of seminiferous tubules was higher (P < 0.05) in AuNR-injected rats than in control group. For the epididymis, the number of spermatozoa was significantly (P < 0.05) higher on days 7 and 14 after AuNR injection when compared with control rats. AuNRs were not detected by TEM at all time points of the experiment. Serum analysis demonstrated that total and free testosterone values significantly (P < 0.05) increased on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 post AuNR injection.

In this study, porous and oxygen-doped carbon nitride (CN-MC) was synthesized via supramolecular preassembly technology using melamine and cyanuric chloride. The carbon nitride catalyst produced via this technology has a relatively high surface area (63.2 m2 g-1), irregular pores, and oxygen doping characteristics, which enhance the light capture capacity, increase the number of reactive sites, and accelerate electron-hole separation efficiency. Thus, the CN-MC exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity during the degradation of organic pollutants Rhodamine B (RhB, 95% removal within 6 h) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl, 70% removal within 6 h) under low-intensity light (the light intensity = 0.8~1.8 mW cm-2 with a wavelength range of 300-700 nm). Mechanistic analysis showed that ·O2- and ·OH were the dominant active free radicals during RhB and TC-HCl photocatalytic degradation over CN-MC. The proposed synthesis strategy effectively improves the photocatalytic activity of graphite carbon nitride under weak light by producing a porous morphology and oxygen atom doping.","Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis of GLPG1690, an Autotaxin Inhibitor, in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953319,Clinical pharmacokinetics,2019 04 06,GLPG1690 is an autotaxin inhibitor in development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Among these, miRNA PC-5P-12969 was exclusively expressed in the IS condition; otherwise, it was not expressed in normal condition, and therefore, we focused on miRNA PC-5P-12969 for further studies.

With the increasing geriatric population, the situation of clinicians seeing more and more elderly epilepsy patients is very likely. Not only is the diagnosis of epilepsy tedious in the elderly, its management raises many challenging issues for the treating physicians. Altered physiology, age-related decline in organ function, and plasma protein binding and altered pharmacodynamics make the elderly patients with seizure disorder a difficult group to treat. This is further complicated by the presence of comorbidities and polypharmacy which increase the chances of drug interactions. The adverse effects that might be tolerated well in younger populations may be disastrous for the aged. Although the newer antiepileptic drugs are found to have a favorable safety profile, there is relative scarcity of randomized-controlled trials involving older and newer antiepileptics in the geriatric population. This review tries to compile the available literature on management of epilepsy in the elderly population including evidence of safety and efficacy of newer and older antiepileptics with special reference to the 'geriatric giants'. It also deals with the interactions between antiepileptic medications and other commonly prescribed drugs in the elderly such as anti-hypertensives and antiischemic agents.

The results showed that miRNA-H4-5p could reverse apoptosis induced by actinomycin D (Act-D) and promote cell cycle progression, but miRNA-H4-3p had no such obvious functions. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase report assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting demonstrated that miRNA-H4-5p could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2 (CDKL2) to negatively regulate their expression.

Several studies have shown that the non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (NI-EFVPC) exhibits poor histopathologic diagnostic reproducibility and have been over-treated as conventional thyroid cancer. In 2015, an international thyroid working group re-evaluated NI-EFVPC and its diagnostic criteria. The new terminology of ""noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features"" (NIFTP) was accordingly introduced to replace NI-EFVPC. The literature has emphasized that NIFTPs are biologically similar to follicular adenomas lacking lymph node metastases and/or recurrence. While the definition of NIFTP is based on specific morphological parameters, recent studies have questioned whether the criterion allowing less than 1% of true papillae should be revised to a total absence of papillae. The motivation for this revision is the rare finding, in some studies, of lymph nodes with metastatic NIFTP. This review evaluates the existing published series of NIFTP cases, clinical consequences of NIFTP, and emerging changes in the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. The introduction of NIFTP has resulted in significant impact on the clinical management of thyroid nodules. Recent revisions in the morphological criteria for NIFTP emphasize the need to adhere to very stringent histomorphologic criteria when making a diagnosis of NIFTP. The adoption of NIFTP terminology instead of NI-EFVPC is associated with conservative lobectomy without radioactive iodine treatment in the majority of cases.",Automated Framework for Screening of Glaucoma Through Cloud Computing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953288,Journal of medical systems,2019 05 02,"In recent times, the use of computer aided diagnosis for detection of Glaucoma from fundus images has been prevalent. In the proposed work, a cloud based system is proposed for automatic and real-time screening of Glaucoma with the use of automatic image processing techniques. The proposed system offers scalability to the developers and easy accessibility to the consumers. The proposed system is device and location independent. The input digital image is analyzed and a comprehensive diagnostic report is generated consisting of detailed analysis of indicative medical parameters like optic-cup-to-disc ratio, optic neuro-retinal rim, ISNT rules making the report informative and clinically significant. With recent advances in the field of communication technologies, the internet facilities are available that make the proposed system an efficient and economical method for initial screening and offer preventive and diagnostic steps in early disease intervention and management. The proposed system can perform an initial screening test in an average time of 6 s on high resolution fundus images. The proposed system has been tested on a fundus database and an average sensitivity of 93.7% has been achieved for Glaucoma cases. In places where there is scarcity of trained ophthalmologists and lack of awareness of such diseases, the cloud based system can be used as an effective diagnostic assistive tool.",Rural Residents' Depressive Symptoms and Help-Seeking Preferences: Opportunities for Church-Based Intervention Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953285,Journal of religion and health,2019 04 06,"This study examines rural residents' depressive symptoms, helps seeking preferences and perceptions of a church-based group depression intervention, informing feasibility of adapting evidence-based treatment for delivery in rural churches. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 100 members of 2 churches in a rural Midwestern community; 63 congregants responded. Depression was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Descriptive analyses were performed, and 12.9% of respondents screened positive for depression. Another 25% reported mild symptomatology. Respondents preferred informal help seeking, although reported more openness to formal providers to address others' depression. Results suggest receptivity to church-based treatment. Almost two-third of respondents reported they would consider attending a church-based group depression intervention, 80% would recommend it to a friend in need, and 60% indicated it would benefit their community. Delivering evidence-based depression treatment within church settings may provide a viable option for increasing access to care in this rural community."

Objectives The primary objective was to categorize direct patient care activities and drug therapy recommendations. The secondary objectives were to categorize recommendations based on drug class and to determine the proportion of recommendations associated with Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) high-alert medications. Methods This retrospective, single-center, chart review was conducted in an academic ED with 65,000 annual visits. EM pharmacists documented direct patient care activities in the electronic health record. Documented activities from 1/1/2015 through 3/31/2015 were abstracted electronically for analysis by a trained reviewer. Results There were 3567 interventions and direct patient care activities documented. The most common activities were facilitation of medication histories (n = 1300) and drug therapy recommendations (n = 1165). Of 1165 drug therapy recommendations, 986 were linked to a drug class such as antimicrobial agents (31.9%), cardiovascular agents (16.6%), and analgesic agents (13.2%) and 20% of these interventions were associated with ISMP high-alert medications. Conclusion EM pharmacists documented several types of direct patient care activities with the majority being drug therapy recommendations and medication histories.",Risk factors of positive surgical margins after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in high-volume center: results in 732 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953271,Journal of robotic surgery,2019 04 06,"The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical, pathological and peri-operative factors associated with the risk of positive surgical margins (PSM) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in a high-volume center. The study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We excluded cases who were under androgen deprivation or had prior treatments. The population included negative cases (control group) and PSM subjects (study groups). The logistic regression model assessed the independent association of factors with the risk of PSM. From January 2013 to December 2017, 732 patients underwent RARP. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 342 cases (46.7%). Overall, 192 cases (26.3%) had PSM. Independent factors associated with the risk of focal PSM were body mass index (odds ratio, OR = 0.936; p = 0.021), percentage of biopsy-positive cores (BPC; OR = 1.012; p = 0.004), pathological extracapsular extension (OR = 2.702; p < 0.0001), seminal vesicle invasion (OR = 2.889; p < 0.0001) and high-volume surgeon (OR = 0.607; p = 0.006). In high-volume centers, features related to host, tumor biology and surgeon are independent factors associated with the risk of PSM after RARP, which are decreased by the high-volume surgeon. The inverse association between BMI and PSM risk needs further clinical research. These issues should be discussed when counseling patients.",Senhance 3-mm robot-assisted surgery: experience on first 14 patients in France.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953270,Journal of robotic surgery,2019 04 06,"The objective of this article is to present our experience with the 3-mm instruments using the Senhance surgical robotic system in gynecological and abdominal surgery from July to December 2017 by a retrospective observational study. All patients who underwent a robot-assisted 3-mm laparoscopic procedure with the Senhance surgical robotic system were enrolled. Two separate populations were involved: nine female gynecological patients and five digestive surgery patients. Five cholecystectomies, three annexectomies, four ovarian cystectomies, one myomectomy and one endometriotic nodule resection were performed. For the gynecological cases, the median time spent at the console was 37 min (12-77), while the total duration of the intervention was 81.33 min. All the interventions were performed on an outpatient basis. There were no postoperative complications. The average visual analog scale for pain (VAS) was 2.11 (± 1.91) on D0. For the abdominal surgery cases, the median time was 39 min (21-64). The average total duration of the intervention was 87.4 min (± 36.82). One of the five interventions was performed on an outpatient basis. There was one laparoscopy conversion. No postoperative complications in the 2 weeks following the operation. There are few 3-mm instruments available with the Senhance surgical robotic system, which limits the number of interventions. However, it is possible to perform gynecological interventions with 3-mm instruments on an outpatient basis in complete safety. It is possible to perform cholecystectomies by pairing the use of 3-mm and 5-mm instruments. The recent arrival of new 3-mm instruments will enable a wider range of surgical indications.",Gene expression profiles between cystic and solid vestibular schwannoma indicate susceptible molecules and pathways in the cystic formation of vestibular schwannoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953268,Functional & integrative genomics,2019 06 15,"Previous research has shown that although NF2 gene mutation is the major cause of vestibular schwannoma (VS), it may not directly participate in cystic VS (CVS). To elucidate the underlying potential genetic mechanisms in the cystic formation of VS, we compared differences in gene expression between solid VS (SVS) and CVS via a bioinformatics analysis. The cDNA microarray method and miRNA sequencing were performed on 29 representative VSs (17 CVSs and 12 SVSs). A differential expression analysis was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). Then, miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed. Gene ontology (GO), a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) were used to analyze the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs at the functional level. From the differential expression analyses, 1304 DEmRNAs, 55 DEmiRNAs, and hub genes including PTEN, FOXO1, FOXO3, VEGFA, and SIRT1 were identified. Histological evidence is presented to confirm the makeup of the hubs, which corresponded with the cDNA microarray. Our analysis revealed that the maps of apoptosis, cellular response to hypoxia, and the PI3K-Akt, AMPK, FOXO, and chemokine signaling pathways were significantly enriched. In addition, the TUNEL assay, immunoblotting analysis, and transmission electron microscope revealed increased degenerative changes in CVS. These findings could be the foundation for understanding the potential role of differential genes in the cystic formation of VS and be helpful in exploring the potential biomarkers for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and development of drug targets for CVS.",Recyclable and Flexible Starch-Ag Networks and Its Application in Joint Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953267,Nanoscale research letters,2019 04 24,"Flexible transparent conductive electrodes are essential component for flexible optoelectronic devices and have been extensively studied in recent years, while most of the researches are focusing on the electrode itself, few topics in material green and recyclability.

Research on PREVENT's impact in healthcare is scant, especially on the lived experiences of staff. This study examined individual interviews with 16 critical National Health Service (NHS) professionals who participated in mandatory PREVENT counter-radicalisation training, half of whom are Muslims. Results reveal two themes underlying the self-censorship healthcare staff. The first theme is fear, which critical NHS staff experienced as a result of the political and moral subscript underlying PREVENT training: the 'good' position is to accept the PREVENT duty, and the 'bad' position is to reject it. This fear is experienced more acutely by British Muslim healthcare staff. The second theme relates to the structures which extend beyond PREVENT but nonetheless contribute to self-censorship: distrustful settings in which the gaze of unknown colleagues stifles personal expression; reluctant trainers who admit PREVENT may be unethical but nonetheless relinquish responsibility from the act of training; and socio-political conditions affecting the NHS which overwhelm staff with other concerns.

This review focuses on methods that have been used to measure and value informal care time and makes suggestions for their appropriate use in cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness analyses. It highlights the importance of methods to value informal care time that are independent of caregiver health effects in order to minimize double counting of spillover effects. Although the concept of including caregiver time costs in economic evaluations is not new, relatively few societal perspective cost-effectiveness analyses have included informal care, with the exception of dementia. This is due in part to challenges in measuring and valuing time costs. Analysts can collect information on time spent in informal care or can assess its impact in displacing other time use, notably time in paid employment. A key challenge is to ensure appropriate comparison groups that do not require informal care to be able to correctly estimate attributable informal care time or foregone market work. To value informal care time, analysts can use estimates of hourly earnings in either opportunity cost or replacement cost approaches. Researchers have used widely varying estimates of hourly earnings. Alternatively, stated-preference methods (i.e. contingent valuation, conjoint analysis) can be used to value the effect of informal care on utility, but this can entail double counting with health effects. Lack of consensus and standardization of methods makes it difficult to compare estimates of informal care costs.",Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in a patient with left-sided gallbladder: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953262,Surgical case reports,2019 04 24,"Left-sided gallbladder is a relatively rare anatomical variation that is frequently associated with a biliary system anomaly.

Enterobacteriaceae in stool specimens was associated with a higher risk of bloodstream infection, and Candida in stool specimens was related to a higher risk of platelet engraftment failure. The cumulative incidence of infection-related mortality 1 year after haplo-HSCT in the PSC group was higher than that of the patients who showed persistently negative stool cultures (NSC group; 19.2% vs. 8.9%, P = 0.017). The probabilities of overall survival (71.4% vs. 83.8%, P = 0.031) and disease-free survival (69.6% vs. 81.0%, P = 0.048) 1 year after haplo-HSCT for the PSC group were significantly lower than those for the NSC group, particularly for patients who had Candida in their stool specimens. In multivariate analysis, Candida in stool specimens significantly increased the risk of mortality and was associated with poorer survival. Our results showed that PSC influenced the clinical outcomes after haplo-HSCT, particularly those who had Candida in their stool specimens."

Why does the use of religious language in such cases almost always arise on the side of patients and their families, rather than on the side of clinicians or others who work in healthcare settings? I suggest that the intractable disputes arise when patients and their families use religious language to frame their problem and the possibilities of solution. Unlike clinicians, they are not bilingual and thus lack the capacity to understand and negotiate differences in terms that are responsive to those who work in healthcare settings. After considering a representative case, I explore whether an ethics consultant or chaplain can function as a translator and suggest that, at best, such efforts at mediation depend on contingent aspects of a case and will only be partially successful. To appreciate limits on the role for bilingual translators, I consider a futility dispute where a parent using religious language demands that everything be done for a permanently unconscious child. I challenge the traditional interpretation that says the parent values ""mere duration of biological life irrespective of quality."" From a religious perspective, human life is never ""merely biological."" This effort to slot the dispute into standard philosophical schemas misses what is crucial in the dispute. I suggest that a better interpretation views the dispute at a meta-level as one about whether withholding and withdrawing care is morally distinguishable from killing. Curiously, this interpretation makes the advocate of futile care into an ally of those ""quality of life"" advocates who also challenge this distinction. The crux of their dispute now rests on the normative ethics of killing. While I think my interpretation comes much closer to the views of many who demand 'futile care,' I suggest that it still falls short because of the way it reconstructs the religious concerns in nonreligious terms. I close by considering an analogy between the language of suffering and the language of faith, suggesting that both require a much richer understanding of the narratives that orient the lives of patients and their families.",Correction to: Chronic prescribed burning alters nutrient deposition and sediment stoichiometry in a lake ecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953248,Ambio,2019 05 16,"The publication contained a dating model that was based on AD/BC dates instead of years before present (YBP) dates for the three C14 AMS values.

To deal with this problem, we used a graph representation including all possible single nucleotide point mutations occurring in codons, which are building blocks of every protein-coding sequence. Following graph theory, the quality of a given code model is measured using the set conductance property which has a useful biological interpretation. Taking this approach, we found the most robust genetic code structures for a given number of coding blocks. In addition, we tested several properties of genetic code models generated by the binary dichotomic algorithms (BDA) and compared them with randomly generated genetic code models. The results indicate that BDA-generated models possess better properties in terms of the conductance measure than the majority of randomly generated genetic code models and, even more, that BDA-models can achieve the best possible conductance values. Therefore, BDA-generated models are very robust towards changes in encoded information generated by single nucleotide substitutions.",Image-Based Flow Simulations of Pre- and Post-left Atrial Appendage Closure in the Left Atrium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953246,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,2019 05 21,"For patients with atrial fibrillation, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is often the site of thrombus formation due to low atrial ejection fraction that triggers strokes and other thromboembolic events. Recently introduced percutaneous LAA occlusion procedure is known to reduce LAA-induced strokes. Despite having the procedure, there are still 11% of the patients who continue to suffer from future strokes or transient ischemic attacks, not accounting for the procedural related complications. The high failure rate is largely due to the variabilities in LAA's shape, size, and contractility which may result in ineffectiveness of this procedure. To correctly identify the candidates and evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure, we rely on patient-specific CT scans which provides the exact LA and LAA geometries and predictive hemodynamic analysis to assist in evaluating quantitative flow parameters pre- and post-LAA occlusion procedures. Hemodynamic parameters are critical to predict adverse hemodynamic flow patterns in LAA as well as the effectiveness of LAA closure in individual patient. The aim of this paper is to establish an image-based patient-specific computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation framework specific to the prediction of treatment outcomes of LAA closure with atrial fibrillation. This framework utilizes automated LA/LAA image segmentation which yields significant reduction in image processing.

Nevertheless, highly outcross nature and flowering once in decades impose severe limitation in its propagation. Identification and mixed cultivation of genetically diverse genotypes may assist successful breeding and natural recombination of desirable traits. Characterization of existing genetic diversity and population structure are indispensable for efficient implementation of such strategies, which is facing a major challenge due to non-availability of sequence-based markers for the species. In this study, 8121 EST-SSR markers were mined from D. hamiltonii transcriptome data. Among all, tri-repeats were most represented (52%), with the abundance of CCG/CGG repeat motif. A set of 114 polymorphic markers encompassing epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, signaling, and cell wall biogenesis, detected polymorphism and interaction (in silico) with important genes, that might have role in bamboo growth and development. Genetic diversity and population structure of the three D. hamiltonii populations (72 individuals) revealed moderate to high-level genetic diversity (mean alleles per locus: 5.8; mean PIC: 0.44) using neutral EST-SSR markers. AMOVA analysis suggests maximum diversity (59%) exists within population. High genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.338) and low gene flow (Nm = 0.49) were evident among populations. Further, PCoA, dendrogram, and Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis clustered three populations into two major groups based on geographical separations.

Its residents are distinctive, however, for their concerted actions in the face of environmental problems and the presence of defenders of a prehispanic worldview based on the protection of nature. This article addresses the health impacts of an integrated environmental health promotion strategy implemented through a participatory action research intervention based on qualitative and quantitative methods. Different actors, sectors, dimensions, and knowledge types were harmonized in a collaborative space created specifically for our interdisciplinary research team, community residents and local authorities.

In the aim to relieve pain, total disc replacement (TDR) is a valuable surgical treatment option, but the expected benefit strongly depends on the prosthesis itself. The present contribution is focused on the synthetic mimic of the native IVD in the aim to optimally restore its functional anatomy and biomechanics, and especially its time-dependency. Semi-crystalline polyethylene (PE) materials covering a wide spectrum of the crystallinity are used to propose new designs of TDR. The influence of the crystallinity on various features of the time-dependent mechanical response of the PE materials is reported over a large strain range by means of dynamic mechanical thermo-analysis and video-controlled tensile mechanical tests. The connection of the stiffness and the yield strength with the microstructure is reported in the aim to propose a model predicting the crystallinity dependency of the response variation with the frequency. New designs of TDR are proposed and implemented into an accurate computational model of a cervical spine segment in order to simulate the biomechanical response under physiological conditions. Predicted in-silico motions are found in excellent agreement with experimental data extracted from published in-vitro studies under compression and different neck movements, namely, rotation, flexion/extension and lateral bending. The simulation results are also criticized by analyzing the local stresses and the predicted biomechanical responses provided by the different prosthetic solutions in terms of time-dependency manifested by the hysteretic behavior under a cyclic movement and the frequency effect.",A prospective randomized comparison of airway seal using the novel vision-guided insertion of LMA-Supreme® and LMA-Protector®.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953222,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 04 06,"The laryngeal mask airways supreme (LMA-Supreme™) and protector (LMA-Protector™) are generally placed blindly, often resulting in a less than optimal position and vision-guided placement has been recommended. This prospective, randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of airway seal by measuring the oropharyngeal leak pressure in 100 surgical patients who underwent a variety of non-thoracic surgery under general anaesthesia, suitable with a supraglottic airway device. Patients were allocated to either the LMA-Supreme (n = 50) or LMA-Protector (n = 50) group. All insertions were performed under vision of a videolaryngoscope using an 'insert-detect-correct-as-you-go' technique with standardized corrective measures. Our primary endpoint, mean oropharyngeal leak pressure, was significantly higher in the LMA-Protector (31.7 ± 2.9 cm H2O) compared to the LMA-Supreme (27.7 ± 3.5 cm H2O) group (mean difference 4.0 cm H2O, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-5.3 cm H2O, p < 0.001) after achieving a near-optimal fibreoptic position in the LMA-Protector (94%) and LMA-Supreme (96%) groups. No statistically significant differences were shown for secondary outcomes of alignment, number of insertion attempts and malpositions, and final anatomical position as scored by fibreoptic evaluation. Corrective manoeuvres were required in virtually all patients to obtain a correct anatomically positioned LMA. Position outcomes of the two devices were similar except for the proportion of procedures with folds in the proximal cuff (90% LMA-Supreme vs. 2% LMA-Protector, p < 0.001), the need for intracuff pressure adjustments (80% LMA-Supreme vs. 48% LMA-Protector, p = 0.001) and size correction (18% LMA-Supreme vs. 4% LMA-Protector, p = 0.025). In conclusion, a higher oropharyngeal leak pressure can be achieved with LMA-Protector compared to LMA-Supreme with optimal anatomical position when insertion is vision-guided.",A simplified quantitative acid-base approach for patients with acute respiratory diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953221,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 04 06,"The Stewart-Figge acid-base model has been criticized for being mathematically complex. We aimed to develop simpler formalisms, which can be used at the bedside. The following simplifications were used: (1) [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] are replaced by their mid-reference concentrations (2) pH is set to 7.4. In the new model [SIDa] is replaced by its adjusted form, [SIDa, adj] = [Na+] + [K+] - [Cl-] + 6.5 and [SIG] is replaced by ""bicarbonate gap"", [BICgap] = [SIDa, adj] - (0.28⋅[Albumin]) - (1.82⋅[Phosphatei])- [HCO3̄]. The diagnostic performance of the model was tested in 210 patients with acute respiratory diseases and 17 healthy volunteers. [BICgap] was also compared to albumin-corrected anion gap ([AGc]). The concordant correlation coefficient between [SIDa, adj] and [SIDa] and between [BICgap] and [SIG] was 0.98 in both comparisons. The mean bias (limits of agreement) of [SIDa, adj] - [SIDa] and of [BICgap] - [SIG] were 0.53 meq/l (- 0.46 to 1.53) and 0.50 meq/l (- 0.70 to 1.70), respectively. A [SIDa, adj] < 50.4 meq/l had an accuracy of 0.995 (p < 0.001) for the diagnosis of strong ion (SI) acidosis, while a [SIDa, adj] > 52.5 meq/l had an accuracy of 0.997 (p < 0.001) for the diagnosis of SI alkalosis. A [BICgap] > 11.6 meq/l predicted unmeasured ion (UI) acidosis with an accuracy of 0.997 (p < 0.001), while an [AGc] > 19.88 meq/l predicted UI acidosis with an accuracy of 0.994 (p < 0.001).

A deficiency of conventional IRE is that the ablation zone is relatively small, bounded by the irreversible electroporation isoelectric field margin. In the previous studies we have introduced a new treatment protocol that combines few short high voltage (SHV) pulses with long low-voltage (LLV) pulses. In the previous studies, we also have shown that the addition of few SHV pulses increases by almost a factor of two the area ablated by a protocol that employs only the LLV pulses. This study employs potato and gel phantom to generate a plausible explanation for the mechanism. The study provides circumstantial evidence that the mechanism involved is the production of electrolytic compounds by the LLV pulse sequence, which causes tissue ablation beyond the margin of the irreversible electroporation isoelectric field generated by the SHV pulses, presumable to the reversible electroporation isoelectric field margin generated by the SHV pulses.","Total mercury, chromium, nickel and other trace chemical element contents in soils at an old cinnabar mine site (Merník, Slovakia): anthropogenic versus natural sources of soil contamination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953219,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 17,"The aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence and distribution of total mercury (Hg) and other trace elements of environmental concern, such as arsenic (As), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and vanadium (V), in soils from the abandoned Merník cinnabar mine in eastern Slovakia. For this purpose, thirty soil samples from two depth intervals within the mine area (n = 60 soil samples) and additional sixteen soil samples from adjacent areas (n = 25 soil samples) were collected. Total Hg was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry, while As and other metals were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. High mercury concentrations (> 100 mg/kg with a maximum of 951 mg/kg) were observed only in surface soils close to mine waste heaps and adits. Otherwise, Hg concentrations in the majority of surface soils were lower (0.14-19.7 mg/kg), however, higher than Hg in soils collected from sites outside the mine area (0.19-6.92 mg/kg) and even considerably higher than Hg in soils at sites not influenced by the Merník mine. Elevated Cr and Ni concentrations in soils regardless of their sampling sites (mean of 276 mg/kg and median of 132 mg/kg for Cr and 168 mg/kg and 81 mg/kg for Ni, respectively) were attributed to the lithology of the area; the soils are underlain by the sediments of the Central Carpathian Palaeogene, containing a detritus of ultrabasic rocks. As our geochemical data are compositional in nature, they were further treated by compositional data analysis (CoDA). Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) applied on centred (clr) log-ratio-transformed data and correlation analysis of compositional parts based on symmetric balances distinguished very well different sources of origin for the chemical elements. The following three element associations were identified: Hg association with the main source in mining/roasting, Cr-Ni association derived from bedrock and As-Cu-Mn-Pb-Zn-V association (natural background and minor sulphides/sulfosalts in mineralized rocks). The values of geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor suggested that concentrations of Hg in the soils were influenced by human industrial activities.",Effect of head-group size of some tetradecylalkylammonium bromide surfactants on obtaining the lyotropic biaxial nematic phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953218,"The European physical journal. E, Soft matter",2019 04 09,"Lyotropic quaternary mixtures of some tetradecylalkylammonium bromide surfactants were prepared to examine the effect of the size of the surfactant head group on the stabilization of different lyotropic nematic phases. The lyotropic mixtures were prepared by the addition of the tetradecylalkylammonium bromides (TTAABr) in the mixture of NaBr/decanol (DeOH)/water. The uniaxial to biaxial nematic phase transitions were determined via laser conoscopy. Some micellization parameters such as critical micelle concentration, degree of counterion binding and micellization Gibbs energy were evaluated from the electrical conductivity measurements of diluted binary surfactants/water solutions. The results indicate that the head-group size of the surfactant molecules influences the amphiphilic molecular aggregate topology. Moreover, the effective area per surfactant head group is a key parameter on stabilizing the lyotropic biaxial nematic phase.",Determining preventable acute care spending among high-cost patients in a single-payer public health care system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953217,The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,2019 04 06,Research has shown that a small proportion of patients account for the majority of health care spending.

Additionally, BLASTn searches indicated the CoVCV genome sequence is most similar to the grapevine vein clearing virus (GVCV) genome (72% identity and 46% query coverage). Moreover, the polyprotein encoded in CoVCV ORF3 is most similar to the corresponding protein of GVCV, with 60% amino acid sequence identity (89% query coverage).

In this study, 28 B. dothidea strains isolated from pear trunk samples showing stem wart or canker symptoms were used to detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses. The dsRNA bands with the size of ~ 1.0 to ~ 6.0 kbp were examined from ten strains. Here, we reported a novel dsRNA mycovirus, tentatively named as Botryosphaeria dothidea victorivirus 2 (BdVV2), isolated from the B. dothidea strain MSD53. BdVV2 contained spherical virions that were ~ 38 nm in diameter consisting of a single linear dsRNA genome of 5,090 bp in length. The BdVV2 genome contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a putative coat protein (CP) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which shared significant amino acid identities of 68% and 60% with the corresponding proteins of Sphaeropsis sapinea RNA viruses 1 (SsRV1). Phylogenetic analyses based on the aa sequences of CP and RdRp both showed that BdVV2 was phylogenetically related to the members of the genus Victorivirus in the family Totiviridae.

However, C-strain has relatively low growth rate in cell cultures, thus affecting productivity of the vaccine for the industry. In this study, eight amino acid residues were mutated on the C-strain backbone, resulting in a cell-adapted strain Cmut8. The mutant strain exhibited rapid growth with titer of about 100 fold higher than its parental C-strain. The mutation sites located at structural proteins Erns and E2 contributed more to cell adaptation than those located in non-structural proteins. Sera collected from pigs inoculated with Cmut8 and C-strain at the same dose showed similar antibody levels and neutralization titers. Pigs inoculated with different doses of Cmut8 (low, medium and high) and with C-strain offered full protection against challenge with a virulent strain, shown as absence of fever and other symptoms, marginal low levels of viral load, and no obvious gross pathological changes in major organs. Unvaccinated control pigs challenged with the virulent strain showed high fever from day 2 post-challenge and apparent clinical symptoms with two deaths. Viral load were markedly elevated in these control pigs after challenge. The pigs inoculated with high dose of Cmut8 did not show fever or other typical CSF symptoms, and no apparent pathological changes were observed in major organs. Besides, the Cmut8 strain did not induce typical fever response in rabbits. These results demonstrate that the cell-adapted Cmut8 strain remains non-pathogenic to the weaned pigs, provides full protection and could be a good candidate vaccine strain for improved yield at lower cost.",Healthcare spending and utilization following antireflux surgery: examining costs and reasons for readmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953200,Surgical endoscopy,2019 04 06,"While clinical outcomes have been reported for anti-reflux surgery (ARS), there are limited data on post-operative encounters, including readmission, and their associated costs.

Although numerous studies have focused on the C. oleifera shell, few studies have examined its biological characteristics, particularly its internal mesoporosity. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microscopic biological structure of C. oleifera shells to explore their potential applications. Paraffin-embedded slices of C. oleifera shells were observed on different planes using an optical microscope. Supercritically dried samples were prepared and assessed using the nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique to reveal mesopore structural features. The present article shows that C. oleifera shells were mainly made up of stone cells, parenchyma tissue, spiral vessels, and vascular bundles. The key features of the cells were the pits in the cell walls of stone cells and vessels, which are associated with the abundant mesopores in C. oleifera shells. C. oleifera shells have an advantage over woody materials based on their mesoporosity features. C. oleifera shells are ideal raw materials that could serve as biomass templates or find applications as other high-performance biomimetic materials.","Gynoecium with carpel dimorphism in Tricomaria usillo, comparison with other genera of the Carolus clade (Malpighiaceae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953173,Protoplasma,2019 04 06,"We analyzed the gynoecium morphology and anatomy of Tricomaria usillo in young and mature flowers from diverse populations in order to analyze the differentiation of structure and function of the parts of the carpel.

We compare the characteristics of the gynoecium of T. usillo and discuss the carpel dimorphism with other genera within the Carolus clade in relation with their pollination syndromes. Carpels were processed according to classic techniques for scanning electron microscopy and bright field microscopy. We conducted field observation in different populations of T. usillo and captured the insects that were identified to specific level. The gynoecium of T. usillo shows inter-population and intra-individual variability. Some have three well-developed carpels, while most of them present two posterior carpels with differentiated styles and stigmas and the anterior one with a shorter style with or without stigma. The ovary has three locules with one ovule each. A compitum is formed and all ovules may be fecundated. However, fruits have generally one seed that develops in the anterior locule. Centris brethesi is the potential pollinator. The gynoecium of T. usillo reflects part of the variation in the carpel dimorphism that probably arose in the branch of the Carolus clade, and evolved in diverse ways in the lineages of this group.

A self assembeled monolayer (SAM) of mercaptoethylamine was prepared to immobilize arsenite on the surface of a quartz crystal microbalance. Gold nanoparticles were modified with arsenite aptamer to amplify the response frequency of the biosensor. Arsenite first binds to the SAM on the gold surface of the QCM. On addition of gold nanoparticles with aptamer (DNA-AuNp), the SAM-As(III)-aptamer sandwich is formed. This increases the resonance frequency of the sensor and allows trace concentration of arsenite to be determined. The aptasensor can detect arsenite in the 8 to 1000 nmol·L-1 concentration range with a 4.4 nmol·L-1 lower detection limit (at S/N = 3). The sandwich structure improves the specificity of the aptasensor without considering the conformational transition of the aptamer. The strategy described here conceivably has a large potential as it shows that small molecules can be sensed by using aptamers with unknown working mechanism.

Most ECM fungi can produce sporocarps. To date, the effects of co-colonising fungal species on sporocarp formation in ECM fungi remain unknown. In this study, we examined host plant growth, mycorrhizal colonisation, and sporocarp formation when roots of Pinus densiflora are colonised by Laccaria japonica and three other ECM fungal species (Cenococcum geophilum, Pisolithus sp., and Suillus luteus). Sporocarp numbers were recorded throughout the experimental period. The biomass, photosynthetic rate, and mycorrhizal colonisation rate of the seedlings were also measured at 45 days, 62 days, and 1 year after seedlings were transplanted. Results indicated that C. geophilum and S. luteus may negatively impact mycorrhizal colonisation and sporocarp formation in L. japonica. Sporocarp formation in L. japonica was positively correlated with conspecific mycorrhizal colonisation but negatively correlated with the biomass of seedlings of P. densiflora. The co-occurring ECM fungi largely competed with L. japonica, resulting in various effects on mycorrhizal colonisation and sporocarp formation in L. japonica. A variety of mechanisms may be involved in the competitive interactions among the different ECM fungal species, including abilities to more rapidly colonise root tips, acquire soil nutrients, or produce antibiotics. These mechanisms need to be confirmed in further studies.",De novo design of anticancer peptides by ensemble artificial neural networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953170,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 05 21,"Membranolytic anticancer peptides (ACPs) are drawing increasing attention as potential future therapeutics against cancer, due to their ability to hinder the development of cellular resistance and their potential to overcome common hurdles of chemotherapy, e.g., side effects and cytotoxicity. In this work, we present an ensemble machine learning model to design potent ACPs. Four counter-propagation artificial neural-networks were trained to identify peptides that kill breast and/or lung cancer cells. For prospective application of the ensemble model, we selected 14 peptides from a total of 1000 de novo designs, for synthesis and testing in vitro on breast cancer (MCF7) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines. Six de novo designs showed anticancer activity in vitro, five of which against both MCF7 and A549 cell lines. The novel active peptides populate uncharted regions of ACP sequence space."

Lignin in compression wood was somewhat more oriented in the direction of the cellulose microfibrils than in normal wood. The structural organization in compression wood (CW) is quite different from that in normal wood (NW). To shed more light on the structural organization of the polymers in plant cell walls, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microscopy in transmission mode has been used to compare the S2-dominated mean orientation of wood polymers in CW with that in NW from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata). Polarized FTIR measurements revealed that in both CW and NW samples, glucomannan and xylan showed a parallel orientation with respect to the cellulose microfibrils. In both wood samples, the glucomannan showed a much greater degree of orientation than the xylan, indicating that the glucomannan has established a stronger interaction with cellulose than xylan. For the lignin, the absorption peak also indicated an orientation along the direction of the cellulose microfibrils, but this orientation was more pronounced in CW than in NW, indicating that the lignin is affected by the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils more strongly in CW than it is in NW.","Urinary equol, but not daidzein and genistein, was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953148,European journal of nutrition,2019 04 06,"Many studies have examined the association of isoflavone intake with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and produced inconsistent results.

The purpose was to better characterize these three entities using immunohistochemistry and FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) to identify biomarkers differently expressed and that might be involved in their pathogenesis. Twenty-two S-ALCL ALK-, 13 PC-ALCL, and 2 BI-ALCL were included. Cases were tested for P53, P63, MUM1, MYC, GATA3, p-STAT3, PD1, and PDL1 protein expression and DUP22, TP53, TP63, MYC, and PDL1 chromosomal aberrations. As expected, S-ALCL ALK- patients had adverse outcome compare to PC and BI-ALCL. No difference was observed between the three groups concerning protein expression except for MUM1 that was significantly more frequently expressed in S-ALCL ALK- compared to PC-ALCL. In particular, constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway and PDL1/PD1 immune-checkpoint expression was present in the three entities.

Cases were mostly (95%) HER2 equivocal by immunohistochemistry (IHC), not centrally reviewed. Other reasons for referring cases were IHC confirmation, IHC discordancy (either between needle-core-biopsy (NCB) and surgical excision specimen (SES) or between different laboratories) and IHC result unexpected for histopathologic features. Cases evaluated with the 2013 guideline (1st cohort) were 14.6% HER2-positive, decreasing significantly after the reclassification with the 2018 guideline due to the exclusion of group 2 cases without HER2 protein overexpression. Cases studied after the implementation of the 2018 guideline (2nd cohort) were 8.7% HER2-positive, a frequency that was not significantly different from the reclassification of the 1st cohort with the 2018 guideline.

In turn, their disease, as well as their response to the treatment, is determined by their genetic makeup and the ""environment,"" which relates to their general health, medical history, personal habits, and surroundings. Developing such optimized treatment strategies is an admirable goal and success stories include examples such as switching chemotherapy agents based on a patient's tumor genotype. However, it remains a challenge to apply precision medicine to diseases for which there is no known effective treatment. Such diseases require additional research, often using experimentally tractable models. Presumably, models that recapitulate as much of the human pathophysiology as possible will be the most predictive. Here we will discuss the considerations behind such ""precision models."" What sort of precision is required and under what circumstances? How can the predictive validity of such models be improved? Ultimately, there is no perfect model, but our continually improving ability to genetically engineer a variety of systems allows the generation of more and more precise models. Furthermore, our steadily increasing awareness of risk alleles, genetic background effects, multifactorial disease processes, and gene by environment interactions also allows increasingly sophisticated models that better reproduce patients' conditions.

An increase in the total protein content of the midgut diverticula, hemolymph, and ovary occurred throughout vitellogenesis followed by a decrease in those levels after laying. The presence of hemocyanin in egg and in LV2, as well as its accumulation in the ovary throughout the vitellogenesis process, was determined. Considering that all biologic processes depend on the correct structure and function of proteins, this study establishes, for the first time for the Order Araneae, the coexistence of three different origins of vitellogenesis-related proteins: one predominantly ovarian involving peptides of 120, 75, 46, and 30 kDa; another extraovarian one originated from the midgut diverticula and represented by a 170 kDa peptide, and a third hemolymphatic one, represented by the 67 kDa peptide.",[Temporary elevation deficit with exophthalmos in a 4-year-old child].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953126,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,2019 04 06,A 4-year-old girl was referred as an emergency case because of diplopia and intermittent exophthalmos of the left eye.

Cell-wall integrity (CWI) pathway is essential for fungal development, virulence, and adaptation to environment stresses. To date, the relationship between AP2 and CWI is largely unknown in phytopathogenic fungi. In this study, we identified the adaptor complex FgAP2 in Fusarium graminearum. The biological function analysis showed that FgAP2 complex contains FgAP2α, FgAP2β, FgAP2σ, and FgAP2μ, and the subunit FgAP2μ, which is required for hyphal growth, conidiation, CWI, and virulence. Yeast two-hybrid showed that FgAP2μ interacts with the CWI sensor FgWsc2B. Consistently, western blotting analysis revealed that FgWsc2B positively regulates phosphorylation of FgMgv1, the MAP kinase of CWI. Moreover, the FgWsc2B deletion mutant exhibited defects in hyphal growth, virulence, and response to CWI damaging agents. Taken together, our data indicated that FgAP2μ is involved in CWI and virulence via interacting with FgWsc2B in F. graminearum.","Splicing, genome stability and disease: splice like your genome depends on it!",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953124,Current genetics,2019 04 06,"The spliceosome has been implicated in genome maintenance for decades. Recently, a surge in discoveries in cancer has suggested that the oncogenic mechanism of spliceosomal defects may involve defective genome stability.

At the same time, specific spliceosomal components have non-canonical functions in genome maintenance.

We investigated the role of SpoIIID in mother cell lysis in Bacillus thuringiensis. A β-galactosidase assay based on the promoter fusions with lacZ indicated that the sigK gene was positively regulated by SpoIIID and σK negatively regulated the expression of sigE. The spoIIID mutant strain exhibited no mother cell lysis in Schaeffer's sporulation medium (SSM) but did in ½ Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. cwlC is an essential hydrolase gene for mother cell lysis. Moreover, the expression of a PcwlC-lacZ fusion in spoIIID mutant was proved to be higher in ½ LB medium than in SSM. HD (ΔspoIIID)(ΔcwlC) mutant was obtained by knocking out the cwlC gene in HD(ΔspoIIID) and displayed no mother cell lysis in both SSM and ½ LB mediums. The deletion of spoIIID decreased the crystal protein production in HD73. The expression of Porf1cry8E and P5014 promoter fusions with lacZ gene in the acrystalliferous HD-(ΔspoIIID) mutant showed similar activity to that in the acrystalliferous HD73- strain before T7 and slightly higher than that in the acrystalliferous HD73- after T7. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that Cry1Ac production in HD-(ΔspoIIID) directed by the Porf1cry8E and P5014 promoters was at a similar level as that in HD73 wild strain. Altogether, these results suggested that the spoIIID mutant with Porf1cry8E or P5014 promoters could be an alternative delivery system for cry gene expression with no mature spore formation and medium-dependent mother cell lysis.",Enhancement of substrate supply and ido expression to improve 4-hydroxyisoleucine production in recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum ssp. lactofermentum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953121,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 27,"4-Hydroxyisoleucine (4-HIL) has potential value in treating diabetes. L-isoleucine dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-isoleucine (Ile) to form 4-HIL with the concomitant oxidation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and oxygen consumption. In our previous study, by expressing the ido gene in the Ile producer Corynebacterium glutamicum ssp. lactofermentum SN01, 4-HIL was de novo-synthesized from glucose without adding either Ile or α-KG. In this study, synergistically improving the substrates supply and IDO activity was applied to enhance the de novo biosynthesis of 4-HIL. Deletion of aceA and blocking of the glyoxylate pathway effectively enhanced α-KG supply and Ile synthesis and thus improved 4-HIL production to 69.47 ± 2.18 mM, 18.9% higher than in the original strain. Coexpression of mqo with ido further improved Ile synthesis but decreased 4-HIL production, partially due to the inadequate activity of IDO. Coexpression of another gene, ido3, with mqo and ido efficiently promoted IDO activity, thus improving 4-HIL production to 91.54 ± 8.29 mM. Further expression of vgb and promotion of the oxygen uptake rate did not change the 4-HIL titer significantly but increased the 4-HIL production rate in the first 72 h of fermentation. After fermentation in the optimized medium, 4-HIL production by the final strains increased to 112-117 mM, indicating these strains are promising candidates for producing 4-HIL. These results demonstrate that synergistically promoting substrate supply and improving IDO activity are efficient approaches to enhance 4-HIL production in C. glutamicum.",Functional analysis of putative transporters involved in oligotrophic growth of Rhodococcus erythropolis N9T-4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953120,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 27,"Rhodococcus erythropolis N9T-4, which is an extremely oligotrophic bacterium, can survive in a completely inorganic medium with no additional carbon source. This bacterium utilizes atmospheric CO2, but does not require any additional energy source such as light and hydrogen gas, required by autotrophic microorganisms. However, its CO2 fixation and energy-acquisition systems in the oligotrophic growth remain unrevealed. We expected N9T-4 to have the transporter(s) that imports essential compound(s) for its oligotrophic growth. Three putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were found to be highly upregulated under oligotrophic conditions. We constructed the gene-deletion mutants of a gene encoding the substrate-binding protein for each ABC transporter (∆sbp1, ∆sbp2, and ∆sbp3). Among these mutants, ∆sbp1 showed growth defects on oligotrophic medium without carbon source. We examined the growth of the mutants on the oligotrophic medium containing 1% trehalose as a sole carbon source. The results exhibited worse growth of ∆sbp3 than that of the control strain (∆ligD), whereas intracellular trehalose content of all mutants decreased compared with that of ∆ligD. It was reported that trehalose functions as the mycolate carrier to the arabinogalactan layer in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of ∆sbp1 cells showed that an outermost envelope of the ∆sbp1 cell diminished, which was expected to be mycolate layer. From these results, we suggest that the same trehalose-recycling system as that in a Mycobacterium cell functions in the oligotrophic growth of N9T-4, and the ABC transporter comprising Sbp1 as the substrate-binding protein is strongly involved in the oligotrophic growth of N9T-4.",Effect of stock density on the microbial community in biofloc water and Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) gut microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953119,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 27,"Biofloc technology is an efficient approach for intensive shrimp culture. However, the extent to which this process can influence the composition of intestinal microbial community is still unknown. Here, we surveyed the shrimp intestinal bacteria as well as the floc water from three biofloc systems with different stock densities. Our study revealed a similar variation trend in phylum taxonomy level between floc bacteria and gut microbiota. Microbial community varied notably in floc water from different stock densities, while a core genus with dominating relative abundance was detected in gut samples. Extensive variation was discovered in gut microbiota, but still clustered into groups according to stock density. Our results indicated that shrimp intestinal microbiota as well as bacteria aggregated in flocs assembled into distinct communities from different stock densities, and the intestinal communities were more similar with the surrounding environment as the increase of stock density and resulting high floc biomass. The high stock density changed the core gut microbiota by reducing the relative abundance of Paracoccus and increasing that of Nocardioides, which may negatively influence shrimp performance. Therefore, this study helps us to understand further bacteria and host interactions in biofloc system.",Expression profiling of immune inhibitory Siglecs and their ligands in patients with glioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953118,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",2019 06 10,"Gliomas appear to be highly immunosuppressive tumors, with a strong myeloid component. This includes MDSCs, which are a heterogeneous, immature myeloid cell population expressing myeloid markers Siglec-3 (CD33) and CD11b and lacking markers of mature myeloid cells including MHC II. Siglec-3 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family and has been suggested to promote MDSC expansion and suppression. Siglecs form a recently defined family of receptors with potential immunoregulatory functions but only limited insight in their expression on immune regulatory cell subsets, prompting us to investigate Siglec expression on MDSCs. We determined the expression of different Siglec family members on monocytic-MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and polymorphnuclear-MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) from blood of glioma patients and healthy donors, as well as from patient-derived tumor material. Furthermore, we investigated the presence of sialic acid ligands for these Siglecs on MDSCs and in the glioma tumor microenvironment. Both MDSC subsets express Siglec-3, -5, -7 and -9, with higher levels of Siglec-3, -7 and -9 on M-MDSCs and higher Siglec-5 levels on PMN-MDSCs. Similar Siglec expression profiles were found on MDSCs from healthy donors. Furthermore, the presence of Siglec-5 and -9 was also confirmed on PMN-MDSCs from glioma tissue. Interestingly, freshly isolated glioma cells predominantly expressed sialic acid ligands for Siglec-7 and -9, which was confirmed in situ. In conclusion, our data show a distinct Siglec expression profile for M- and PMN-MDSCs and propose possible sialic acid-Siglec interactions between glioma cells and MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment."

Hypotheses on cognate amino acid order of inclusion in the genetic code produce evolutionary ranks for theoretical RNA rings. This evolutionary hypothesis predicts that pieces of RNA rings with more ancient cognate amino acid should be more frequent in modern genes than those from RNA rings with late cognate amino acids. Analyses of genes for tRNA synthetases, among the most ancient proteins, from archaeal, bacterial, eukaryote and viral superkingdoms overall confirm these predictions, least for tRNA synthetases with early cognate amino acids and for the neogene-enriched genome of the giant virus Tupanvirus. Hence early tRNA synthetase genes and late RNA rings evolved separately. Results indicate that RNA rings and tRNA synthetases with the same cognate amino acid are less separated for relatively recent cognate amino acids, suggesting that over evolutionary time the components of the molecular apparatus became more integrated, perhaps in cell-like membrane-bound systems. Results confirm that theoretical considerations in the design of minimal RNA rings recreated RNAs close to the actual primordial RNA population that produce genes by accretion, and confirm the hypothesis of homology of minimal RNA rings with tRNAs and their proto-tRNA status.",A comparison of segmented abdominopelvic fluid volumes with conventional CT signs of abdominal compartment syndrome in a trauma population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953097,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 06 12,To compare the utility of abdominopelvic fluid volume measurements with established computed tomography signs for refractory post-traumatic abdominal compartment syndrome.,Locally recurrent rectal cancer: what the radiologist should know.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953096,Abdominal radiology (New York),2019 04 06,"Despite advances in surgical techniques and chemoradiation therapy, recurrent rectal cancer remains a cause of morbidity and mortality. After successful treatment of rectal cancer, patients are typically enrolled in a surveillance strategy that includes imaging as studies have shown improved prognosis when recurrent rectal cancer is detected during imaging surveillance versus based on development of symptoms. Additionally, patients who experience a complete clinical response with chemoradiation therapy may elect to enroll in a ""watch-and-wait"" strategy that includes imaging surveillance rather than surgical resection. Factors that increase the likelihood of recurrence, patterns of recurrence, and the imaging appearances of recurrent rectal cancer are reviewed with a focus on CT, PET CT, and MR imaging.",ATAT1 regulates forebrain development and stress-induced tubulin hyperacetylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953095,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 04 06,"α-Tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) catalyzes acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 in various organisms ranging from Tetrahymena to humans. Despite the importance in mammals suggested by studies of cultured cells, the mouse Atat1 gene is non-essential for survival, raising an intriguing question about its real functions in vivo. To address this question, we systematically analyzed a mouse strain lacking the gene. The analyses revealed that starting at postnatal day 5, the mutant mice display enlarged lateral ventricles in the forebrain, resembling ventricular dilation in human patients with ventriculomegaly. In the mice, ventricular dilation is due to hypoplasia in the septum and striatum. Behavioral tests of the mice uncovered deficits in motor coordination. Birth-dating experiments revealed that neuronal migration to the mutant septum and striatum is impaired during brain development. In the mutant embryonic fibroblasts, we found mild defects in cell proliferation and primary cilium formation. Notably, in these cells, ATAT1 is indispensable for tubulin hyperacetylation in response to high salt, high glucose, and hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. We investigated the role of ATAT1 in the hematopoietic system using multicolor flow cytometry and found that this system remains normal in the mutant mice. Although tubulin acetylation was undetectable in a majority of mutant tissues, residual levels were detected in the heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, oviduct, thymus and spleen. This study thus not only establishes the importance of ATAT1 in regulating mouse forebrain development and governing tubulin hyperacetylation during stress responses, but also suggests the existence of an additional α-tubulin acetyltransferase.",The expression of circulating miR-504 in plasma is associated with EGFR mutation status in non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953094,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 04 06,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, are grossly misregulated in some human cancers, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The aberrant expression of specific miRNAs results in the abnormal regulation of key components of signalling pathways in tumour cells. MiRNA levels and the activity of the gene targets, including oncogenes and tumour suppressors, produce feedback that changes miRNA expression levels and indicates the cell's genetic activity. In this study, we measured the expression of five circulating miRNAs (miR-195, miR-504, miR-122, miR-10b and miR-21) and evaluated their association with EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (EGFR) mutation status in 66 NSCLC patients. Moreover, we examined the discriminative power of circulating miRNAs for EGFR mutant-positive and -negative NSCLC patients using two different data normalisation approaches. We extracted total RNA from the plasma of 66 non-squamous NSCLC patients (31 of whom had tumours with EGFR mutations) and measured circulating miRNA levels using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The miRNA expression levels were normalised using two endogenous controls: miR-191 and miR-16. We found significant associations between the expression of circulating miR-504 and EGFR-activating mutations in NSCLC patients regardless of the normalisation approach used (p = 0.0072 and 0.0236 for miR-16 and miR-191 normalisation, respectively). The greatest discriminative power of circulating miR-504 was observed in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions versus wild-type EGFR normalised to miR-191 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.81, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, circulating miR-504 levels were significantly reduced in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutated subgroup compared to EGFR-mutated patients (p < 0.0030) and those with EGFR/KRAS wild-type tumours (p < 0.0359). Our study demonstrated the feasibility and potential diagnostic value of plasma miR-504 expression analysis to distinguish between EGFR-mutated and wild-type NSCLC patients. However, quality control and normalisation strategies are very important and have a major impact on the outcomes of circulating miRNA analyses.",Fine mapping and molecular characterization of the virescent gene vsp in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953093,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 06,"The vsp gene was fine mapped to a 353.7-kb region, and a 201-bp deletion that affected chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis was found in the candidate gene GhPUR4. Virescent mutations can be used as marker traits in heterosis breeding and can also be used to research chloroplast development, chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis mechanisms. Here, we obtained a light-sensitive virescent mutant, vsp, that has reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content and abnormal chloroplast development. Then, the virescent space (vsp) gene in the vsp mutant was preliminarily mapped to a 38.32-Mb region of chromosome D04 using a high-density SNP genetic map with a total length of 5384.33 cM and 4472 bin markers. Furthermore, the vsp gene was narrowed down to a 353.7-kb region that contains 15 candidate genes using 484 virescent individuals from an F2 population. Sequence analysis of genes in this region showed that a 201-bp deletion was present in the Gh_D04G1108 (GhPUR4) gene in the vsp mutant. The 201-bp deletion of Gh_D04G1108 caused the deletion of 67 AAs in the GhPUR4 protein. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of GhPUR4 in normal plants caused reduced GhPUR4 gene expression levels, reduced Chl content, abnormal chloroplast development and virescent true leaves. This study could help us unravel the function of GhPUR4 in chloroplast development and Chl biosynthesis at the early developmental stages of the true leaves in cotton, which could promote the research and application of virescent mutations in cotton heterosis breeding.","Bacterioferritin comigratory protein is important in hydrogen peroxide resistance, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation in Azorhizobium caulinodans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953092,Archives of microbiology,2019 04 06,"Reactive oxygen species are not only harmful for rhizobia but also required for the establishment of symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and their legume hosts. In this work, we first investigated the preliminary role of the bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP), a member of the peroxiredoxin family, in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azorhizobium caulinodans. Our data revealed that the bcp-deficient strain of A. caulinodans displayed an increased sensitivity to inorganic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) but not to two organic peroxides in a growth-phase-dependent manner. Meanwhile, BCP was found to be involved in catalase activity under relatively low H2O2 conditions. Furthermore, nodulation and N2 fixation were significantly impaired by mutation of the bcp gene in A. caulinodans. Our work initially documented the importance of BCP in the bacterial defence against H2O2 in the free-living stage of rhizobia and during their symbiotic interactions with legumes. Molecular signalling in vivo is required to decipher the holistic functions of BCP in A. caulinodans as well as in other rhizobia.",A Polyphasic Approach for Assessing Eco-System Connectivity Demonstrates that Perturbation Remodels Network Architecture in Soil Microcosms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953090,Microbial ecology,2019 04 06,"Network analysis was used to show changes in network attributes by analyzing the relations among the main soil microbial groups in a potted tomato soil inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, treated with low doses of Mentha spicata essential oil, or both, and then exposed to tenfold higher oil addition (stress pulse). Pretreatments were chosen since they can induce changes in the composition of the microbial community. Cellular phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and the activity of six soil enzymes, mainly involved in the N-cycle were measured. Networks were constructed based on correlated changes in PLFA abundances. The values of all parameters were significantly different from those of random networks indicating modular architecture. Networks ranked from the lowest to highest modularity: control, non-pretreated and stressed, inoculated and stressed, oil treated and stressed, inoculated and treated with oil and stressed. The high values of network density and 1st/2nd eigenvalue ratio are related to arylamidase activity while N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, acid phosphomoesterase, and asparaginase activities related to high values of the clustering coefficient index. We concluded that modularity may be an efficient indicator of changes in the network of interactions among the members of the soil microbial community and the modular structure of the network may be related to the activity of specific enzymes. Communities that were stressed without a pretreatment were relatively resistant but prone to sudden transition towards instability, while oil or inoculation pretreatments gave networks which could be considered adaptable and susceptible to gradual change.",Time-Dependent Hormetic Response of Soil Alkaline Phosphatase Induced by Cd and the Association with Bacterial Community Composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953089,Microbial ecology,2019 04 06,"Hormetic dose-response that involved Cd in soils is increasingly paid attentions for risk assessment of Cd toxicity, but insufficient studies were conducted to define the temporary modification of soil enzyme and the potential microbial responses. The present study chooses soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as endpoint to uncover the time-dependent hormetic responses to low doses of Cd and its association with bacterial community composition. The results showed that addition of 0.01-3.0 mg kg-1 Cd significantly increased ALP's activities with maximum stimulatory magnitude of 11.4-27.2%, indicating a typical hormesis. The response started at 12 h after Cd addition and maintained about 24 h. This demonstrated that the hormetic response is time-dependent and transient. Changes of soil bacterial community composition showed that, at 6 h, relative abundances (RAs) of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes at phylum and Pontibacter, Bacillaceae-Bacillus, Bacillaceae1-Bacillus, and Paenisporosarcina at genus significantly correlated with ALP's activities at 12-36 h (P < 0.05). This suggests that soil bacteria likely showed an earlier response to Cd and potentially contributes to the subsequent soil enzyme's hormesis. In addition, it was found that Gram-negative bacteria other than Gram-positive bacteria are prone to exhibiting a hormetic response under Cd stress. Our findings provide much insight into ecotoxicological risk assessment for soil Cd pollution."

Over 100 litter samples were collected from 30 poultry farms representing a total of 60 different broiler houses with 9 houses sampled more than once over 1.5 yr. The samples were collected just before the placement of newly hatched chicks and after an anticoccidial drug (ACD) or Eimeria vaccine (VAC) program, and processed for counting oocysts followed by Eimeria species determination using ITS1 PCR. Broiler chicks were inoculated with recovered Eimeria oocysts to determine if the litter oocysts were viable and capable of causing patent infection. At placement, E. maxima (Emax) oocysts were detected in 70 of 75 houses after ACD program and 46 of 47 houses after VAC program. Eimeria acervulina, E. praecox, and/or E. tenella (Eapt) were detected in 75 of 75 houses after ACD program and 47 of 47 houses after VAC program. Viability testing revealed that 33.0% of broiler houses contained viable Emax oocysts, while 46.9% contained viable Eapt oocysts. During VAC programs, the concentration of Emax oocysts at placement and the total number of Emax oocysts shed by chickens in viability studies showed a very strong correlation (r = 0.83). Likewise, during ACD programs, the concentration of Eapt oocysts at placement and the total number of Eapt oocysts shed by chickens in the viability study showed a strong correlation (r = 0.62). In general, Eimeria oocyst levels at placement and number of viable oocysts shed by chickens in the viability study were similar among houses on the same farm. However, the number of Eimeria oocysts shed in the viability studies was considerably less than expected based on the number of oocysts given. These data suggest that nearly 100% of all poultry houses contain Emax and Eapt oocysts at placement with 30 to 50% of the houses containing viable Eimeria oocysts, thus possibly representing a source of the protozoa to newly hatched chicks.","A Profile of Point of Care Coordinators: Roles, Responsibilities and Attitudes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953076,Laboratory medicine,2019 04 06,"Point of care (POC) testing is rapidly evolving.

Existing computational methods typically fail to detect weak or dynamic interactions because they use a peak-calling step that ignores paired-end linkage information. We have developed a novel computational method called Chromatin Interaction Discovery (CID) to overcome this limitation with an unbiased clustering approach for interaction discovery. CID outperforms existing chromatin interaction detection methods with improved sensitivity, replicate consistency, and concordance with other chromatin interaction datasets. In addition, CID also outperforms other methods in discovering chromatin interactions from HiChIP data. We expect that the CID method will be valuable in characterizing 3D chromatin interactions and in understanding the functional consequences of disease-associated distal genetic variations.",Impact of a probiotic-based cleaning product on the microbiological profile of broiler litters and chicken caeca microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953074,Poultry science,2019 04 06,"This study investigated for the first time the decontamination efficacy of a probiotic-based cleaning product containing Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus megaterium spores on fresh and reused broiler litters during 3 rearing cycles of 6 wk each. Moreover, the impact of reused litters treated with the cleaning product on the chicken caeca microbiota was assessed at the end of the rearing cycles in comparison to untreated litter. The Bacillus spores provided with the cleaning treatment were able to successfully colonize the reused poultry litters, decreasing the mean counts of total aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and coagulase positive Staphylococci. The decrease of Enterobacteriaceae, mainly represented by the genus Escherichia, was also observed in the caeca of broilers reared on reused litters treated with the cleaning product. Moreover, the treatment retained the caeca content of Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium as well as the level of biodiversity among the bacteria genera colonizing the caeca of animals reared on reused litter. Overall, the results of this study highlight a positive effect of the probiotic-based cleaning strategy on the microbial decontamination of reused litters and on broiler caeca stability, thereby enhancing animal health and prevention of poultry diseases.",Identification of common highly expressed genes of Salmonella Enteritidis by in silico prediction of gene expression and in vitro transcriptomic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953073,Poultry science,2019 04 06,"Chickens are the reservoir host of Salmonella Enteritidis. Salmonella Enteritidis colonizes the gastro-intestinal tract of chickens and replicates within macrophages without causing clinically discernable illness. Persistence of S. Enteritidis in the hostile environments of intestinal tract and macrophages allows it to disseminate extra-intestinally to liver, spleen, and reproductive tract. Extra-intestinal dissemination into reproductive tract leads to contamination of internal contents of eggs, which is a major risk factor for human infection. Understanding the genes that contribute to S. Enteritidis persistence in the chicken host is central to elucidate the genetic basis of the unique pathobiology of this public health pathogen. The aim of this study was to identify a succinct set of genes associated with infection-relevant in vitro environments to provide a rational foundation for subsequent biologically-relevant research. We used in silico prediction of gene expression and RNA-seq technology to identify a core set of 73 S. Enteritidis genes that are consistently highly expressed in multiple S. Enteritidis strains cultured at avian physiologic temperature under conditions that represent intestinal and intracellular environments. These common highly expressed (CHX) genes encode proteins involved in bacterial metabolism, protein synthesis, cell-envelope biogenesis, stress response, and a few proteins with uncharacterized functions. Further studies are needed to dissect the contribution of these CHX genes to the pathobiology of S. Enteritidis in the avian host. Several of the CHX genes could serve as promising targets for studies towards the development of immunoprophylactic and novel therapeutic strategies to prevent colonization of chickens and their environment with S. Enteritidis.",Effect of a low protein diet on chicken ceca microbiome and productive performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953072,Poultry science,2019 04 06,"The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of supplementation of a low protein diet on ceca microbiome and productive performances of broiler chickens. A total of 1,170 one-day-old male chicks (Ross 308) were divided in 2 diet groups and reared in the same conditions up to 42 D. Birds belonging to the control group were fed a basal diet. Birds belonging to the low protein group the basal diet with a reduced level of crude protein (-7%). Cecum contents from randomly selected birds were collected at 14 and 42 D within each diet group, submitted to DNA extraction and then tested by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Abundances of species belonging to Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were mainly affected by the diet as well as interaction between diet and time, while species belonging to Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria changed mainly according to the age of the birds. At family level, Lactobacillaceae significantly decreased in the low protein group up to 14 D. However, at the end of the rearing period the same family was significantly higher in the low protein group. The most abundant functional genes, represented by cystine desulfurase, alpha-galactosidase, and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, displayed comparable abundances in both diet groups, although significative differences were identified for less abundant functional genes at both sampling times. Birds fed control and low protein diets showed similar productive performances. However, in the finisher phase, feed conversion rate was significantly better in chickens fed the low protein diet. Overall, this study showed that a reduced intake of crude protein in broilers increases the abundance of Lactobacillaceae in the ceca over time and this seems to be linked to a better feed conversion rate between 36 and 42 D. A reduced intake of crude protein in chicken production can help to improve exploitation of edible resources, while reducing the emission of nitrogen pollutants in the environment.",Effects of Temperature on First Instar Lymantria (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) Survival and Development With and Without Food.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953071,Environmental entomology,2019 06 07,"Lymantria dispar L. and Lymantria monacha (L.) are Eurasian pests that have the potential for accidental introduction via trade into other world areas. Establishment of first instars of Lymantria depends on larvae surviving long enough to disperse and finding suitable hosts. The survival and development of newly hatched Lymantria larvae from nine geographic populations at seven temperatures (1-30°C) held without food, with summer foliage of a preferred or conifer host was determined. There was considerable variation both within and among the Lymantria populations in the survival of larvae at different temperatures when held with and without food. Without food survival declined from about a month at 5°C to a few days at 30°C, following a typical enzymatic kinetic rate function. At 1°C larval survival was less than at 5°C likely because the larvae were susceptible to freezing. Larvae from the one L. monacha population fed and gained weight on the summer foliage, particularly on the conifer, at 10-15°C but < 20% survived for 14 d at 20-30°C. The newly hatched L. dispar larvae from all eight populations fed (at 10-30°C) and developed (at 15-30°C) on the summer foliage of one or both of the hosts. This suggests that they may be able to find adequate food for establishment even if hatch is not synchronous with bud break in the invaded habitat. Survival on the conifer was highest for one Chinese and two European populations of L. dispar, suggesting the ability to utilize conifers is population and not subspecies specific.",Protective effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza polysaccharides on liver injury in chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953070,Poultry science,2019 04 06,"This study investigated the effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza polysaccharides (SMPs) on the injury of chicken hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro studies primary cultured hepatocytes were isolated by 2-step collagenase perfusion. Carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) was added to the hepatocytes to establish a hepatocyte injury model. Hepatocytes were treated with different concentrations of SMPs to detect the protective effects of SMPs on CCL4-induced hepatocyte injury. The results of the control group showed that chicken hepatocytes grew well and their morphology was normal. After CCL4 treatment, the activity of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) of hepatocytes increased compared with the normal control group. SMPs treatment downregulated the contents of ALT, AST, and malondialdehyde (MDA), and upregulated the contents of glutathione (GSH) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450). An acute chicken liver injury model was established in vivo with 2.0 mL/kg 50% CCL4. Oral administration of SMP at different doses exhibited preventive success. The results showed that compared with the control group, the contents of total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), and GSH in the liver injury model group were significantly decreased and the levels of liver index, ALT, AST, and MDA were significantly increased. In contrast, in the SMP group the contents of TP, Alb, and GSH were significantly increased, and the levels of liver index, ALT, AST, and MDA were significantly decreased compared with the model group. Therefore, we conclude that SMPs have good protective effect on chicken liver damage in vivo and in vitro.",Glycerol inoculation in eggs of young broiler breeders at different embryonic periods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953069,Poultry science,2019 04 06,"Small eggs have lesser amounts of nutrients to be used by the embryo, and the yolk glycerol is the main substrate for glycogen production, which is the main energy source in the last days of incubation. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the effect of a glycerol injection in light weight eggs at 2 different days of incubation. To this end, 336 light eggs (55.6 to 58.6 g) from 32-wk-old broiler breeders were incubated. The eggs were divided into 3 treatment groups: 1 group inoculated with saline solution on the 17th d of embryonic development (E17) (control group), the second group injected with a 6 mg glycerol/mL solution at E17, and the third group injected with 6 mg glycerol/mL on the 18th d of incubation (E18). Incubation parameters, liver and muscle glycogen, and broilers performance at 7 d of age were evaluated. Glycerol administration in ovo did not influence hatchability, period of embryonic death or early hatching. Chicks exposed to glycerol in ovo feeding (IOF) used more yolk than birds inoculated with saline solution. Glycerol inoculation at E18 enhanced liver glycogen deposition (P = 0.001) and also improved broilers performance at 7 d, although this improvement in performance and glycogen reserves was not observed when eggs were inoculated at 17 d of incubation. Birds receiving glycerol IOF at E18 showed higher feed intake and body weight gain when compared to the control group and the group inoculated at E17. It was found that glycerol inoculation in light eggs at the 18th d of incubation contributed to raise liver glycerol levels and also to improve broilers performance at 7 d.",Cisplatin- and cyclophosphamide-induced primordial follicle depletion is caused by direct damage to oocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953068,Molecular human reproduction,2019 04 06,"It is well established that DNA-damaging chemotherapies can cause infertility and ovarian endocrine failure by depleting the ovarian reserve of primordial follicles. Currently, no effective pharmacological therapies exist for the preservation of long-term fertility and ovarian function in female cancer patients, due to a limited understanding of the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced follicle depletion. This study investigated the cellular targets, molecular mechanisms, and temporal course of ovarian reserve depletion following treatment with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were injected i.p. with saline, cisplatin (5mg/kg), or cyclophosphamide (300mg/kg); ovaries were harvested after 8 or 24 hours. Follicle counts showed depletion of all follicular stages 24 hours after administration of cisplatin or cyclophosphamide. Eight hours post-treatment, H2A histone family member X (γH2AX) immunofluorescence showed DNA double-stranded breaks at all follicular stages, including within primordial follicle oocytes. This staining was resolving by 24 hours, indicating that primordial follicle oocytes begin to undergo either apoptosis or repair in this timeframe. γH2AX-positive follicles were further examined to identify the specific cell types damaged. In primordial, transitional, and primary follicles, only oocytes sustained DNA damage, whereas in secondary and antral follicles, only somatic cells were affected. TUNEL staining confirmed that apoptosis occurs in these targeted cell types. Whilst multi-drug and multi-dose regimens were not examined, this study conclusively shows that cyclophosphamide and cisplatin cause direct damage to primordial follicle oocytes, which then undergo apoptosis. Therefore, future pharmacological strategies to prevent chemotherapy-induced infertility in females must specifically prevent primordial follicle oocyte death."

It has been reported that gut microbiota has a dominant influence on the risks of psychiatric disorders through gut microbiota-brain axis. We extended the classic gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach to detect the association between gut microbiota and complex diseases using published genome-wide association study (GWAS) and GWAS of gut microbiota summary data. We applied our approach to real GWAS data sets of five psychiatric disorders, including attention deficiency/hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (AUT), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). To evaluate the performance of our approach, we also tested the genetic correlations of obesity and type 2 diabetes with gut microbiota. We identified several significant associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota, such as ADHD and genus Desulfovibrio (P = 0.031), order Clostridiales (P = 0.034). For AUT, association signals were observed for genera Bacteroides (P = 0.012) and Desulfovibrio (P = 0.033). Genus Desulfovibrio (P = 0.005) appeared to be associated with BD. For MDD, association signals were observed for genus Desulfovibrio (P = 0.003), order Clostridiales (P = 0.004), family Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.007) and genus Bacteroides (P = 0.007). Genus Desulfovibrio (P = 0.012) and genus Bacteroides (P = 0.038) appeared to be associated with SCZ.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",2019 04 06,"Extending life by delaying the aging process have proven to be the most effective way to fight multiple chronic diseases in elderly adults. Evidence suggests that longevity is inversely related to unsaturation of membrane phospholipids. The present study investigated how different unsaturated dietary fats affect lifespan and cause death in male Wistar rats fed diets based on virgin olive oil (V), sunflower oil (S) or fish oil (F), which were supplemented or not with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Previous results suggest that individual longevity and survival probability at different ages may be modulated by an appropriate dietary fat treatment. Lifelong feeding with V or F diets would reduce death probability compared to feeding with S diet at certain ages, although the effects of V diet would be maintained for most of life. Furthermore, the addition of lower amounts of CoQ10 reduced mortality associated with S diet, but CoQ10 had no effect on survival when combined with virgin olive oil or fish oil. Supplementation with low doses of CoQ10 failed to increase the maximum lifespan potential of rats fed a V or F diet. No clear evidence showing that MUFA, n-3 PUFA or CoQ10 exerted the observed effects by modulating the rate of aging has been found.",Microfabricated blood vessels for modeling the vascular transport barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953042,Nature protocols,2019 06 10,"The vascular endothelium forms the inner lining of blood vessels and actively regulates vascular permeability in response to chemical and physical stimuli. Understanding the molecular pathways and mechanisms that regulate the permeability of blood vessels is of critical importance for developing therapies for cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. Recently, we developed a novel microfluidic human engineered microvessel (hEMV) platform to enable controlled blood flow through a human endothelial lumen within a physiologic 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) into which pericytes and other stromal cells can be introduced to recapitulate tissue-specific microvascular physiology. This protocol describes how to design and fabricate the silicon hEMV device master molds (takes ~1 week) and elastomeric substrates (takes 3 d); how to seed, culture, and apply calibrated fluid shear stress to hEMVs (takes 1-7 d); and how to assess vascular barrier function (takes 1 d) and perform immunofluorescence imaging (takes 3 d).",Quantitative imaging of sleep behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans and larval Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953041,Nature protocols,2019 05 20,"Sleep is nearly universal among animals, yet remains poorly understood. Recent work has leveraged simple model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster larvae, to investigate the genetic and neural bases of sleep. However, manual methods of recording sleep behavior in these systems are labor intensive and low in throughput. To address these limitations, we developed methods for quantitative imaging of individual animals cultivated in custom microfabricated multiwell substrates, and used them to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying sleep. Here, we describe the steps necessary to design, produce, and image these plates, as well as analyze the resulting behavioral data. We also describe approaches for experimentally manipulating sleep. Following these procedures, after ~2 h of experimental preparation, we are able to simultaneously image 24 C. elegans from the second larval stage to adult stages or 20 Drosophila larvae during the second instar life stage at a spatial resolution of 10 or 27 µm, respectively. Although this system has been optimized to measure activity and quiescence in Caenorhabditis larvae and adults and in Drosophila larvae, it can also be used to assess other behaviors over short or long periods. Moreover, with minor modifications, it can be adapted for the behavioral monitoring of a wide range of small animals.",Standardization of complex biologically derived spectrochemical datasets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953040,Nature protocols,2019 05 20,"Spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are used to study interactions of light with biological materials. This interaction forms the basis of many analytical assays used in disease screening/diagnosis, microbiological studies, and forensic/environmental investigations. Advantages of spectrochemical analysis are its low cost, minimal sample preparation, non-destructive nature and substantially accurate results. However, an urgent need exists for repetition and validation of these methods in large-scale studies and across different research groups, which would bring the method closer to clinical and/or industrial implementation. For this to succeed, it is important to understand and reduce the effect of random spectral alterations caused by inter-individual, inter-instrument and/or inter-laboratory variations, such as variations in air humidity and CO2 levels, and aging of instrument parts. Thus, it is evident that spectral standardization is critical to the widespread adoption of these spectrochemical technologies. By using calibration transfer procedures, in which the spectral response of a secondary instrument is standardized to resemble the spectral response of a primary instrument, different sources of variation can be normalized into a single model using computational-based methods, such as direct standardization (DS) and piecewise direct standardization (PDS); therefore, measurements performed under different conditions can generate the same result, eliminating the need for a full recalibration. Here, we have constructed a protocol for model standardization using different transfer technologies described for FTIR spectrochemical applications. This is a critical step toward the construction of a practical spectrochemical analysis model for daily routine analysis, where uncertain and random variations are present.",Ancient pathogen genomics as an emerging tool for infectious disease research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953039,Nature reviews.

Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve skin and organ fibrosis in patients with progressive disease and a high risk of organ failure, indicating that cells originating in the bone marrow are important contributors to the pathogenesis of SSc. Animal studies also indicate a pivotal function of myeloid cells in the development of fibrosis leading to changes in the tissue architecture and dysfunction in multiple organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidney. In this Review, we summarize current knowledge about the function of myeloid cells in fibrogenesis that occurs in patients with SSc. Targeted therapies currently in clinical studies for SSc might affect myeloid cell-related pathways. Therefore, myeloid cells might be used as cellular biomarkers of disease through the application of high-dimensional techniques such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing."

However, culture is always changing, and this change affects the evolution of cognitive processes and behavioural practices across and within societies. Studies have now documented historical changes in sexism1, individualism2,3, language use4 and music preferences5 within the United States and around the world6. Here we build on these efforts by examining changes in cultural tightness-looseness (the strength of cultural norms and tolerance for deviance) over time, using the United States as a case study. We first develop a new linguistic measure to measure historical changes in tightness-looseness. Analyses show that America grew progressively less tight (i.e., looser) from 1800 to 2000. We next examine how changes in tightness-looseness relate to four indicators of societal order: debt (adjusted for inflation), adolescent pregnancies and crime, and high school attendance, as well as four indicators of creative output: registered patents, trademarks, feature films produced, and baby-naming conformity. We find that cultural tightness correlates negatively with each measure of creativity, and correlates positively with three out of four measures of societal order (fewer adolescent pregnancies, less debt and higher levels of school attendance). These findings imply that the historical loosening of American culture was associated with a trade-off between higher creativity but lower order.",Little race or gender bias in an experiment of initial review of NIH R01 grant proposals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953009,Nature human behaviour,2019 06 10,"Many granting agencies allow reviewers to know the identity of a proposal's principal investigator (PI), which opens the possibility that reviewers discriminate on the basis of PI race and gender. We investigated this experimentally with 48 NIH R01 grant proposals, representing a broad range of NIH-funded science. We modified PI names to create separate white male, white female, black male and black female versions of each proposal, and 412 scientists each submitted initial reviews for 3 proposals. We find little to no race or gender bias in initial R01 evaluations, and additionally find that any bias that might have been present must be negligible in size. This conclusion was robust to a wide array of statistical model specifications. Pragmatically, important bias may be present in other aspects of the granting process, but our evidence suggests that it is not present in the initial round of R01 reviews.",Global music streaming data reveal diurnal and seasonal patterns of affective preference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953008,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 06,"People manage emotions to cope with life's demands1,2. Previous research has identified affective patterns using self-reports3 and text analysis4,5, but these measures track the expression of affect, not affective preference for external stimuli such as music, which affects mood states and levels of emotional arousal1,6,7. We analysed a dataset of 765 million online music plays streamed by 1 million individuals in 51 countries to measure diurnal and seasonal patterns of affective preference. Findings reveal similar diurnal patterns across cultures and demographic groups. Individuals listen to more relaxing music late at night and more energetic music during normal business hours, including mid-afternoon when affective expression is lowest. However, there were differences in baselines: younger people listen to more intense music; compared with other regions, music played in Latin America is more arousing, while music in Asia is more relaxing; and compared with other chronotypes, 'night owls' (people who are habitually active or wakeful at night) listen to less-intense music. Seasonal patterns vary with distance from the equator and between Northern and Southern hemispheres and are more strongly correlated with absolute day length than with changes in day length. Taken together with previous findings on affective expression in text4, these results suggest that musical choice both shapes and reflects mood.",Extreme opponents of genetically modified foods know the least but think they know the most.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953007,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 06,"There is widespread agreement among scientists that genetically modified foods are safe to consume1,2 and have the potential to provide substantial benefits to humankind3. However, many people still harbour concerns about them or oppose their use4,5. In a nationally representative sample of US adults, we find that as extremity of opposition to and concern about genetically modified foods increases, objective knowledge about science and genetics decreases, but perceived understanding of genetically modified foods increases. Extreme opponents know the least, but think they know the most. Moreover, the relationship between self-assessed and objective knowledge shifts from positive to negative at high levels of opposition. Similar results were obtained in a parallel study with representative samples from the United States, France and Germany, and in a study testing attitudes about a medical application of genetic engineering technology (gene therapy). This pattern did not emerge, however, for attitudes and beliefs about climate change.",Sleepers track informative speech in a multitalker environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953006,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 06,"Sleep is a vital need, forcing us to spend a large portion of our life unable to interact with the external world. Current models interpret such extreme vulnerability as the price to pay for optimal learning. Sleep would limit external interferences on memory consolidation1-3 and allow neural systems to reset through synaptic downscaling4. Yet, the sleeping brain continues generating neural responses to external events5,6, revealing the preservation of cognitive processes ranging from the recognition of familiar stimuli to the formation of new memory representations7-15. Why would sleepers continue processing external events and yet remain unresponsive? Here we hypothesized that sleepers enter a 'standby mode' in which they continue tracking relevant signals, finely balancing the need to stay inward for memory consolidation with the ability to rapidly awake when necessary. Using electroencephalography to reconstruct competing streams in a multitalker environment16, we demonstrate that the sleeping brain amplifies meaningful speech compared to irrelevant signals. However, the amplification of relevant stimuli was transient and vanished during deep sleep. The effect of sleep depth could be traced back to specific oscillations, with K-complexes promoting relevant information in light sleep, whereas slow waves actively suppress relevant signals in deep sleep. Thus, the selection of relevant stimuli continues to operate during sleep but is strongly modulated by specific brain rhythms.",Opposite effects of dopamine and serotonin on resting-state networks: review and implications for psychiatric disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953003,Molecular psychiatry,2019 04 06,"Alterations in brain intrinsic activity-as organized in resting-state networks (RSNs) such as sensorimotor network (SMN), salience network (SN), and default-mode network (DMN)-and in neurotransmitters signaling-such as dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT)-have been independently detected in psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states. The here suggested model carries important implications for psychiatric disorders, providing novel and well testable hypotheses especially on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",AUTS2 isoforms control neuronal differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953002,Molecular psychiatry,2019 04 06,"Mutations in AUTS2 are associated with autism, intellectual disability, and microcephaly. AUTS2 is expressed in the brain and interacts with polycomb proteins, yet it is still unclear how mutations in AUTS2 lead to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Here we report that when neuronal differentiation is initiated, there is a shift in expression from a long isoform to a short AUTS2 isoform. Yeast two-hybrid screen identified the splicing factor SF3B1 as an interactor of both isoforms, whereas the polycomb group proteins, PCGF3 and PCGF5, were found to interact exclusively with the long AUTS2 isoform. Reporter assays showed that the first exons of the long AUTS2 isoform function as a transcription repressor, but the part that consist of the short isoform acts as a transcriptional activator, both influenced by the cellular context. The expression levels of PCGF3 influenced the ability of the long AUTS2 isoform to activate or repress transcription. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with heterozygote mutations in Auts2 had an increase in cell death during in vitro corticogenesis, which was significantly rescued by overexpressing the human AUTS2 transcripts. mESCs with a truncated AUTS2 protein (missing exons 12-20) showed premature neuronal differentiation, whereas cells overexpressing AUTS2, especially the long transcript, showed increase in expression of pluripotency markers and delayed differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that the precise expression of AUTS2 isoforms is essential for regulating transcription and the timing of neuronal differentiation.",Deficiency in intestinal epithelial Reg4 ameliorates intestinal inflammation and alters the colonic bacterial composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953001,Mucosal immunology,2019 05 30,"The regenerating islet-derived family member 4 (Reg4) in the gastrointestinal tract is up-regulated during intestinal inflammation. However, the physiological function of Reg4 in the inflammation is largely unknown. In the current study, the functional roles and involved mechanisms of intestinal epithelial Reg4 in intestinal inflammation were studied in healthy and inflamed states using human intestinal specimens, an intestinal conditional Reg4 knockout mouse (Reg4ΔIEC) model and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. We showed that the elevated serum Reg4 in pediatric intestinal failure (IF) patients were positively correlated with the serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In inflamed intestine of IF patients, the crypt base Reg4 protein was increased and highly expressed towards the luminal face. The Reg4 was indicated as a novel target of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) that enhanced Reg4 expression during the intestinal inflammation. In vivo, the DSS-induced colitis was significantly ameliorated in Reg4ΔIEC mice. Reg4ΔIEC mice altered the colonic bacterial composition and reduced the bacteria adhere to the colonic epithelium. In vitro, Reg4 was showed to promote the growth of colonic organoids, and that this occurs through a mechanism involving activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In conclusion, our findings demonstrated intestinal-epithelial Reg4 deficiency protects against experimental colitis and mucosal injury via a mechanism involving alteration of bacterial homeostasis and STAT3 activation.",Alpha-galactosylceramide enhances mucosal immunity to oral whole-cell cholera vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953000,Mucosal immunology,2019 05 30,"Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) that results in 3-4 million cases globally with 100,000-150,000 deaths reported annually. Mostly confined to developing nations, current strategies to control the spread of cholera include the provision of safe drinking water and improved sanitation and hygiene, ideally in conjunction with oral vaccination. However, difficulties associated with the costs and logistics of these strategies have hampered their widespread implementation. Specific challenges pertaining to oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) include a lack of safe and effective adjuvants to further enhance gut immune responses, the complex and costly multicomponent vaccine manufacturing, limitations of conventional liquid formulation and the lack of an integrated delivery platform. Herein we describe the use of the orally active adjuvant α-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) to strongly enhance intestinal bacterium- and toxin-specific IgA responses to the OCV, Dukoral® in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. We further demonstrate the mucosal immunogenicity of a novel multi-antigen, single-component whole-cell killed V. cholerae strain and the enhancement of its immunogenicity by adding α-GalCer. Finally, we report that combining these components and recombinant cholera toxin B subunit in the SmPill® minisphere delivery system induced strong intestinal and systemic antigen-specific antibody responses.",Emerging roles of bile acids in mucosal immunity and inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30952999,Mucosal immunology,2019 04 06,"Bile acids are cholesterol-derived surfactants that circulate actively between the liver and ileum and that are classically recognized for emulsifying dietary lipids to facilitate absorption. More recent studies, however, have revealed new functions of bile acids; as pleotropic signaling metabolites that regulate diverse metabolic and inflammatory pathways in multiple cell types and tissues through dynamic interactions with both germline-encoded host receptors and the microbiota. Accordingly, perturbed bile acid circulation and/or metabolism is now implicated in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver diseases, metabolic syndrome, colon cancer, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Here, we discuss the three-dimensional interplay between bile acids, the microbiota, and the mucosal immune system, focusing on the mechanisms that regulate intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Although the functions of bile acids in mucosal immune regulation are only beginning to be appreciated, targeting bile acids and their cellular receptors has already proven an important area of new drug discovery."
