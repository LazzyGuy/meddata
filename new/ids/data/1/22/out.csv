Although structural information is codified in the amino acid sequence, computational prediction using only this information is still an unsolved problem. However, one successful method to model a protein's structure starting from the primary sequence is to use contact prediction derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Here we use our contact predictor PconsC4 to generate a list of probable contacts between residues in the primary sequences. These contacts are then used together with the secondary structure prediction as constraints for the CONFOLD folding method. In this way, a 3D protein model can be built starting directly from the primary sequence. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Pharmacologic Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Suppresses Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Murine Fast-food Diet Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063640,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 05 07,"EGFR is a critical regulator of hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. Our recent work indicated EGFR can also regulate lipid metabolism during liver regeneration after partial-hepatectomy. Based on these findings, we investigated role of EGFR in a mouse model of NAFLD utilizing a pharmacological inhibition strategy. C57BL6/J mice were fed chow-diet, or fast-food diet with/without EGFR inhibitor (Canertinib) for 2-months. EGFR inhibition completely prevented development of steatosis and liver injury in this model. In order to study if EGFR inhibition can reverse NAFLD progression, mice were fed fast-food diet for 5-months, with/without Canertinib-treatment for the last 5-weeks of the study. EGFR-inhibition remarkably decreased steatosis, liver injury, fibrosis and improved glucose tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed ~40% of genes altered by fast-food diet were differentially expressed after EGFR-inhibition, and thus, are potentially regulated by EGFR. Several genes and enzymes related to lipid metabolism (particularly fatty-acid synthesis and lipolysis), which were disrupted by fast-food diet, were found to be modulated by EGFR. Several crucial transcription factors that play a central role in regulating these lipid metabolism genes during NAFLD, including PPARγ, SREBF1, ChREBP and HNF4α, were also found to be modulated by EGFR. In fact, ChIP-analysis revealed PPARγ binding to several crucial lipid metabolisms genes (Fasn, Scd1 and Plin2) was drastically reduced by EGFR inhibition. Further upstream, EGFR-inhibition suppressed AKT signaling, which is known to control these transcription factors, including PPARγ and SREBF1, in NAFLD models. Lastly, the effect of EGFR in FFD-induced fatty-liver phenotype was not shared by receptor-tyrosine-kinase MET, as investigated using MET-KO mice. In-conclusion, our study revealed a role of EGFR in NAFLD and the potential of EGFR-inhibition as a treatment strategy for NAFLD. This article is protected by copyright.

In order to implement appropriate manufacturing control strategies during bio-processing, it is important to understand various real life bio-processing conditions where such self-associations may manifest. One such case study is presented here of increase in dimer content for an mAb during scale-up bio-processing and the approach taken to understand the under-lying mechanism. In this example, a therapeutic mAb demonstrated a consistently higher dimer values (~0.5% higher) in the drug product (DP) during release when compared to the same value measured in the corresponding drug substance (DS) lot. This observation was interesting since the DS was supplied frozen, and the DS and DP share the same formulation composition and therefore investigation of this dimer change was the scope of the characterization study. Variable path length spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography was used for protein quantification and to monitor %dimer respectively during characterization of fill-finish unit operations. At the start of DP manufacturing process, immediately after thaw of bulk DS, a protein concentration gradient was observed and the concentration ranged from 90 mg/mL (top of container) to 210 mg/mL (bottom of container). The dimerization kinetics in the same DS container was dependent on concentration with higher concentrations demonstrating higher rates of dimerization. After the bulk DS was mixed for further processing, %dimer in purified bulk DS was quantitated to be approximately 1.4% which is identical to levels observed during scale-up manufacturing of DP. After each unit operation, the in-process samples tested for %dimer showed a gradual increase in dimer as a function of time over the next 7 days accumulating to 1.8% dimer at the end of DP manufacturing process. Samples subjected to static incubation at 2-8°C and room temperature (RT; 15-25°C) showed a gradual increase in dimer over the same time frame; however, the rate of increase in dimer at RT was higher compared to samples stored at 2-8°C. The results from this demonstrate two important key findings: self-association kinetics of mAbs could be exacerbated by protein cryoconcentration and temperature conditions during bioprocessing. Since these two parameters are commonly encountered during manufacturing, the proposed mitigation strategy is to ensure homogeneity of the bulk DP during processing. The temperature dependent self-association kinetics of mAb could be mitigated by processing at lower temperature (e.g., 2-8°C) and by storing the finished DP at lower temperature after manufacturing. The results from this study also highlight the criticality of setting slightly wider specifications for DP compared to DS following ICH Q6B guidelines.",Accuracy of ultrasound in measurement of the pediatric cricothyroid membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063634,Paediatric anaesthesia,2019 05 27,"Emergency front of neck airway is a recommended airway rescue strategy in children over 1 year old.

Allostery, or control from a distance, is seen as a fundamental biomolecular mechanism for proteins. From the traditional methods of conformational selection and induced fit, the field has grown to include the role of protein motions in defining a dynamics-based allosteric approach. Harnessing of these continuous motions in the protein to exert allosteric effects can be defined by a ""violin"" model that focuses on distributions of protein vibrations as opposed to concerted pathways. According to this model, binding of an allosteric modifier causes global redistribution of dynamics in the protein kinase domain that leads to changes in its catalytic properties. This model is consistent with the ""entropy-driven allostery"" mechanism proposed by Cooper and Dryden in 1984 and does not require, but does not exclude, any major structural changes. We provide an overview of practical implementation of the violin model and how it stands amidst the other known models of protein allostery. Protein kinases have been described as the biomolecules of interest. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(6):685-696, 2019.","Adsorption of hexavalent chromium onto alkali-modified biochar derived from Lepironia articulata: A kinetic, equilibrium, and thermodynamic study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063632,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 06 03,"Hydrochar obtained after hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of Lepironia articulata (LA) was modified into biochar by reacting with a specific amount of KOH in a tubular reactor under slow pyrolysis. The physical and chemical properties of the hydrochar and modified biochar were characterized. The performance of modified biochar (LABC) was investigated through batch sorption experiments. Removal (%) and the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax ) of Cr(VI) onto LABC increased up to 98.9% and 28.75 mg/g relative to 63.44% and 21.90 mg/g in unmodified hydrochar (LAHC) at pH 2.0, 313 K, and 200 mg/L, respectively. The sorption kinetics uptake data were best interpreted with pseudo-second-order model, and sorption isotherm was simulated with the Langmuir adsorption model. The thermodynamic parameters confirm the adsorption process to be an endothermic, spontaneous, and increased disorder. The overall results revealed that LABC can be utilized as an environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and effective adsorbent in Cr(VI) removal. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Hydrochar and modified biochar prepared from a tropical biomass (Lepironia articulata) were successfully used for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. Increased specific surface was obtained by applying chemical modification with alkali treatment, contributing to effectiveness as adsorbent. Dimensionless Kc was estimated from the Langmuir fits and then used to estimate thermodynamics of adsorption. The signs of ∆H°, ∆G°, and ∆S° indicate that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto LABC was an endothermic, spontaneous, and increased disorder.","Study of biogas slurry concentrated by reverse osmosis system: characteristics, optimization and mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063631,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 05 07,"Biogas slurry, also called liquid digestate, refers to the liquid part of the anaerobic digestate produced from the anaerobic digestion process, which is an environmental pollution source if it is discharged without proper treatment.

The effects of pre-treatment technology including gravity settling and ultrafiltration process were studied via analyzing the chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3 -N), total nitrogen (TN), and conductivity. Reverse osmosis was applied in the biogas slurry concentration. The performance of reverse osmosis membrane used in the concentration process was studied by analyzing the permeate and concentrate (retentate), the volume reduction factor and the concentration factor. The suitable parameters were selected as 20.0-25.0°C for influent temperature, 0.8-1.0Mpa for operating pressure, and 6.0-8.0 for influent pH. Furthermore, the feasible concentration factor was evaluated as 4.

Individuals are hypocalcemic with inappropriately low parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and relative hypercalciuria. Calcilytics are negative allosteric modulators of the extracellular calcium receptor (CaR) and therefore may have therapeutic benefits in ADH1. Five adults with ADH1 due to 4 distinct CAR mutations received escalating doses of the calcilytic compound NPSP795 (SHP635) on 3 consecutive days. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety were assessed. Parallel in vitro testing with subject CaR mutations assessed the effects of NPSP795 on cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (Ca2+i ), and ERK and p38MAPK phosphorylation. These effects were correlated with clinical responses to administration of NPSP795. NPSP795 increased plasma PTH levels in a concentration-dependent manner up to 129% above baseline (p=0.013) at the highest exposure levels. Fractional excretion of calcium (FECa) trended down but not significantly so. Blood ionized calcium levels remained stable during NPSP795 infusion despite fasting, no calcitriol and little calcium supplementation. NPSP795 was generally safe and well-tolerated. There was significant variability in response clinically across genotypes. In vitro, all mutant CaRs were half-maximally activated (EC50 ) at lower concentrations of extracellular calcium (Ca2+o ) compared to wild type (WT) CaR; NPSP795 exposure increased the EC50 for all CaR activity readouts. However, the in vitro responses to NPSP795 did not correlate with any clinical parameters. NPSP795 increased plasma PTH levels in subjects with ADH1 in a dose-dependent manner, and thus, serves as proof-of-concept that calcilytics could be an effective treatment for ADH1. Albeit all mutations appear to be activating at the CaR, in vitro observations were not predictive of the in vivo phenotype, or the response to calcilytics, suggesting that other parameters impact the response to the drug.

Arboviruses are arthropod born viruses, mainly transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, responsible for more than thousands of deaths annually. The Flavivirideae family is probably the most clinically relevant, as it is composed of very important agents, such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and, recently, Zika virus. Intriguingly, despite their structural and genomic similarities, flaviviruses may cause conditions ranging from mild infections with fever, cutaneous rash, and headache, to very severe cases, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and microcephaly. These differences may greatly rely on viral burden, tissue tropism, and mechanisms of immune evasion that may depend on both viral and host genetic factors. Unfortunately, very little is known about the biology of these factors, and how they orchestrate these differences. In this context, viral structural proteins and host cellular receptors may have a great relevance, as their interaction dictates not only viral tissue tropism, but also a plethora on intracellular mechanisms that may greatly account for either failure or success of infection. A great number of viral receptors have been described so far, although there is still a huge gap in understanding their overall role during infection. Here we discuss some important aspects triggered after the interaction of flaviviruses and host membrane receptors, and how they change the overall outcome of the infection.",Macrophage priming is dispensable for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and restriction of Leishmania amazonensis replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063608,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 05 07,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to multiple stimuli and triggers activation of caspase-1 (CASP1), IL-1β production, and inflammation. NLRP3 activation requires two signals. The first leads to transcriptional regulation of specific genes related to inflammation, and the second is triggered when pathogens, toxins, or specific compounds damage cellular membranes and/or trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we assess the requirement of the first signal (priming) for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) infected with Leishmania amazonensis. We found that BMDMs express the inflammasome components NLRP3, ASC, and CASP1 at sufficient levels to enable the assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in response to infection. Therefore, priming was not required for the formation of ASC specks, CASP1 activation (measured by fluorescent dye FAM-YVAD), and restriction of L. amazonensis replication via the NLRP3 inflammasome. By contrast, BMDM priming was required for CASP1 cleavage (p20) and IL-1β secretion, because priming triggers robust up-regulation of pro-IL-1β and CASP11 that are important for efficient processing of CASP1 and IL-1β. Taken together, our data shed light into the cellular and molecular processes involved in activation of the NLRP3 in macrophages by Leishmania, a process that is important for the outcome of Leishmaniasis.",A new approach to estimate aerobic fitness using the NHANES dataset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063607,Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,2019 06 14,"Physical activity and fitness are essential for healthy growth in children.

The aim of this study was to use [18 F]FDG and [18 F]fluoride µPET/CT imaging to monitor systemic inflammatory and destructive bone remodeling processes as well as potential bone repair in an established mouse model of chronic inflammatory, erosive polyarthritis. Therefore, human tumor necrosis factor transgenic (hTNFtg) mice were treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody, for 4 weeks. Before and after treatment period, mice received either [18 F]FDG, for detecting inflammatory processes, or [18 F]fluoride, for monitoring bone remodeling processes, for PET scans followed by CT scans. Standardised uptake values (SUVmean ) were analyzed in various joints and histopathological signs of arthritis, joint damage and repair were assessed. Longitudinal PET/CT scans revealed a significant decrease in [18 F]FDG SUVs in affected joints demonstrating complete remission of inflammatory processes due to TNF blockade. In contrast, [18 F]fluoride SUVs could not discriminate between different severities of bone damage in hTNFtg mice. Repeated in vivo CT images proved a structural reversal of pre-existing bone erosions after anti-TNF therapy. Accordingly, histological analysis demonstrated complete resolution of synovial inflammation and healing of bone at sites of former bone erosion. We conclude that in vivo multimodal [18 F]FDG µPET/CT imaging allows to quantify and monitor inflammation-mediated bone damage and reveals not only reversal of synovitis but also bone repair upon TNF blockade in experimental arthritis.

Our results showed that within a certain concentration, both MTGase and pectin had positive effects on the gelation point, melting point, gel strength, textural, and swelling properties of fish gelatin. Particularly, low pectin content (0.5%, w/v) could give fish gelatin gels the highest values of gel strength, melting temperature, and hardness. Meantime, flow behavior results showed that both MTGase and pectin could increase fish gelatin viscosity without changing its fluid characteristic, but the latter gave fish gelatin higher viscosity. Both MTGase and pectin could increase the lightness of fish gelatin gels but decreases its transparency. More importantly, fluorescence and UV absorbance spectra, particle size distribution, and confocal microscopy results indicated that MTGase and pectin could change the structure of fish gelatin with the formation of large aggregates. Compared with MTGae modified fish gelatin, pectin could endow fish gelatin had similar gel strength, thermal and textural properties to pig skin gelatin.",Activation of PPARδ suppresses BACE1 expression by upregulating SOCS1 in a JAK2/STAT1-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063584,Journal of neurochemistry,2019 05 07,"Neuronal expression of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) has been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms that regulate BACE1 expression are unclear. Here, we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR δ) decreases BACE1 expression by upregulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Activation of PPARδ by GW501516, a specific PPARδ agonist, inhibited expression of BACE1. This effect was abrogated by shRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARδ and by treatment with the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660, indicating that PPARδ is involved in GW501516-mediated suppression of BACE1 expression. On the other hand, GW501516-activated PPARδ induced expression of SOCS1, which is a negative regulator of cytokine signal transduction, at the transcriptional level by binding to a PPAR response element in its promoter. This GW501516-mediated induction of SOCS1 expression led to downregulation of BACE1 expression via inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). GW501516-activated PPARδ suppressed the generation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) in accordance with the decrease in BACE1 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that PPARδ attenuates BACE1 expression via SOCS1-mediated inhibition of STAT1 signaling, thereby suppressing BACE1-associated generation of neurotoxic Aβ.

Previous work on natural-scene perception suggests that observers quickly acquire the gist, but gist-level understanding may not be sufficient to enable action. The moving road environment cannot be studied with static images alone, and safe driving requires anticipating future events. We performed two experiments to examine how quickly subjects could perceive the road scenes they viewed and make predictions based on their mental representations of the scenes. In both experiments, subjects performed a temporal-order prediction task, in which they viewed brief segments of road video and indicated which of two still frames would come next after the end of the video. By varying the duration of the previewed video clip, we determined the viewing duration required for accurate prediction of recorded road scenes. We performed an initial experiment on Mechanical Turk to explore the space, and a follow-up experiment in the lab to address questions of road type and stimulus discriminability. Our results suggest that representations which enable prediction can be developed from brief views of a road scene, and that different road environments (e.g., city versus highway driving) have a significant impact on the viewing durations drivers require to make accurate predictions of upcoming scenes."

ZIKV is unique from other flaviviruses, as it is transmitted vertically and sexually in addition to by mosquito vectors. Prior studies in mice, non-human primates, and humans have shown that ZIKV targets the testis in males, resulting in persistent infection and oligospermia. However, its effects on the corresponding female gonads have not been evaluated. Here, we assessed the effects of ZIKV on the ovary in non-pregnant mice. During the acute phase, ZIKV productively infected the ovary causing accumulation of CD4+ and virus-specific CD8+ T cells. T cells protected against ZIKV infection in the ovary, as higher viral burden was measured in CD8-/- and TCRβδ-/- mice. Increased cell death and tissue inflammation in the ovary was observed during the acute phase of infection, but this normalized over time. In contrast to that observed with males, minimal persistence and no long-term consequences of ZIKV infection on ovarian follicular reserve or fertility were demonstrated in this model. Thus, although ZIKV replicates in cells of the ovary and causes acute oophoritis, there is rapid resolution and no long-term effects on fertility, at least in mice.",Enhanced T-cell maturation and monocyte aggregation are features of cellular inflammation in human T-lymphotropic virus type-1-associated myelopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063543,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 05 07,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy (HAM), is an inflammatory condition characterised by severe disability and high levels of infected white blood cells.

Thus, the aberrant functioning of monocytes may affect not only host defense but also the development of inflammatory diseases. Monocytes are a heterogeneous population with phenotypical and functional differences. Most recent studies have shown that monocytes are divided into three subsets, namely classical, intermediate and non-classical subsets, both in humans and mice. Accumulating evidence showed that monocyte activation is associated with the disease progression in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it remains to be determined how monocytes contribute to the disease process and which subset is involved. In this review, we discuss the pathogenic role of monocyte subsets in SLE and RA on the basis of current studies by ourselves and others to shed light on the suitability of monocyte-targeted therapies in these diseases.","Clinical characteristics, associated malignancies and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis in inflammatory bowel disease patients: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063540,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2019 05 07,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is usually associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and oleic acid at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for fatty acid and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb x dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb x dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormonesensitivelipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoAdesaturase (P < 0.01), fattyacidsynthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01) and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs.

Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period.

Plasma samples are obtained from 86 HNSCC patients and 29 non-cancer volunteers who had been treated at Mie University Hospital between May 2015 and December 2016, and plasma miR-21 expression was measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, plasma miR-21 level of advanced HNSCC patients including 22 non-recurrent cases and 11 recurrent cases before and after treatment was analyzed using a longitudinal design. Plasma miR-21 expression in 86 HNSCC patients was obviously higher than in 29 control patients (P < 0.0001). The area under the curve (AUC) for plasma miR-21 was 0.756 (95% confidence interval: 0.661-0.851). Furthermore, our longitudinal study of plasma miR-21 showed that the expression level of plasma miR-21 was significantly reduced at the time point of 2 months after treatment in case of no recurrence. On the other hand, plasma miR-21 was not decreased after treatment in case of 10 patients who had developed recurrences during the follow-up period. This study may provide new insights into the role of plasma miR-21 as a biomarker for HNSCC, and plasma miR-21 would be useful for early detection of tumor recurrence after operation or chemoradiotherapy.","Aqueous microgels modified with photosensitive wedge-shaped amphiphilic molecules: synthesis, structure and photochemical behaviour.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063533,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 05 07,"Aqueous microgels based on poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) with reversible temperature-induced volume transition are promising ""smart"" materials for various applications. In this work, the microgels are modified via acid-base interaction by wedge-shaped amphiphilic sulfonic acid molecules with alkyl chains of different lengths and an azobenzene group. In contrast to the pristine microgel the modified microgels retain colloidal stability in water and show different responses to the change of temperature and pH. The azobenzene group in the ligand molecules acts as a spectroscopic and kinetic probe sensing the microenvironment inside the microgel particles. Thus, the observed hyperchromicity upon heating suggests the enhancement of hydrophobicity with the increase of temperature. The hydrophobicity of the microgel interior increases with the increase of the modification degree as indicated by the increase of activation energy of the thermal Z/E isomerization of the azobenzene group.",A deconvolution protocol of the mechanical relaxation spectrum to identify and quantify individual polymer feature contributions to self-healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063532,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"Starting from experimental macro-rheological data, we develop a fitting protocol that succeeded in the separation of the overlapping relaxation phenomena in the dissipative regime for a set of intrinsic healing polymers healing most effectively near their glass transition temperature Tg. To allow for a proper deconvolution, the rheological master curves are converted to a relaxation spectrum (H(τ)) and this is fitted using an optimized mechanical model, e.g. the Maxwell-Weichert model. The deconvolution of overlapping segmental mobility and reversible interactions is successfully demonstrated for a set of polyimide and polyamide polymers containing none, one and two reversible dynamic features near-Tg. Through the fitting parameters, the relaxation timescale of each feature and their apparent process enthalpies are obtained. The quantitative data obtained using the fitting protocol are then compared to macroscopic healing results. As a result, a clear correspondence between the energy stored by the system to accomplish reversible (e.g. H-bonds, π-π) and chain interdiffusion relaxation transitions and the healing efficiency of such polymers are obtained. The implementation of this protocol allows for a clearer identification of the relevant mechanisms in self-healing polymers and paves the way for the development of more efficiently healable polymeric systems."

Epigenetic changes may play significant roles in DOHaD; however, access to human fetuses for research has ethical and technical hurdles. Umbilical cord blood (CB) has been commonly used as an epigenetic surrogate of fetuses, but it does not provide direct evidence of fetal exposure to pollutants. Here, we propose umbilical cord tissue (UC), which accumulates substances delivered to fetuses during gestation, as an alternative surrogate for epigenetic studies on fetuses. To explore the feasibility to examine UC epigenome by deep sequencing, we determined CpG methylation profiles of human postnatal UC by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Principal component analysis clearly separated the DNA methylomes of UC and CB pairs isolated from the same newborn (n = 10). Although all UC chromosomes were modestly hypomethylated compared to CB chromosomes, GO analysis revealed strong enrichment of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at promoter-associated CpG islands in the HOX gene clusters and other genes encoding transcription factors involved in determination of the body pattern. DNA methylomes of UC autosomes were largely comparable between males and females. Deficiency of folate during pregnancy has been suggested to affect fetal DNA methylation to cause congenital anomalies. Whereas DNA methylome of UC was not significantly affected by early-gestational (12 weeks) low levels of maternal plasma folate (< 8 ng/ml, n = 10) compared to controls (>19 ng/mL, n = 10), two specific loci of LTR12C endogenous retroviruses in chromosome 12 were significantly hypermethylated in the low-folate group. Our study suggests that UC is useful as an alternative surrogate for studying environmental effects on DNA methylation in human fetuses, compensating CB by providing additional information about epigenetic regulation of genes involved in developmental body patterning and endogenous retroviruses.",The importance of acute kidney injury in suspected community acquired infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063508,PloS one,2019 05 10,Most sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) cases are community acquired (CA).

The empirical conclusions show that there are certain differences in inclusive financial inclusion development level in various provinces in China. Improving the inclusion development level of inclusive finance can better promote farmers' entrepreneurship. Urbanization level, economic openness and regional economic development level have a significant positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurship, while farmers' income and education level have a significant negative effect on farmers' entrepreneurship.

Moderate positive significant correlation (r = 0.37, p<0.01) and (r = 0.33, p<0.01) was found between GD and mid-parent heterosis (MPH) and better-parent heterosis (BPH), respectively, for grain yield for all the hybrids. Higher correlation between genetically closer individuals was observed for grain yield heterosis when the parents of B- and R- crosses had lesser genetic distance (<0.68 GD) in comparison to those parental combinations having GD higher than 0.68, indicating that the GD based predictions for grain yield are better when the parents are genetically related than when they are genetically diverse. In this study, all the pearl millet hybrid parents seems to exist in two broad-based heterotic pools; one each represented by seed and restorer parents as B × R hybrids showed highest mean heterosis for grain yield than either of B × B or R × R crosses. Further, four heterotic pools have been identified in this diverse set of hybrid parents of pearl millet, two each for seed parents (HPB1 and HPB2) and for restorer parents (HPR3 and HPR4). Among these, HPB1 × HPR3 was identified having the highest heterotic level, and could be further used to develop higher yielding pearl millet hybrids."

Efficient inhibitors of signaling have previously been developed but their applicability as cancer drugs is limited by the short in vivo half-life. In this study, we show that a fusion protein, consisting of the prolactin receptor antagonist PrlRA and an albumin binding domain for half-life extension can be expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and efficiently refolded and purified to homogeneity. The fusion protein was found to have strong affinity for the two intended targets: the prolactin receptor (KD = 2.3±0.2 nM) and mouse serum albumin (KD = 0.38±0.01 nM). Further investigation showed that it could efficiently prevent prolactin mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 at 100 nM concentration and above, similar to the PrlRA itself, suggesting a potential as drug for cancer therapy in the future. Complexion with HSA weakened the affinity for the receptor to 21±3 nM, however the ability to prevent phosphorylation of STAT5 was still prominent.

In Experiment 2, information about possible economic consequences was included. Relatively fewer (55%) participants (n = 372) indicated they would support a ban. Supporters of a ban were willing to pay an average dairy product price premium of 68% to see the ban enacted. Indirect measures of support indicated socially desirable responding was greater in Experiment 2 where the economic impacts of voting behavior were made explicit. In both studies, women and liberals were more likely to support a ban. The majority of participants in Experiment 1 (51%) and Experiment 2 (57%) said they had never heard or read anything about tie stalls before participating in our survey. We conclude that current knowledge of the use of tie stalls is low, but if this situation were to change there may be considerable public concern about the use of this housing method.",hPL promotes osteogenic differentiation of stem cells in 3D scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063489,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Human platelet lysate (hPL) has been considered as the preferred supplement for the xeno-free stem cell culture for many years. However, the biological effect of hPL on the proliferation and differentiation of dental stem cells combined with the use of medical grade synthetic biomaterial is still under investigation. Thus, the optimal scaffold composition, cell type and specific growth conditions, yet need to be formulated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regenerative potential of dental stem cells seeded on synthetic scaffolds and maintained in osteogenic media supplemented with either hPL or xeno-derived fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two types of dental stem cells were isolated from human impacted third molars and intact teeth; stem cells of apical papilla (SCAP) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Cells were expanded in cell culture media supplemented with either hPL or FBS. Consequently, proliferative capacity, immunophenotypic characteristics and multilineage differentiation potential of the derived cells were evaluated on monolayer culture (2D) and on synthetic scaffolds fabricated from poly 'lactic-co-glycolic' acid (PLGA) (3D). The functionality of the induced cells was examined by measuring the concentration of osteogenic markers ALP, OCN and OPN at different time points. Our results indicate that the isolated dental stem cells showed similar mesenchymal characteristics when cultured on hPL or FBS-containing culture media. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and H&E staining revealed the proper adherence of the derived cells on the 3D scaffold cultures. Moreover, the increase in the concentration of osteogenic markers proved that hPL was able to produce functional osteoblasts in both culture conditions (2D and 3D), in a way similar to FBS culture. These results reveal that hPL provides a suitable substitute to the animal-derived serum, for the growth and functionality of both SCAP and PDLSCs. Thus the use of hPL, in combination with PLGA scaffolds, can be useful in future clinical trials for dental regeneration.",Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among health care workers in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063488,PloS one,2019 05 10,Nation-wide hepatitis B vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCWs) is not well researched in China.

In this way they might influence whether a cell is sensitive or resistant to a certain drug. So far, only a limited number of relatively small scale studies comprising few cell lines and/or drugs have been performed. To obtain a broader view on miRNAs and their association with drug response, we investigated the expression levels of 411 miRNAs in relation to drug sensitivity in 36 breast cancer cell lines. For this purpose IC50 values of a drug screen involving 34 drugs were associated with miRNA expression data of the same breast cancer cell lines. Since molecular subtype of the breast cancer cell lines is considered a confounding factor in drug association studies, multivariate analysis taking subtype into account was performed on significant miRNA-drug associations which retained 13 associations. These associations consisted of 11 different miRNAs and eight different drugs (among which Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Veliparib). The taxanes, Paclitaxel and Docetaxel, were the only drugs having miRNAs in common: hsa-miR-187-5p and hsa-miR-106a-3p indicative of drug resistance while Paclitaxel sensitivity alone associated with hsa-miR-556-5p. Tivantinib was associated with hsa-let-7d-5p and hsa-miR-18a-5p for sensitivity and hsa-miR-637 for resistance. Drug sensitivity was associated with hsa-let-7a-5p for Bortezomib, hsa-miR-135a-3p for JNJ-707 and hsa-miR-185-3p for Panobinostat. Drug resistance was associated with hsa-miR-182-5p for Veliparib and hsa-miR-629-5p for Tipifarnib. Pathway analysis for significant miRNAs was performed to reveal biological roles, aiding to find a potential mechanistic link for the observed associations with drug response. By doing so hsa-miR-187-5p was linked to the cell cycle G2-M checkpoint in line with this checkpoint being the target of taxanes. In conclusion, our study shows that miRNAs could potentially serve as biomarkers for intrinsic drug resistance and that pathway analyses can provide additional information in this context.",Using fecal microbiota as biomarkers for predictions of performance in the selective breeding process of pedigree broiler breeders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063485,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Much work has been dedicated to identifying members of the microbial gut community that have potential to augment the growth rate of agricultural animals including chickens. Here, we assessed any correlations between the fecal microbiome, a proxy for the gut microbiome, and feed efficiency or weight gain at the pedigree chicken level, the highest tier of the production process. Because selective breeding is conducted at the pedigree level, our aim was to determine if microbiome profiles could be used to predict feed conversion or weight gain in order to improve selective breeding. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, we profiled the microbiomes of high and low weight gain (WG) birds and good and poor feed efficient (FE) birds in two pedigree lineages of broiler chickens. We also aimed to understand the dynamics of the microbiome with respect to maturation. A time series experiment was conducted, where fecal samples of chickens were collected at 6 points of the rearing process and the microbiome of these samples profiled. We identified OTUs differences at different taxonomic levels in the fecal community between high and low performing birds within each genetic line, indicating a specificity of the microbial community profiles correlated to performance factors. Using machine-learning methods, we built a classification model that could predict feed conversion performance from the fecal microbial community. With respect to maturation, we found that the fecal microbiome is dynamic in early life but stabilizes after 3 weeks of age independent of lineage. Our results indicate that the fecal microbiome profile can be used to predict feed conversion, but not weight gain in these pedigree lines. From the time series experiments, it appears that these predictions can be evaluated as early as 20 days of age. Our data also indicates that there is a genetic factor for the microbiome profile.",High serum CRP influences myocardial miRNA profiles in ischemia-reperfusion injury of rat heart.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063484,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Prognosis of myocardial infarction tends to be worse when serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is high. miRNAs are also known to be involved in different pathogeneses of heart diseases such as myocardial infarction.

To confirm this hypothesis, we performed global miRNA expression profiling of myocardium using IRI and CRP infusion rat model.",Phospholipid levels in blood during community-acquired pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063483,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Phospholipids, major constituents of bilayer cell membranes, are present in large amounts in pulmonary surfactant and play key roles in cell signaling. Here, we aim at finding clinically useful disease markers in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using comprehensive phospholipid profiling in blood and modeling of changes between sampling time points. Serum samples from 33 patients hospitalized with CAP were collected at admission, three hours after the start of intravenous antibiotics, Day 1 (at 12-24 h), Day 2 (at 36-48 h), and several weeks after recovery. A profile of 75 phospholipid species including quantification of the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) was determined using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To control for possible enzymatic degradation of LPCs, serum autotaxin levels were examined. Twenty-two of the 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CAP received a laboratory-verified CAP diagnosis by microbial culture or microbial DNA detection by qPCR. All major phospholipid species, especially the LPCs, were pronouncedly decreased in the acute stage of illness. Total and individual LPC concentrations increased shortly after the initiation of antibiotic treatment, concentrations were at their lowest 3h after the initiation, and increased after Day 1. The total LPC concentration increased by a change ratio of 1.6-1.7 between acute illness and Day 2, and by a ratio of 3.7 between acute illness and full disease resolution. Autotaxin levels were low in acute illness and showed little changes over time, contradicting a hypothesis of enzymatic degradation causing the low levels of LPCs. In this sample of patients with CAP, the results demonstrate that LPC concentration changes in serum of patients with CAP closely mirrored the early transition from acute illness to recovery after the initiation of antibiotics. LPCs should be further explored as potential disease stage biomarkers in CAP and for their potential physiological role during recovery."

Based on Miryoku Engineering and the Evaluation Grid Method, this study interviewed 22 frequent users to get concrete features of game design; Moreover, 210 subjects were divided into high, medium, and low involvement groups according to CIP measures, and then this study used Multiple Regression analysis to determine whether players with different levels of involvement had different perceptions of the design features of music games. The results found 44 concrete features and six original evaluations items of game design, and also discovered that there were perception differences in different involvement groups, and only two concrete design features significantly influenced all three groups: 'Extra games to earn more points after completing levels' and 'Playable without internet'.",In silico identification of genetic mutations conferring resistance to acetohydroxyacid synthase inhibitors: A case study of Kochia scoparia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063467,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Mutations that confer herbicide resistance are a primary concern for herbicide-based chemical control of invasive plants and are often under-characterized structurally and functionally. As the outcome of selection pressure, resistance mutations usually result from repeated long-term applications of herbicides with the same mode of action and are discovered through extensive field trials. Here we used acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) of Kochia scoparia (KsAHAS) as an example to demonstrate that, given the sequence of a target protein, the impact of genetic mutations on ligand binding could be evaluated and resistance mutations could be identified using a biophysics-based computational approach. Briefly, the 3D structures of wild-type (WT) and mutated KsAHAS-herbicide complexes were constructed by homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The resistance profile of two AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, tribenuron methyl and thifensulfuron methyl, was obtained by estimating their binding affinity with 29 KsAHAS (1 WT and 28 mutated) using 6 molecular mechanical (MM) and 18 hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods in combination with three structure sampling strategies. By comparing predicted resistance with experimentally determined resistance in the 29 biotypes of K. scoparia field populations, we identified the best method (i.e., MM-PBSA with single structure) out of all tested methods for the herbicide-KsAHAS system, which exhibited the highest accuracy (up to 100%) in discerning mutations conferring resistance or susceptibility to the two AHAS inhibitors. Our results suggest that the in silico approach has the potential to be widely adopted for assessing mutation-endowed herbicide resistance on a case-by-case basis.",Incidence and complications of perioperative atrial fibrillation after non-cardiac surgery for malignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063466,PloS one,2019 05 10,"Perioperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is one of the common arrhythmias in the setting of non-cardiac surgeries for malignancy.

Based on 93,566 to 181,246 annotated unigenes of the four species, we identified 1,117 one-to-one orthologous genes and subsequently constructed the phylogenetic trees that are consistent with previous studies. Together with the tree, the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions presented decreased evolutionary rates from the D. rerio branch to the sub-branch clustered by P. flavescens and P. fluviatilis. The specific 93 fast-evolving genes and 57 positively selected genes in P. flavescens, compared with 22 shared fast-evolving genes among P. fluviatilis, G. cernua, and S. lucioperca, showed an intrinsic foundation that ensure its adaptation to the warmer Great Lakes and farther south, especially in functional terms like ""Cul4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex."" Meanwhile, the specific 78 fast-evolving genes and 41 positively selected genes in S. lucioperca drew a clear picture of how it evolved to a large and elongated body with camera-type eyes and muscle strength so that it could occupy the highest position in the food web.

Here we use principle component analysis (PCA) and path analysis to explore how different aspects of human sociality interact. We demonstrate two distinct clusters in both sexes relating to (i) romantic relationships and (ii) wider social engagement, such as that with the local community. These two domains of relationship were associated with different dispositional traits: individual variation in impulsivity in the former, and in empathy and avoidant attachment in the latter. Although these clusters were broadly similar across both sexes, clearer differentiation is evident in males. In females only, support network size was positively related to the anxious dimension of attachment and, unlike in males, was not related to feelings of inclusion in the local community. This suggests that support networks may play different roles in the two sexes, indicating a productive line of future research. These findings have important practical applications: loneliness interventions that target the specific type of relationship that is felt to be lacking and the associated dispositional traits are likely to be more effective than more generic approaches.",What's in a name? A preliminary event-related potential study of response to name in preschool children with and without autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063462,PloS one,2019 05 10,"The ability to selectively respond to one's own name is important for social and language development, and is disrupted in atypically developing populations (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). Research with typically developing samples using event-related potentials (ERPs) has demonstrated that the subject's own name (SON) is differentiated from other stimuli at both early sensory and later cognitive stages of auditory processing. While neural indices of response to name have been researched extensively in adults, no such studies have been conducted with typically developing preschool children or children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study investigated ERP response to name in a sample of typically developing (TD) preschoolers (n = 19; mean age = 4.3 years) as well as a small, exploratory comparison group of preschoolers with ASD (n = 13; mean age = 4.4 years). TD preschoolers exhibited significantly greater negativity to SON over frontal regions than to an unfamiliar nonsense name, consistent with the adult SON negativity component. This component was present whether the name was spoken by a parent or an unfamiliar adult, suggesting that it reflects SON-specific processing rather than broad self-relevant information processing. Comparing preschoolers with ASD to the TD children revealed a significant SON negativity component across both groups. The amplitude of the SON negativity response was significantly correlated with social variables in the ASD group, though these correlations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of the SON component in preschool children with and without ASD.",An integrative association method for omics data based on a modified Fisher's method with application to childhood asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063461,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"The development of high-throughput biotechnologies allows the collection of omics data to study the biological mechanisms underlying complex diseases at different levels, such as genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. However, each technology is designed to collect a specific type of omics data. Thus, the association between a disease and one type of omics data is usually tested individually, but this strategy is suboptimal. To better articulate biological processes and increase the consistency of variant identification, omics data from various platforms need to be integrated. In this report, we introduce an approach that uses a modified Fisher's method (denoted as Omnibus-Fisher) to combine separate p-values of association testing for a trait and SNPs, DNA methylation markers, and RNA sequencing, calculated by kernel machine regression into an overall gene-level p-value to account for correlation between omics data. To consider all possible disease models, we extend Omnibus-Fisher to an optimal test by using perturbations. In our simulations, a usual Fisher's method has inflated type I error rates when directly applied to correlated omics data. In contrast, Omnibus-Fisher preserves the expected type I error rates. Moreover, Omnibus-Fisher has increased power compared to its optimal version when the true disease model involves all types of omics data. On the other hand, the optimal Omnibus-Fisher is more powerful than its regular version when only one type of data is causal. Finally, we illustrate our proposed method by analyzing whole-genome genotyping, DNA methylation data, and RNA sequencing data from a study of childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans."

Recent physiological measures of listening effort have utilized pupil dilation. Using a combination of physiological and subjective measures of listening effort, this study aimed to identify differences in listening effort during 2 auditory tasks: sentence recognition and word recognition. Method Pupil dilation and subjective ratings of listening effort were obtained for auditory tasks utilizing AzBio sentences recognition and Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 words recognition, across 3 listening situations: in quiet, at +6 dB signal-to-noise ratio, and at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Task accuracy was recorded for each of the 6 conditions, as well as peak pupil dilation and a subjective rating of listening effort. Results A significant impact of listening situation (quiet vs. noise) and task type (sentence recognition vs. word recognition) on both physiological and subjective measures was found. There was a significant interaction between listening situation and task type, suggesting that contextual cues may only be beneficial when audibility is uncompromised. The current study found no correlation between the physiological and subjective measures, possibly suggesting that these measures analyze different aspects of cognitive effort in a listening task.","Predicting Persistent Orofacial Pain: The Role of Illness Perceptions, Anxiety, and Depression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063437,JDR clinical and translational research,2019 05 07,Persistent orofacial pain (POFP) can be caused by a range of conditions affecting the mouth and face and is often associated with significant disability.

Many IBD patients avoid numerous types of foods in fear of disease exacerbation. The aim of the study was to investigate dietary beliefs and food avoidance among pediatric patients with IBD. This questionnaire-based study was conducted in three University-affiliated children's hospitals in Poland. Data were collected from parents of children who were diagnosed with IBD. A total of 155 parents of IBD patients participated in the survey: 104 (67.1%) had a child with Crohn's disease and 51 (32.9%) with ulcerative colitis. Parents of older children and those with longer disease duration predicted diet being considered one of the causative agents of IBD, and differences were statistically significant (P = .01 and P = .04, respectively). Also, patients with a shorter history of disease rarely shared food with other family members (P = .02). In total, 61.5% of patients avoided some kind of food in fear of disease flares. In the parent's opinion, the food the children liked but avoided included fried dishes, sweets (e.g., chocolate, cookies, cakes, candies, jellies), and fast food. Due to their dietary beliefs, parents of children with IBD commonly introduced dietary restrictions for their offspring. Frequent and unjustified food avoidance may influence not only nutritional status but also general well-being of pediatric patients. Our results underscore the urgent need for IBD patients and parents of ill children to receive reliable dietary advice based on strong scientific evidence.","Use of ""C9/11 Mismatch"" Control Small Interfering RNA Reveals Sequence-Related Off-Target Effect on Coagulation of an Small Interfering RNA Targeting Mouse Coagulation Factor XII.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063435,Nucleic acid therapeutics,2019 05 07,"Recently, our group reported that a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting coagulation factor XII (siF12) leads to an unexpected prothrombotic response in a mouse model where venous thrombosis follows inhibition of endogenous anticoagulants. In this study, we aimed to clarify this unexpected response by evaluating the effects of this siF12 (here, siF12-A) on plasma coagulation through thrombin generation (TG). Besides a routine negative control siRNA (siNEG), we included extra siRNA controls: one siRNA similar to siF12-A except for positions 9-11 of the siRNA that are replaced with its complementary base pairs (siF12-AC9/11), and a second siRNA against F12 (siF12-B). Three days after injection, a significant increase in TG peak height was observed solely for animals injected with siF12-A and siF12-AC9/11, which is considered prothrombotic. As this change in coagulation was unrelated to FXII we conclude that it was off-target.

Purpose:
 Childhood brain tumors (CBTs) and their treatment increase the risk of secondary neoplasms (SNs). We studied the incidence of secondary craniospinal tumors with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening in a national cohort of survivors of CBT treated with radiotherapy, and we analyzed the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) data on SNs in survivors of CBT with radiotherapy registered as a part of the primary tumor treatment. 
Methods:
 A total of 73 survivors of CBT participated in the MRI study (mean follow-up of 19 ± 6.2 years). The incidence of SNs in a cohort of CBT patients (N = 569) was retrieved from the FCR (mean follow-up of 11 ± 12.9 years). Brain tumors were diagnosed at age ≤16 years between the years 1970 and 2008 in the clinical study and the years 1963 and 2010 in the FCR population. 
Results:
 Secondary brain tumors, meningiomas in all and schwannoma in one, were found in 6 of the 73 (8.2%) survivors with a mean of 23 ± 4.3 years after the diagnosis of the primary tumor. The cumulative incidence was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-25.1) in 25 years of follow-up. In the FCR data, the 25-year cumulative incidence of SNs was 2.4% (95% CI 1.3-4.1); only two brain tumors, no meningiomas, were registered. 
Conclusion:
 Survivors of CBT treated with radiotherapy have a high incidence of meningiomas, which are rarely registered in the FCR.",Effect of Slab Thickness on the Detection of Pulmonary Nodules by Use of CT Maximum and Minimum Intensity Projection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063429,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2019 05 07,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of slab thickness on the detection of pulmonary nodules by use of maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) and minimum-intensity-projection (MinIP) to process CT images. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Chest CT data of 221 patients with pulmonary nodules were retrospectively analyzed. Nodules were categorized into two groups according to density: solid nodules (SNs) and subsolid nodules (SSNs). Pulmonary nodules were independently evaluated by two radiologists using axial CT images with 1-mm and 5-mm section thickness and MIP and MinIP images. MIP images for SN detection and MinIP images for SSN detection were separately reconstructed with four (5, 10, 15, 20 mm) and three (3, 8, 15 mm) slab thicknesses. The numbers and locations of detected nodules were recorded, and interobserver agreement was assessed. For each reader, the differences in nodule detection rates were evaluated in different series of images. RESULTS. Among the different series of images, interobserver agreements for detecting nodules were all good to excellent (κ ≥ 0.687). For total SNs and SNs with a diameter < 5 mm, detection rates on 10-mm MIP images were significantly higher than in other series of images (reader 1, 84.5% and 83.8%; reader 2, 83.6% and 82.2%). For total SSNs and SSNs < 5 mm, detection rates on 3-mm MinIP images were significantly higher than those in other series of images, except for 1-mm (reader 1, 93.3% and 78.6%; reader 2, 95.0% and 81.0%). CONCLUSION. Ten-millimeter MIP images are extremely efficient for detecting SNs. Three-millimeter MinIP images are more useful for visualizing SSNs, the efficiency being comparable to that achieved by use of 1-mm axial images.",Use of Imaging in the Emergency Department: Do Individual Physicians Contribute to Variation?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063428,AJR.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the magnitude of physician variation in the use of imaging and the factors associated with variation in an urban emergency department (ED) in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective cohort study was conducted from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014, in the ED of a level I adult trauma center in the northeastern United States. The study cohort included all patient visits to the ED during the study period. We built hierarchic and logistic regression models to determine per-physician utilization of low- and high-cost imaging, and we identified factors correlated with variation in use. Global (i.e., intraclass correlation coefficient) and individual variability metrics were used to profile physician variation after controlling for patient-, visit-, and physician-related covariates. RESULTS. A total of 56,793 patients presented to the ED during the study; of these patients, 49.5% (28,135) underwent imaging, with 38.2% (21,686) undergoing low-cost imaging and 21.9% (12,430) undergoing high-cost imaging. Statistically significant predictors of imaging orders were patient age and sex, number of secondary diagnoses, certain primary diagnoses, time of arrival in the ED, and ED crowding. Unadjusted and adjusted intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.0072 and 0.0066, respectively, for low-cost imaging, and 0.0097 and 0.0090, respectively, for high-cost imaging. The coefficient of variation for adjusted imaging odds ratios was 10.9% and 14.0% for low- and high-cost imaging, respectively, indicating a moderate degree of variation. CONCLUSION. Unexplained and moderate variation in imaging utilization exists among ED physicians, even after controlling for patient, visit, and physician characteristics. Improvement initiatives using well-defined ED imaging quality measures may help improve quality and reduce waste.",Reliability of Single-Slice-Based 2D CT Texture Analysis of Renal Masses: Influence of Intra- and Interobserver Manual Segmentation Variability on Radiomic Feature Reproducibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063427,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,2019 05 07,"OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to investigate the potential influence of intra- and interobserver manual segmentation variability on the reliability of single-slice-based 2D CT texture analysis of renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS. For this retrospective study, 30 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma were included from a public database. For intra- and interobserver analyses, three radiologists with varying degrees of experience segmented the tumors from unenhanced CT and corticomedullary phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) in different sessions. Each radiologist was blind to the image slices selected by other radiologists and him- or herself in the previous session. A total of 744 texture features were extracted from original, filtered, and transformed images. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used for reliability analysis. RESULTS. In the intraobserver analysis, the rates of features with good to excellent reliability were 84.4-92.2% for unenhanced CT and 85.5-93.1% for CECT. Considering the mean rates of unenhanced CT and CECT, having high experience resulted in better reliability rates in terms of the intraobserver analysis. In the interobserver analysis, the rates were 76.7% for unenhanced CT and 84.9% for CECT. The gray-level cooccurrence matrix and first-order feature groups yielded higher good to excellent reliability rates on both unenhanced CT and CECT. Filtered and transformed images resulted in more features with good to excellent reliability than the original images did on both unenhanced CT and CECT. CONCLUSION. Single-slice-based 2D CT texture analysis of renal masses is sensitive to intra- and interobserver manual segmentation variability. Therefore, it may lead to nonreproducible results in radiomic analysis unless a reliability analysis is considered in the workflow."

Areas covered: In this narrative review, the authors discuss key points about CRPS definitions, diagnostic criteria and pitfalls, pathophysiological hypotheses, and treatment strategies with particular reference to pharmacotherapy. The article was based on a literature search using PubMed while the available guidelines for the management of CRPS were also examined. Expert opinion: According to the quality of evidence, pharmacological interventions for CRPS seem to be more effective all the more so when they act on peripheral mechanisms, particularly on nociceptive pain, and when applied early in the disease, while reliable evidence about central mechanisms of chronic pain in CRPS is lacking. In our opinion, drug therapy should be preferred as early as possible, particularly in warm forms of CRPS to prevent significant functional limitation, psychological distress, and social and economic fallout.",Multivariate Method for Inferential Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Gene Expression Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063414,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,2019 05 07,"Microarray technology is widely recognized as one of the most important tools when it comes to understanding genetic expression in biological processes.

The current drugs are toxic, duration of treatment is long, there is regional variation in efficacy, and emergence of resistance is common. Areas covered: This manuscript is based on literature derived from PubMed and reviews the current and emerging medications for the treatment of leishmaniasis. A single dose of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) and multidrug therapy are the best options for VL in the Indian subcontinent (ISC), while a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin remains the treatment of choice for VL in Africa where efficacious and safe regimens are needed for HIV-VL coinfection. L-AmB at a total dose of 18-21 mg/kg is the recommended regimen for VL in the Mediterranean region, South America and for HIV-VL coinfection. Treatment of CL varies from observation, local or systemic therapy depending on severity of lesions, etiological species and its potential to develop into mucosal leishmaniasis. Expert opinion: The monitoring of single-dose L-AmB and combination therapy in the ISC is essential. Effective short-course combination therapy is needed for the treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis and HIV-VL. Better evidence for treatment is still needed along with safer and shorter treatment options for CL and MCL.",Urbanization and Altitude Are Associated with Low Kidney Function in Peru.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063411,High altitude medicine & biology,2019 05 07,"Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M., J. Jaime Miranda, Robert H. Gilman, Offdan Narvaez-Guerra, Karela Herrera-Enriquez, Josefina Medina-Lezama, Liam Smeeth, William Checkley, and Antonio Bernabe-Ortiz; on behalf of the CRONICAS Cohort Study Group. Urbanization and altitude are associated with low kidney function in Peru. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2019. 
Background:
 Kidney health needs to be studied in low- and middle-income countries with populations living at high altitude and undergoing urbanization. We studied whether greater level of urbanization was associated with worse kidney function and higher hemoglobin was associated with worse kidney function at high altitude. 
Methods:
 Cross-sectional analysis of population-based studies in Peru including five sites at different altitude above the sea level and urbanization level (in decreasing order of urbanization): Lima (sea level), Arequipa (2335 m), urban Puno (3825 m), Tumbes (sea level), and rural Puno (3825 m). The exposures were urbanization and altitude as per study site, and hemoglobin (g/dL). The outcome was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
Results:
 Four thousand two hundred eight people were studied: mean age was 57.4 years (standard deviation: 12.4) and 51.9% were women. In comparison to rural Puno, eGFR was similar in Lima; in comparison to rural Puno, Arequipa, urban Puno, and Tumbes had worse eGFR, for example, in Arequipa, β = -8.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.90 to -5.24). Intermediate (β = -8.60; 95% CI: -10.55 to -6.66) and high (β = -11.21; 95% CI: -14.19 to -8.24) altitude were negatively correlated with eGFR when only urban places were analyzed. At high altitude, there was a trend for a negative association between hemoglobin and eGFR: β = -1.09 (95% CI: -2.22 to 0.04). 
Conclusions:
 Apparently, higher altitude and level of urbanization, except for one highly urbanized site, were associated with worse kidney function. Our findings suggest that some of the adverse impact of high altitude on kidney function has been balanced by the lower risk conferred by rural environments.",Identification of a Novel Frameshift Variant of POU3F4 and Genetic Counseling of Korean Incomplete Partition Type III Subjects Based on Detailed Genotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063410,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,2019 06 04,"
Aim:
 The aim of this study was to report a novel POU Class 3 Homeobox 4 (POU3F4) variant and to provide further guidance on genetic counseling for incomplete partition (IP) type III families in the Korean population by showing two new contrasting cases in terms of genotypes and inheritance. 
Materials and Methods:
 Two consecutively recruited hearing-impaired probands with seemingly nonsyndromic features and their biological mothers were included in this study. Sanger sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed for POU3F4. 
Results:
 A novel frameshift variant of POU3F4, c.852delC (p.Ile285Serfs*3), was identified in one of the patients. This mutation is predicted to truncate the protein within the POU homeodomain, resulting in the complete loss of the last nucleus localization signal. The proband's biological mother was also shown to be a carrier of this c.852delC (p.Ile285Serfs*3) mutant allele. A de novo genomic deletion on chromosome Xq21.2 was confirmed in another subject via quantitative PCR. This subject's biological mother, however, was not a carrier of this deletion. This indicates that the large upstream deletion of POU3F4 in the second proband occurred de novo. This finding is compatible with the previously proposed tendency for a high de novo rate of large genomic deletions involving the X-linked deafness-2 (DFNX2) locus. 
Conclusion:
 This study adds a novel, probably pathogenic POU3F4 truncation variant to the literature and provides guidance toward effective genetic counseling for IP III subjects based on more frequent de novo occurrence of POU3F4 deletions than POU3F4 point variants.",Relationship Between Genetic Polymorphisms of the TNF Gene and Hallux Valgus Susceptibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063409,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,2019 06 04,"
Background:
 Hallux valgus (HV) is a type of forefoot deformity affecting ∼23% of adults. Previous studies have shown that HV is highly heritable. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine involved in bone remodeling and plays essential roles in osteoarthritis and chronic inflammatory bone diseases, including HV. 
Methods:
 A total of 1,788 Chinese women comprising 637 HV subjects and 1,151 controls were recruited. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in TNF and its promoter regions were selected and genotyped. Genetic association analyses were performed to investigate potential susceptibility SNPs. Bioinformatic and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses were conducted to examine the functional consequences of the SNPs identified as being significantly associated with HV. 
Results:
 SNP rs1800629, which is located at the 5' end of the promoter region of TNF, was identified as significantly associated with HV status in Chinese women (OR = 0.56, p = 2.12 × 10-6). Bioinformatic analyses using RegulomeDB indicated that this SNP has important functional significance, but subsequent eQTL analyses did not identify a significant association between rs1800629 and TNF gene expression. In addition, 26 genes with cis-eQTL for rs1800629 were identified. 
Conclusions:
 This study identified a susceptibility SNP for HV located within the promoter region of the TNF gene. Bioinformatic and eQTL analyses linked this SNP to 26 genes but not to TNF. Functional studies are needed to more fully characterize the effects of this SNP.","""Placebo Effects"" in Clinical Trials Evaluating Patients with Uncontrolled Persistent Asthma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063408,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,2019 05 07,"Patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma can show substantial health improvements when administered placebo.",The eicosapentaenoic acid:arachidonic acid ratio and its clinical utility in cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063407,Postgraduate medicine,2019 06 13,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a key anti-inflammatory/anti-aggregatory long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid. Conversely, the omega-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA) is a precursor to a number of pro-inflammatory/pro-aggregatory mediators. EPA acts competitively with AA for the key cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes to form less inflammatory products. As a result, the EPA:AA ratio may be a marker of chronic inflammation, with a lower ratio corresponding to higher levels of inflammation. It is now well established that inflammation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. This review examines the role of the EPA:AA ratio as a marker of cardiovascular disease and the relationship between changes in the ratio (mediated by EPA intake) and changes in cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies have shown that a lower EPA:AA ratio is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and vascular disease. Increasing the EPA:AA ratio through treatment with purified EPA has been shown in clinical studies to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and reduces the risk of cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. The EPA:AA ratio is a valuable predictor of cardiovascular risk. Results from ongoing clinical trials will help to define thresholds for EPA treatment associated with better clinical outcomes.",Pharmacotherapeutic management of epilepsy in MERRF syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063406,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,2019 06 11,"Introduction: Epilepsy is a prominent feature of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)-syndrome. The most frequent seizure type is myoclonic seizures, of which the treatment is challenging and empiric. Areas covered: Herein, the author summarises and discusses previous and recent findings of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment in MERRF-syndrome. Expert opinion: MERRF-syndrome is a predominantly maternally inherited, multisystem mitochondrial disorder caused by pathogenic variants predominantly of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Canonical clinical features of MERRF include myoclonus, epilepsy, ataxia, and myopathy. Additionally, other manifestations in the CNS, peripheral nerves, eyes, ears, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine organs may occur (MERRF-plus). Today, MERRF is considered rather as myoclonic ataxia than as myoclonic epilepsy. Genotypically, MERRF is due to mutations in 13 mtDNA-located genes and 1 nDNA-located gene. According to the modified Smith-score, the strongest gene-disease relationship exists for MT-TK, MT-TL1, and POLG1. Epilepsy is the second most frequent phenotypic feature of MERRF. Seizure-types associated with MERRF include focal myoclonic, focal clonic, and focal atonic seizures, generalized myoclonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, and myoclonic-atonic seizures, or typical absences. Treatment of myoclonic epilepsy relies on expert judgments recommending levetiracetam, together with clonazepam, or topiramate, zonisamide, or piracetam in monotherapy as the first line AEDs."

Understanding the wrinkling phenomena of heterogeneous systems with continuously variable features is still a challenge. In this work, we propose an unconventional strategy to prepare periodic thickness-gradient metal films on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates by masking of copper grids which are weaved by orthometric copper wires. It is found that a periodic thickness-gradient film spontaneously forms during the sputtering process because of the specific structures of the copper grids. Surface wrinkles are strongly modulated by the copper grid structures and are position-dependent within a period. A phase diagram has been established to correlate the wrinkle morphology with the mesh size and film thickness. The film surfaces at mesh centers are evolved from labyrinth wrinkling to herringbone wrinkling and then to stripe wrinkling and finally to wrinkling-free state when the mesh size decreases and/or the film thickness increases. The morphological characteristics, evolutional behaviors, and underlying mechanisms of such wrinkling are discussed in detail based on the stress theory and numerical simulation.",Reversible Aggregation of Chlorophyll Derivative Induced by Phase Transition of Lipid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063389,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 10,"Controlling the supramolecular organization of pigment molecules will provide innovative materials that exhibit variable optical properties. In nature, photosynthetic systems employ chlorophyllous supramolecules in which each pigment molecule is suitably organized in proteins, and their properties are adequately optimized by changing the structures of the surrounding amino acid residues. Here, we report a strategy for varying the aggregation behavior of a chlorophyll derivative by using a phase-transition phenomenon of lipid bilayers. Methyl pyropheophorbide a (MPP) was employed as a chlorophyllous pigment in our artificial system, and synthetic phosphatidylcholines with saturated acyl chain(s) were also used. The MPP molecules successfully accumulated within the lipid bilayer of liposomes without changing the vesicular structure. When the lipid bilayer was in a gel form (under the phase-transition temperature, Tm), the embedded MPP aggregated to yield a dimeric form showing red-shifted absorption bands and circular dichroism signals. When the solutions of MPP-containing liposomes were heated to higher temperatures than their Tm, MPP disaggregated to monomeric form as the absorption spectrum changed into its original fashion in dichloromethane. The reversible thermochromic (dis)aggregation of the MPP molecules had good cyclability. Additional careful examination of the phase transition in the MPP-lipid co-assemblies clarified that the critical temperatures of the MPP (dis)aggregation were in good agreement with the phase-transition temperatures of the pigment-containing bilayers. The reversible MPP aggregation in the lipid bilayers occurred in a wide range of temperatures (around 10-55 °C) by changing the length of the diacyl side chains of phospholipids. The reversible thermochromism of the chlorophyllous system was established by varying the nature of the surrounding lipid bilayer.

Herein, we report the ""aromatic metamorphosis"" of indoles into 1,2-benzazaborins via the insertion of boron into the C2-N bond. This endocyclic insertion consists of a reductive ring-opening using lithium metal and a subsequent trapping of the resulting dianionic species with organoboronic esters.

These long lifetimes are accompanied by an intriguing temperature-dependence of the Kerr amplitude, which increases with temperature up to 50 K and then abruptly switches sign. Using ab initio simulations, we explain the latter behavior in terms of the intrinsic electron-phonon coupling and the activation of transitions to secondary valleys. The phonon-assisted scattering of the photoexcited electron-hole pairs prepares a valley spin polarization within the first few ps after laser excitation. The sign of the total valley magnetization, and thus the Kerr amplitude, switches as a function of temperature, as conduction and valence band states exhibit different phonon-mediated intervalley scattering rates. However, the electron-phonon scattering on the ps time scale does not provide an explanation for the long spin lifetimes. Hence, we deduce that the initial spin polarization must be transferred into spin states, which are protected from the intrinsic electron-phonon coupling, and are most likely resident charge carriers, which are not part of the itinerant valence or conduction band states.","2 H-Azirines as C-C Annulation Reagents in Cu-Catalyzed Synthesis of Furo[3,2- c]quinolone Derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063384,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"A method of furo-annulation of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylates with 3-arylazirines under Cu(II) catalysis was developed to synthesize a variety of 2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2- c]quinolones bearing a carbamate group at the C2 position.

Now we demonstrate that the selectivity in this process can be optimized for CO production by choice of molecular sieve crystals as supports. The NPs are enveloped within the crystals with controlled nanopore environments that allow tuning of the catalytic selectivity to minimize methanation and favor the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Pure silica MFI (S-1)-fixed rhodium NPs exhibited maximized CO selectivity at high CO2 conversions, whereas aluminosilicate MFI zeolite-supported rhodium NPs displayed high methane selectivity under the equivalent conditions. Strong correlations were observed between the nanoporous environment and catalytic selectivity, indicating that S-1 minimizes hydrogen spillover and favors fast desorption of CO to limit deep hydrogenation. Materials in this class appear to offer appealing opportunities for tailoring selective supported catalysts for a variety of reactions.",Typical Stochastic Paths in the Transient Assembly of Fibrous Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063371,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 06 10,"When chemically fueled, molecular self-assembly can sustain dynamic aggregates of polymeric fibers-hydrogels-with tunable properties. If the fuel supply is finite, the hydrogel is transient, as competing reactions switch molecular subunits between active and inactive states, drive fiber growth and collapse, and dissipate energy. Because the process is away from equilibrium, the structure and mechanical properties can reflect the history of preparation. As a result, the formation of these active materials is not readily susceptible to a statistical treatment in which the configuration and properties of the molecular building blocks specify the resulting material structure. Here, we illustrate a stochastic-thermodynamic and information-theoretic framework for this purpose and apply it to these self-annihilating materials. Among the possible paths, the framework variationally identifies those that are typical-loosely, the minimum number with the majority of the probability. We derive these paths from computer simulations of experimentally-informed stochastic chemical kinetics and a physical kinetics model for the growth of an active hydrogel. The model reproduces features observed by confocal microscopy, including the fiber length, lifetime, and abundance as well as the observation of fast fiber growth and stochastic fiber collapse. The typical mesoscopic paths we extract are less than 0.23% of those possible, but they accurately reproduce material properties such as mean fiber length.",Effects of Acetylshikonin on the Infection and Replication of Coxsackievirus A16 in Vitro and in Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063370,Journal of natural products,2019 05 24,"Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) is one of the most prevalent enteroviral pathogens associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. In the present study, we have investigated (1) whether the bioactive compound acetylshikonin (AS) inhibits CVA16 infection in vitro and in vivo and (2) the potential antiviral mechanism(s). The results suggest that AS is nontoxic at concentrations of up to 5 μmol/L and could directly inactivate virus particles at relatively low concentrations (0.08 μmol/L), thereby rendering CVA16 incapable of cellular entry. Correspondingly, the expression of viral RNA in vitro was also reduced 100-fold ( P < 0.05) when compared to infected, untreated controls. Results from a CVA16-infected neonatal mouse model indicate that, in comparison to the virus-infected, untreated group, body weights of the mice in the virus-infected, compound-treated group increased more steadily with less severe clinical symptoms. In addition, viral loads in internal organs significantly decreased in treated animals, concomitantly with both reduced pathology and diminished expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-6. In conclusion, AS exerted an inhibitory effect on CVA16 infection in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides a basis for further investigations of AS-type compounds to develop therapeutics to mitigate CVA-associated disease in children.",Prioritization Approaches for Substances of Emerging Concern in Groundwater: A Critical Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063369,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 10,"Risks from emerging contaminants (ECs) in groundwater to human health and aquatic ecology remain difficult to quantify. The number of ECs potentially found in groundwater presents challenges for regulators and water managers regarding selection for monitoring. This study is the first systematic review of prioritization approaches for selecting ECs that may pose a risk in groundwater. Online databases were searched for prioritization approaches relating to ECs in the aquatic environment using standardized key word search combinations. From a total of 672, 33 studies met the eligibility criteria based primarily on the relevance to prioritizing ECs in groundwater. The review revealed the lack of a groundwater specific contaminant prioritization methodology in spite of widely recognized differences between groundwater and surface water environments with regard to pathways to receptors. The findings highlight a lack of adequate evaluation of methodologies for predicting the likelihood of an EC entering groundwater and knowledge gaps regarding the occurrence and fate of ECs in this environment. The review concludes with a proposal for a prioritization framework for ECs in groundwater monitoring that enables priority lists to be updated as new information becomes available for substances with regard to their usage, physicochemical properties, and hazards.",Electronic Communication in Luminescent Dicyanorhenate-Bridged Homotrinuclear Rhenium(I) Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063368,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"A series of cyano-bridged homotrinuclear Re(I) complexes with the general formula of {[Re]'[Re][Re]'}+ {[Re]' = -[ReI(CO)2(LL)(X)]; [Re] = -[(NC)ReI(CO)2(phen)(CN)]-; LL = diimine, diphosphine, or two carbonyl ligands; X = triphenylphosphine or carbonyl ligand} and the corresponding mononuclear complex analogues were synthesized. The structures of most of the trinuclear Re(I) complexes have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The relative orientations of peripheral to central Re(I) units in these structures vary considerably. The photophysical properties of these trinuclear Re(I) complexes have been examined. Except for the trinuclear Re(I) complex with Br2phen ligand, all the other triads display orange to red photoluminescence derived from the 3MLCT [dπ(Re) → π*(phen)] origin of the central Re(I) unit, suggestive of efficient energy transfer between the peripheral chromophores and the central unit. In addition to the efficient energy transfer processes between the Re(I) chromophores in these trinuclear complexes, the ability of the [NC-Re-CN] bridging ligands for electronic coupling between the rhenium metal centers is evidenced by ca. 0.2-0.3 V separation of the two rhenium metal-based oxidation potentials of the chemically equivalent peripheral units.",SO2-Tolerant Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO x over Meso-TiO2@Fe2O3@Al2O3 Metal-Based Monolith Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063367,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 10,"It is an intractable issue to improve the low-temperature SO2-tolerant selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with NH3 because deposited sulfates are difficult to decompose below 300 °C. Herein, we established a low-temperature self-prevention mechanism of mesoporous-TiO2@Fe2O3 core-shell composites against sulfate deposition using experiments and density functional theory. The mesoporous TiO2-shell effectively restrained the deposition of FeSO4 and NH4HSO4 because of weak SO2 adsorption and promoted NH4HSO4 decomposition on the mesoporous-TiO2. The electron transfer at the Fe2O3 (core)-TiO2 (shell) interface accelerated the redox cycle, launching the ""Fast SCR"" reaction, which broadened the low-temperature window. Engineered from the nano- to macro-scale, we achieved one-pot self-installation of mesoporous-TiO2@Fe2O3 composites on the self-tailored AlOOH@Al-mesh monoliths. After the thermal treatment, the mesoporous-TiO2@Fe2O3@Al2O3 monolith catalyst delivered a broad window of 220-420 °C with NO conversion above 90% and had superior SO2 tolerance at 260 °C. The effective heat removal of Al-mesh monolithcatalysts restrained NH3 oxidation to NO and N2O while suppressing the decomposition of NH4NO3 to N2O, and this led to much better high-temperature activity and N2 selectivity. This work supplies a new point for the development of low-temperature SO2-tolerant monolithic SCR catalysts with high N2 selectivity, which is of great significance for both academic interests and practical applications.",An Autonomous Microfluidic Device for Generating Volume-Defined Dried Plasma Spots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063366,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Obtaining plasma from a blood sample and preparing it for subsequent analysis is currently a laborious process involving experienced health-care professionals and centrifugation. We circumvent this by utilizing capillary forces and microfluidic engineering to develop an autonomous plasma sampling device that filters and stores an exact amount of plasma as a dried plasma spot (DPS) from a whole blood sample in less than 6 min. We tested 24 prototype devices with whole blood from 10 volunteers, various input volumes (40-80 μL), and different hematocrit levels (39-45%). The resulting mean plasma volume, assessed gravimetrically, was 11.6 μL with a relative standard deviation similar to manual pipetting (3.0% vs 1.4%). LC-MS/MS analysis of caffeine concentrations in the generated DPS (12 duplicates) showed a strong correlation ( R2 = 0.99) to, but no equivalence with, concentrations prepared from corresponding plasma obtained by centrifugation. The presented autonomous DPS device may enable patient-centric plasma sampling through minimally invasive finger-pricking and allow generatation of volume-defined DPS for quantitative blood analysis.",Photolytic Transformation Products of Decabromodiphenyl Ethane (DBDPE).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063365,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 10,"The photolytic transformation of decabromodiphenyl ethane-a current-use brominated flame retardant and major substitute of the structurally related decabromodiphenyl ether-was investigated in different solvents (toluene, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, and benzyl alcohol). The transformation rate followed pseudo first order kinetics, with increasing half-life ( t1/2) in the order of toluene ( t1/2 = 4.6 min), chlorobenzene ( t1/2 = 14.0 min), dichloromethane ( t1/2 = 27.9 min), and benzyl alcohol ( t1/2 ≈ 60 min). Formation and amount of transformation products varied depending on the solvent used. A detailed study of the hydrodebromination products allowed us to tentatively assign all three possible nonaBDPEs (BDPE 207, 208, and in benzyl alcohol only BDPE 206) and three predominant octaBDPE congeners (BDPE 197, 201, and 202). Next to the reported BDPEs, formation of several oxygen containing transformation products (OxyTPs), dominated by octabrominated OxyTP, was verified by GC-Orbitrap-HRMS analysis. Use of HPLC and Florisil column enabled the separation of OxyTPs and BDPEs, and the polybrominated OxyTPs were most likely tricyclic compounds with almost planar structure.",Combined Effects of pH and Borohydride Reduction on Optical Properties of Humic Substances (HS): A Comparison of Optical Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063364,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 10,"The combined effects of pH and borohydride reduction on the optical properties of a series of humic substances and a lignin model were examined to probe the molecular moieties and interactions that give rise to the observed optical properties of these materials. Increasing the pH from 2 to 12 produced significantly enhanced absorption across the spectra of all samples, with distinct spectral responses observed over pH ranges attributable to the deprotonation of carboxylic acids and phenols. Borohydride reduction substantially attenuated the broadband absorption enhancements with pH, clearly indicating that the loss of absorption due to ketone/aldehyde reduction is coupled with the pH-dependent increase in absorption due to deprotonation of carboxylic acids and phenols. These results cannot be easily explained by a superposition of the spectra of independently absorbing chromophores (superposition model) but are readily interpretable within a charge transfer (CT) model. Changes of fluorescence emission with pH for both untreated and borohydride reduced samples suggest that a pH-dependent structural reorganization of the HS may also be influencing the fluorescence emission. Independent of optical model, these results demonstrate that chemical tests targeted to specific moieties can identify distinct structural differences among HS sources as well as provide insight into the molecular moieties and interactions that produce the observed optical and photochemical properties.",Uniform Alignment of Non-π-Conjugated Species Enhances Deep Ultraviolet Optical Nonlinearity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063363,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 08,"The precision of array of laser applications and manipulation on smaller scales are limited by the so-called 200 nm wall, and breakthroughs rely on the discovery of new materials with transparency and phase matchability in the ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet region.

The substance produces second harmonic generation lasers through direct frequency doubling with incident Yb:KGW femtosecond lasers on an as-synthesized (010) wafer with a size of 14 × 10 × 2.1 mm3. According to the calculated refractive index dispersion curve, the shortest second-harmonic generation (SHG) wavelength is estimated to be 194 nm, the shortest among phosphates and monofluorophosphate.

In certain applications, the lenses are required to operate in harsh and/or extreme environments, for example aerospace, chemical, and biological environments. Under such circumstances, it is critical that the ultrathin flat lenses can be resilient and preserve their outstanding performance. However, the majority of the demonstrated ultrathin flat lenses are based on metal or semiconductor materials that have poor chemical, thermal, and UV stability, which limit their applications. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene ultrathin flat lens that can be applied in harsh environments for different applications, including a low Earth orbit space environment, strong corrosive chemical environments (pH = 0 and pH = 14), and biochemical environment. The graphene lenses have extraordinary environmental stability and can maintain a high level of structural integrity and outstanding focusing performance under different test conditions.

Benefiting from their structural merits, the Sb NTs manifest excellent sodium storage performance with superior rate performance (286 mAh g-1 at 10 A g-1) and extraordinary cycling stability (342 mAh g-1 after 6000 cycles at 1 A g-1). Furthermore, a full cell with Sb NTs as anode and Na3(VOPO4)2F as cathode exhibits a high energy density (252 Wh kg-1) and high output voltage (2.7 V), revealing their significant application promise in the next-generation SIBs.","High-Resolution, Fast, and Shape-Conformable Hydrogen Sensor Platform: Polymer Nanofiber Yarn Coupled with Nanograined Pd@Pt.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063349,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"We report a flexible hydrogen sensing platform based on a single-strand yarn consisting of high-density electrospun nanofibers, on which nanograined Pd or Pd@Pt is coated via yarn spinning followed by sputter deposition. In general, Pd undergoes a phase transition to PdH x (α-PdH x at [H2] < 1% and β-PdH x at [H2] > 2%), in which H atoms act as electron scattering centers, thus increasing the resistance. In our system, the sensors exhibit switchable H2 sensing behaviors, that is, (i) Δ R/ R0 > 0 at [H2] > 1% by the active electron scattering and (ii) Δ R/ R0 < 0 at [H2] < 1% derived from nanograined Pd effects. Due to high mechanical stability stemming from nanogranular morphologies of Pd, which is essential for enduring a huge volume expansion upon exposure to high-concentration H2, we could obtain a wide concentration range (4-0.0001%) H2 detection resolution. Moreover, an ultrathin Pt overlayer coated on Pd offers an accelerated H2 detection capability based on effective gas dissociation and activation properties. Furthermore, by virtue of the core (thread)-shell (nanofiber yarn) scaffold, long cycling reliability and flexibility were achieved.

In this literature, a novel combinatorial approach technique is utilized within an ALD grown simple metal oxide to synthesize a ""spatially addressable combinatorial library"". The two key factors in gradients were defined during the ALD process: (1) the process temperature and (2) a nonuniform flow of pulsed gases inside a cross-flow reactor. To validate the feasibility of our novel combinatorial approach, a case study of zinc oxide (ZnO), a simple metal oxide whose properties are well-known, is performed. Because of the induced gradient, the ZnO (002) crystallite size was found to gradually vary across a 100 mm wafer (∼10-20 nm) with a corresponding increase in the normalized Raman E2/A1 peak intensity ratio. The findings agree well with the visible grain size observed from scanning electron microscope. The novel combinatorial approach provides a means of systematical interpretation of the combined effect of the two gradients, especially in the analysis of the microstructure of ZnO crystals. Moreover, the combinatorial library reveals that the process temperature, rather than the crystal size, plays the most significant role in determining the electrical conductivity of ZnO.",Metal Active Sites and Their Catalytic Functions in Zeolites: Insights from Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063347,Accounts of chemical research,2019 06 11,"Zeolites are important heterogeneous catalysts widely used in the modern chemical and petrochemical industries. Metal-containing zeolites show distinct performance in the catalytic processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, activation and conversion of light alkanes, methanol-to-aromatics conversion, biomass transformation, and so on. The metal speciation, distribution, and interactions on zeolites have enormous impact on their property and catalytic performance. Significant efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of more active and selective zeolites by engineering the metal active sites. However, the nature of metal species and their role in the reactions are still poorly understood, which makes it difficult to establish the structure-activity relationship toward the rational design and application of zeolites. For example, synergic active sites are often present on the metal-containing zeolites, but their structure, property and quantification still remain to be resolved. Solid-state NMR is a powerful tool for the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts and catalytic reactions by providing information about both molecular structure and dynamics. The heterogeneity and low concentration of the metal sites on zeolites usually leads to a great challenge for their characterization. In this Account, we will describe our effort to study the metal active sites, host-guest interactions, and reaction intermediates by using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, with the aim to highlight recent advances in solid-state NMR techniques for probing the structure and property of metal-containing zeolites as well as the relevant reaction mechanisms. Using sensitivity-enhanced NMR methods such as 67Zn, 71Ga, and 119Sn, NMR enables the identification of metal speciation on zeolites. The synergic active sites constituted by metal species (as Lewis acid sites) and acidic protons (as Brønsted acid sites) on zeolites that amount to only a small fraction of the whole system can be directly probed and quantified with advanced 1H-67Zn or 1H-71Ga double-resonance solid-state NMR. We developed NMR methods to study the host-guest interactions in zeolites by observing the spatial interaction/proximity between aluminum sites (associated with Brønsted or Lewis acid sites) in zeolite host and carbon atoms in organic molecule guest formed during catalytic reaction, which leads to the formation of supramolecular reaction centers in the methanol-to-olefins reaction. The mechanisms underlying the catalytic reactions on metal-modified zeolite are revealed by the identification of key reaction intermediates with in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy. Our discussion based on the representative examples shows how the metal species serving as active sites significantly affect the property and activity of zeolites and related reaction pathways. The structural information obtained by the state-of-the-art solid-state NMR techniques provides new insights into the structure-activity relationship of zeolites in heterogeneous catalysis, which should be beneficial for rational design of highly efficient zeolite catalysts.",Development and Fabrication of Vapor Cross-Linked Hyaluronan-Polyethylene Interpenetrating Polymer Network as a Biomaterial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063346,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"Flexible heart valve leaflets made from hyaluronan-enhanced linear low-density polyethylene interpenetrating polymeric network (HA-LLDPE IPN) films have been shown to provide good hemodynamics, but the resulting surfaces were not consistent; therefore, the present work tries to mitigate this problem by developing a vapor cross-linked HA-LLDPE IPN. Herein, the HA-LLDPE fabrication process is studied, and its parameters are varied to assess their effects on the IPN formation. Thermal analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to quantify the effects of different treatment conditions on material properties. Water contact angle goniometry, infrared spectroscopy, and toluidine blue O (TBO) staining were used to characterize the surface of the HA-LLDPE IPN. The results show that a hydrophilic surface is formed on HA-LLDPE, which is indicative of HA. HA surface density data from TBO staining show consistent HA distribution on the surface. The IPN fabrication process does not affect the tensile properties that make LLDPE an attractive material for use in flexible heart valve leaflets. The 28 day in vitro biological assays show HA-LLDPE to be noncytotoxic and resistant to enzymatic degradation. The HA-LLDPE showed less platelet adhesion and caused less platelet activation than the plain LLDPE or tissue culture polystyrene. All of the results indicate that vapor cross-linked HA-LLDPE IPN is a promising material for use as flexible leaflets for heart valve replacements.",Steam Selective Etching: A Strategy to Effectively Enhance the Flexibility and Suppress the Volume Change of Carbonized Paper-Supported Electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063344,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"Paper-supported electrodes with high flexibility have attracted much attention in flexible Li-ion batteries. However, they are restricted by the heavy inactive paper substrate and large volume change during the lithiation-delithiation process, which will lead to low capacity and poor rate capability and cyclability. Converting the paper substrate to carbon fiber by carbonization can substantially eliminate the ""dead mass"", but it becomes very brittle. This study reports a water-steam selective etching strategy that successfully addresses these problems. With the help of steam etching, pores are created, and transition-metal oxides are embedded into the fiber. These effectively accommodate the volume change and enhances the kinetics of ion and electron transport. The pores release the mechanical stress from bending, ensuring the sufficient bendability of carbonized paper. Benefiting from these merits, the steam-etched samples show high flexibility and possess outstanding electrochemical performance, including ultra-high capacity and superior cycling stability with capacity retention over 100% after 1500 cycles at 2 A g-1. Furthermore, a flexible Li-ion full battery using the steam-etched Fe2O3@CNF anode and LiFePO4/steam-etched CNF cathode delivers a high capacity of 623 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and stable electrochemical performances under the bent state, holding great promise for next-generation wearable devices.","Violence and Public and Personal Health: Sexual Violence, Sexual Assault, and Sex Trafficking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063343,FP essentials,2019 06 06,"In the United States, approximately 1 in 5 women will experience a sexual assault in her lifetime.

Firearm injuries cost more than $3 billion per year, and deaths from guns cause more than $20 billion in lifetime work loss and medical costs. Risk factors for being a perpetrator of gun violence include a personal history of or exposure to individuals with violent tendencies, untreated mental disorders, substance abuse, and access to weapons. Physicians can screen patients for risk of firearm-related injury and share strategies to prevent injury and death in the home. Health care-based interventions may increase rates of safe storage of firearms for high-risk groups. Standardized protocols can assist with responses to violent threats in the medical workplace.

We describe two cases of inflammatory bowel disease with an initial symptom of lameness due to peripheral arthritis and enthesitis, respectively.","[Distal hereditary renal tubular acidosis, diagnosis in siblings: About 2 pediatric cases].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063314,Archivos argentinos de pediatria,2019 05 07,"Distal renal tubular acidosis is the most common type of renal tubular acidosis in pediatrics and can be hereditary. It is due to an inability in the kidney to excrete hydrogen ion (H+), in the absence of deterioration of renal function, and it is accompanied by hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap. The symptoms can be growth retardation, vomiting, constipation, lack of appetite, polydipsia and polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, weakness and even muscle paralysis due to hypokalemia. It is often accompanied by sensorineural hearing impairment. Correcting acidosis can have a variety of benefits such as restoring normal growth, decreasing hypokalemia, stabilizing or preventing nephrocalcinosis and decreasing the risk of osteopenia. Timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients make them remain asymptomatic and able to lead a good quality of life.

It also leads to hypermethylation of the gene promoter, silencing it and reducing the expression levels of FMRP, a protein involved in synaptic maturation and plasticity. A lower expansion causes primary ovarian failure syndrome as well as tremor and ataxia syndrome characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia of late onset and intention tremor.

The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world, as does its detection and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that developing countries have a similar or even greater kidney disease burden than developed countries. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of care are defined by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors, leading to significant disparities, even in developed countries. These disparities exist across the spectrum of kidney disease -prevention, screening, care and treatment. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease.

Critical periods are genetically programmed, highly sensitive time intervals during which the interaction between environment and individuals generates the development of physiological processes related to physical growth and development, survival (breastfeeding), social behavior, and learning. Barker hypothesis is based on the finding that prenatal malnutrition (for example, lowbirthweight) is closely related to mortality due to cardiovascular disease CVD) in the adult, and to the risk conditions leading to it: insuline resistence, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and high blood pressure. This association is no due to genetical causes, but secondary to nutritional deficits which in turn generate epigenetic mechanisms of methylation of DNA basis and cromatine proteines (histones), which do not modify the genetic code but modulate its expresion, reinforcing some genes, inhibiting others, regulating when and where they are expressed. These genes participate in the process called programming, consisting of permanent changes in the response to stimulation of metabolic and hormone regulators, such as, for example, increasing insuline resistence. Epigenetic changes persist even when original conditions (fetal or perinatal malnutrition) are no longer present. This, in turn, affects health of the offspring later in adult life, creating thus the same environmental prenatal conditions to the next generation. This transgenerational effects of early nutritional experiences are more frequent in population groups of por socioeconomic level, and consequently have serious implications in the future health of Latin American populations.",Humanism in medicine: The critical role of pediatricians in autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063308,Archivos argentinos de pediatria,2019 05 07,"In this article, we describe the importance of coexisting medical problems in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Hybridogenetic Cataglyphis ants display a bizarre genetic system, where queen-worker caste determination is primarily determined by genetic factors. In hybridogenetic populations, all workers are F1 hybrids of two distinct lineages, whereas new queens are nearly always pure-lineage individuals produced by clonal reproduction. The distribution and evolutionary history of these hybridogenetic populations have not yet been thoroughly analysed. Here, we studied the phylogeographic distribution of hybridogenetic populations in two closely related Spanish species: Cataglyphis humeya and Cataglyphis velox. Hybridogenesis has been previously documented in a locality of C. velox, but whether this system occurs elsewhere within the range of the two species was yet unknown. Queens and workers from 66 localities sampled across the range of the species were genotyped at 18 microsatellite markers to determine whether queens were produced by parthenogenesis and whether workers were hybrids of divergent lineages. Populations with F1 hybrid workers were identified by combining genetic, geographical and mating assortments data. In most populations of C. velox, workers were found to be hybrids of two divergent lineages. Workers were however produced via random mating in two marginal populations of C. velox, and in all populations studied of its sister species C. humeya. High-throughput sequencing data were obtained to confirm inferences based on microsatellites and to characterize relationships between populations. Our results revealed a complicated history of reticulate evolution that may account for the origin of hybridogenetic lineages in Cataglyphis. This article is protected by copyright.

The method relies on imparting chemical and physical orthogonality to a polymer film via formation of a semi-interpenetrating diphasic polymer network with a bridged polysilsesquioxane structure, which is termed an orthogonal polymer semiconductor gel. The synthesized gel films remain tolerant to various chemical and physical etching processes involved in photolithography, thereby facilitating fabrication of high-resolution patterns of polymer semiconductors. This method is utilized for fabricating tandem electronics, including pn-complementary inverter logic devices and pixelated polymer light-emitting diodes, which require deposition of multiple polymer semiconductors through solution processes.

Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is a pivotal member of immunophilin family. Whether CYPA can be detected in sera of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients remains to be explored. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the first identified human tumor virus and is a causative agent of NPC. The antibody of EBV capsid antigen immunoglobulin A (EBV-VCA-IgA) is a known biomarker of NPC, with a proportion of no more than 70% being detected positively. Hence, novel biomarkers need to be discovered for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of EBV-associated NPC. A total of 110 NPC and 36 normal control serum samples were collected. Exosomes from these samples were extracted. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the above samples were validated by reverse transcription -quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the results demonstrated that both the serum and exosomal CYPA levels of NPC patients were significantly higher than that of normal cases. In addition, exosomal CYPA had a much higher level than that in the whole sera. The positive rate of EBV-VCA-IgA antibody was 68.2% in NPC sera, and noticeably, among the cases with EBV-VCA-IgA negative, 80% of them presented high levels of CYPA above the standard (cutoff value). In particular, CYPA in exosomes was uniformly with higher significance than that in whole sera. Combined analysis of CYPA protein and EBV-VCA-IgA antibody showed a greatly higher discriminatory ability in diagnosis of NPC. Moreover, exosomal CYPA level had a positive correlation with that of the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in exosomes. EBV-positive cancer cells secreted significantly higher levels of exosomal CYPA. This study established the utility of circulating exosomal CYPA as a potential noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for EBV-associated NPC.",Accumulation of rare coding variants in genes implicated in risk of human cleft lip with or without cleft palate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063268,American journal of medical genetics. Part A,2019 06 12,"Cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CLP) is a common craniofacial malformation with complex etiologies, reflecting both genetic and environmental factors. Most of the suspected genetic risk for CLP has yet to be identified. To further classify risk loci and estimate the contribution of rare variants, we sequenced the exons in 49 candidate genes in 323 CLP cases and 211 nonmalformed controls. Our findings indicated that rare, protein-altering variants displayed markedly higher burdens in CLP cases at relevant loci. First, putative loss-of-function mutations (nonsense, frameshift) were significantly enriched among cases: 13 of 323 cases (~4%) harbored such alleles within these 49 genes, versus one such change in controls (p = 0.01). Second, in gene-level analyses, the burden of rare alleles showed greater case-association for several genes previously implicated in cleft risk. For example, BHMT displayed a 10-fold increase in protein-altering variants in CLP cases (p = .03), including multiple case occurrences of a rare frameshift mutation (K400 fs). Other loci with greater rare, coding allele burdens in cases were in signaling pathways relevant to craniofacial development (WNT9B, BMP4, BMPR1B) as well as the methionine cycle (MTRR). We conclude that rare coding variants may confer risk for isolated CLP.",Willingness of individuals with eating disorders to participate in health research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063267,The International journal of eating disorders,2019 05 07,This study examines the association between eating disorders (EDs) and willingness to participate in health research studies among community members.,IL-17A is not a treatment target in progressive vitiligo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063266,Pigment cell & melanoma research,2019 05 22,"Multiple reports confirm elevated circulating IL-17 levels and increased numbers of Th17 lymphocytes in patients with non-segmental vitiligo. Additionally, melanocyte damaging characteristics have been ascribed to IL-17. A single-arm pilot study using secukinumab in active non-segmental vitiligo was conducted. The large majority of patients developed additional skin depigmentations limiting further enrollment. Overall, laboratory analysis revealed no change in secreted chemokines or Th subsets. Th17 lymphocytes correlated with Th2, Th9, and Th22 cells while an inverse link with Th1 cells and serum sCD25 levels was observed. In contrast, Th17.1 cells correlated positively with Th1 lymphocytes. Confirmatory results were found in an independent group of patients with vitiligo showing a significant increase in Th17.1 and Th1 lymphocytes in progressive vitiligo patients compared to healthy controls, which was not found for Th17 cells. These results do not support a direct pathogenic role of IL-17 or Th17 cells in vitiligo. Nonetheless, a delicate Th17/Th17.1/Th1 balance seems evident which changes markedly according to disease activity. This may offer new treatment options by interfering with cytokines that drive differentiation of Th17 cells toward Th1.",Intensity-based 2D-3D registration for an ACL reconstruction navigation system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063265,The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,2019 06 14,"To improve the positioning accuracy of tunnels for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, we proposed an intensity-based 2D-3D registration method for an ACL reconstruction navigation system.

Lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, γ-HCH, or γ-BHC) is an especially good target compound for the purpose, because it is relatively recalcitrant but can be degraded by a limited range of bacterial strains. A comparison of the complete genome sequences of lindane-degrading sphingomonad strains clearly demonstrated that (i) lindane-degrading strains emerged from a number of different ancestral hosts that have recruited lin genes encoding enzymes that are able to channel lindane to central metabolites, (ii) in sphingomonads lin genes have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer mediated by different plasmids and in which IS6100 plays a role in recruitment and distribution of genes, and (iii) IS6100 plays a role in dynamic genome rearrangements providing genetic diversity to different strains and ability to evolve to other states. Lindane-degrading bacteria whose genomes change so easily and quickly are also fascinating starting materials for tracing the bacterial evolution process experimentally in a relatively short time period.

Large avian frugivores are also among the most threatened due to anthropogenic impacts. We evaluated the role of large avian frugivores in a plant-disperser community by (a) determining whether the plant-disperser community was modular, with a distinct community of large frugivores (thereby highlighting their importance), (b) determining relative qualitative and quantitative roles played by large-bodied frugivores vis-à-vis other frugivores and (c) determining impacts of large-bodied frugivore loss on the plant-disperser community. The study was carried out at a tropical forest site in north-east India, which is part of the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot. We collected tree watch data (20:55 hr) from 46 tree species, which represented 85% of tree species that are predominantly bird-dispersed in the area. We found that the plant-disperser community was modular, with a distinct module of large-seeded tree species and large frugivores. Intermediate-sized frugivores such as barbets and bulbuls were the most connected, while large-sized frugivores, such as hornbills and imperial pigeons, were moderately well connected. Qualitative and quantitative roles played by different dispersers varied across the gradient of frugivore body size. Hornbills, the largest avian frugivores, consumed a significantly greater number of fruits and swallowed larger proportions of fruits compared with other avian groups. In comparison with similar-sized frugivores, imperial pigeons fed on larger-sized fruits, highlighting their importance for dispersal of large-seeded plants. Under simulated extinction scenarios, larger extinction cascades were not necessarily caused by larger frugivores; however, extinctions of certain large-bodied frugivores (hornbills, imperial pigeons) caused extinction cascades. Integrating information from networks and seed dispersal effectiveness approaches enabled a better understanding of large frugivore role in a plant-disperser community. While large-bodied frugivores may not be playing a central role in plant-disperser communities, they are crucial as seed dispersal service providers for large-seeded plants. In conjunction with the reported local extinctions of large frugivores like hornbills from the south Asian region, this study's findings highlight the irreplaceable quantitative and qualitative impacts that tropical plant communities are likely to experience in the future.",Ultrastructural localization of DREADDs in monkeys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063250,The European journal of neuroscience,2019 05 07,"Designer-receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are extensively used to modulate neuronal activity in rodents, but their use in primates remains limited. An essential need that remains is the demonstration that DREADDs are efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane of primate neurons. To address this issue, electron microscopy immunogold was used to determine the subcellular localization of the AAV vector-induced DREADDs hM4Di and hM3Dq fused to different tags in various brain areas of rhesus monkeys and mice. When hM4Di was fused to mCherry, the immunogold labeling was mostly confined to the intracellular space, and poorly expressed at the plasma membrane in monkey dendrites. In contrast, the hM4Di-mCherry labeling was mostly localized to the dendritic plasma membrane in mouse neurons, suggesting species differences in the plasma membrane expression of these exogenous proteins. The lack of hM4Di plasma membrane expression may limit the functional effects of systemic administration of DREADD-actuators in monkey neurons. Removing the mCherry and fusing of hM4Di with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag resulted in strong neuronal plasma membrane immunogold labeling in both monkeys and mice neurons. Finally, hM3Dq-mCherry was expressed mostly at the plasma membrane in monkey neurons, indicating that the fusion of mCherry with hM3Dq does not hamper membrane incorporation of this specific DREADD. Our results suggest that the pattern of ultrastructural expression of DREADDs in monkey neurons depends on the DREADD/tag combination. Therefore, a preliminary characterization of plasma membrane expression of specific DREADD/tag combinations is recommended when using chemogenetic approaches in primates.

The Streptococcus bovis group has undergone significant taxonomic changes over the past two decades and, in 2002, Poyart et al. described two distinct novel species within the genus Streptococcus: Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus pasteurianus. The bovis group streptococci include commensal species and subspecies or opportunistic pathogens of humans and animals. The cat was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Bologna for chronic diarrhoea associated with fresh blood. A diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma was advanced. S. lutetiensis was accidentally isolated from the faeces of the cat and identified through MALDI-TOF and 16s rRNA sequencing. The Kirby-Bauer test revealed that the isolate was resistant to enrofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, marbofloxacin and tetracycline. The detection of S. lutetiensis in cat faeces might suggest that it could be a normal inhabitant of cat intestinal tract or that it could be involved in the manifestation of intestinal diseases. Since bacteria belonging to the S. bovis group are considered emerging pathogens, additional research is required to evaluate the role of S. lutetiensis in cats and its role in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study the isolation of Streptococcus lutetiensis from a cat with intestinal lymphoma was described for the first time. An antimicrobial susceptibility test performed by means of the disc diffusion method revealed that the isolate was resistant to enrofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, marbofloxacin and tetracycline. Nowadays the ecological or pathogenetic role of S. lutetiensis in the gut of animals remains unclear but, even if its role as commensal bacterium was confirmed, the presence of multi-resistant S. lutetiensis in cat gut could favour the transmission of antimicrobial resistance to other bacteria.","Using prognosis to guide inclusion criteria, define standardised endpoints and stratify follow-up in active surveillance for prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063245,BJU international,2019 06 03,To test whether using disease prognosis can inform a rational approach to active surveillance (AS) for early prostate cancer.,High-Resolution 3D NIR-II Photoacoustic Imaging of Cerebral and Tumor Vasculatures Using Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles as Contrast Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063244,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 07,"Exogenous contrast-agent-assisted NIR-II optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy imaging (ORPAMI) holds promise to decipher wide-field 3D biological structures with deep penetration, large signal-to-background ratio (SBR), and high maximum imaging depth to depth resolution ratio.

These results are superior to the recently reported 3D NIR-II fluorescence confocal vascular imaging, which opens up new opportunities for NIR-II CP-NP-assisted ORPAMI in various biomedical applications.",Release of sodium pyruvate from sacral prophylactic dressings: A computational model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063243,International wound journal,2019 05 07,"The use of sacral dressings for pressure ulcer prevention is growing rapidly. In addition to their passive biomechanical role in pressure and shear reduction, in the near future, prophylactic dressings may also provide active tissue protection by releasing preventive agents or drugs into skin and deeper tissues. We investigated delivery of sodium pyruvate (NaPy) from an active dressing to potentially protect the sacral skin and underlying tissues in addition. We used four finite element model variants describing different skin roughness levels to determine time profiles of NaPy diffusion from the dressing into the skin layers. The NaPy concentrations for the different modelled cases stabilised after 1 to 6.5 hours from the time of application of the dressings, at 1% to 3% of the NaPy concentration in the dressing reservoir, which is considered potent. We conclude that prophylactic sacral dressings have the potential to deliver NaPy into skin and subdermally, to potentially increase soft tissue tolerance to sustained bodyweight-caused cell and tissue deformations. The time durations to achieve the steady-state potent NaPy dermal concentrations are clinically feasible, for example, for preparation of patients for surgery or for use in intensive care units.",Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Spiropyrans and Spirooxazines via Dynamic Enantioselective Crystallization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063242,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 07,"Chiral symmetry breaking of two spiropyrans and one spirooxazine was performed by dynamic enantioselective crystallization. The three spiro-compounds afforded racemic conglomerate crystals, and easily racemized in alcoholic solution without irradiation. Vapor-diffusion crystallization or attrition-enhanced deracemization (Viedma ripening) gave optically pure enantiomorphic crystals. Their absolute configurations were determined by X-ray single crystal analysis and each enantiomorphic crystal was correlated with its solid-state CD spectrum."

A sample of 500 college students aged between 20 and 30 years participated in this study. Their levels of borderline personality symptoms, self-concept and identity disturbances, internet addiction, depression, and suicidality at baseline and at follow-up interviews were assessed through the Borderline Symptoms List, Self-concept and Identity Measure, Chen Internet Addiction Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and questions related to suicidality from the Epidemiological version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, respectively. A total of 324 college students received follow-up assessments 1 year later. Among them, 15.4%, 27.5%, and 17% had internet addiction, significant depression, and suicidality, respectively. Our result revealed the severity of borderline symptoms, disturbed identity, unconsolidated identity, and lack of identity at initial assessment increased the occurrence of internet addiction, significant depression, and suicidality at follow-up assessment except for the predictive effect of unconsolidated identity on internet addiction.

These enzymatic levels are unknown for most of the wild birds analyzed in this study. The objectives were to establish plasma acetylcholinesterase levels in songbirds of two undisturbed sites in the central Monte desert (Argentina). The influence of age, sex, body condition, feeding and migratory habits, and species of belonging on cholinesterase activity is also examined. One hundred and sixty-five wild birds belonging to 26 species were studied. The values obtained for acetylcholinesterase activities provide a good estimate of the normal values in free-living individuals of Zonotrichia capensis, Molothrus bonariensis, Passer domesticus, Diuca diuca, Pospiza ornata, Saltator aurantiirostris, Gryseotyrannus aurantioatrocristatus and Columbina picui, with interspecific differences. The media enzymatic levels ± standar error ranged from 546.31 ± 17.97 μmol min-1 L-1 in P. domesticus to 3439.90 ± 173.92 in Tyrannus melancholicus. No significant differences were detected between different sexes or ages. Birds that migrate (which are also insectivores), showed higher levels of cholinesterase than residents (mainly granivores). It is recommended that in cases of bird poisoning, plasma cholinesterase activity can be used as a diagnostic tool only if pre-exposure levels obtained in the same species are available, and ideally evaluated in individuals from the same biogeographical region.

Influence of the amino terephthalate linker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063224,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 07,"This manuscript reports a comparative study of the catalytic performance of gold nanoparticles encapsulated within MIL-101(Cr) with or without amino groups in the terephthalate linker. The purpose is to show how the amino groups can influence the microenvironment and catalytic stability of incorporated gold nanoparticles. The first influence of the presence of this substituent is the smaller particle size of Au NPs hosted in MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 (2.45 ± 0.19 nm) compared to the parent MIL-101(Cr)-H (3.02 ± 0.39 nm). Both materials are highly active to promote the aerobic alcohol oxidation and exhibit a wide substrate scope. While both catalysts can achieve turnover numbers as high as 106 for the solvent-free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, Au@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 exhibits higher turnover frequency values (12,000 h-1) than Au@MIL-101(Cr)-H (6,800 h-1). Au@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 also exhibits higher catalytic stability, being recyclable by 20 times with coincident temporal conversion profiles, in comparison with some decay observed in the parent Au@MIL-101(Cr)-H. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy of the 20-times used samples shows a very minor particle size increase in the case of Au@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 (2.97 ± 0.27 nm) in comparison with the Au@MIL-101(Cr)-H analogue (5.32 ± 0.72). The data presented show the potential of a better control of the microenvironment to improve the performance of encapsulated Au nanoparticles.","Multivariate analyses and human health assessments of heavy metals for the surface water quality in the Xiangjiang River Basin, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063223,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,2019 05 07,"The pollution by heavy metals in river water is becoming a major subject of global drinking water concern, and the Xiangjiang River is one of the most heavily polluted rivers in China. Water samples were collected from 17 sites spanning the entire Xiangjiang watershed from 2005 to 2016 to investigate spatial-temporal distributions and potential human health risks related to 8 metal pollutants (As, Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Se). The results of spatial-temporal distribution analyses proved that most metals were below the guideline limits for the majority of the time. However, the hazard index (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR) analyses indicated that As and Cr facilitated a potential risk of cancer, although noncarcinogenic heavy metals in general and carcinogenic risk declined year by year. A nonparametric seasonal Mann-Kendall's test revealed that there were notable decreasing trends in As, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr and Pb for most sites, whereas Se and Hg significantly increased in some areas over the targeted 12 years. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) agreed with dual hierarchical cluster analysis (DHCA) in the identification of pollution sources, the results of which are as follows: 1) As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic activities and the smelting industry; 2) Cr and Cu mainly originated from agricultural or industrial activities; and 3) Se was predominantly from natural erosion. This research will be conducive to optimizing the distribution of water monitoring stations and drafting remediation strategies pertaining to the protection of public health in metal-polluted areas.

However, invaders could have important effects on native host-parasite dynamics. Where infectious stages are ubiquitous and native host-pathogen specificity is strong, invasive less-competent hosts may reduce the pool of infectious stages, effectively reducing native host-parasite encounter rate. Alternatively, invasive species could alter transmission via changes in native species abundance. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors can also impact disease dynamics by altering host or parasite condition. However, little is known about potential interactive effects of invasion and environmental context on native species disease dynamics. Moreover, experimental examinations of the mechanisms driving dilution effects are limited, but serve to provide tests of predictions leading to diversity-disease relationships. Using field and laboratory experiments, we tested competing hypotheses that an invasive species reduces the prevalence of a native parasite in its host by removing infectious propagules from the environment or by reducing native host abundance. In addition, we evaluated the role of detritus quantity as a resource base in mediating effects of the invasive species. Native parasite prevalence was reduced when the invasive species was present. Prevalence was also higher in high detritus habitats, although this effect was lost when the invasive species was present. The invasive species significantly reduced infectious propagules from the aquatic habitats. Presence of the invasive species had no effect on the native species abundance; thus, the reduction in parasitism was not due to changes in host density but through a reduction in infectious propagule encounters. We conclude that an invasive species can facilitate a native species by reducing parasite prevalence via a dilution effect and that these effects can be modified by resource level. Reductions in parasitism may have ripple effects throughout the community, altering the strength of competitive interactions, predation rates or coinfection with other pathogens. We advocate considering potential positive effects of invasive species on recipient communities, in addition to effects of invasions on host-parasite interactions to gain a broader understanding of the complex consequences of invasion.",Chemerin partly mediates tumor-inhibitory effect of all-trans retinoic acid via CMKLR1-dependent natural killer cell recruitment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063220,Immunology,2019 05 29,"Down-regulated chemerin expression has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis of several types of cancer including melanoma. All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is a potent inducer of chemerin, and we previously reported that atRA inhibited murine melanoma growth through enhancement of anti-tumor T-cell immunity. Here, we aimed to investigate whether loss of endogenous chemerin accelerated melanoma growth and whether chemerin was involved in the melanoma-inhibitory effect of atRA. We demonstrated that chemerin was constitutively expressed in the skin, which was down-regulated during murine melanoma growth. Rarres2-/- mice, which are deficient in chemerin, exhibited aggravated tumor growth and impaired tumor-infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells that express CMKLR1, the functional receptor of chemerin. Topical treatment with atRA up-regulated skin chemerin expression, which was primarily derived from dermal cells. Moreover, atRA treatment significantly enhanced tumor-infiltrating NK cells, which was completely abrogated in Rarres2-/- mice and Cmklr1-/- mice, suggesting a dependency of NK cell recruitment on the chemerin-CMKLR1 axis in melanoma. Despite comparable melanoma growth detected in wild-type mice and Cmklr1-/- mice, lack of CMKLR1 partially abrogated the melanoma-inhibitory effect of atRA. This may be due to the inability to enhance tumor-infiltrating NK cells in Cmklr1-/- mice following atRA treatment. Collectively, our study suggests that down-regulation of chemerin could be a strategy used by cancers such as melanoma to impair anti-tumor NK cell immunity and identifies a new anti-tumor mechanism of atRA by up-regulating chemerin to enhance CMKLR1-dependent NK cell recruitment.",Are there gross motor coordination spurts during mid-childhood?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063218,American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,2019 05 07,The aims of this study were (1) to identify the timing of the mid-growth spurt (MGS) in stature in children and (2) to identify gross motor coordination (GMC) spurts when aligned by the age of attainment of the MGS (aMGS).,Adverse Health Outcomes in Offspring Associated With Fetal Alcohol Exposure: A Systematic Review of Clinical and Preclinical Studies With a Focus on Metabolic and Body Composition Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063217,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2019 05 28,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in well-characterized neurological, behavioral, and cognitive deficits in offspring. However, the effects on other health outcomes have not been comprehensively described. We used a systematic review methodology to survey published clinical and preclinical studies investigating a broad range of health outcomes in offspring with PAE. This study specifically reports on outcomes related to metabolism and body composition. The literature was systematically searched across 4 electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science), resulting in 3,230 articles following duplicate removal. Titles and abstracts were reviewed against specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, with 242 articles meeting the criteria for full-text assessment of eligibility. Articles with ineligible study type were removed (127) and articles added from reference lists (15) and an updated search closer to submission (9) for a total of 139 studies. Although 5 health domains were identified, here we focus on metabolism and body composition. Details of alcohol exposure, offspring demographics, and sample sizes were tabulated and quality of reporting assessed. Findings were summarized for body composition (percentage fat mass), physiological and molecular outcomes related to glucose metabolism, and outcomes related to lipid metabolism. There were 32 included studies (2 case-control, 1 prospective longitudinal cohort, and 29 preclinical). Studies had a range of alcohol exposures, both dosage and timing, although all clinical studies had heavy PAE and/or evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome in offspring. The preclinical studies provided evidence of glucose intolerance and/or insulin resistance; dyslipidemia and/or hypercholesterolemia; and increased adiposity in offspring with PAE. Due to the paucity of clinical studies, we recommend further studies be conducted to obtain a complete assessment of long-term metabolic health outcomes in children and adults with PAE, particularly in those diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.",Layered Crystalline and Amorphous Platinum Disulfide (PtS2 ): Contrasting Electrochemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063216,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 29,"Group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2 and WS2 have been extensively studied for various applications while few studies have delved into other TMDs such as platinum dichalcogenides. In this work, layered crystalline and amorphous platinum disulfide (PtS2 ) were synthesized, characterised and their fundamental electrochemical properties were investigated. Both materials exhibited inherent oxidation and reduction reactions which would limit their operating potential window for sensing applications. Amorphous phase materials are considered to be promising electrocatalysts due to the porous, and nanostructured morphology with high concentration of unsaturated active sites. The electrocatalytic performances towards oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of crystalline and amorphous PtS2 were analysed. Amorphous PtS2 was found to exhibit superior electrocatalytic performances towards ORR and HER as compared to crystalline PtS2 . For HER, amorphous and crystalline PtS2 have overpotential values of 0.30 V and 0.70 V (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm-2 , respectively. The influence of electrochemical reduction pre-treatment on their catalytic behaviours was also investigated. Electrochemical reduction pre-treatment on both crystalline and amorphous PtS2 removed the oxidized sulfate groups and increased the proportion of Pt0 oxidation state which exposed more catalytic sites. As such, these materials were activated and displayed improved ORR and HER performances. Electrochemically reduced amorphous PtS2 outperformed the untreated counterparts and exhibited the best HER performance with overpotential of 0.17 V (vs. RHE) at current density of -10 mA cm-2 . These findings provide insights into the electrochemical properties of noble metal PtS2 in both crystalline and amorphous states which can be activated by electrochemical reduction pre-treatment."

Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 17,"This paper describes a global analysis of macromolecular B values. It is shown that the distribution of B values generally follows the shifted inverse-gamma distribution (SIGD). The parameters of the SIGD are estimated using the Fisher scoring technique with the expected Fisher information matrix. It is demonstrated that a contour plot based on the parameters of the SIGD can play a role in the validation of macromolecular structures. The dependence of the peak-height distribution on resolution and atomic B values is also analysed. It is demonstrated that the B-value distribution can have a dramatically different effect on peak heights at different resolutions. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the B values of neighbouring atoms must account for resolution. A combination of the SIGD, peak-height distribution and outlier detection was used to identify a number of entries from the PDB that require attention. It is also shown that the presence of a multimodal B-value distribution often indicates that some loops or parts of the molecule have either been mismodelled or have dramatically different mobility, depending on their environment within the crystal. These distributions can also indicate the level of sharpening/blurring used before atomic structure refinement. It is recommended that procedures such as sharpening/blurring should be avoided during refinement, although they can play important roles in map visualization and model building.",Structural analysis of a replication protein encoded by a plasmid isolated from a multiple sclerosis patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063152,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 17,"Bovine meat and milk factors (BMMFs) are circular, single-stranded episomal DNAs that have been detected in bovine meat and milk products. BMMFs are thought to have roles in human malignant and degenerative diseases. BMMFs encode a replication initiator protein (Rep) that is actively transcribed and translated in human cells. In this study, a Rep WH1 domain encoded on a BMMF (MSBI1.176) isolated from a multiple sclerosis human brain sample was determined to 1.53 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography. The overall structure of the MSBI1.176 WH1 domain was remarkably similar to other Rep structures, despite having a low (28%) amino-acid sequence identity. The MSBI1.176 WH1 domain contained elements common to other Reps, including five α-helices, five β-strands and a hydrophobic pocket. These new findings suggest that the MSBI1.176 Rep might have comparable roles and functions to other known Reps of different origins.",Crystal structure of the leucine-rich repeat ectodomain of the plant immune receptor kinase SOBIR1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063151,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 17,"Plant-unique membrane receptor kinases with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extracellular domains are key regulators of development and immune responses. Here, the 1.55 Å resolution crystal structure of the immune receptor kinase SOBIR1 from Arabidopsis is presented. The ectodomain structure reveals the presence of five LRRs sandwiched between noncanonical capping domains. The disulfide-bond-stabilized N-terminal cap harbours an unusual β-hairpin structure. The C-terminal cap features a highly positively charged linear motif which was found to be largely disordered in this structure. Size-exclusion chromatography and right-angle light-scattering experiments suggest that SOBIR1 is a monomer in solution. The protruding β-hairpin, a set of highly conserved basic residues at the inner surface of the SOBIR LRR domain and the presence of a genetic missense allele in LRR2 together suggest that the SOBIR1 ectodomain may mediate protein-protein interaction in plant immune signalling.",Structural and functional insights into phosphomannose isomerase: the role of zinc and catalytic residues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063150,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 07,"Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) is a housekeeping enzyme that is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to fungi to mammals and is important for cell-wall synthesis, viability and signalling. PMI is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible isomerization between mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), presumably via the formation of a cis-enediol intermediate. The reaction is hypothesized to involve ring opening of M6P, the transfer of a proton from the C2 atom to the C1 atom and between the O1 and O2 atoms of the substrate, followed by ring closure resulting in the product F6P. Several attempts have been made to decipher the role of zinc ions and various residues in the catalytic function of PMI. However, there is no consensus on the catalytic base and the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. In the present study, based on the structure of PMI from Salmonella typhimurium, site-directed mutagenesis targeting residues close to the bound metal ion and activity studies on the mutants, zinc ions were shown to be crucial for substrate binding. These studies also suggest Lys86 as the most probable catalytic base abstracting the proton in the isomerization reaction. Plausible roles for the highly conserved residues Lys132 and Arg274 could also be discerned based on comparison of the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant PMIs. PMIs from prokaryotes possess a low sequence identity to the human enzyme, ranging between 30% and 40%. Since PMI is important for the virulence of many pathogenic organisms, the identification of catalytically important residues will facilitate its use as a potential antimicrobial drug target.",Visualizing membrane trafficking through the electron microscope: cryo-tomography of coat complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063149,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 17,"Coat proteins mediate vesicular transport between intracellular compartments, which is essential for the distribution of molecules within the eukaryotic cell. The global arrangement of coat proteins on the membrane is key to their function, and cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging have been used to study membrane-bound coat proteins, providing crucial structural insight. This review outlines a workflow for the structural elucidation of coat proteins, incorporating recent developments in the collection and processing of cryo-electron tomography data. Recent work on coat protein I, coat protein II and retromer performed on in vitro reconstitutions or in situ is summarized. These studies have answered long-standing questions regarding the mechanisms of membrane binding, polymerization and assembly regulation of coat proteins.",Design guidelines for an electron diffractometer for structural chemistry and structural biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063148,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 05 17,"3D electron diffraction has reached a stage where the structures of chemical compounds can be solved productively. Instrumentation is lagging behind this development, and to date dedicated electron diffractometers for data collection based on the rotation method do not exist. Current studies use transmission electron microscopes as a workaround. These are optimized for imaging, which is not optimal for diffraction studies. The beam intensity is very high, it is difficult to create parallel beam illumination and the detectors used for imaging are of only limited use for diffraction studies. In this work, the combination of an EIGER hybrid pixel detector with a transmission electron microscope to construct a productive electron diffractometer is described. The construction not only refers to the combination of hardware but also to the calibration of the system, so that it provides rapid access to the experimental parameters that are necessary for processing diffraction data. Until fully integrated electron diffractometers become available, this describes a setup for productive and efficient operation in chemical crystallography."

Here we report on a terpene synthase (DdTPS8)-cytochrome P450 (CYP521A1) gene cluster that produces a novel C12 trisnorsesquiterpene and affects the development of Dictyostelium discoideum. DdTPS8 catalyzes the formation of a sesquiterpene discoidol, which is undetectable from the volatile bouquet of wild type D. discoideum. Interestingly, a DdTPS8 knockout mutant lacks not only discoidol, but also a putative trisnorsesquiterpene. This compound was hypothesized to be derived from discoidol via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed oxidative cleavage. CYP521A1, which is clustered with DdTPS8, was identified as a top candidate. Biochemical assays demonstrated that CYP521A1 catalyzes the conversion of discoidol to a novel trisnorsesquiterpene named discodiene. The DdTPS8 knockout mutant exhibited slow progression in development. This study points to the untapped diversity of natural products made by D. discoideum, which may have diverse roles in its development and chemical ecology.",A question of lineage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063134,eLife,2019 05 10,"In the ventral nerve cord of fruit flies, neurons from the same hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter.",Computational 3D histological phenotyping of whole zebrafish by X-ray histotomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063133,eLife,2019 06 14,"Organismal phenotypes frequently involve multiple organ systems. Histology is a powerful way to detect cellular and tissue phenotypes, but is largely descriptive and subjective. To determine how synchrotron-based X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) can yield 3-dimensional whole-organism images suitable for quantitative histological phenotyping, we scanned whole zebrafish, a small vertebrate model with diverse tissues, at ~1 micron voxel resolutions. Micro-CT optimized for cellular characterization (histotomography) allows brain nuclei to be computationally segmented and assigned to brain regions, and cell shapes and volumes to be computed for motor neurons and red blood cells. Striking individual phenotypic variation was apparent from color maps of computed densities of brain nuclei. Unlike histology, the histotomography also allows the study of 3-dimensional structures of millimeter scale that cross multiple tissue planes. We expect the computational and visual insights into 3D cell and tissue architecture provided by histotomography to be useful for reference atlases, hypothesis generation, comprehensive organismal screens, and diagnostics.",Anatomical basis and physiological role of cerebrospinal fluid transport through the murine cribriform plate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063132,eLife,2019 06 10,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows through the brain, transporting chemical signals and removing waste. CSF production in the brain is balanced by a constant outflow of CSF, the anatomical basis of which is poorly understood. Here, we characterized the anatomy and physiological function of the CSF outflow pathway along the olfactory sensory nerves through the cribriform plate, and into the nasal epithelia. Chemical ablation of olfactory sensory nerves greatly reduced outflow of CSF through the cribriform plate. The reduction in CSF outflow did not cause an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), consistent with an alteration in the pattern of CSF drainage or production. Our results suggest that damage to olfactory sensory neurons (such as from air pollution) could contribute to altered CSF turnover and flow, providing a potential mechanism for neurological diseases.",Mammalian cell growth dynamics in mitosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063131,eLife,2019 06 10,"The extent and dynamics of animal cell biomass accumulation during mitosis are unknown, primarily because growth has not been quantified with sufficient precision and temporal resolution. Using the suspended microchannel resonator and protein synthesis assays, we quantify mass accumulation and translation rates between mitotic stages on a single-cell level. For various animal cell types, growth rates in prophase are commensurate with or higher than interphase growth rates. Growth is only stopped as cells approach metaphase-to-anaphase transition and growth resumes in late cytokinesis. Mitotic arrests stop growth independently of arresting mechanism. For mouse lymphoblast cells, growth in prophase is promoted by CDK1 through increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and cap-dependent protein synthesis. Inhibition of CDK1-driven mitotic translation reduces daughter cell growth. Overall, our measurements counter the traditional dogma that growth during mitosis is negligible and provide insight into antimitotic cancer chemotherapies.",Non-selective inhibition of inappropriate motor-tendencies during response-conflict by a fronto-subthalamic mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063130,eLife,2019 06 10,"To effectively interact with their environment, humans must often select actions from multiple incompatible options. Existing theories propose that during motoric response-conflict, inappropriate motor activity is actively (and perhaps non-selectively) suppressed by an inhibitory fronto-basal ganglia mechanism. We here tested this theory across three experiments. First, using scalp-EEG, we found that both outright action-stopping and response-conflict during action-selection invoke low-frequency activity of a common fronto-central source, whose activity relates to trial-by-trial behavioral indices of inhibition in both tasks. Second, using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the basal ganglia and motor cortex, we found that response-conflict increases the influence of the subthalamic nucleus on M1-representations of incorrect response-tendencies. Finally, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that during the same time period when conflict-related STN-to-M1 communication is increased, cortico-spinal excitability is broadly suppressed. Together, these findings demonstrate that fronto-basal ganglia networks buttress action-selection under response-conflict by rapidly and non-selectively net-inhibiting inappropriate motor tendencies.",CNS myelination and remyelination depend on fatty acid synthesis by oligodendrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063129,eLife,2019 05 12,"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) support neurons and signal transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) by enwrapping axons with myelin, a lipid-rich membrane structure. We addressed the significance of fatty acid (FA) synthesis in OLs by depleting FA synthase (FASN) from OL progenitor cells (OPCs) in transgenic mice. While we detected no effects in proliferation and differentiation along the postnatal OL lineage, we found that FASN is essential for accurate myelination, including myelin growth. Increasing dietary lipid intake could partially compensate for the FASN deficiency. Furthermore, FASN contributes to correct myelin lipid composition and stability of myelinated axons. Moreover, we depleted FASN specifically in adult OPCs to examine its relevance for remyelination. Applying lysolecithin-induced focal demyelinating spinal cord lesions, we found that FA synthesis is essential to sustain adult OPC-derived OLs and efficient remyelination. We conclude that FA synthesis in OLs plays key roles in CNS myelination and remyelination.",An acquired scaffolding function of the DNAJ-PKAc fusion contributes to oncogenic signaling in fibrolamellar carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063128,eLife,2019 06 10,"Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer. FLCs uniquely produce DNAJ-PKAc, a chimeric enzyme consisting of a chaperonin-binding domain fused to the Cα subunit of protein kinase A. Biochemical analyses of clinical samples reveal that a unique property of this fusion enzyme is the ability to recruit heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Gene-editing of mouse hepatocytes generated disease-relevant AML12DNAJ-PKAc cell lines. Further analyses indicate that the proto-oncogene A-kinase anchoring protein-Lbc is up-regulated in FLC and functions to cluster DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes with a RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Drug screening reveals Hsp70 and MEK inhibitor combinations that selectively block proliferation of AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrates that DNAJ-PKAc biases the signaling landscape toward ERK activation and engages downstream kinase cascades. Thus, the oncogenic action of DNAJ-PKAc involves an acquired scaffolding function that permits recruitment of Hsp70 and mobilization of local ERK signaling.",Dissociable laminar profiles of concurrent bottom-up and top-down modulation in the human visual cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063127,eLife,2019 06 10,"Recent developments in human neuroimaging make it possible to non-invasively measure neural activity from different cortical layers. This can potentially reveal not only which brain areas are engaged by a task, but also how. Specifically, bottom-up and top-down responses are associated with distinct laminar profiles. Here, we measured lamina-resolved fMRI responses during a visual task designed to induce concurrent bottom-up and top-down modulations via orthogonal manipulations of stimulus contrast and feature-based attention. BOLD responses were modulated by both stimulus contrast (bottom-up) and by engaging feature-based attention (top-down). Crucially, these effects operated at different cortical depths: Bottom-up modulations were strongest in the middle cortical layer and weaker in deep and superficial layers, while top-down modulations were strongest in the superficial layers. As such, we demonstrate that laminar activity profiles can discriminate between concurrent top-down and bottom-up processing, and are diagnostic of how a brain region is activated.",Building the GreenCut2 suite of proteins to unmask photosynthetic function and regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063126,"Microbiology (Reading, England)",2019 05 07,"The suite of GreenCut proteins, initially assembled in 2007 and updated in 2011 (GreenCut2), comprises 597 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteins; these proteins, identified as putative orthologues in all green lineage organisms examined, but not (or poorly conserved) in non-photosynthetic organisms, are potentially enriched for proteins affiliated with photosynthesis. The annotation of GreenCut2 proteins and the characterization of mutants with lesions in genes encoding those proteins identified catalytic components of the photosynthetic apparatus that were previously uncharacterized, as well as polypeptides likely associated with chloroplast biogenesis and potential regulatory factors and activities that link environmental conditions to dynamic control of photosynthetic activities. Analyses of strains devoid of specific GreenCut2 proteins are being aided by a genome-wide library of mutants for which the lesions are mapped, indexed and readily available to the community (https://www.chlamylibrary.org/). In this review we briefly include some milestones in the history of photosynthesis, explain the way in which the GreenCut protein assemblage was generated and describe potential functions of individual member proteins, especially those linked to photosynthesis."

Thus, analysis of the information generated by epidemiological surveillance systems has vital importance for health decision making. A retrospective analysis was performed using data generated by the four molecular diagnostic laboratories of the Mexican Social Security Institute between 2010 and 2016. Demographics, influenza positivity, seasonality, treatment choices and vaccination status analyses were performed for the vaccine according to its composition for each season. In all cases, both the different influenza subtypes and different age groups were considered separately. The circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 (48.7%), influenza A/H3N2 (21.1%), influenza B (12.6%), influenza A not subtyped (11%) and influenza A/H1N1 (6.6%) exhibited well-defined annual seasonality between November and March, and there were significant increases in the number of cases every 2 years. An inadequate use of oseltamivir was determined in 38% of cases, and the vaccination status in general varied between 12.1 and 18.5% depending on the season.

Two-hundred and seventy-nine isolates of E. coli were recovered from 90 faecal samples from apparently healthy (45) and diarrhoeal (45) calves. The isolates were screened for phenotypic susceptibility to carbapenems and production of metallo β-lactamase, as well as five carbapenemase resistance genes by PCR, and overexpression of efflux pumps. Eighty-one isolates (29.03%) were resistant to at least one of three carbapenem antibiotics [meropenem (23.30%), imipenem (2.15%) and ertapenem (1.43%)], and one isolate was positive for the blaVIM gene which was located on an Incl1 plasmid of a novel sequence type (ST 297) by multilocus sequence typing. The majority (83.95%) of isolates had an active efflux pump. Calves housed on concrete floors were approximately seven times more likely to acquire meropenem-resistant isolates than those housed on earthen floors (95% CI 1.27-41.54). In India, carbapenem drugs are not used in food animal treatment, hence carbapenem-resistant strains in calves possibly originate from the natural environment or human contact and is of public health importance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of blaVIM carbapenemases gene in calves from India.","Epidemiologic patterns of human Salmonella serotype diversity in the USA, 1996-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063111,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Although researchers have described numerous risk factors for salmonellosis and for infection with specific common serotypes, the drivers of Salmonella serotype diversity among human populations remain poorly understood. In this retrospective observational study, we partition records of serotyped non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates from human clinical specimens reported to CDC national surveillance by demographic, geographic and seasonal characteristics and adapt sample-based rarefaction methods from the field of community ecology to study how Salmonella serotype diversity varied within and among these populations in the USA during 1996-2016. We observed substantially higher serotype richness in children &lt;2 years old than in older children and adults and steadily increasing richness with age among older adults. Whereas seasonal and regional variation in serotype diversity was highest among infants and young children, variation by specimen source was highest in adults. Our findings suggest that the risk for infection from uncommon serotypes is associated with host and environmental factors, particularly among infants, young children and older adults. These populations may have a higher proportion of illness acquired through environmental transmission pathways than published source attribution models estimate.","On the role of different age groups during pertussis epidemics in California, 2010 and 2014.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063110,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"There is limited information on the roles of different age groups in propagating pertussis outbreaks, and the temporal changes in those roles since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines. The relative roles of different age groups in propagating the 2010 and the 2014 pertussis epidemics in California were evaluated using the relative risk (RR) statistic that measures the change in the group's proportion among all detected cases before vs. after the epidemic peak. For the 2010-11 epidemic, evidence for a predominant transmission age group was weak, with the largest RR estimates being 1.26 (95% CI 1.08-1.46) (aged 11-13 years); 1.19 (1.01-1.4) (aged 9-10 years); 1.17 (0.86-1.59) (aged 14-15 years); 1.12 (0.86-1.46) (aged 16-19 years) and 1.1 (0.89-1.36) (aged 7-8 years). The 2014 epidemic showed a strong signal of the role of older adolescents, with the highest RR estimate being in those aged 14-15 years (RR = 1.83, 1.61-2.07), followed by adolescents aged 16-19 years (RR = 1.41, 1.24-1.61) and 11-13 years (RR = 1.26, 1.12-1.41), with lower RR estimates in other age groups. As the time following introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines in California progressed, older adolescents played an increasing role in transmission during the major pertussis outbreaks. Booster pertussis vaccination for older adolescents with vaccines effective against pertussis transmission should be considered with the aim of mitigating future pertussis epidemics in the community.",A history of FMD research and control programmes in Southeast Asia: lessons from the past informing the future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063108,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a major animal health problem within Southeast Asia (SEA). Although Indonesia and more recently the Philippines have achieved freedom from FMD, the disease remains endemic on continental SEA. Control of FMD within SEA would increase access to markets in more developed economies and reduce lost productivity in smallholder and emerging commercial farmer settings. However, despite many years of vaccination by individual countries, numerous factors have prevented the successful control of FMD within the region, including unregulated 'informal' transboundary movement of livestock and their products, difficulties implementing vaccination programmes, emergence of new virus topotypes and lineages, low-level technical capacity and biosecurity at national levels, limited farmer knowledge on FMD disease recognition, failure of timely outbreak reporting and response, and limitations in national and international FMD control programmes. This paper examines the published research of FMD in the SEA region, reviewing the history, virology, epidemiology and control programmes and identifies future opportunities for FMD research aimed at the eventual eradication of FMD from the region.",HPV infection in semen: results from a new molecular approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063107,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the agent of the most common sexually transmitted diseases causing a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from warts to cancer. Oncogenic HPV infection is the major cause of cervical cancer and less frequently of penile cancers. Its presence in semen is widely known, but the effects on fertility are still controversial. We developed a new approach to evaluate virus localisation in the different semen components. We analysed also the specific genotype localisation and viral DNA quantity by qPCR. Results show that HPV DNA can be identified in every fraction of semen: spermatozoa, somatic cells and seminal plasma. Different samples can contain the HPV DNA in different fractions and several HPV genotypes can be found in the same fraction. Additionally, different fractions may contain multiple HPV genotypes in different relative quantity. We analysed the wholeness of HPV DNA in sperm cells by qPCR. In one sample more than half of viral genomes were defective, suggesting a possible recombination event. The new method allows to easily distinguish different sperm infections and to observe the possible effects on semen. The data support the proposed role of HPV in decreased fertility and prompt new possible consequences of the infection in semen.",Zoonotic approach to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli: integrated analysis of virulence and antimicrobial resistance in ruminants and humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063106,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"In 2014-2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in 115 sheep, 104 beef and 82 dairy cattle herds to estimate Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) prevalence, and collected data on human clinical cases of infection. Isolates were characterised (stx1, stx2, eae, ehxA) and serogroups O157 and O111 identified by PCR, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles were determined by broth microdilution. STEC were more frequently isolated from beef cattle herds (63.5%) and sheep flocks (56.5%) than from dairy cattle herds (30.5%) (P &lt; 0.001). A similar but non-significant trend was observed for O157:H7 STEC. In humans, mean annual incidence rate was 1.7 cases/100 000 inhabitants for O157 STEC and 4.7 for non-O157 STEC, but cases concentrated among younger patients. Distribution of virulence genes in STEC strains from ruminants differed from those from human clinical cases. Thus, stx2 was significantly associated with animal STEC isolates (O157 and non-O157), ehxA to ruminant O157 STEC (P = 0.004) and eae to human non-O157 STEC isolates (P &lt; 0.001). Resistance was detected in 21.9% of human and 5.2% of animal O157 STEC isolates, whereas all non-O157 isolates were fully susceptible. In conclusion, STEC were widespread in ruminants, but only some carried virulence genes associated with severe disease in humans; AMR in ruminants was low but profiles were similar to those found in human isolates.",Injection drug network characteristics as a predictor of injection behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063105,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Social network characteristics of people who inject drugs (PWID) have previously been flagged as potential risk factors for HCV transmission such as increased injection frequency. To understand the role of the injecting network on injection frequency, we investigated how changes in an injecting network over time can modulate injecting risk behaviour. PWID were sourced from the Networks 2 Study, a longitudinal cohort study of PWID recruited from illicit drug street markets across Melbourne, Australia. Network-related correlates of injection frequency and the change in frequency over time were analysed using adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards and Generalised Estimating Equations modelling. Two-hundred and eighteen PWID followed up for a mean (s.d.) of 2.8 (1.7) years were included in the analysis. A greater number of injecting partners, network closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality over time were associated with an increased rate of infection frequency. Every additional injection drug partner was associated with an increase in monthly injection frequency. Similarly, increased network connectivity and centrality over time was also associated with an increase in injection frequency. This study observed that baseline network measures of connectivity and centrality may be associated with changes in injection frequency and, by extension, may predict subsequent HCV transmission risk. Longitudinal changes in network position were observed to correlate with changes in injection frequency, with PWID who migrate from the densely-connected network centre out to the less-connected periphery were associated with a decreased rate of injection frequency.",The seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus infection in Belgium anno 2002 and 2006: a comparative analysis with hepatitis A virus seroprevalence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063104,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is endemic worldwide but its seroprevalence varies widely. The goal of this study was to estimate the age-specific seroprevalence of CMV infection in Belgium based on two cross-sectional serological datasets from 2002 and 2006. The seroprevalence was estimated relying on diagnostic test results based on cut-off values pre-specified by the manufacturers of the tests as well as relying on mixture models applied to continuous pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody titre concentrations. The age-specific seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV), based on three Belgian cross-sectional serological datasets from 1993, 2002 and 2006, was used as a comparator since individuals acquire lifelong immunity upon recovery, implying an increasing seroprevalence with age. The age group weighted overall CMV seroprevalence derived from the mixture model was 32% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-34%) in 2002 and 31% (95% CI 30-32%) in 2006. We demonstrated that CMV epidemiology differs from the immunizing infection HAV. This was the first large-scale study of CMV and HAV serial datasets in Belgium, estimating seroprevalence specified by age and birth cohort.",Co-receptor tropism and genetic characteristics of the V3 regions in variants of antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 infected subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063103,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Co-receptor tropism has been identified to correlate with HIV-1 transmission and the disease progression in patients. A molecular epidemiology investigation of co-receptor tropism is important for clinical practice and effective control of HIV-1. In this study, we investigated the co-receptor tropism on HIV-1 variants of 85 antiretroviral-naive patients with Geno2pheno algorithm at a false-positive rate of 10%. Our data showed that a majority of the subjects harboured the CCR5-tropic virus (81.2%, 69/85). No significant differences in gender, age, baseline CD4+ T-cell counts and transmission routes were observed between subjects infected with CXCR4-tropic or CCR5-tropic virus. The co-receptor tropism appeared to be associated with the virus genotype; a significantly more CXCR4-use was predicted in CRF01_AE infections whereas all CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC were predicted to use CCR5 co-receptor. Sequences analysis of V3 revealed a higher median net charge in the CXCR4 viruses over CCR5 viruses (4.0 vs. 3.0, P &lt; 0.05). The predicted N-linked glycosylation site between amino acids 6 and 8 in the V3 region was conserved in CCR5 viruses, but not in CXCR4 viruses. Besides, variable crown motifs were observed in both CCR5 and CXCR4 viruses, of which the most prevalent motif GPGQ existed in both viral tropism and almost all genotypes identified in this study except subtype B. These findings may offer important implications for clinical practice and enhance our understanding of HIV-1 biology."

Erinaceus coronavirus (EriCoV), a clade C Betacoronavirus, was first described in Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Germany. Here, our objective was to determine whether EriCoV is present, and if it is associated with disease, in Great Britain (GB). An EriCoV-specific BRYT-Green® real-time reverse transcription PCR assay was used to test 351 samples of faeces or distal large intestinal tract contents collected from casualty or dead hedgehogs from a wide area across GB. Viral RNA was detected in 10.8% (38) samples; however, the virus was not detected in any of the 61 samples tested from Scotland. The full genome sequence of the British EriCoV strain was determined using next generation sequencing; it shared 94% identity with a German EriCoV sequence. Multivariate statistical models using hedgehog case history data, faecal specimen descriptions and post-mortem examination findings found no significant associations indicative of disease associated with EriCoV in hedgehogs. These findings indicate that the Western European hedgehog is a reservoir host of EriCoV in the absence of apparent disease.",Analysis of individual patient data to describe the incubation period distribution of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063091,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a pathogen that can cause bloody diarrhoea and severe complications. Cases occur sporadically but outbreaks are also common. Understanding the incubation period distribution and factors influencing it will help in the investigation of exposures and consequent disease control. We extracted individual patient data for STEC cases associated with outbreaks with a known source of exposure in England and Wales. The incubation period was derived and cases were described according to patient and outbreak characteristics. We tested for heterogeneity in reported incubation period between outbreaks and described the pattern of heterogeneity. We employed a multi-level regression model to examine the relationship between patient characteristics such as age, gender and reported symptoms; and outbreak characteristics such as mode of transmission with the incubation period. A total of 205 cases from 41 outbreaks were included in the study, of which 64 cases (31%) were from a single outbreak. The median incubation period was 4 days. Cases reporting bloody diarrhoea reported shorter incubation periods compared with cases without bloody diarrhoea, and likewise, cases aged between 40 and 59 years reported shorter incubation period compared with other age groups. It is recommended that public health officials consider the characteristics of cases involved in an outbreak in order to inform the outbreak investigation and the period of exposure to be investigated.",The effectiveness of vaccination to prevent the papillomavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063090,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Our purpose was to determine the effectiveness and harms of vaccination in patients with any sexual history to prevent the prevalence of papillomavirus infection. A search strategy was conducted in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS databases. Searches were also conducted in other databases and unpublished literature. The risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Analysis of fixed effects was conducted. The primary outcome was the infection by any and each human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype, serious adverse effects and short-term adverse effects. The measure of the effect was the risk difference (RD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The planned interventions were bivalent vaccine/tetravalent/nonavalent vs. placebo/no intervention/other vaccines. We included 29 studies described in 35 publications. Bivalent HPV vaccine offers protection against HPV16 (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.098 to -0.0032), HPV18 (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.062 to -0.0004) and HPV16/18 genotypes (RD of -0.1, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.04). On the other side, tetravalent HPV vaccine offered protection against HPV6 (RD of -0.0500, 95% CI -0.0963 to -0.0230), HPV11 (RD -0.0198, 95% CI -0.0310 to -0.0085). Also, against HPV16 (RD of -0.0608, 95% CI -0.1126 to -0.0091) and HPV18 (RD of -0.0200, 95% CI -0.0408 to -0.0123). There was a reduction in the prevalence of HPV16, 18 and 16/18 genotypes when applying the bivalent vaccine, with no increase in adverse effects. Regarding the tetravalent vaccine, we found a reduction in the prevalence of HPV6, 11, 16 and 18 genotypes, with no increase in adverse effects.","Estimate of the annual burden of foodborne illness in nondeployed active duty US Army Service Members: five major pathogens, 2010-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063088,Epidemiology and infection,2019 05 07,"In this study, we estimate the burden of foodborne illness (FBI) caused by five major pathogens among nondeployed US Army service members. The US Army is a unique population that is globally distributed, has its own food procurement system and a food protection system dedicated to the prevention of both unintentional and intentional contamination of food. To our knowledge, the burden of FBI caused by specific pathogens among the US Army population has not been determined. We used data from a 2015 US Army population survey, a 2015 US Army laboratory survey and data from FoodNet to create inputs for two model structures. Model type 1 scaled up case counts of Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica non-typhoidal and STEC non-O157 ascertained from the Disease Reporting System internet database from 2010 to 2015. Model type 2 scaled down cases of self-reported acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) to estimate the annual burden of Norovirus illness. We estimate that these five pathogens caused 45 600 (5%-95% range, 30 300-64 000) annual illnesses among nondeployed active duty US Army Service members. Of these pathogens, Norovirus, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica non-typhoidal were responsible for the most illness. There is a tremendous burden of AGI and FBI caused by five major pathogens among US Army Soldiers, which can have a tremendous impact on readiness of the force. The US Army has a robust food protection program in place, but without a specific active FBI surveillance system across the Department of Defence, we will never have the ability to measure the effectiveness of modern, targeted, interventions aimed at the reduction of specific foodborne pathogens.",Development of predictive nomograms for clinical use to quantify the risk of isolating resistance prone organisms in patients with infected foot ulcers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063087,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been considered prevalent pathogens in foot infections. However, whether empiric therapy directed against these organisms is necessary, and in whom to consider treatment, is rather unclear. The aim of this study was to develop predictive algorithms for forecasting the probability of isolating these organisms in the infected wounds of patients in a population where the prevalence of resistant pathogens is low. This was a retrospective study of regression model-based risk factor analysis that included 140 patients who presented with infected, culture positive foot ulcers to two urban hospitals. A total of 307 bacteria were identified, most frequently MRSA (11.1%). P. aeruginosa prevalence was 6.5%. In the multivariable analysis, amputation (odds ratio (OR) 5.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48-27.63), renal disease (OR 5.46, 95% CI 1.43-25.16) and gangrene (OR 2.78, 95% CI 0.82-9.59) were identified as risk factors associated with higher while diabetes (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.34) and Infectious Diseases Society of America infection severity &gt;3 (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.03-0.65) were associated with lower odds of P. aeruginosa isolation (C statistic 0.81). Similar analysis for MRSA showed that amputation was associated with significantly lower (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.79) risk, while history of MRSA infection (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.56-20.63) and osteomyelitis (OR 2.523, 95% CI 1.00-6.79) was associated with higher odds of isolation (C statistic 0.69). We developed two predictive nomograms with reasonable to strong ability to discriminate between patients who were likely of being infected with P. aeruginosa or MRSA and those who were not. These analyses confirm the association of some, but also question the significance of other frequently described risk factors in predicting the isolation of these organisms.",Estimating seasonal variation in Australian pertussis notifications from 1991 to 2016: evidence of spring to summer peaks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063086,Epidemiology and infection,2019 06 10,"Unlike for many other respiratory infections, the seasonality of pertussis is not well understood. While evidence of seasonal fluctuations in pertussis incidence has been noted in some countries, there have been conflicting findings including in the context of Australia. We investigated this issue by analysing the seasonality of pertussis notifications in Australia using monthly data from January 1991 to December 2016. Data were made available for all states and territories in Australia except for the Australian Capital Territory and were stratified into age groups. Using a time-series decomposition approach, we formulated a generalised additive model where seasonality is expressed using cosinor terms to estimate the amplitude and peak timing of pertussis notifications in Australia. We also compared these characteristics across different jurisdictions and age groups. We found evidence that pertussis notifications exhibit seasonality, with peaks observed during the spring and summer months (November-January) in Australia and across different states and territories. During peak months, notifications are expected to increase by about 15% compared with the yearly average. Peak notifications for children &lt;5 years occurred 1-2 months later than the general population, which provides support to the theory that older household members remain an important source of pertussis infection for younger children. In addition, our results provide a more comprehensive spatial picture of seasonality in Australia, a feature lacking in previous studies. Finally, our findings suggest that seasonal forcing may be useful to consider in future population transmission models of pertussis.",Histopathological changes to the vascular wall after treatment of great saphenous veins using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063085,VASA. Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,2019 05 07,"Background: A histopathological examination was conducted on vein samples from six patients who had undergone great saphenous vein sealing with Histoacryl and Lipiodol to treat chronic venous insufficiency of the superficial venous system. Patients and methods: In each patient a sample of the complete vein including the surrounding tissue was obtained through a minor incision under perioperative sonographic monitoring. Each patient had signed an informed consent form. Samples were taken at the following intervals: six days, six weeks, six months, one year, two years, and three years after treatment. Results: N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate with Lipiodol induces a thrombotic reaction in the acute phase and endothelium is destroyed but no significant inflammation or substantial vascular wall damage is present. In the subsequent period, a foreign body giant cell reaction emerges accompanied by only moderate chronic inflammation that does not extend to the vascular wall or the surrounding tissue. The thrombus is organized with minimal recanalization. The foreign material is gradually degraded, and it is no longer detectable after three years. The vessel wall showed slight sclerotization. Conclusions: N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate that has been applied gradually degrades over the course of three years accompanied by a giant cell reaction, mild chronic inflammation and cicatrices, but there is minimal recanalization of the obturated section.","Modelling of the feed-to-fillet transfer of ethoxyquin and one of its main metabolites, ethoxyquin dimer, to the fillet of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmon salar L.).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063084,"Food additives & contaminants. Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 05 07,"Ethoxyquin (EQ) is an antioxidant supplemented to feed ingredients, mainly fish meal, which is currently under re-evaluation for use in the food production chain. EQ is partly metabolized into several metabolites of which the ethoxyquin dimer (EQDM) accumulates most in the farmed fish fillet. In this study, the feed-to-fillet transfer of dietary EQ and EQDM in Atlantic salmon fillet was investigated, and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK-) two-compartmental model was developed, based on experimental determined EQ and EQDM uptake, metabolism, and elimination kinetics. The model was verified with an external data-set and used to simulate the long term (>1.5 years) EQ and EQDM feed-to fillet transfer in Atlantic salmon under realistic farming conditions such as the seasonal fluctuations in feed intake, growth, and fillet fat deposition. The model predictions showed that initial EQDM levels in juvenile fish are the driving factor in final levels found in food-producing animals, while for EQ the levels in feed, and seasonal variations were the driving factor for food EQ levels.",A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063083,Radiology,2019 05 07,"Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years ± 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Clear identification of factors that account for variation in follow-up recommendations might prevent unnecessary tests for incidental or ambiguous image findings. Purpose To determine incidence and identify factors associated with follow-up recommendations in radiology reports from multiple modalities, patient care settings, and imaging divisions. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed 318 366 reports obtained from diagnostic imaging examinations performed at a large urban quaternary care hospital from January 1 to December 31, 2016, excluding breast and US reports. A subset of 1000 reports were randomly selected and manually annotated to train and validate a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a report included a follow-up imaging recommendation (training-and-validation set consisted of 850 reports and test set of 150 reports). The trained algorithm was used to classify 318 366 reports. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of follow-up recommendation. Additional analysis by imaging subspecialty division was performed, and intradivision and interradiologist variability was quantified. Results The machine learning algorithm classified 38 745 of 318 366 (12.2%) reports as containing follow-up recommendations. Average patient age was 59 years ± 17 (standard deviation); 45.2% (143 767 of 318 366) of reports were from male patients. Among 65 radiologists, 57% (37 of 65) were men. At multivariable analysis, older patients had higher rates of follow-up recommendations (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.01, 1.01] for each additional year), male patients had lower rates of follow-up recommendations (OR, 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.0), and follow-up recommendations were most common among CT studies (OR, 4.2 [95% CI: 4.0, 4.4] compared with radiography). Radiologist sex (P = .54), presence of a trainee (P = .45), and years in practice (P = .49) were not significant predictors overall. A division-level analysis showed 2.8-fold to 6.7-fold interradiologist variation. Conclusion Substantial interradiologist variation exists in the probability of recommending a follow-up examination in a radiology report, after adjusting for patient, examination, and radiologist factors. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Russell in this issue."

HFMD is mainly induced by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71 (EV71). EV71-associated HFMD often has serious neurological disease complications. The purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanisms of action of EV71 on neurons. SH-SY5Y cells transfected or untransfected with EV71 were sequenced. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the limma package in R, and clustering analysis was then performed using the ComplexHeatmap package in R. The DAVID tool was used for EDG enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were predicted using the STRING database and PPI networks were then constructed using Cytoscape software. After pathways involved in the key PPI network nodes were enriched, pathway deviation scores were calculated. Clustering analysis was also conducted for these pathways. There were 978 DEGs in the transfected samples. Upregulated TNF was enriched in NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Among the top 20 nodes in the PPI network, CDK1, STAT3, CCND1, TNF, and MYC had the highest degrees. A total of 28 pathways were enriched for the top 20 nodes, including Epstein-Barr virus infection (p = 3.78E-06), proteoglycans in cancer (p = 4.96E-06), and melanoma (p = 1.99E-05). In addition, clustering analysis showed that these pathways could clearly differentiate the two groups of samples. EV71 may affect neurons by mediating CDK1, STAT3, CCND1, TNF, and MYC, indicating that these genes are promising targets for preventing the neuronal complications of HFMD.",Use of Growth Factors and Cytokines to Treat Injuries Resulting from a Radiation Public Health Emergency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063041,Radiation research,2019 05 07,"In response to concerns over possible radiological or nuclear incidents, the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program within the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was tasked by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support development of medical countermeasures (MCM) to treat the acute and delayed injuries that can result from radiation exposure. To date, the only three drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of acute radiation syndrome are growth factors targeting granulocyte (Neupogen® or Neulasta®) or granulocyte and macrophage (Leukine®) hematopoietic cell lineages. Although these are currently stockpiled for deployment in response to a mass casualty scenario, these growth factors will likely be administered in a scarce-resources environment and availability may be limited. Therefore, there is growing interest in understanding the role that these growth factors play in mitigating radiation damage, to optimize their use and maximize the number of people who can be treated. For these reasons, the NIAID and the Radiation Injury Treatment Network organized a workshop to explore the use of growth factors and other cytokines as MCMs in the treatment of radiation-induced injuries. Subject matter experts from government, industry and academia gathered at this workshop to discuss the concept of operations, triage and treatment, administration to diverse civilian populations, growth factors under development for radiation indications, and how the practice of medicine can inform other potential approaches.",Metabolic syndrome: Association between prevalence and risk at worksites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063040,Archives of environmental & occupational health,2019 05 07,"This study, conducted at major Japanese companies, aimed to determine if asymptomatic workers in workplaces with a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome have a greater risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Data were obtained from the health records of 298,145 people, from 2011 to 2015. We collected data on the participants' age, sex, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and lifestyle behaviors. To test whether the risk of metabolic syndrome in asymptomatic workers differed between groups with a higher and lower prevalence in 2011, Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed, with the covariates being controlled for. The analysis showed that the risk of metabolic syndrome among asymptomatic workers in the high-prevalence group was about 1.1-fold elevated compared to those within the low-prevalence group. As a follow-up to these results, interventions aimed at asymptomatic workers should be provided in workplaces with a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome.",What can musicians' claims data reveal about their musculoskeletal conditions?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063039,Archives of environmental & occupational health,2019 05 07,"Musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms are common amongst professional musicians.

MSK conditions also accounted for 77.76% of costs for musicians' WCC. The most common reported mechanism for MSK claims was body stressing (72.48%), and the most common agency was ""other non-powered equipment"" (including musical instruments; 39.71%), which also accounted for 51.27% of upper limb claims specifically.

Background:
Nontailored and static goals may hinder behavior change. We investigated the feasibility and acceptability of an adaptive proof-of-concept smartphone-delivered intervention by using real-world movement data capture of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) to inform behavior change content delivery.
Materials and Methods:
A single-group 8-week study with pre- and post-intervention assessments was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants aged 17-69 years who owned an Android smartphone were recruited and used the application (app). Usage data, self-reported acceptability and PA and SB were assessed. Daily repeated measurement of PA and SB outcomes were analyzed through random-effects mixed models.
Results:
Participants (n = 69) were predominantly female (78%) with a mean age of 34.5 years (range 18-61). On average, participants opened the app on 11.4 days throughout the 8 weeks. Use decreased over time; 20% of participants opened the app every day. Feedback on behavior (73%), behavior substitution (71%), discrepancy between behavior and goal (58%) and goal setting (54%) were rated as the most useful behavior change techniques by participants. Time spent on light, moderate-to-vigorous intensity and total PA increased post-intervention, whereas time spent on SB decreased.
Conclusions:
The adaptive proof-of-concept app was considered acceptable, with preliminary support for its positive effects on PA and SB.",Influence of Visual Dependence on Inter-Segmental Coordination during Upright Stance in Cerebral Palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063037,Journal of motor behavior,2019 05 07,"The presence of visual dependence as an influential factor on the development of functional stability in ambulatory individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) was studied in 22 adults with spastic bilateral CP, 11 of whom were considered visually dependent, and 18 healthy adults. Participants stood upright during pitch plane disturbances of the visual field and support surface. Intersegmental coordination behaviors were assessed by fitting trajectories of adjacent body segments to an ellipse. Mixed-model repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on ellipse orientation angle and area. Dissimilar stabilizing strategies adopted by the two groups with CP imply that visual dependence impacts postural control.

Conserved ortholog set (COS) markers were used to identify D. villosum chromosome introgression lines, which were then subjected to seedling P. graminis f. tritici resistance screening with race TTKSK. A COS marker-verified line carrying chromosome 2V with TTKSK resistance was further characterized by combined genomic in situ and fluorescent in situ analyses to confirm a monosomic substitution line MS2V(2D) (20″ + 1' 2V[2D]). This is the first report of stem rust resistance on 2V, which was temporarily designated as SrTA10276-2V. To facilitate the use of this gene in wheat improvement, a complete set of previously developed wheat-D. villosum disomic addition lines was subjected to genotyping-by-sequencing analysis to develop D. villosum chromosome-specific markers. On average, 350 markers per chromosome were identified. These markers can be used to develop diagnostic markers for D. villosum-derived genes of interest in wheat improvement.",African Nightshade and African Spinach Decrease Root-Knot Nematode and Potato Cyst Nematode Soil Infestation in Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063027,Plant disease,2019 05 07,"Plant-parasitic nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes (RKN: Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst nematodes (CN: Globodera and Heterodera spp.) cause severe yield reduction in most cultivated crops and are of high economic importance. African nightshade (Solanum spp.) and African spinach (Amaranthus spp.) are important African indigenous vegetables (AIV) and are rich sources of nutrition and income. However, their host status to plant-parasitic nematodes remains largely speculative. Therefore, a survey was conducted which revealed that S. villosum exhibited high root galling, whereas on S. scabrum, A. cruentus, and A. dubius root galling was rare or very low. Additionally, soil collected from the rhizosphere of S. villosum and S. scabrum contained few cysts of potato cyst nematodes (PCN), and no developing PCN females were observed on the roots of growing plants. Therefore, we studied the dynamics of RKN and PCN on A. dubius, A. cruentus, S. scabrum, and S. villosum over 2 years in a field experiment. The effects of AIV crop species on RKN and PCN soil infestation were evaluated using susceptible S. lycopersicum or S. tuberosum. After first, second, and third cultivation of A. dubius, A. cruentus, and S. scabrum, RKN infestation of the soil decreased by more than 85%, whereas S. scabrum and S. villosum decreased PCN densities by more than 80%. When cropping susceptible crops, after three seasons of successive cultivation of these AIV, galling index and number of developing PCN females measured on susceptible crops decreased by more than 75%. Wilting and RKN-PCN coinfection incidences also decreased significantly. Here, we present data that support the development of a novel cropping system including African spinach and African nightshade, which reveals a high potential to manage RKN and PCN in an environmentally friendly, effective, and productive way.",On the life and work of Korbinian Brodmann (1868-1918).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063026,Journal of the history of the neurosciences,2019 05 07,"This study describes the life and work of early-twentieth-century German scientist Korbinian Brodmann (1868-1918).

Background:
 Providers often use birth plans to document parents' wishes for their fetus with a life-limiting condition. 
Objective:
 The objective of the study was to (1) discover important components of a birth plan for parents and providers who carry them out, and (2) understand the experience of parents and providers with birth plans. 
Methods:
 The study design involves mixed-methods, descriptive, exploratory survey. This involves parents (n = 20) of a pregnancy complicated by a life-limiting diagnosis and providers who care for them (n = 116). The approach involves descriptive and univariate analyses for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. 
Results:
 Consistent components for families and physicians were diagnosis and medical management of the infant. Families gave greater emphasis on memory-making preferences. Parents feel birth plans give them a sense of control. Themes emerged from parents' experience of creating a birth plan are as follows: sense of control, therapeutic, memory making, effective communication, feeling prepared, and unexpected events. Most physicians feel comfortable discussing goals of care with families but report insufficient time. The importance of components of birth plans and perception of the parents' understanding of the prognosis varied by specialty. 
Discussion:
 Birth plans are beneficial and provide a greater sense of control for parents. Most physicians feel comfortable utilizing them. More than one-third of the physicians do not feel that they have time to complete a birth plan with parents. Communication between physicians and families about limitations of the plan and the potential trajectories could be improved. Communication between maternal and neonatal care providers regarding parent expectations and understanding could also be improved.","Neurovascular coupling during optogenetic functional activation: Local and remote stimulus-response characteristics, and uncoupling by spreading depression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063009,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 05 07,"Neurovascular coupling is a fundamental response that links activity to perfusion. Traditional paradigms of neurovascular coupling utilize somatosensory stimulation to activate the primary sensory cortex through subcortical relays. Therefore, examination of neurovascular coupling in disease models can be confounded if the disease process affects these multisynaptic pathways. Optogenetic stimulation is an alternative to directly activate neurons, bypassing the subcortical relays. We employed minimally invasive optogenetic cortical activation through intact skull in Thy1-channelrhodopsin-2 transgenic mice, examined the blood flow changes using laser speckle imaging, and related these to evoked electrophysiological activity. Our data show that optogenetic activation of barrel cortex triggers intensity- and frequency-dependent hyperemia both locally within the barrel cortex (>50% CBF increase), and remotely within the ipsilateral motor cortex (>30% CBF increase). Intriguingly, activation of the barrel cortex causes a small (∼10%) but reproducible hypoperfusion within the contralateral barrel cortex, electrophysiologically linked to transhemispheric inhibition. Cortical spreading depression, known to cause neurovascular uncoupling, diminishes optogenetic hyperemia by more than 50% for up to an hour despite rapid recovery of evoked electrophysiological activity, recapitulating a unique feature of physiological neurovascular coupling. Altogether, these data establish a minimally invasive paradigm to investigate neurovascular coupling for longitudinal characterization of cerebrovascular pathologies.",Causal Gene Regulatory Network Modeling and Genomics: Second-Generation Challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063008,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,2019 05 07,"
Gene regulatory network modeling has played a major role in advancing the understanding of developmental systems, by crystallizing structures of relevant extant information, by formally posing hypothetical functional relationships between network elements, and by offering clear predictive tests to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving developmental progression. Both ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based and Boolean models have also been highly successful in explaining dynamics within subcircuits of more complex processes. In a very small number of cases, gene regulatory network models of much more global scope have been proposed that successfully predict the dynamics of the processes establishing most of an embryonic body plan. Can such successes be expanded to very different developmental systems, including post-embryonic mammalian systems? This perspective discusses several problems that must be solved in more quantitative and predictive theoretical terms, to make this possible. These problems include: the effects of cellular history on chromatin state and how these affect gene accessibility; the dose dependence of activities of many transcription factors (a problem for Boolean models); stochasticity of some transcriptional outputs (a problem for simple ODE models); response timing delays due to epigenetic remodeling requirements; functionally different kinds of repression; and the regulatory syntax that governs responses of genes with multiple enhancers.
",Development of innate immunity in chicken embryos and newly hatched chicks: A disease control perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063007,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2019 05 07,"Newly hatched chickens are confronted by a wide array of pathogenic microbes when their adaptive immune defenses have limited capabilities to control these pathogens. In such circumstances and within this age group, innate responses provide a degree of protection. Moreover, as the adaptive immune system is relatively naïve to foreign antigens, synergy with innate defenses is critical. This review presents knowledge on the ontogeny of innate immunity in chicken pre-hatch and early post-hatch and provides insights into possible interventions to modulate innate responses early in the life of the bird. As in other vertebrate species, chicken innate immune system components, including cellular mediators, cytokine and chemokine repertoires and molecules involved in antigen detection, develop early in life. Comparison of innate immune systems in newly hatched chickens and mature birds has revealed differences, in magnitude and quality, but responses in younger chickens can be boosted using innate immune system modulators. Functional expression of pattern recognition receptors and several defense molecules by innate immune system cells of embryos and newly hatched chicks suggests that innate responses can be modulated at this stage of development to combat pathogens. Improved understanding of innate immune system ontogeny and functionality in chickens is critical for implementation of sound and safe interventions to provide long-term protection against pathogens. Technological approaches such as RNASeq and CRISPR/Cas9 for functional metagenomics and gene knockouts can be used in the future to explore and dissect the contributions of signaling pathways of innate immunity and to devise more efficacious disease control strategies.",High-fat diet in pregnant rats and adverse fetal outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063006,Upsala journal of medical sciences,2019 06 10,"Background: Although pregestational obesity has been associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcome, the mechanisms behind are not known. We aimed to investigate the influence of the maternal metabolic state on fetal outcome in rats exposed to either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a control diet (CD). We also investigated the impact of serum collected from HFD/CD pregnant rats on CD embryonic development in whole-embryo cultures. Material and methods: On gestational day 0, 9, 10, or 20 maternal plasma/serum samples were collected as pregnancies were terminated for the estimations of maternal metabolic state and embryo-fetal development. We measured embryonic gene expression of ROS scavenger enzymes as well as genes involved in inflammation in maternal adipose tissue. Results: In HFD maternal plasma/serum, concentrations of glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, branched-chain amino acids, and leptin were increased, whereas those of triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids were decreased. Gene expression of CuZnSOD, IL-6, IL-10, and resistin was increased in HFD maternal adipose tissue, whereas that of CuZnSOD and MnSOD was decreased in HFD-exposed embryos. HFD caused retention of most fatty acids in the maternal liver as well. Conclusion: HFD alters the maternal metabolic state, increases fetal resorptions in vivo, and increases the rate of fetal/embryonic malformations both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that metabolic disturbances in HFD pregnant rats have profound adverse developmental effects in the offspring.",Enclomiphene citrate: A treatment that maintains fertility in men with secondary hypogonadism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063005,Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2019 05 10,"Hypogonadism is an important issue among the male population. Treatments such as exogenous testosterone have become very popular. One of the adverse effects of testosterone is its suppression of fertility. This has lead to the use of alternative therapies such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that aim to correct hypogonadism without reducing fertility. Areas covered: The SERM, clomiphene citrate, which is approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian dysfunction, has been shown to have beneficial effects on male hypogonadism. Clomiphene citrate exists as a mixture of both the cis-isomer (zuclomiphene) and the trans-isomer (enclomiphene). The literature has suggested that most of the beneficial effects of clomiphene are due to the trans-isomer enclomiphene. Zuclomiphene contributes little to the intended outcomes. The purpose of this drug profile is to examine the available literature on the trans-isomer enclomiphene. Expert opinion: Enclomiphene has been shown to increase testosterone levels while stimulating FSH and LH production. Initial studies demonstrated that enclomiphene maintains the androgenic benefit of clomiphene citrate without the undesirable effects attributable to zuclomiphene. This article reviews the difficulties associated with the FDA approval of a new molecular entity related to the treatment of hypogonadism.",Prospects for a General Theory of Evolutionary Novelty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063004,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,2019 05 07,"
Novelty is a topic of broad interest, with two distinct approaches within evolutionary biology. The dominant approach since Darwin has been transformationist, with novelty arising through gradual changes in morphology. The Modern Synthesis emphasized the importance of ecological opportunity rather than the source of variation, and this view has many adherents today. Yet, since well before Darwin, an alternative view has held that novelties could arise by rapid changes and many not necessarily be connected to ecological opportunity. The rise of comparative evolutionary developmental biology since 1990 has led to a resurgence of these arguments. Many case studies have documented novelties and there have been rigorous efforts to define the attributes of novelty, but there have been few attempts at a more general model. In contrast, studies of technological innovation have been replete with qualitative models since the 1930s. In this article I consider several possibilities for constructing a general model of novelty and innovation: (1) A general formal theory. (2) Commonalities between different levels, such as genes and morphology, but with sufficient differences between domains that any formal theory would be level specific. (3) Commonalities across levels but for various reasons developing a formal theory even within domains is improbable. A final alternative is that novelty and innovation may be so deeply historical that any general framework is impossible. I conclude that a common conceptual framework can be developed and serve as the foundation for simulation studies, but the importance of feedbacks and potentiating factors renders a formal model implausible.
",Improved unhealthy lifestyle habits in patients with high cardiovascular risk: results from a structured lifestyle programme in primary care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063003,Upsala journal of medical sciences,2019 06 10,"Background. Physical activity, healthful dietary habits, and not smoking are associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, few studies have examined how counselling to improve poor lifestyle habits might be carried out in clinical practice. In Swedish primary care, structured lifestyle counselling is still not integrated into everyday clinical practice. The aim of the present study was two-fold: (1) to describe a novel lifestyle intervention programme in primary care; and (2) to evaluate change in unhealthy lifestyle habits over 1 year in men and women with high cardiovascular risk who participated in the lifestyle intervention programme. Method. A single-group study with a 1-year follow-up was carried out. A total of 417 people was enrolled, median age 62 years (54% women), with either hypertension (69%), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or impaired glucose tolerance. The 1-year intervention included five counselling sessions that focused on lifestyle habits, delivered by a district nurse with postgraduate credits in diabetes care and the metabolic syndrome. All patients were offered in-depth counselling for one or more lifestyle habits when needed. Lifestyle habits were assessed by a questionnaire at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Total change was assessed using a nine-factor unhealthy lifestyle habit index. Results. Favourable, significant changes were observed for physical activity, dietary habits, smoking, and stress over 1 year. Similar improvements were seen for both sexes and type of diagnosis. Conclusions. The results support the utility of a multifactorial, structured approach to change unhealthy lifestyle habits for cardiovascular risk prevention in a primary care setting.",Association between Sleep Disturbances and Emotional/Behavioral Problems in Chinese and Japanese Preschoolers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063001,Behavioral sleep medicine,2019 05 07,"Sleep disturbances are often associated with emotional/behavioral problems in young children, but whether the association differs among Asian countries remains unknown.

Skeletal muscle perfusion during walking relies on complex interactions between cardiac activity and vascular control mechanisms, why cardiac dysfunction may contribute to intermittent claudication (IC) symptoms. The study aims were to describe cardiac function at rest and during stress in consecutive IC patients, to explore the relations between cardiac function parameters and treadmill performance, and to test the hypothesis that clinically silent myocardial ischemia during stress may contribute to IC limb symptomatology. Design. Patients with mild to severe IC (n = 111, mean age 67 y, 52% females, mean treadmill distance 195 m) underwent standard echocardiography, dobutamine stress echocardiography (SE) and treadmill testing. The patient cohort was separated in two groups based on treadmill performance (HIGH and LOW performance). Results. Ten patients (9%) had regional wall motion abnormalities of which three had left ventricular ejection fraction <50% at standard echocardiography. A majority had lower than expected systolic- and diastolic ventricular volumes. LOW performers had smaller diastolic left ventricular volumes and lower global peak systolic velocity during dobutamine stress. No patient demonstrated significant cardiac dysfunction during dobutamine provocation that was not also evident at standard echocardiography. Conclusions. Most IC patients were without signs of ischemic heart disease or cardiac failure. The majority had small left ventricular volumes. The hypothesis that clinically silent myocardial ischemia impairing left ventricular function during stress may contribute to IC limb symptomatology was not supported."

Then, optimized sertaconazole-NLCs were incorporated into the pluronic F127 (PF127)/hydroxy propylmethylcellulose (HPMC) K4M hydrogel. The formulations were examined for pH, gelation temperature, rheological properties, in vitro permeation studies, and anti-fungal activity. The optimized sertaconazole-NLCs showed a mean particle size of 272.40 nm, encapsulation efficiency of 89.97%, zeta potential of 12.9 mV, and polydispersity index of 0.31. All the in situ formulations had acceptable pH, ranging from 5.89 to 6.28. The gelation temperature of the optimized formulation was 35.1 °C after dilution with simulated tear fluid (STF). Sertaconazole-NLCs showed a higher antifungal activity and permeation through the bovine cornea compared to the free drug and the in situ gel formulation.

Here, effects of curcumin on the fruit gray mold of kiwifruit infected by Botrytis cinerea were analyzed. Results demonstrated that curcumin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and triggered apoptosis in B. cinerea hyphae. Use of N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, partially ameliorated the inhibition of curcumin on B. cinerea. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chlorine, abrogated the ROS production induced by curcumin, suggesting that curcumin induces oxidative stress in B. cinerea via a NADPH-oxidase-dependent mechanism. Disease severity of gray mold in curcumin-treated kiwifruit was significantly reduced. The malondialdehyde content decreased while the antioxidant enzyme activity increased in kiwifruit with the application of increasing concentrations of curcumin.

The performance of the as-fabricated Si photocathodes with and without the CPDA layer was comparatively studied for PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes to evaluate the effect of the sandwich CPDA layer in between the Si substrate and the TiO2 layer on the photoelectrocatalytic behaviors of Si-based electrodes. The photocathodes containing the CPDA layer demonstrated lower electron transfer resistance, higher built-in photovoltage, and larger band bending relative to the analogous electrodes without the CPDA layer. Accordingly, the short-circuit photocurrents of the Ni and Ni-Mo-decorated photocathodes with the CPDA layer were enhanced by a factor of 2.8-3.3, and their open-circuit photovoltages were enlarged by 0.14-0.22 V, compared to those of the corresponding electrodes without the CPDA layer in 1 M KOH under simulated 1 sun illumination. Moreover, the photocathodes with the CPDA layer also exhibited an improved stability for PEC HER in alkaline solutions, with a faradaic efficiency of 90-97% in the initial hour.","Correlations of Crystal and Electronic Structure via NMR and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopies in the RETMAl2 (RE = Sc, Y, La-Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu; TM = Ni, Pd, Pt) Series.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062962,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"A total of 35 intermetallic aluminum compounds have been synthesized from the elements via arc melting and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. A total of 15 of them have been previously reported; however, detailed property investigations were missing. Compounds of the RETMAl2 (rare earth metal RE = Sc, Y, La-Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu) series with transition metal TM = Ni, Pd, and Pt crystallize isostructurally in the orthorhombic MgCuAl2 type structure ( Cmcm, oC16, fc2). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction investigations were conducted on YNiAl2, LaNiAl2, YPdAl2, ScPtAl2, and YPtAl2. The TM and Al atoms form a [TMAl2]δ- polyanion, the RE atoms reside in cavities within the framework. While the Sc, Y, La, and Lu compounds exhibit Pauli-paramagnetic behavior, consistent with all atoms being closed shell, the other RETMAl2 compounds show paramagnetism along with magnetic ordering at low temperatures, in line with an open-shell trivalent oxidation state for the RE atoms. Solid-state 27Al NMR investigations were carried out on the Pauli-paramagnetic samples, all showing only a single central transition, in line with one crystallographic site for the respective atoms. The observed quadrupolar coupling constants and electric-field-gradient asymmetry parameters were found to be in good agreement with the density-functional-theory-calculated values. Isotropic resonance shifts are dominated by the Fermi-contact interactions with s-conduction electron densities at the Fermi edge (Knight shifts). The bonding characteristics mirror the electronic density of states and crystal chemistry of the family of intermetallic compounds under consideration. Both the Knight shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants can be predicted based on element-specific increments.","Optimized Association of Short Alkyl Side Chains Enables Stiff, Self-Recoverable, and Durable Shape-Memory Hydrogel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062959,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 30,"This work reports a self-healing and shape-memory hydrogel integrating multiple mechanical properties. The network configuration is featured as entangled networks cross-linked by distributed association of very short alkyl chains (hexyl, six carbons). These cross-linking knots are interconnected by the long hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol backbone. The optimal aggregation of hexyl side chains leads to the broadened distribution in bonding strength as verified by static and dynamic mechanical characterization. These structural features contribute to high strength, toughness, stiffness, and yet fast recoverability. Furthermore, the hydrophobic and supramolecular nature of aggregated alkyl chains offers high durability and solvent-assistant healing function. Finally, distributed association of hexyl side chains confers a broadened temperature-dependent modulus, allowing for encoding stepwise shape recovery from a temporary shape at different temperatures and/or times.",Graphene Quantum Dots Wrapped Gold Nanoparticles with Integrated Enhancement Mechanisms as Sensitive and Homogeneous Substrates for Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062958,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Rational engineering of highly stable and Raman-active nanostructured substrates is still urgently in demand for achieving sensitive and reliable surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis in solution phase. Herein, monodisperse N-doping graphene quantum dots wrapped Au nanoparticles (Au-NGQD NPs) were facilely prepared, and further their applications as substrates in SERS-based detection and cellular imaging have been explored. The as-prepared Au-NGQD NPs exhibit superior long-term stability and biocompatibility, as well as large enhancement capability due to the integration of electromagnetic and chemical enhancements. The practical applicability of the Au-NGQD NPs was verified via the direct SERS tests of several kinds of aromatics in solution phase. Finite-difference time-domain simulations in combination with density functional theory calculation were also successfully used to explain the enhancement mechanism. Furthermore, the Au-NGQD NPs were conjugated with 4-nitrobenzenethiol (4-NBT, as reporter) and 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA, as targeting element) to construct the MPBA/4-NBT@Au-NGQD probes, which could specifically recognize glycan-overexpressed cancer cells through SERS imaging on a cell surface.

In this work, we report for the first time the use of nanoparticles for fabrication of novel paper-based OENs, which represent much higher sensitivity and produce simple but discriminant colorimetric signature of volatile metabolomes. This nano-optoelectronic nose (NOEN) system, which is fabricated by dropping of gold and silver nanoparticles (each synthesized by 8 chemical species) on the paper, gives obvious colorimetric signatures for chemicals having individual or combined functional groups. Owning to their ultrasensitivity, these simple devices need very small amounts of analytes. These devices could detect and discriminate 45 volatile organic compounds in 9 chemical families including phenols, alchohols, ketones, aldehydes, amines, acids, esters, arenes, and hydrocarbons. In addition to excellent discrimination ability, this NOEN sensor shows ultrahigh sensitivity such that could determine volatile compounds with detection limits around or lower than 10 ppb.

However, development of a high-performance LIC is still restricted by the sluggish intercalation reaction and unsatisfied specific capacities in battery-type bulk anodes. To overcome these issues, herein, we utilize two-step atomic layer deposition (ALD) to realize a uniform coating of FeO x and TiO2 on CuO nanorods, which results in the formation of ternary CuO@FeO x@TiO2 composite. After further treatment in H2/Ar atmosphere, the as-derived Fe3O4 is encapsulated between conductive Cu nanorod and hollow TiO2 shell (denoted as Cu@Fe3O4@TiO2). Owing to the rational design, the binder-free Cu@Fe3O4@TiO2 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh Li-ion storage capacity (1585 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), superior rate capability, and excellent cycle performance (no decay after 1000 cycles), which could efficiently boost the energy-storage capability of LICs. By employing an anode of Cu@Fe3O4@TiO2 and a cathode of activated carbon, the as-constructed full LIC device provides high energy//powder densities (154.8 Wh kg-1 at 200 W kg-1; 66.2 Wh kg-1 at 30 kW kg-1).

Mesoporous structures are ideal carriers for PCMs and guarantee shape stability during the thermal cycle. In this study, we introduce transparent wood (TW) as a TES system. A shape-stabilized PCM based on polyethylene glycol is encapsulated into a delignified wood substrate, and the TW obtained is fully characterized, also in terms of nano- and mesoscale structures. Transparent wood for thermal energy storage (TW-TES) combines large latent heat (∼76 J g-1) with switchable optical transparency. During the heating process, optical transmittance increases by 6% and reaches 68% for 1.5 mm thick TW-TES. Characterization of the thermal energy regulation performance shows that the prepared TW-TES composite is superior to normal glass because of the combination of good heat-storage and thermal insulation properties.

All oncology drugs for which ACSS were required from January 2006-September 2015 found on the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency website were reviewed, and the influence of ACSS on the package insert content was evaluated. Most of the package insert revisions regarding serious treatment-related adverse events were based on spontaneous reports from clinicians.

Finding novel strategies such as device structure engineering is a key pathway toward addressing this issue. In this work, the light absorption and carrier collection of OPV devices are improved by employment of ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays with an optimum NW length (50 nm) and antireflection (AR) film with nanocone structure. The optical characterization results show that ZnO NW increases the transmittance of the electron transporting layer as well as the absorption of the polymer blend. Moreover, the as-deposited polymer blend on the ZnO NW array shows better charge transfer as compared to the planar sample. By employing PC70BM:PV2000 as a promising air-stable active-layer, power conversion efficiencies of 9.8% and 10.1% are achieved for NW devices without and with an AR film, indicating 22.5% and 26.2% enhancement in PCE as compared to that of planar device.

HL-1 cardiomyocytes seeded on SIS matrix-coated plates, SIS gel, and uncoated plates were subjected to H/R, cell viability, apoptosis, expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax were investigated. SIS gel and SIS matrix as coating substrates markedly improved cell viability, preventing cell apoptosis compared to uncoated plates, with SIS gel yielding the best cytoprotective effects. SIS gel down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CCL2, and IL-6) expression through suppression the JNK-MAPK/NF-κB pathways. Furthermore, SIS gel protected cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by activating AKT and ERK pathways, and markedly up-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression but inhibited that of pro-apoptotic Bax and c-caspase 3. Together, these findings show that SIS gel could decrease H/R-induced cell apoptosis through a mechanism potentially related to its ability to regulate expression of inflammatory cytokines and anti-apoptosis signaling pathways to prevent cell apoptosis.

Ether-based Li-S batteries involve sophisticated multistep solid-liquid-solid-solid electrochemical reaction mechanisms. Recently, studies on Li-S batteries have widely focused on the initial solid (sulfur)-liquid (soluble polysulfide)-solid (Li2 S2 ) conversion reactions, which contribute to the first 50% of the theoretical capacity of the Li-S batteries. Nonetheless, the sluggish kinetics of the solid-solid conversion from solid-state intermediate product Li2 S2 to the final discharge product Li2 S (corresponding to the last 50% of the theoretical capacity) leads to the premature end of discharge, resulting in low discharge capacity output and low sulfur utilization. To tackle the aforementioned issue, a catalyst of amorphous cobalt sulfide (CoS3 ) is proposed to decrease the dissociation energy of Li2 S2 and propel the electrochemical transformation of Li2 S2 to Li2 S. The CoS3 catalyst plays a critical role in improving the sulfur utilization, especially in high-loading sulfur cathodes (3-10 mg cm-2 ). Accordingly, the Li2 S/Li2 S2 ratio in the discharge products increased to 5.60/1 from 1/1.63 with CoS3 catalyst, resulting in a sulfur utilization increase of 20% (335 mAh g-1 ) compared to the counterpart sulfur electrode without CoS3 .",Spontaneous trans-Selective Transfer Hydrogenation of Apolar Boron-Boron Double Bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062910,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 06,"The transfer hydrogenation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-supported diborenes with dimethylamine borane proceeds with high selectivity for the trans-1,2-dihydrodiboranes.

Nevertheless, the crystalline lattice of perovskites often includes defects, such as interstitials, vacancies, and impurities; at the grain boundaries and surfaces, dangling bonds can also be present, which all contribute to nonradiative recombination of photo-carriers. On device level, such recombination undesirably inflates the open-circuit voltage deficit, acting thus as a significant roadblock toward the theoretical efficiency limit of 30%.

Age, as shown in the post hoc analyses, was demonstrated to be a significant covariate.

Adults who were functionally intact at baseline (n = 161, ages 47-89) underwent ASL imaging to quantify whole-brain gray matter perfusion; a subset (n = 136) had repeated imaging (average follow-up: 2.3 years). Neuropsychological testing at each visit was summarized into executive function, memory, and processing speed composites. Global gray matter volume, white matter microstructure (mean diffusivity), and white matter hyperintensities were also quantified. We assessed baseline associations among perfusion, cognition, and brain structure using linear regression, and longitudinal relationships using linear mixed effects models. Greater baseline perfusion, particularly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus, was associated with better executive functions. Greater whole-brain perfusion loss was associated with worsening brain structure and declining processing speed. This study helps validate noninvasive MRI-based perfusion imaging and underscores the importance of cerebral blood flow in cognitive aging."

In this study, with a rapid event-related simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy recording in humans, we explored the potential contribution of anticipatory electrophysiological activation and hemodynamic activation by examining how anticipatory low-frequency oscillations and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration influence the subsequent event-related potential (ERP) marker of attentional selection. We found that expecting a target led to both a posterior lateralization of alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation power and a lateralization of HbO response over the visual cortex. Importantly, the magnitude of cue-induced alpha lateralization was positively correlated with the nearby HbO lateralization in the visual cortex, and such a cue-induced alpha lateralization predicted the subsequent target-evoked N2pc amplitudes assumed to reflect attentional selection. Our results suggest that each individual's attentional selection biomarker as reflected by N2pc is predictable in advance via the anticipation-induced alpha lateralization, and such cue-induced alpha lateralization seems to play an important role in the functional coupling effects between the low-frequency EEG and the nearby hemodynamic activation.",Enantioseparation of flurbiprofen enantiomers using chiral ionic liquids by liquid-liquid extraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062890,Chirality,2019 05 22,"Flurbiprofen is a kind of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which has been widely used in clinic for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. It has been reported that S-flurbiprofen shows good performance on clinic anti-inflammatory treatment, while R-enantiomer almost has no pharmacological activities. It has important practical values to obtain optically pure S-flurbiprofen. In this work, chiral ionic liquids, which have good structural designability and chiral recognize ability, were selected as the extraction selector by the assistance of quantum chemistry calculations. The distribution behaviors of flurbiprofen enantiomers were investigated in the extraction system, which was composed of organic solvent and aqueous phase containing chiral ionic liquid. The results show that maximum enantioselectivity up to 1.20 was attained at pH 2.0, 25°C using 1,2-dichloroethane as organic solvent, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole L-tryptophan ([Bmim][L-trp]) as chiral selector. The racemic flurbiprofen initial concentration was 0.2 mmol L-1 , and [Bmim][L-trp] concentration was 0.02 mol L-1 .

This is the result of investigations performed on oligonucleotide duplexes with silver-mediated base pairs of α-D and β-D anomeric 5-aza-7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosines and anomeric 2'-deoxycytidines incorporated in 12-mer duplexes. To this end, a new synthesis protocol was developed to access the pure anomers of 5-aza-7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine by glycosylation of either the protected nucleobase or its salt followed by separation of glycosylation products by crystallization and chromatography. Thermal stability measurements were performed on duplexes with α-D/α-D and β-D/β-D homo base pairs or α-D/β-D and β-D/α-D hybrid pairs within two sequence environments - positions 6 or 7 - of oligonucleotide duplexes. The individual Tm stability increase observed after silver ion addition differs significantly. Homo base pairs with β-D/β-D or α-D/α-D nucleoside combination were more stable than α-D/β-D hybrid base pairs. The positional switch of silver ion mediated base pairs has a significant impact on the stability. Nucleobase substituents introduced at the 5-position of the dC site of silver-mediated base pairs effect base pair stability to a minor extent. Our investigation might find application in the construction of bioinspired nanodevices, in DNA diagnostics or metal DNA hybrid materials.","Structural investigation of selective binding dynamics for the pheromone-binding protein 1 of the grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062883,Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology,2019 06 06,"The European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller), is a serious pest in vineyards in North and South America. Mating disruption techniques have been used to control and monitor L. botrana on the basis of its sexual communication. This needs a well-tuned olfactory system, in which it is believed that pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are key players that transport pheromones in the antennae of moths. In this study, the selectivity of a PBP, named as LbotPBP1, was tested by fluorescence binding assays against 11 sex pheromone components and 6 host plant volatiles. In addition, its binding mechanism was predicted on the basis of structural analyses by molecular docking and complex and steered molecular dynamics (SMD). Our results indicate that LbotPBP1 binds selectively to sex pheromone components over certain host plant volatiles, according to both in vitro and in silico tests. Thus, chain length (14 carbon atoms) and functional groups (i.e., alcohol and ester) appear to be key features for stable binding. Likewise, residues such as Phe12, Phe36, and Phe118 could participate in unspecific binding processes, whilst Ser9, Ser56, and Trp114 could participate in the specific recognition and stabilization of sex pheromones instead of host plant volatiles. Moreover, our SMD approach supported 11-dodecenyl acetate as the best ligand for LbotPBP1. Overall, the dynamics simulations, contact frequency analysis and SMD shed light on the binding mechanism of LbotPBP1 and could overcome the imprecision of molecular docking, supporting the in vitro binding assays. Finally, the role of LbotPBP1 in the chemical ecology of L. botrana is discussed.",Phage therapy: Current status and perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062882,Medicinal research reviews,2019 05 07,"The spread of antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens combined with the lack of new drug classes in the antibiotic pipeline causes a resurgence of the use of bacterial viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy [PT]).

Their bottom-up synthesis from glucose is promising for bulk production, but to ensure a completely water-soluble product via degree of polymerization (DP) control (DP ≤ 6) is challenging. Here, we show biocatalytic production of cellodextrins with DP centered at 3 to 6 (~96 wt.% of total product) using coupled cellobiose and cellodextrin phosphorylase. The cascade reaction, wherein glucose was elongated sequentially from α-d-glucose 1-phosphate (αGlc1-P), required optimization and control at two main points. First, kinetic and thermodynamic restrictions upon αGlc1-P utilization (200 mM; 45°C, pH 7.0) were effectively overcome (53% → ≥90% conversion after 10 hrs of reaction) by in situ removal of the phosphate released via precipitation with Mg2+ . Second, the product DP was controlled by the molar ratio of glucose/αGlc1-P (∼0.25; 50 mM glucose) used in the reaction. In optimized conversion, soluble cellodextrins in a total product concentration of 36 g/L were obtained through efficient utilization of the substrates used (glucose: 98%; αGlc1-P: ∼80%) after 1 hr of reaction. We also showed that, by keeping the glucose concentration low (i.e., 1-10 mM; 200 mM αGlc1-P), the reaction was shifted completely towards insoluble product formation (DP ∼9-10). In summary, this study provides the basis for an efficient and product DP-controlled biocatalytic synthesis of cellodextrins from expedient substrates.",CFD and kinetic-based modeling to optimize the sparger design of a large-scale photobioreactor for scaling up of biofuel production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062867,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 05 22,"Microalgal biofuels have not yet achieved wide-spread commercialization, partially as a result of the complexities involved with designing and scaling up of their biosystems. The sparger design of a pilot-scale photobioreactor (120 L) was optimized to enable the scale-up of biofuel production. An integrated model coupling computational fluid dynamics and microalgal biofuel synthesis kinetics was used to simulate the biomass growth and novel biofuel production (i.e., bisabolene) in the photobioreactor. Bisabolene production from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant was used as an example to test the proposed model. To select the optimal sparger configuration, a rigorous procedure was followed by examining the effects of sparger design parameters (number and diameter of sparger holes and gas flow rates) on spatially averaged bubble volume fraction, light intensity, friction velocity, power input, biomass concentration, and bisabolene production. The optimized sparger design increases the final biomass concentration by 18%, thereby facilitating the scaling up of biofuel production.",The clinical significance of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in ischemic stroke patients with acute kidney injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062866,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,2019 05 07,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become a common complication of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and may have a significant impact on the clinical outcomes.

Here, we performed an intact glycopeptide analysis method to simultaneously analyze the site-specific N- and O-glycan profiles of the recombinant erythropoietin Fc (EPO-Fc) protein secreted from a Chinese hamster ovary glutamine synthetase stable cell line and compared the effects of two commercial culture media, EX-CELL (EX) and immediate advantage (IA) media, on the glycosylation profile of the target protein. EPO-Fc, containing the Fc region of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) fused to EPO, was harvested at Day 5 and 8 of a batch cell culture process followed by purification and N- and O-glycopeptide profiling. A mixed anion exchange chromatographic column was implemented to capture and enrich N-linked glycopeptides. Using intact glycopeptide characterization, the EPO-Fc was observed to maintain their individual EPO and Fc N-glycan characteristics in which the EPO region presented bi-, tri-, and tetra-branched N-glycan structures, while the Fc N-glycan displayed mostly biantennary glycans. EPO-Fc protein generated in EX medium produced more complex tetra-antennary N-glycans at each of the three EPO N-sites while IA medium resulted in a greater fraction of bi- and tri-antennary N-glycans at these same sites. Interestingly, the sialylation content decreased from sites 1-4 in both media while the fucosylation progressively increased with a maximum at the final IgG Fc site. Moreover, we observed that low amounts of Neu5Gc were detected and the content increased at the later sampling time in both EX and IA media. For O-glycopeptides, both media produced predominantly three structures, N1F1F0SOG0, N1H1F0S1G0, and N1H1F0S2G0, with lesser amounts of other structures. This intact glycopeptide method can decipher site-specific glycosylation profile and provide a more detailed characterization of N- and O-glycans present for enhanced understanding of the key product quality attributes such as media on recombinant proteins of biotechnology interest.","Prognostic value of mutant p53, Ki-67, and TTF-1 and their correlation with EGFR mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062864,Histology and histopathology,2019 05 13,"The clinical characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation have been well studied.

However, it is impossible to gauge the extent of their use with current post-mortem toxicological screening, where GBP and PGL are only screened for if they are mentioned in the case documents. This study determines the prevalence of GBP and PGL, the potential extent of their under-reporting and poly-drug use in a post-mortem population. Between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017, 3,750 deceased from Coroners' cases in London and South East England underwent a routine drugs screen and a specific screen for GBP and PGL. The prevalence of both drugs was determined in the cohort and the subcategories of heroin users and non-heroin-users. The prevalence of both drugs was compared to tramadol (Class C drug). Case documents were reviewed to investigate the under-reporting of GBP and PGL and poly-drug use. Of 3,750 samples analyzed, 118 (3.1%) were positive for GBP, 229 (6.1%) for PGL and 120 (3.2%) were positive for tramadol. If routine analysis without additional screening of GBP and PGL had been performed in this cohort, GBP would have been under-reported by 57.6% (P < 0.0001) and PGL by 53.7% (P < 0.0001) in deaths. The most common drug group observed with GBP and PGL was non-heroin-related opioids at 60.2% and 64.6%, respectively. In total 354 deceased (9.4%) were heroin users. GBP was positive in 23 (6.5%) of these cases and PGL was positive in 69 (19.5%). The prevalence of PGL in heroin users (19.5%) was 4.1 times greater than in non-heroin users (4.7%) (P < 0.0001).

Yet, many bioinformatics tools for such analyses have focused on specific clades, with greatest attention paid to plants, animals and fungi. The rapid increase of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data from diverse lineages now provides opportunities to estimate evolutionary relationships and gene family evolution across the eukaryotic tree of life. At the same time, these types of data are known to be error-prone (e.g. substitutions, contamination). To address these opportunities and challenges, we have refined a phylogenomic pipeline, now named PhyloToL, to allow easy incorporation of data from HTS studies, to automate production of both MSAs and gene trees, and to identify and remove contaminants. PhyloToL is designed for phylogenomic analyses of diverse lineages across the tree of life (i.e. at scales of > 100 million years). We demonstrate the power of PhyloToL by assessing stop codon usage in Ciliophora, identifying contamination in a taxon- and gene-rich database and exploring the evolutionary history of chromosomes in the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Benchmarking PhyloToL's homology assessment against that of OrthoMCL and a published paper on superfamilies of bacterial and eukaryotic organelle outer membrane pore-forming proteins demonstrates the power of our approach for determining gene family membership and inferring gene trees. PhyloToL is highly flexible and allows users to easily explore HTS data, test hypotheses about phylogeny and gene family evolution and combine outputs with third-party tools (e.g. PhyloChromoMap, iGTP).",Imaging the injured beating heart intravitally and the vasculoprotection afforded by haematopoietic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062860,Cardiovascular research,2019 05 07,"Adequate microcirculatory perfusion, and not just opening of occluded arteries, is critical to salvage heart tissue following myocardial infarction (MI).

These weeds can potentially evolve and adapt through gene flow from both domesticated crop varieties and reproductively-compatible wild relatives. We studied populations of weedy rice in Thailand to investigate the role of introgression from cultivated and wild rice in their evolution. We examined two complementary sources of genetic data: allelic variation at three rice domestication genes (Bh4, controlling hull color; Rc, controlling pericarp color and seed dormancy; and sh4, controlling seed shattering), and 12 previously-published SSR markers. Sampling spanned three major rice growing regions in Thailand (Lower North, North East, and Central Plain) and included 124 cultivated rice accessions, 166 weedy rice accessions, and 98 wild rice accessions. Weedy rice strains were overall closely related to the cultivated varieties with which they co-occur. Domestication gene data revealed potential adaptive introgression of sh4 shattering alleles from wild rice. Introgression of potentially maladaptive rc crop alleles (conferring reduced dormancy) was also detected, with the frequency of the crop allele highest in northern populations. Although SSR markers also indicated introgression into weed populations from wild and cultivated rice, there was little overlap with domestication genes in the accessions showing admixed ancestry. This suggests that much of the introgression we detected at domestication genes most likely reflects past introgression rather than recent gene flow.

Many previous studies have reported synaptic connections of heterogeneous interneurons in superficial OB layers. In contrast, few studies have examined synaptic connections in deep layers because of the lack of a selective marker for intrinsic neurons located in the deeper layers, including the mitral cell layer, internal plexiform layer (IPL) and granule cell layer. However, neural circuits in the deep layers are likely to have a strong effect on the output of the OB because of the cellular composition of these regions. Here, we analyzed the calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the IPL, one of the clearly neurochemically defined interneuron types in the deep layers, using multiple immunolabeling and confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with electron microscopic three-dimensional serial-section reconstruction, enabling correlated laser and volume electron microscopy (EM). Despite a resemblance to the morphological features of deep short axon cells, IPL calbindin-immunoreactive (IPL-CB-ir) neurons lacked axons. Furthermore, multiple immunolabeling for plural neurochemicals indicated that IPL-CB-ir neurons differed from any interneuron types reported previously. We identified symmetrical synapses formed by IPL-CB-ir neurons on granule cells (GCs) using correlated laser and volume EM. These synapses might inhibit GCs and thus disinhibit mitral and tufted cells. Our present findings indicate, for the first time, that IPL-CB-ir neurons are involved in regulating the activities of projection neurons, further suggesting their involvement in synaptic circuitry for output from the deeper layers of the OB, which has not previously been clarified.",The Role of Sex and Age on Pre-drinking: An Exploratory International Comparison of 27 Countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062843,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",2019 05 07,"This exploratory study aims to model the impact of sex and age on the percentage of pre-drinking in 27 countries, presenting a single model of pre-drinking behaviour for all countries and then comparing the role of sex and age on pre-drinking behaviour between countries.","Effects of oral neuromuscular training on swallowing dysfunction among older people in intermediate care-a cluster randomised, controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062842,Age and ageing,2019 05 07,"this prospective, cluster randomised, controlled trial investigated the effect of oral neuromuscular training among older people in intermediate care with impaired swallowing.","Racial Discrimination, Disease Activity, and Organ Damage: The Black Women's Experiences Living with Lupus (BeWELL) Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062841,American journal of epidemiology,2019 05 07,"African American women are disproportionately impacted by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic, potentially debilitating autoimmune disease; and also experience more rapid progression and worse outcomes compared to other groups. This study examined if racial discrimination is associated with disease outcomes among 427 African American women with a validated diagnosis of SLE in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, recruited to the Black Women's Experiences Living with Lupus (BeWELL) Study (2015-2017). Frequency of self-reported experiences of racial discrimination in domains such as employment, housing, and medical settings was assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination measure. SLE activity in the previous three months, including symptoms of fatigue, fever, skin rashes, and ulcers, was measured using the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; irreversible damage to an organ or system was measured using the Brief Index of Lupus Damage (BILD). Multivariable linear regression analyses examining the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire and log-transformed BILD scores indicated that increasing frequency of racial discrimination was associated with greater SLE activity (b=2.00, 95% CI=1.32, 2.68) as well as organ damage (b=0.08, 95% CI=0.02, 0.13).

It thus opens a promising new avenue for safety studies. The method has been successfully used to evaluate the safety of two vaccines for adolescents and young adults, but its suitability to study vaccines for older adults had not been established. The current study applied the method to assess the safety of live attenuated herpes zoster vaccination during 2011-2017 in U.S. adults ≥ 60 years old, using claims data from Truven Health MarketScan® Research Databases. Counts of International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes recorded in emergency department or hospital settings were scanned for any statistically unusual clustering within a hierarchical tree structure of diagnoses and within 42 days after vaccination. Among 1.24 million vaccinations, four clusters were found: cellulitis on Days 1-3, non-specific erythematous condition on Days 2-4, ""other complications…"" on Days 1-3, and non-specific allergy on Days 1-6. These results are consistent with local injection-site reactions and other known, generally mild vaccine-associated adverse events and a favorable safety profile.

Evidence-based intervention strategies are needed to effectively reduce malaria transmission. Zambia's National Malaria Control Centre conducted targeted indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Nchelenge District, Luapula Province from 2014-2016 using the organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos-methyl. An evaluation of the IRS campaign was conducted by the Southern Africa International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research using actively detected malaria cases in bimonthly household surveys from April 2012 to July 2017. Changes in parasite prevalence before vs. after IRS were assessed by season using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors, controlling for clustering of participants in households and demographic, geographic, and climatological covariates. In targeted areas, parasite prevalence declined approximately 25% during the rainy season following IRS with pirimiphos-methyl but did not decline during the dry season or in the overall study area. Within targeted areas, parasite prevalence declined in unsprayed households, suggesting both direct and indirect effects of IRS. The moderate decrease in parasite prevalence within sprayed areas indicates that IRS with pirimiphos-methyl is an effective malaria control measure, but a more comprehensive package of interventions is needed to effectively reduce the malaria burden in this setting."

Nanotubes were formed under almost all combinations of the investigated factors, and for the first time the formation of nanotubes at low pH (4.0) and low protein concentration (10 g l-1) was observed. Only one sample (10 g l-1, calcium ratio 2.4, and pH 7.5) formed mainly fibrils instead of nanotubes. By altering the three investigated factors, fibrils and/or aggregates were sometimes formed together with nanotubes resulting in transparent, semi-transparent, or non-transparent gels, or sediments. However, structural modelling based on small-angle X-ray scattering data indicated that the formed nanotubes were only to a minor degree affected by the investigated factors. The majority of the nanotubes were found to have an outer diameter of around 19 nm, an inner diameter of 6.6 nm and a wall thickness of 6.0 nm, except for three samples at low α-La concentrations and high calcium levels which exhibited slightly smaller dimensions. These three factors affected the hydrolysis as well as the self-assembly rate, resulting in the observed differences. However, these factors did not influence the architecture of the self-assembled nanotubes, and the lateral spacing of the individual parallel β-sheet motifs was found to be 1.05 ± 0. 03 nm for all nanotubes. This study provides novel fundamental knowledge of the formation and structure of α-La nanotubes under different conditions, which will facilitate future application of these nanotubes in food and pharmaceutical areas.",On solvated tin(iv) ions and the coordination chemistry of high-valent d10 metal ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062807,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 07,"A very slow oxidation of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) solvated tin(ii) ions in solution results in the formation of a crystalline, structurally determined compound, [CH3Sn(OS(CH3)2)5](ClO4)3, whereas a similar reaction in N,N-dimethylthioformamide (dmtf) forms a crystalline solid with a proposed binuclear [Sn2(SH)2(SCHN(CH3)2)8]6+ entity but whose exact formula remains undetermined.

It allows for wide-range infrared vibrational spectroscopy of molecular ions. In this study, the apparatus is used for infrared vibrational predissociation (IR-PD) measurements of the simple alcohol cations of methanol and ethanol as well as their protonated forms. Spectra are taken by tagging the cold molecular ions with He atoms. The infrared spectrum of protonated methanol is recorded for the first time, and the wavelength coverage for all other species is substantially extended. The bands of all spectra are analysed by comparison to ab initio calculation results at different levels of theory. Vibrational bands of different isomers and conformers (rotamers) are discussed and identified in the experimental spectra. Besides the measurement of IR-PD spectra, the method of infrared multiple photon dissociation IR-MPD is applied for some cases. Spectral narrowing due to the cold environment is observed and rotational band contours are simulated. This will help in identifying more complex species using the IR-MPD method in future measurements. Overall the IR-PD spectra reveal more bands than are observed for the IR-MPD spectra. In particular, many new bands are observed in the fingerprint region. Depletion saturation of the finite number of trapped ions is observed for the IR-PD spectra of the ethanol cation and the presence of only one isomeric species is concluded. This special feature of ion trapping spectroscopy may be used in future studies for addressing specific isomers or cleaning the ion cloud from specific isomers or conformers.

We hypothesize that benefits of tea consumption can be partially mediated by modulating intestinal microbiota via inhibiting the formation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and promoting the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat diet with the addition of 1% water extracts of green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Results showed that the dietary supplementation of three tea water extracts equally improved the glucose tolerance and reduced a high fat diet-induced gain in weight, hepatic lipids, and white adipose tissue weights. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in plasma LPS and a significant increase in the production of SCFAs. The metagenomic analyses showed that the tea extracts changed the overall composition of gut microbiota and decreased the relative abundance of family Rikenellaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. In addition, tea water extracts could also change the abundance of key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) including OTU473 (Alistipes), OTU229 (Rikenella), OTU179 (Ruminiclostridium) and OTU264 (Acetatifactor). In conclusion, three tea extracts could improve the glucose tolerance, induce the production of SCFAs and inhibit the production of endotoxin LPS, most likely mediated by modulating gut microbiota.",SERS-based rapid assay for sensitive detection of Group A Streptococcus by evaluation of the swab sampling technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062777,The Analyst,2019 05 28,"Beta-hemolytic, Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a life-threating pathogen and the reason for prominent disease, pharyngitis.

We fabricated eggshell microparticle (ESP) reinforced gelatin-based hydrogels to obtain mechanically stable and biologically active three-dimensional (3D) constructs that can differentiate pre-mature cells into osteoblasts. Physical properties including swelling ratio, degradation, and mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels were investigated. Pre-osteoblasts were encapsulated within the ESP-reinforced hydrogels to study their differentiation and evaluate mineral deposition by these cells. The ESP-reinforced gels were then subcutaneously implanted in a rat model to determine their biocompatibility and degradation behaviors. The composite hydrogels have shown outstanding tunability in physical and biological properties holding substantial promise for engineering mineralized tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, tooth, and tendon). These 3D scaffolds enabled the differentiation of pre-osteoblasts without the use of specialized osteogenic growth medium. The ESP-reinforced gels exhibited significant enhancement in mineralization by pre-osteoblasts. These behaviors are positively correlated with increasing concentrations of ESP. Findings suggest that our novel composite hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical properties and indicates a favorable in vivo response by subcutaneous implantation in a rat model.","Near-atomically flat, chemically homogeneous, electrically conductive optical metasurface.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062774,Nanoscale,2019 05 17,"Metasurfaces, or two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength-scale structures, can exhibit extraordinary optical properties.

Exploiting the large difference between the Thomas-Fermi screening length for longitudinal electric fields and the skin depth for transverse electromagnetic fields, the near-atomically flat top surface of the proposed structure can appear homogeneous chemically and electrically but highly inhomogenous optically.

The structure of 2 was characterized in acetonitrile-d3 by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and a DOSY experiment. The trimeric nature of supramolecular coordination complex 2 in solution was ascertained by cold spray ionization mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) and confirmed in the solid state by X-ray structure analysis. The asymmetric unit of 2 comprises the trimetallic Pd complex, six PF6- counter-ions and seven acetonitrile solvent molecules. Moreover, there is one cavity within the unit cell which could contain diethyl ether solvent molecules, as suggested by the crystallization process. The packing is stabilized by weak inter- and intramolecular C-H...N and C-H...F interactions. Interestingly, the crystal structure displays two distinct conformations for the LH ligand (i.e. syn and anti), with an all-syn-[Pd] coordination mode. This result is in contrast to the solution behaviour, where multiple structures with syn/anti-LH and syn/anti-[Pd] are a priori possible and expected to be in rapid equilibrium.","The rich crystal chemistry of the AMM'(PO4)2 morphotropic series: NaZnAl(PO4)2, the first Na representative with a new structure type.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062707,"Acta crystallographica.

Each Cd atom is in a slightly distorted trans-N2O4 octahedral environment, forming a two-dimensional layer structure with a (3,6)-connected topology. Layers are linked to each other by π-π stacking, resulting in a three-dimensional supramolecular framework. The strong luminescence and good thermal stability of (I) indicate that it can potentially be used as a luminescence sensor.

This study aimed to establish the Ca requirements of egg-type duck breeders from 23 to 57 weeks of age on egg production, eggshell, incubation, tibial, plasma and ovary-related indices, as well as the expression of matrix protein-related genes. Totally, 450 Longyan duck breeders aged 21 weeks of age were allotted randomly into five treatments, each with six replicates of 15 individually caged birds. The data collection started from 23 weeks of age and continued over the following 35 weeks. The five groups corresponded to five dietary treatments containing either 2.8%, 3.2%, 3.6%, 4.0% or 4.4% Ca. The tested dietary Ca levels increased (linear, P &lt;0.01) egg production and egg mass, and linearly improved (P &lt;0.01) the feed conversion ratio (FCR). Increasing the dietary Ca levels from 2.8% to 4.4% increased (P &lt;0.01) the eggshell thickness and eggshell content. The tested Ca levels showed a quadratic effect on eggshell thickness and ovarian weight (P &lt;0.01); the highest values were obtained with the Ca levels 4.0% and 3.6%, respectively. Dietary Ca levels affected the small yellow follicles (SYF) number and SYF weight/ovarian weight, and the linear response (P &lt;0.01) was significant vis-à-vis SYF number. In addition, dietary Ca levels increased (P &lt;0.05) the tibial dry weight, breaking strength, mineral density and ash content. Plasma and tibial phosphorus concentration exhibited a quadratic (P &lt;0.01) response to dietary Ca levels. Plasma calcitonin concentration linearly (P &lt;0.01) increased as dietary Ca levels increased. The relative expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 in the uterus rose (P &lt;0.01) with the increment of dietary Ca levels, and the highest value was obtained with 3.2% Ca. In conclusion, Longyan duck breeders fed a diet with 4.0% Ca had superior eggshell and tibial quality, while those fed a diet with 3.6% Ca had the heaviest ovarian weights. The regression model indicated that the dietary Ca levels 3.86%, 3.48% and 4.00% are optimal levels to obtain maximum eggshell thickness, ovarian weight and tibial mineral density, respectively.",Invited review: Application of meta-omics to understand the dynamic nature of the rumen microbiome and how it responds to diet in ruminants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062682,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"Ruminants are unique among livestock due to their ability to efficiently convert plant cell wall carbohydrates into meat and milk. This ability is a result of the evolution of an essential symbiotic association with a complex microbial community in the rumen that includes vast numbers of bacteria, methanogenic archaea, anaerobic fungi and protozoa. These microbes produce a diverse array of enzymes that convert ingested feedstuffs into volatile fatty acids and microbial protein which are used by the animal for growth. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses have helped to reveal how the composition of the rumen microbiome varies significantly during the development of the ruminant host, and with changes in diet. These sequencing efforts are also beginning to explain how shifts in the microbiome affect feed efficiency. In this review, we provide an overview of how meta-omics technologies have been applied to understanding the rumen microbiome, and the impact that diet has on the rumen microbial community.",Transfer of passive immunity in dairy calves: the effectiveness of providing a supplementary colostrum meal in addition to nursing from the dam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062681,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"Failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) in dairy calves - which is often due to the low amount of colostrum provided within a few hours after birth - remains a crucial issue. Enabling dairy calves to nurse colostrum from their dams could be useful in increasing intake and thus avoiding FTPI, but further potential effects on the health and welfare of both calves and dams should also be considered. In this study, 107 calf-dam pairs from two Italian dairy farms were alternately assigned to one of the following colostrum provision methods (CPMs): 'hand-fed method' (HFM) - the calf was separated from the dam immediately after birth and colostrum was provided by nipple-bottle (n = 50); 'nursing method' (NM) - the calf nursed colostrum from the dam for the first 12 h of life without farmer assistance (n = 30); and 'mixed method' (MM) - the nursing calf received a supplementary colostrum meal by nipple-bottle (n = 27). Serum of calves (1 to 5 days of age) and samples of their first colostrum meal were analysed by electrophoresis to assess immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration. Additionally, behavioural indicators of separation distress (calf and dam vocalisations; calf refusal of the first meal after separation; undesirable dam behaviour at milking) in the following 24 h were recorded as binary variables (Yes/No), and the health status of calves (disease occurrence and mortality) and dams (postpartum disorders and mastitis occurrence) were monitored for the first 3 months of life and 7 days after parturition, respectively. The lowest FTPI occurrence (calf serum Ig concentration 0.05). The results of this study indicated that providing calves with a supplementary colostrum meal in addition to nursing from the dam (MM) is truly effective in maximizing passive immunity transfer. Anyway, specific strategies should be studied to minimise calf-dam separation distress.",An investigation into the effectiveness of compressed straw blocks in reducing abnormal behaviour in growing pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062680,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"The provision of manipulable material to pigs is a legal requirement to ensure their good welfare. Loose straw is edible, chewable, investigable and manipulable, and has been proven to be effective in reducing abnormal behaviour. However, it is incompatible with slatted systems and therefore not a viable option for many intensive units. Thus, there is a need to identify enrichment materials that are as effective as loose straw and compatible with slatted floors. This study investigated the viability of using compressed straw blocks on a commercial farm in terms of cost and effectiveness in reducing biting relative to plastic hanging toys. A total of 880 slaughter pigs were used, among which half (n = 440, 8 groups) were provided with commercial pig toys (TOY) and the other half (n = 440, 8 groups) were provided compressed straw blocks (STRAW BLOCK). Animals were separated according to sex to investigate whether there was a higher propensity to tail and ear bite depending on sex. Pigs were monitored from weaning to slaughter, with tails being examined post scalding and any condemnations recorded at the abattoir. Throughout their life, the tails and ears of all pigs were examined individually, and behavioural observations of each pig group were conducted fortnightly. Salivary cortisol was also obtained from a subsample of pigs from each group every fortnight to monitor stress levels. The highest straw usage was recorded in the second weaner stage (39 to 67 days after weaning). Enrichment type or sex had no effect on tail lesion scores or cold carcass weight recorded at the abattoir. There was also no effect of enrichment type or sex on body, tail, or ear lesion scores during either the weaner (0 to 39 days after weaning) or finisher stage (67 to145 days after weaning). Female pigs showed more biting behaviour than males, and female pigs that were provided STRAW BLOCK performed better than those provided TOY. In both the weaner and finisher accommodation, more instances of interaction were recorded with TOY pens as enrichment than with STRAW BLOCK, but the interaction duration was not recorded. There was no effect of sex on either stage. More instances of aggression were observed with the TOY than with STRAW BLOCK in the weaner stage (P &lt; 0.05). Enrichment type or sex had no effect on cortisol levels. Thus, relative to plastic hanging toys, compressed straw blocks provided in this manner did not benefit pig welfare.",Reliability of visible reflectance spectroscopy in discriminating between pasture and stall-fed lambs from thin and fat-tailed sheep breeds in dry and hot environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062679,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"Considering the additional market value of pasture meat, many authentication methods were developed to discriminate it from meat produced in conventional systems. The visible reflectance spectroscopy technique has proved its efficiency under European conditions and breeds. The present study tested the reliability of this method to discriminate between pasture-fed (P) and stall-fed (S) lambs under North African conditions and investigated the effect of feeding system (FS) (P v. S) and breed (Barbarine; Queue Fine de l'Ouest; and Noire de Thibar) on weight and colour of perirenal, subcutaneous and caudal fat. A total of 18 P and 18 S lambs were used with 6 P and 6 S lambs for each breed. The colour and the reflectance spectrum of different fat tissues were measured. The FS affected weights of all fat tissues and all colour parameters of perirenal and subcutaneous fat (P ≤ 0.01); it almost affected redness and yellowness of caudal fat (P ≤ 0.05; P ≤ 0.01). In all adipose tissues, lightness was higher and both redness and yellowness were lower for S lambs than P lambs. The breed affected weight, lightness and redness of perirenal fat and weight and redness of subcutaneous fat with significant interaction with FS for subcutaneous fat data. To discriminate P lambs from S lambs, the reflectance spectrum of perirenal, subcutaneous and caudal fat at wavelengths between 450 and 510 nm (Method 1, M1) or at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm using partial least squares discriminative analysis as a classification method (Method 2, M2) were used. M2 yielded to a higher proportion of correctly classified lambs compared with M1 (P = 0.001). The proportion of correctly classified lambs using M2 was 76.4, 75.0 and 80.0% for perirenal, subcutaneous and caudal fat for P lambs and 83.3, 76.4 and 100.0% for S lambs. Despite lower reliability in comparisons to European researches, this study confirmed the efficiency of visible reflectance spectroscopy technique applied on perirenal fat in feeding systems authentication under North African conditions and spotted the caudal fat as a new support for better classification of fat-tailed breeds.",Weeping forsythia extract alleviates dexamethasone-induced oxidative injury of breast muscles in broilers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062678,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"Antioxidants have been always used to improve post-slaughter meat quality in broilers subjected to stress. Forsythia suspensa extract (FSE), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is generally regarded as a natural source of antioxidants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that FSE could protect post-slaughter breast muscles against oxidative injury induced by dexamethasone (DEX) mimicking chronic physiological stress in poultry production. Average daily gain and feed efficiency of poultry were suppressed by DEX and improved by FSE (P &lt; 0.05). Dexamethasone caused the decrease in the redness value and the increase in the lightness and yellowness values and drip loss of the breast muscles (P &lt; 0.05), and FSE had the converse effects (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary FSE supplementation decreased monounsaturated fatty acid (FA) and increased polyunsaturated FA in breast muscles of broilers (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, FSE decreased malondialdehyde and carbonyl content in the breast muscles of DEX-treated broilers (P &lt; 0.05). The inhibition of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl in the breast muscles was decreased by DEX and increased by FSE (P &lt; 0.05). Total-antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity in the breast muscles were decreased in birds subjected to DEX and increased in birds supplemented with FSE (P &lt; 0.05). Totally, DEX suppressed growth performance and induced breast muscle oxidative injury in broilers, and FSE supplementation improved antioxidant capacity to attenuate these adverse effects. Therefore, FSE could be a potential natural antioxidant to alleviate oxidative injury of the breast muscles in broilers and to improve the meat quality for human consumption.",One-year all-cause mortality for 338 patients admitted with epistaxis in a large tertiary ENT centre.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062677,The Journal of laryngology and otology,2019 05 07,Epistaxis is the most common ENT emergency.

We investigated the effects of replacing AH with CS in the starter diet on nutrient intake, digestibility, growth performance, rumen fermentation and selected blood metabolites in Holstein calves. Newborn male calves (n = 30; 3 days of age; 40.2 ± 1.28 kg BW) were assigned randomly to three groups receiving starter diets containing chopped AH (10% dry matter (DM) basis; AH diet), CS (10% DM, CS diet) or their combination (each at 5% level; AHCS diet). The starter diets had the same nutrient composition but differed in DM content (91.2%, 87.5% and 83.8% for AH, AHCS and CS, respectively). The calves were weaned on day 50, and the study continued until day 70. Nutrient intake, BW (at weaning and at the end of the study) and body measurements were not affected by the diet. During the post-weaning period, average daily gain tended to be greater on CS than on AH diet. Feed efficiency was greater in CS than in AH or AHCS calves during the post-weaning period. Digestibility of neutral detergent fiber was greater in AHCS and CS compared with AH during the post-weaning period. Concentration and profile of volatile fatty acids and ruminal fluid pH were not affected by the diet. Replacing AH with CS in the starter diet had no effect on feed intake, growth performance and general health of the calves. These results indicate that AH and CS can be used interchangeably in dairy calf starter diets until 70 days of age, allowing dairy producers more choices in selecting the feed ingredients.","Black soldier fly defatted meal as a dietary protein source for broiler chickens: effects on carcass traits, breast meat quality and safety.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062675,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"Finding insect meals as alternative sources of poultry feedstuffs is a recent research topic; therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of defatted black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L., HI) larvae meal in broiler chicken diets on the carcass characteristics and meat quality parameters, proximate composition, fatty acid profile and the heavy metal content of the breast meat. Four dietary treatments were designed: a control diet (HI0) and three experimental diets (HI5, HI10 and HI15), corresponding to 50, 100 and 150 g/kg HI inclusion levels, respectively. The inclusion of 50, 100 and 150 g HI meal per kg feed supply 16.56%, 33.01% and 49.63% of required crude protein. The broilers were slaughtered at day 35, the carcasses were weighed and the breast muscles were excised from 16 birds per each feeding group (two birds per replicate pens) and used for meat quality evaluation. Linear and quadratic responses were observed, for increasing HI meal levels, in the live and carcass weights (maximum for HI10). As far as the colour of the breast meat is concerned, redness (a*) showed a linear response, while yellowness (b*) linearly decreased with increasing HI meal levels (minimum for HI15). As the HI larvae meal increased in the diets, the moisture content linearly decreased and the protein content increased. The total saturated fatty acid and total monounsaturated fatty acid proportions rose to the detriment of the polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction. The HI larvae meal, used in the current study, represents a valuable protein source for broiler chickens when included by up to 100 g/kg in their diets, as an improved slaughtering performance was observed without any detrimental effects on meat quality parameters or heavy metal residues in the meat.",Effects of lysine deficiency on carcass composition and activity and gene expression of lipogenic enzymes in muscles and backfat adipose tissue of fatty and lean piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062674,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 05 07,"The purpose of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms involved in fat deposition promoted by dietary lysine deficiency, particularly intramuscular fat (IMF), and differential responses between fatty and lean pigs. Carcass traits and lipogenic enzyme activities and gene expression levels in muscles and adipose tissue were investigated in Iberian (fatty) and Landrace × Large White (LDW) pigs under identical feeding level (based on body weight (BW)) and management conditions. Twenty-eight barrows of 10 kg initial BW, 14 per breed, were fed two isoproteic (200 g CP /kg DM) and isocaloric (14.7 MJ metabolizable energy/kg DM) diets with identical composition except for the lysine content (1.09% for diet adequate in lysine and 0.52% for diet deficient in lysine). At a BW of 25 kg, pigs were slaughtered. Compared with pigs fed the lysine-adequate diet, in both genotypes lysine-deficient diet led to lower carcass protein concentration, lower relative proportions of leaner components (loin, ham and shoulder; P &lt; 0.01), and higher carcass fatty components and carcass lipid concentration (P &lt; 0.001). Irrespective of diet, the activity and gene expression of lipogenic enzymes (fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)) were greater in Iberian than in LDW pigs, particularly in adipose tissue where transcriptional regulators involved in the control of adipogenesis and lipogenesis were also upregulated in Iberian animals. In backfat tissue, there was a small decrease induced by or no effects of lysine-deficient diet on the activity and gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, nor in gene expression levels of upstream regulators of lipogenesis and adipogenesis. In longissimus muscle, the activity of FAS, G6PDH and ME increased with lysine deficiency in both genotypes (P &lt; 0.01) and an upregulation of gene expression of lipogenic enzymes was specifically observed in Iberian pigs (P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.001). In biceps femoris muscle of lysine-deficient pigs, the activity of FAS and ME enzymes increased, ME1 gene was upregulated (added to FASN gene in the case of Iberian pigs; P &lt; 0.01 to P &lt; 0.001) and PPARA gene was downregulated (P &lt; 0.05). The results show that in both fatty and lean pigs, the effect of lysine deficiency on lipid metabolism was tissue-specific, with an activation of lipogenesis in longissimus and biceps femoris muscle but no apparent stimulation in backfat adipose tissue. Suitable feeding protocols including lysine-deficient diets should be designed for each pig type in order to increase intramuscular lipids without penalizing the growth of lean carcass components."

Background:
 Exosomes or small extracellular vesicles secreted from cells are nanovesicles with a diameter of 40-150 nm, which play a number of roles in both physiologic and pathologic processes. In Graves' disease (GD), autoantibodies bind to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) on the surface of thyroid follicular epithelial cells and stimulate thyroid growth and thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. The present study aimed to confirm the existence of TSHR in exosomes secreted from thyroid cells and to define the role of TSHR exosomes in GD. 
Methods:
 Exosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation from the culture medium of the human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line (NTHY-ori 3-1) and thyroid carcinoma cell lines (8305C, 8505C, and FTC-133). TSHR expression in cell lysates and exosomes was evaluated by Western blot analysis. In order to study the function of TSHR exosomes, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing TSHR (HEK/TSHR) were established. Using exosomes isolated from both HEK and HEK/TSHR cells, the binding capacity of the M22 human monoclonal autoantibody to TSHR exosomes and their effect on M22-mediated stimulation of cAMP production in HEK/TSHR cells were evaluated. As a positive control for the functional assay, human recombinant TSHR chimera protein capable of binding to TSH was used. 
Results:
 TSHR was detected in exosomes from cancer cells as well as normal epithelial cells. An in vitro binding assay showed that alkaline phosphatase-labeled M22 bound to TSHR exosomes in a dose-dependent manner. M22 dose-dependently stimulated intracellular cAMP production in HEK/TSHR cells. The addition of exosomes from HEK/TSHR cells but not those from parental HEK cells significantly ameliorated cAMP production stimulated by treatment with M22 in HEK/TSHR cells. A decoy effect similar to TSHR exosomes was observed for human recombinant TSHR chimera. 
Conclusions:
 The results suggest that exosomes expressing TSHR may be secreted from normal and cancerous thyroid cells. In the thyroid gland of patients with GD, TSHR exosomes may exert a decoy effect by sequestering autoantibody, thereby ameliorating autoantibody-mediated activation of thyroid function.",Pathogen disgust sensitivity changes according to the perceived harshness of the environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062661,Cognition & emotion,2019 05 07,"Much research has explored behaviours that are linked with disgust sensitivity. Few studies, however, have been devoted to understanding how fixed or variable disgust sensitivity is. We therefore aimed to examine whether disgust sensitivity can change with the environment by repeatedly testing students whose environment was not changing as well as student cadets undergoing intensive training at an army camp. We found that an increase in the perceived harshness of the environment was associated with a decrease in pathogen disgust sensitivity. Our results support the idea that disgust sensitivity is malleable depending on the environment. More specifically, we propose that in a harsh environment, where survival may be more difficult, pathogen disgust sensitivity may decrease to allow the consumption of available resources.",The long non-coding RNA ANRASSF1 in the regulation of alternative protein-coding transcripts RASSF1A and RASSF1C in human breast cancer cells: implications to epigenetic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062660,Epigenetics,2019 05 27,"Alternative protein-coding transcripts of the RASSF1 gene have been associated with dual functions in human cancer: while RASSF1C isoform has oncogenic properties, RASSF1A is a tumour suppressor frequently silenced by hypermethylation. Recently, the antisense long non-coding RNA RASSF1 (ANRASSF1) was implicated in a locus-specific mechanism for the RASSF1A epigenetic repression mediated by PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2). Here, we evaluated the methylation patterns of the promoter regions of RASSF1A and RASSF1C and the expression levels of these RASSF1 transcripts in breast cancer and breast cancer cell lines. As expected, RASSF1C remained unmethylated and RASSF1A was hypermethylated at high frequencies in 75 primary breast cancers, and also in a panel of three mammary epithelial cells (MEC) and 10 breast cancer cell lines (BCC). Although RASSF1C was expressed in all cell lines, only two of them expressed the transcript RASSF1A. ANRASSF1 expression levels were increased in six BCCs. In vitro induced demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxicytydine (5-Aza-dC) resulted in up-regulation of RASSF1A and an inverse correlation with ANRASSF1 relative abundance in BCCs. However, increased levels of both transcripts were observed in two MECs (184A1 and MCF10A) after treatment with 5-Aza-dC. Overall, these findings indicate that ANRASSF1 is differentially expressed in MECs and BCCs. The lncRNA ANRASSF1 provides new perspectives as a therapeutic target for locus-specific regulation of RASSF1A.",Empoderamiento y búsqueda de atención en salud: un factor ignorado de la mortalidad materna en una comunidad indígena mexicana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062659,Global health promotion,2019 05 07,"Resumen: Objetivo: Indagar la vinculación entre expresiones del empoderamiento (autonomía y poder de decisión) y las prácticas de autocuidado y de búsqueda de atención durante el embarazo y posterior al parto, en relación con la mortalidad materna, en mujeres indígenas del municipio de Santa María Temaxcaltepec, Oaxaca, México. Métodos: se realizaron seis grupos focales: dos con mujeres embarazadas; dos con madres de niños <3 años de edad, y dos con hombres quienes en los últimos tres años fueron padres. Resultados: la hegemonía masculina en el contexto familiar y en las instituciones de salud, dificulta la autonomía y el poder de decisión de las mujeres sobre su salud reproductiva. Esto impacta directamente en la búsqueda de atención durante el embarazo y el parto. Conclusiones: la falta de autonomía y de poder de decisión femenino se relaciona indirectamente, con resultados adversos del embarazo. Estos hallazgos son útiles para orientar el diseño de estrategias que promuevan el empoderamiento de las mujeres y la equidad de género en el contexto de los servicios y programas comunitarios y llamar la atención de tomadores de decisiones hacia la presencia, de factores no-médicos de la muerte materna en comunidades indígenas.",Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in placentas from preterm infants: association with maternal socioeconomic status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062658,Epigenetics,2019 06 10,"This study evaluated the hypothesis that prenatal maternal socioeconomic status (SES) adversity is associated with DNA methylation in the placenta. SES adversity was defined by the presence of, as well as a summative count of, four factors: less than college education, single marital status, food and nutritional service assistance, and public health insurance. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina EPIC array in 426 placentas from a sample of infants born < 28 weeks of gestation from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn cohort. Associations between SES adversity and DNA methylation were assessed with robust linear regressions adjusted for covariates and controlled the false discovery rate at < 10%. We also examined whether such associations were sex specific. Indicators of SES adversity were associated with differential methylation at 33 CpG sites. Of the 33 identified CpG sites, 19 (57.6%) displayed increased methylation, and 14 (42.4%) displayed decreased methylation in association with at least one of the SES adversity factors. Sex differences were observed in DNA methylation associated with summative SES score; in which placentas derived from female pregnancies showed more robust differential CpG methylation than placentas from male pregnancies. Maternal SES adversity was associated with differential methylation of genes with key role in gene transcription and placental function, potentially altering immunity and stress response. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the role of epigenetic differences in mediating the association between maternal socioeconomic status during pregnancy and later life health outcomes in children.",TDP-43 is Required for Mammary Gland Repopulation and Proliferation of Mammary Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062657,Stem cells and development,2019 06 11,"Mammary gland stem cells (MaSCs), assumed to be the original cells of breast cancer, play essential roles in regulating mammary gland homeostasis and development. Previously, we identified a crucial regulatory role of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an RNA-binding protein, in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer. However, the function of TDP-43 in MaSCs is unclear. Based on single-cell data analysis of the mammary gland, TDP-43 showed potential involvement in the regulation of MaSCs. We therefore investigated the effects of TDP-43 on the mammary gland development. Our data both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that TDP-43 was required for the mammary gland repopulation, which suggested the potential role in the regulation of MaSCs. Knockdown of TDP-43 inhibited proliferation of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and mammary morphogenesis. RNA-seq data and other experiments identified that loss of TDP-43 induced the upregulation of genes related to the cell cycle, providing a possible mechanism for TDP-43 in regulating mammary gland repopulation. Thus, our findings indicate a previously unknown role of TDP-43 in MECs.",Molecular simulations of fluconazole-mediated inhibition of sterol biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062656,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 05 16,"Invasive opportunistic fungal infections and antifungal drug resistance prompt the investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of the triazole drugs. The target of triazoles is the product of the ERG11 gene, the cytochrome P450 sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51), which is part of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to reveal the mechanisms of fluconazole inhibitory activities in orthologs of CYP51 present in humans (Hs), and in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), Candida albicans (Ca) and Candida glabrata (Cg). The conformational diversity of the BC loop in the CYP51-Hs and CYP51-Mt structures alter the catalytic site of these enzymes when compared to the fungal CYPs, resulting in greater conformational variability of the inhibitor. Overall interaction energies are consistent with the observed affinities, but are the result of the competitive interactions of the ligand with the protein residues, the HEME group and water molecules. Specifically, protein-fluconazole interactions are more effective in CYP51-Mt due to polar interactions with the Arg96 residue. These interactions are, however, substituted in fungal enzymes by ligand-HEME interactions, which compensate for the loss of the polar bond and result in a more energetically favored binding. Therefore, the development of ligand with increased specificity to fungal enzymes should focus on the strengthening polar ligand-HEME interactions, while larger hydrophobic ligands are probably best suited to target mycobacterial and human enzymes. These differences and other ligand-binding site-specific interactions are presented and can inspire the design of new inhibitors with greater ortholog specificity. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

While these impacts do not always result in overt symptomology or a diagnosed 'concussion,' evidence indicates that cumulative repetitive impacts affect brain pathophysiology. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of prospective, longitudinal trials evaluating repetitive head impact exposure on white matter microstructure in collision and contact sport athletes to inform clinical care and treatment strategies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed to determine studies that met pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2498 abstracts were initially identified, and 20 studies were critically evaluated herein. The majority of studies demonstrated significant longitudinal changes in anisotropy and/or diffusivity metrics that were associated with the quantity and/or the magnitude of head impact exposure, highlighting the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for measuring changes in white matter microstructure. Our review also comments on study methodology and describes how age, sex, sport, and time between sport cessation and DTI measures contribute to divergent findings within the literature. Suggestions for future research are also provided to overcome previous study limitations and maximize our understanding of the role of repetitive head impact exposure on white matter integrity and long-term neurological sequela.",Prospective memory training in young adults enhances trained-task but not transfer-task performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062654,"Memory (Hove, England)",2019 05 07,"Training and transfer effects of prospective memory training have not been assessed in healthy young adults yet. The present study examined the effects of an 8-day prospective memory training programme using the Virtual Week computer game in 18-24-year-old students. Using the performance of an active control group as comparison, the study revealed a significant short-lived beneficial training-induced effect on a nearest-transfer task consisting of a different version of the trained task. No evidence was obtained for transfer effects to other tasks measuring prospective memory (near transfer), or to tasks measuring various executive functions or general intelligence (far transfer). These results were compared to those from a previous study in which an identical training and testing protocol was used in 13-15-year-old adolescents. This study did reveal some evidence of near and far transfer. The results of the two studies combined suggest a greater potential for prospective memory training to induce beneficial transfer effects in young adolescents than in young adults.","Oral vitamin B12 supplement is delivered to the distal gut, altering the corrinoid profile and selectively depleting Bacteroides in C57BL/6 mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062653,Gut microbes,2019 05 07,"Vitamin B12 is a critical nutrient for humans as well as microbes. Due to saturable uptake, high dose oral B12 supplements are largely unabsorbed and reach the distal gut where they are available to interact with the microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine if oral B12 supplementation in mice alters 1) the concentration of B12 and related corrinoids in the distal gut, 2) the fecal microbiome, 3) short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and 4) susceptibility to experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice (up to 24 animals/group) were supplemented with oral 3.94 µg/ml cyanocobalamin (B12), a dose selected to approximate a single 5 mg supplement for a human. Active vitamin B12 (cobalamin), and four B12-analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba, CN-Cbi) were analyzed in cecal and fecal contents using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), in parallel with evaluation of fecal microbiota, cecal SCFA, and susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. At baseline, active B12 was a minor constituent of overall cecal (0.86%) and fecal (0.44%) corrinoid. Oral B12 supplementation increased active B12 at distal sites by >130-fold (cecal B12 increased from 0.08 to 10.60 ng/mg, fecal B12 increased from 0.06 to 7.81 ng/ml) and reduced microbe-derived fecal corrinoid analogues ([ADE]CN-Cba, [2Me-ADE]CN-Cba, [2MeS-ADE]CN-Cba). Oral B12 had no effect on cecal SCFA. Microbial diversity was unaffected by this intervention, however a selective decrease in Bacteroides was observed with B12 treatment. Lastly, no difference in markers of DSS-induced colitis were detected with B12 treatment."

A sequence variation in patatin like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), rs 738409, is strongly associated with the progression of fatty liver disease. The resulting mutant causes a substitution of isoleucine to methionine at position 148.

Both these receptor subtypes are poorly understood in asthma. In this study, we investigated effects of AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, novel AT2 receptor agonist novokinin and AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 in a mouse model of asthma. Methods: Mice were divided into control (CON) and allergen sensitized (SEN) groups. SEN was sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) on days 1 and 6 (30 μg; i.p.), followed by 5% OVA aerosol challenge (days 11-13). Treatments included (a) losartan (SEN + LOS; 20 mg/kg i.p., day 14), (b) novokinin (SEN + NOV; 0.3 mg/kg i.p., day 14), and (c) PD 123319 (SEN + PD; 5 mg/kg i.p., day 14). Experiments for airway responsiveness, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal ring reactivity using isolated organ bath were performed. Results: Airway responsiveness to methacholine (MCh) (48 mg/mL) was significantly higher in SEN (563.71 ± 40% vs. 294.3 ± 123.84 in CON). This response was potentiated in SEN + PD group (757 ± 30%; p < .05 compared to SEN). SEN + LOS (247.61 ± 86.85%) and SEN + NOV (352 ± 11%) had significantly lower response compared to SEN. SEN + LOS (26.22 ± 0.29%) and SEN + NOV (46.20 ± 0.76%) treatment significantly (p < .001) attenuated total cell count and eosinophils compared to SEN group (69.38 ± 1.5%), while SEN + PD (73.04 ± 0.69%) had highest number of eosinophils. Tracheal response to MCh was significantly higher in SEN group compared to controls, and this response was significantly lowered with the losartan and novokinin treatments.

Here, B lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients were divided into groups according to different standards. By course of disease: newly diagnosed (ND), complete remission (CR), consolidation (CONS). By stratification: high risk (HR), standard risk (SR). By minimal residual disease (MRD): MRD positive(MRD+), MRD negative (MRD-). The proportion of plasmacytoid DC(pDC) and myeloid DC(mDC) were compared within these standards. The costimulatory molecule levels of pDC, mDC in ND and CR were measured and the function of peripheral blood monocyte-derived DC(MoDC)s were examined. We found proportions of pDC and mDC in ND were both lower compared to control group and gradually increased after CR. In HR and MRD+, the proportions were also lower compared to SR and MRD- at CR stage, respectively; but there were no difference between these comparisons when newly diagnosed. In ND, both CD80, CD86 levels in pDC, mDC were higher while the levels in activated MoDCs were lower when compared to control and CR group, respectively. The dextran uptake of MoDCs, T cell proliferation promoting ability, IL-12, BAFF, INF-α levels in supernatant and their mRNA relative expression in activated MoDCs in ND were also lower than those in control and CR group.

Despite its strong antitumor activities, α-MMC exerts the undesirable immunotoxicity effects of hypersensitivity or immunosuppression. Since α-MMC is a plant protein, its application in vivo can easily induce hypersensitivity, but its immunosuppressive mechanism is still unclear. Materials and methods: The toxicity of α-MMC to peripheral blood cells and the cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and spleen immune cells were measured in rats. For further confirmation, experiments were performed in vitro with the mononuclear cell line THP-1, B lymphocyte cell line WIL2-S and T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat. Results: High doses of α-MMC (3.0 mg/kg) resulted in weight loss in rats, a decreased percentage of monocytes, and increased percentages of eosinophils and basophils. Both high-dose and low-dose (1.0 mg/kg) α-MMC inhibited cytokine expression in PBMCs and increased cytokine expression in spleen T cells. In in vitro, α-MMC mainly acted on THP-1 cells, with effects including high dose-induced apoptosis and low dose-induced regulation of inhibitory cytokine expression. Conclusions: The action of α-MMC on immune cells mainly affects monocytes, thereby eliciting its immunosuppressive effect. Its mode of action is to guide functional immunosuppressive regulation at low doses and induce apoptosis at high doses. As the monocytes would be recruited into tumor tissues and are polarized into tumor-associated macrophages, the selective cytotoxicity and cytokine release regulation of α-MMC in monocytes may be an important mechanism of its antitumor effects."

The actual study clarified the protective activity of Sal in H2O2-injured human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. HTM cells were disposed with H2O2 to construct an oxidative damage model in vitro. Then, Sal was utilized to administrate HTM cells, and cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-interrelated proteins and ROS production were appraised using CCK-8, flow cytometry, western blot and DCFH-DA staining. MiR-27a inhibitor and its control were transfected into HTM cells, and the influences of miR-27a inhibition in HTM cells stimulated with H2O2 and Sal were detected. PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways were ultimately investigated to uncover the underlying mechanism. We found that H2O2 evoked HTM cells oxidative damage, as evidenced by repressing cell viability, inducing apoptosis, activating cleaved-caspase-3/-9 expression and increasing ROS production. Sal significantly lightened H2O2-evoked oxidative damage in HTM cells. Additionally, miR-27a was up-regulated by Sal, and miR-27a suppression significantly reversed the protective effect of Sal on H2O2-injured HTM cells. Finally, Sal activated PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways through enhancement of miR-27a in H2O2-injured HTM cells.

QRT-PCR results showed that SBF2-AS1 expression was upregulated in AML cells. CCK-8 assay revealed that SBF2-AS1 inhibition decreased AML cells proliferation ability in vitro. Flow cytometry assays showed that SBF2-AS1 inhibition induced AML cells apoptosis and arrested AML cells in G0/G1 phase. Mechanistically, miR-188-5p was identified as a direct target of SBF2-AS1. SBF2-AS1 upregulated the expression level of ZFP91 by sponging miR-188-5p. And the effects of SBF2-AS1 suppression on AML cells progression could be abolished by miR-188-5p inhibitors. Moreover, we found that SBF2-AS1 inhibition reduced tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings elucidated that SBF2-AS1 could act as a miRNA sponge in AML progression, and provided a potential therapeutic strategy for AML treatment.",Development of a Complete En-Bloc Technique with Direct Bladder Neck Incision: A Newly Modified Approach for Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062613,Journal of endourology,2019 06 12,"
Introduction:
 The objectives of this study were to introduce a newly developed approach for holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) called the ""complete en-bloc technique,"" and to compare the clinical outcomes of this approach with those of previously performed procedures. 
Methods:
 This study retrospectively assessed the perioperative findings from 548 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) undergoing HoLEP who were divided into the following groups according to the consecutive changes in surgical techniques: group A (n = 236), the three-lobe technique; group B (n = 137), the conventional en-bloc technique; and group C (n = 175), the complete en-bloc technique with direct bladder neck incision. 
Results:
 There were no significant differences in major clinical characteristics or urinary symptoms among groups A, B, and C. Although there was no significant difference in the resected prostate weight among the three groups, the enucleation time was significantly shorter and total laser energy was significantly lower in group C than in groups A and B. Therefore, the enucleation efficiency, calculated by dividing the resected prostate weight by the enucleation time, was significantly greater in group C than in groups A and B. Furthermore, no significant differences in the postoperative urinary symptoms, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life, maximum flow rate, postvoid residual, and persistent stress urinary incontinence rate, were noted among the three groups, and there were no significant differences in the incidences of major perioperative complications, including the blood transfusion, bladder injury, urethral stricture, and bladder neck sclerosis among the three groups. 
Conclusions:
 These findings suggest that our complete en-bloc technique can improve the clinical outcomes of HoLEP in BPH patients, even in difficult cases, considering its markedly improved enucleation efficiency.",Long non-coding RNA NEAT1 promotes steatosis via enhancement of estrogen receptor alpha-mediated AQP7 expression in HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062612,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 05 07,"Hepatic steatosis is one of the most important features of the pathogenesis for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fat deposition in liver cells can influence hepatic lipogenesis along with other metabolic pathways and further lead to the irreversible liver cirrhosis and injury. However, the underlying mechanism of steatosis remains largely unexplored. Our previous study revealed that AQP7 played an important role in liver steatosis. In this study, we determined that the transcriptional level of AQP7 was up-regulated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) upon 17β-estradiol (E2) and oleic acids treated HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we identified long non-coding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) as a potential hallmark which was down-regulated in ERα silencing HepG2 cells by RNA-Seq. Finally, we validated that the 3' terminal nucleotides of NEAT1 were contributed for the interaction with ERα to facilitate AQP7 transcription to suppress liver steatosis. Overall, our study gave evidence that NEAT1 played an important role in the activation of ERα to regulate AQP7-mediated hepatic steatosis.",Clinical Manifestations and Mechanisms of Autoimmune Disease-Related Multiple Cerebral Infarcts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062611,Cell transplantation,2019 05 07,"It is important to investigate the clinical characteristics and identify the stroke mechanisms of patients with autoimmune disease-related stroke, which are necessary for early etiology diagnosis, accurate treatment and preventive strategies. In this article we retrospectively studied eight cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with autoimmune diseases, and without competing conventional stroke etiologies. The characteristics of stroke (clinical and radiological features), the laboratory tests especially serum D-dimer levels (as a marker of hypercoagulable state), and embolic signals on transcranial Doppler were evaluated for all eight patients. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI), which can help to evaluate vasculitis was performed in four patients. The possible underlying mechanisms of these cases were discussed based on these manifestations. As a result, autoimmune diseases in our study included systemic lupus erythematosus ( n=5), mixed connective tissue disease ( n=1), central nervous system vasculitis ( n=1), and Takayasu arteritis ( n=1). All eight patients presented with acute infarction lesions in ≥2 vascular territories. Most patients presented with numerous small and medium infarction lesions located in the cortical and subcortical areas. Multiple stroke mechanisms were involved in these cases, including hypercoagulability ( n=4), cardiac embolism ( n=1) and vasculitis ( n=3). Embolic signals could be detected on transcranial Doppler in all three stroke mechanisms. In conclusion, our study revealed the characteristics of autoimmune disease-related stroke. For patients with multiple acute cerebral infarcts within non-single arterial territories, autoimmune disease is an important etiology not to be neglected. Multiple stroke mechanisms were involved in these cases.",Adipose tissue-derived ECM hydrogels and their use as 3D culture scaffold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062610,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 05 07,"Adipose tissue has the therapeutic capacity in the form of a fat graft, for example, for treatment of irradiation-induced scars and difficult to heal dermal wounds. For large-scale clinical application, an off-the-shelf product is warranted. In recent years, ECM-derived hydrogels are postulated to harbour therapeutic capacity and might even replicate the beneficial effects of adipose tissue. In normal homeostasis, the natural ECM acts as a deposit of growth factors, that releases them over time. In the healing of lesions, this might promote cell accumulation and proliferation which in turn stimulates angiogenesis and repair. The decellularization of tissue and the generation of hydrogels may leave cytotoxic traces. Therefore, our research assessed the cytotoxic effect of human adipose tissue-derived ECM hydrogels on connective tissue cells i.e. fibroblasts. The results showed no cytotoxicity, meaning the hydrogels caused no cell death. Cell migration and survival were observed when cultured in ECM hydrogels and followed for 7 days. Cell survival in the hydrogel was confirmed with CFDA staining and also cells showed the ability to penetrate and migrate throughout the gel. We conclude that ECM hydrogels are promising to use as innovative therapy for wound healing.",Development of CRISPR-Mediated Systems in the Study of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062609,Human gene therapy methods,2019 05 28,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of X-linked recessive degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin (DMD) gene on the X chromosome. The DMD gene is complex, consisting of 79 exons, and mutations cause changes in the DMD mRNA so that the reading frame is altered, and the muscle-specific isoform of the dystrophin protein is either absent or truncated with variable residual function. The emerging CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing technique is being developed as a potential therapeutic approach to treat DMD because it can permanently replace the mutated dystrophin gene with the normal gene. Prenatal DNA testing can inform whether the female fetus is a carrier of DMD, and the male fetus has inherited a mutation from his mother (50% chance of both).

This study attempted to validate UCA1 possessed modulatory function on cell proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1. Ectopic expression of UCA1 was induced in TPC-1 cells by transfection. CCK-8 assays were employed to value cell viability. Cell apoptosis analysis was conducted through flow cytometry. We found that overexpressed UCA1 strongly promoted cell proliferation. However, the knockdown of UCA1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced obvious cell apoptosis. Besides, cell EMT was promoted by overexpressed UCA1 and was inhibited by the knockdown of UCA1. Further study revealed that miR-15a level in TPC-1 cells was suppressed by overexpressed UCA1. Simultaneous overexpression of UCA1 and miR-15a partly alleviated UCA1-induced growth, identifying that miR-15a was a possible target of UCA1. At last, the Hippo and JNK signal pathways were activated by overexpressed UCA1 but were then weakened by the adding of miR-15a.

The results demonstrate that sMoS2 exhibits greater long-term persistence. Contrarily, ceMoS2 underwent progressive deterioration, in which preferential oxidation of the 1T of a mixture of 1T and 2H phases was observed. The oxidative degradation of ceMoS2 was retarded in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), including Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) and Aldrich humic acid (ALHA), in the dark ambient condition, while the aging process of MoS2 with co-occurring ALHA was accelerated under sunlight exposure. The observed inhibition effect on the deterioration of ceMoS2 by NOM was mainly attributed to slower dissolution kinetics with rapid initial oxidation (i.e., forming Mo-O bonding) or carbon grafting, rather than prevention of the formation of secondary small suspended Mo-containing particles. The compiled results highlight that the environmental fate of MoS2 nanosheets will be regulated by the combined effects of exfoliating agents and environmentally relevant factors including organic macromolecules and sunlight exposure.",Regulating Key Variables and Visualizing Lithium Dendrite Growth: An Operando X-ray Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062595,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 29,"Although Li metal has long been considered to be the ideal anode material for Li rechargeable batteries, our limited understanding of the complex mechanism of Li plating has hindered the widespread deployment of Li metal anodes. Therefore, operando studies are required to unambiguously reveal the complex mechanistic steps involved. In this study, we employed synchrotron-based X-ray imaging methods to visualize the evolution of Li plating/stripping under operando and, more importantly, practical conditions for battery operation, providing detailed insights into morphology evolution during Li plating. The effects of critical battery operating parameters, including concentration of Li salts, current density, ionic strength, and various electrolytes and additives, on Li plating/stripping have been studied. The delicate interplay of these conditions on the resulting Li metal morphology has been characterized for the first time.","Antisulfatase, Osteogenic, and Anticancer Activities of Steroid Sulfatase Inhibitor EO-33 in Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062594,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 13,"Steroid sulfatase (STS) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens from inactive sulfated steroids. After we reported EO-33 as a potent in vitro STS inhibitor without undesirable estrogenic activity and with osteogenic properties, we are now interested in validating EO-33's in vivo potential to inhibit STS, to prevent bone deterioration, and to reduce estrogen-dependent tumor growth. A scale-up synthesis was first elaborated to prepare the multigram quantity of EO-33 needed to perform in vivo studies. EO-33 blocked the uterine weight stimulated by estrone sulfate in ovariectomized mice by 69% and the STS activity in the liver by 81%. It also produced a selective estrogen receptor modulator effect as assessed by measuring the tibia weight and calcium content. Using a human breast cancer (MCF-7 xenograft) model in nude mice, EO-33 blocked 90% of tumor growth induced by estradiol sulfate, and no toxic effect was observed by assessing the body and liver weights.","Visible-Light-Driven, Photoredox-Catalyzed Cascade of ortho-Hydroxycinnamic Esters To Access 3-Fluoroalkylated Coumarins.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062593,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 10,"A general and straightforward protocol for di-/perfluoroalkylation of ortho-hydroxycinnamic esters via a photoredox-catalyzed cascade was developed to access a variety of 3-fluoroalkylated coumarins.

Three lead compounds were selected for evaluation of in vivo efficacy against Plasmodium berghei infection in mice on the basis of their improved blood, plasma, and microsomal stability profiles compared with the parent natural product. One of the lead analogues cured P. berghei-infected mice in the Peters 4 day-suppressive test when administered 25 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally daily for 4 days. The compound was also capable of clearing parasites in established infections at 50 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally daily for 4 days and exhibited moderate activity when administered as four oral doses of 100 mg kg-1.",Gold Nanoparticle-Induced Photocurrent Quenching and Recovery of Polymer Dots: Toward Signal-On Energy-Transfer-Based Photocathodic Bioanalysis of Telomerase Activity in Cell Extracts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062591,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Energy transfer (ET) in photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis is usually generated between noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) and traditional inorganic quantum dots (QDs). Using the innovative polymer dot (Pdot)-involved ET, this work reports the first signal-on and cathodic PEC bioanalysis toward telomerase (TE) activity in cell extracts. Specifically, the sequential binding of capture DNA (cDNA), telomerase primer sequence (TS), and Au NP-labeled probe DNA (Au NP-pDNA) on the electrode would place the Au NPs in close proximity of the Pdots, leading to obvious quenching of the cathodic photocurrent. The subsequent extension of the TS by TE in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) would then release the Ag NP-pDNA from the electrode, leading to the recovery of the photocurrent. On the basis of the Au NP-induced photocurrent quenching and the recovery of Pdots, a sensitive biosensor could thus be developed by tracking the photocurrents to probe the TE activity. This strategy allows for signal-on and cathodic PEC bioanalysis of TE, which can be easily extended for numerous other targets of interest. We believe this work could offer a new perspective for the rational implementation of Pdot-involved ET for advanced PEC bioanalysis.",Iodine-Rich Polymersomes Enable Versatile SPECT/CT Imaging and Potent Radioisotope Therapy for Tumor in Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062589,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"Emerging tumor treatment demands high sensitivity and high-spatial resolution diagnosis in combination with targeted therapy. Here, we report that iodine-rich polymersomes (I-PS) enable versatile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) dual-modal imaging and potent radioisotope therapy for breast cancer in vivo. Interestingly, I-PS could be easily and stably labeled with radioiodine, 125I and 131I. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy showed that 125I-PS had a size of 106 nm and vesicular morphology, similar to those of the parent I-PS. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays displayed that I-PS and 125I-PS were noncytotoxic, whereas 131I-PS caused significant death of 4T1 cells at 5 mg PS/mL with a radioactivity of 12 μCi. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies showed that 125I-PS has a prolonged circulation and distributes mainly in tumor and the reticuloendothelial system. The intravenous injection of 125I-PS to 4T1 murine breast tumor-bearing mice allowed simultaneous high sensitivity and high-spatial resolution imaging of tumor by SPECT and CT, respectively. The therapeutic studies revealed that 131I-PS could effectively retard the growth of 4T1 breast tumor and significantly prolong mice survival time. The hematoxylin and eosin staining assay proved that 131I-PS induced tumor cell death. I-PS emerges as a robust and versatile platform for dual-modal imaging and targeted radioisotope therapy.",Oligo(ethylene glycol)-Functionalized Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for the Detection of Hydrazine in Vitro and in Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062588,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Hydrazine induced toxicity causes serious harm to the health of humans. The detection of N2H4 in vitro and in vivo has attracted a great deal of attention, especially in the context of fluorescent probes. Although some fluorescent N2H4 probes have been reported, only a few operate in purely aqueous media and, as a result, require the use of organic cosolvents which hinders their use in analysis of real samples. In addition, most of the current N2H4 probes are either ""off-on"" or ""on-off"" types, in which it is difficult to eliminate interference from background fluorescence commonly occurring in in vitro and in vivo systems. Furthermore, some probes are unable to differentiate hydrazine from other organic amines. To address the above problems, we developed a novel oligo(ethylene glycol)-functionalized fluorescent probe for the detection of N2H4. The probe, which has a donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A)-type structure, is water-soluble, and it can be utilized to selectively detect N2H4 in both colorimetric and ratiometric mode. Furthermore, the probe is able to differentiate hydrazine from other organic amines and can be used to detect hydrazine vapor and for imaging A549 cells and zebrafish.",A Liposomal Platform for Delivery of a Protein Antigen to Langerin-Expressing Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062587,Biochemistry,2019 06 10,"The skin is an attractive site for vaccination and harbors a dense network of Langerhans cells that are the prime target for antigen delivery approaches in the epidermis. While specific targeting of Langerhans cells has been shown to elicit the necessary T-cell response using antibody-based delivery approaches, the targeted administration of particulate antigens in the form of nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations has been challenging. We previously reported on a specific targeting ligand for human Langerin, a C-type lectin expressed on Langerhans cells. This ligand is presented on liposomes and renders them highly specific for the uptake by Langerhans cells. Here we show a detailed study of the uptake and intracellular routing of the particles in model cell lines by confocal and live cell imaging as well as flow cytometric assays. Liposomes are internalized into early endosomal compartments and accumulate in late endosomes and lysosomes, shortly followed by a release of the cargo. Furthermore, we show the encapsulation of protein antigens and their delivery to cell lines and primary human Langerhans cells. These data further support the applicability of the targeted liposomal particles for protein vaccine applications.",Directly Accessible and Transferrable Nanofluidic Systems for Biomolecule Manipulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062586,ACS sensors,2019 05 24,"Molecular detection and manipulation via nanofluidic systems offers new routes for single-molecule analysis to study epigenetic mechanisms and genetic mutation of disease. For detection of single biological molecule, many types of nanomicrofluidic systems have been utilized. Typically, mechanical tethering, fluidic pressure, chemical interactions, or electrical forces allow controllable attraction, enrichment, confinement, and elongation of target molecules. The currently available methods, however, are unable to offer both molecular manipulation and direct and concurrent assessment of target molecules in the system due to the nature of enclosed channels and associated fluidic components. Here, we introduce a wafer-scale nanofluidic system that incorporates an array of accessible open nanochannels and nano-microtrappers to enrich and elongate target molecules (DNA) via the combination of an electric field and hydrodynamic force. The open nanofluidic system allows easy access, direct observation, and manipulation of molecules in the nanochannels. The presence of a stretched single DNA and the efficacy of the nanofluidic system are studied by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Hybrid integration of the nanodevice fabrication with a material transfer printing technique enables to design a highly flexible and transferrable nanofluidic system after molecular concentration."

Stent design and drug elution strategies have evolved over the years leading to the last generation DES which shows optimal safety and efficacy outcome. Peripheral arteries have different mechanical and biological features and the lessons learned from the coronary field have been difficult to introduce into the development of peripheral vascular technologies. First, due to its complex biomechanical behavior the use of metallic stents is limited in some vascular segments (i.e., distal SFA). Also, peripheral vascular atherosclerosis is different containing higher levels of plaque burden and calcium. Finally, peripheral arterial disease tends to be more aggressive including longer lesions and higher incidence of total chronic occlusion. In general terms, restenosis in the peripheral vascular territory is more aggressive and occurs at a later time (~12-months) requiring a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to coronary technologies. Several strategies have been evaluated in the peripheral arteries raging from the bare metal stent to the drug coated balloon and drug eluting stent with outcome varying depending on the different field of application (i.e. SFA and BTK). Results coming from the clinical trial are encouraging but further studies and direct comparison among the different technologies are demanded to determine the best therapy for peripheral vascular disease (PVD).",The current state of surgical bypass versus drug eluting stents for long femoropopliteal occlusive lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062570,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 07,"Considerable advances have been made over the last decade in the management of patients with peripheral artery disease. Historically, endovascular treatment has been the accepted approach for short lesions and surgical bypass for long, complex femoropopliteal lesions. However, bypass surgery holds significant risk of mortality and morbidity for the patient. That toll includes prolonged hospitalization, as well as the potential for wound healing and systemic complications, all of which are intensified by the ageing population. Advances in endovascular devices, such as drug eluting stents present an alternative, minimally invasive treatment option which may more suitable for complex lesions in a high-risk population.

In the jejunum, a high-affinity, super-low-capacity (Ha/sLc) kinetic system accounted for glucose transport, and a low-affinity, low-capacity (La/Lc) kinetic system accounted for galactose transport. In contrast, the ileum demonstrated a high-affinity, super-high-capacity (Ha/sHc) glucose transport and a low-affinity, high-capacity (La/Hc) galactose transport systems. Jejunal glucose transport was not inhibited by dapagliflozin, but galactose transport was inhibited. Comparatively, ileal glucose and galactose transport were both sensitive to dapagliflozin. Genomic and gene expression analyses identified 10 of the 12 known SLC5A family members in the porcine jejunum, ileum, and distal colon. Dominant SGLT1 (SLC5A1) and SGLT3 (SLC5A4) expression was associated with the sigmoidal Ha/sLc glucose and La/Lc galactose transport systems in the jejunum. Comparatively, the dominant expression of SGLT1 (SLC5A1) in the ileum was only associated with Ha glucose and La galactose kinetic systems. However, the sigmoidal kinetics and overall high capacity (Hc) of transport is unlikely accounted for by SGLT1 (SLC5A1) alone. Finally, the absence of transport and lack of pharmacological inhibition in the colon was associated with the poor expression of SLC5A genes. Altogether, the results demonstrated intestinal segregation of monosaccharide transport fit different sigmoidal kinetic systems. This reveals multiple transporter populations in each system, supported by gene expression profiles and pharmacological inhibition. Overall, this work demonstrates a complexity to transporter involvement in intestinal electrogenic monosaccharide absorption systems not previously defined.","Direct costs of both inpatient and outpatient care for all type cancers: The evidence from Beijing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062522,Cancer medicine,2019 06 14,"Cancer is a major public health issue worldwide.

Herein, a SERS active AuCu alloy with a starfish-like structure is prepared using a surfactant-free method. By covering the anisotropic AuCu alloy with graphene oxide (GO), enhanced SERS activity is obtained owing to graphene-enhanced Raman scattering and assembly of Raman reporters. Besides, stability of SERS is promoted based on the protection of GO to the AuCu alloy. Meanwhile, it is found that SERS activity of AuCu/GO can be regulated by DNA. The regulation is sequence and length dual-dependent, and short polyT reveals the strongest ability of enhancing the SERS activity. Relying on this phenomenon, a SERS biosensor is designed to quantify apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). Because of the APE1-induced cycling amplification, the biosensor is able to detect APE1 sensitively and selectively. In addition, APE1 in human serum is analyzed by the SERS biosensor and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data from the SERS method are superior to that from ELISA, indicating great potential of this biosensor in clinical applications.",Guidance for the Treatment of Femoral Neck Fracture with Precise Minimally Invasive Internal Fixation Based on the Orthopaedic Surgery Robot Positioning System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062519,Orthopaedic surgery,2019 05 07,"Femoral neck fractures are among the most common fractures in orthopaedics. There are many surgical methods for the treatment of femoral neck fracture. Percutaneous cannulated lag screw fixation for the treatment of femoral neck fractures is favored by orthopaedic doctors because of its characteristics of being minimally invasive, with less bleeding and firm fixation. However, traditional freehand screw placement is limited by many factors, and the screw malposition rate is very high, which directly leads to the reduction of its biomechanical stability, and even leads to the ischemic necrosis of the femoral head caused by damage to blood vessels. In addition, excessive attempts to drill holes can damage cancellous bone and affect the screw's holding force, which reduces the stability of internal fixation and increases the risk of failure. At the same time, too much radiation exposure to medical personnel and patients also causes great damage to the body. Robot-assisted orthopaedic surgery combines the mechanical ""eye"" (an infrared ray tracking device) and the mechanical ""hand"" (six degrees of freedom mechanical arm), and through the process of preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance in screw placement, and postoperative confirmation, provides a more minimally invasive and precise treatment method for this kind of surgery, and significantly reduces radiation exposure.

While it is one of the most common fracture injuries impacting the elder community and those who suffer from traumatic falls or forceful collisions, there are almost no validated computational methods that can accurately model these fractures. This could be due to the complex, inhomogeneous bone microstructure, complex geometries and the limitations of current fracture mechanics methods. In this paper, we develop and implement a novel phase field method to investigate the proximal humerus fracture. To model the fracture in the inhomogeneous domain, we propose a power law relationship between bone mineral density and critical energy release rate. The method is validated by an in vitro experiment, in which a human humerus is constrained on both ends while subjected to compressive loads on its head in the longitudinal direction that lead to fracture at the anatomical neck. CT-scans are employed to acquire the bone geometry and material parameters, from which detailed finite element meshes with inhomogeneous Young modulus distribution in the bone are generated. The numerical method, implemented in a high performance computing environment, is used to quantitatively predict the complex 3D brittle fracture of the bone, and is shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, our findings show that the damage is initiated in the trabecular bone-head and propagates outward towards the bone cortex. We conclude that the proposed phase field method is a promising approach to model bone fracture.",Guidance for Treatment of Pelvic Acetabular Injuries with Precise Minimally Invasive Internal Fixation Based on the Orthopaedic Surgery Robot Positioning System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062515,Orthopaedic surgery,2019 05 07,"Pelvic acetabular fracture is a common kind of fracture, mostly caused by high energy injuries. It is associated with high mortality and disability rates. The aim of surgical treatment of pelvic acetabular fractures is to restore the symmetry and stability of the pelvic ring structure and the anatomical structure of acetabular. Open reduction internal fixation is often used for the treatment of such fractures, but open surgery is in cases of serious injury, more bleeding, and high risk of infection. With the development of minimally invasive technology and the concept of the bone channel structure, the percutaneous lag screw technique for the treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures has been applied in clinical practice and has proven to be effective. However, the anatomical structure of the pelvis and acetabulum is complex, and there are many important nerves and vessels adjacent to it. Traditional fluoroscopy screw placement is prone to screw malposition, and even minor angle changes may lead to screw perforation and damage of nerve vessels. The problem of radiation exposure is also noteworthy. Robotic-assisted surgery can be used to carry out screw position planning through preoperative imaging, intraoperative real-time tracking, and mechanical arm assistance to ensure that the screw placement position is consistent with the planning. In this way, robotic-assisted surgery can be used to accurately insert lag screws, and can reduce surgical risk and radiation exposure.

To address this question, we studied senescence in two different organ systems in humans, namely skin and T cells in 80 middle-aged and older individuals from the Leiden Longevity Study. Epidermal p16INK4a positivity was associated with neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T-cell immunosenescence phenotype composites (i.e., end-stage differentiated/senescent T cells, including CD45RA+ CCR7- CD28- CD27- CD57+ KLRG1+ T cells). Dermal p16INK4a positivity was significantly associated with the CD4+ , but not with the CD8+ immunosenescence composite. We therefore conclude that there is limited evidence for a link between skin senescence and immunosenescence within individuals.",Why do sub-Saharan Africans present late for HIV care in Switzerland?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062497,HIV medicine,2019 05 07,Late presentation (LP) to HIV care disproportionally affects individuals from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

Now it is shown that bulky tetrazine substituents accelerate this cycloaddition. Computational studies suggest that dispersion forces between the isocyano group and the tetrazine substituents in the transition state contribute to the atypical structure-activity relationship. Stable asymmetric tetrazines that react with isonitriles at rate constants as high as 57 L mol-1  s-1 were accessible by combining bulky and electron-withdrawing substituents. Sterically encumbered tetrazines react selectively with isonitriles in the presence of strained alkenes/alkynes, which allows for the orthogonal labeling of three proteins. The established principles will open new opportunities for developing tetrazine reactants with improved characteristics for diverse labeling and release applications with isonitriles.",Three-dimensional distribution of wall shear stress and its gradient in red cell-resolved computational modeling of blood flow in in vivo-like microvascular networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062494,Physiological reports,2019 05 12,"Using a high-fidelity, 3D computational model of blood flow in microvascular networks, we provide the full 3D distribution of wall shear stress (WSS), and its gradient (WSSG), and quantify the influence of red blood cells (RBCs) on WSS and WSSG. The deformation and flow dynamics of the individual RBCs are accurately resolved in the model, while physiologically realistic microvascular networks comprised of multiple bifurcations, convergences, and tortuous vessels are considered. A strong heterogeneity in WSS and WSSG is predicted across the networks, with the highest WSS occurring in precapillary bifurcations and capillary vessels. 3D variations of WSS and WSSG are shown to occur due to both network morphology and the influence of RBCs. The RBCs increase the WSS by as much as three times compared to that when no RBCs are present, and the highest increase is observed in venules. WSSG also increases significantly, and high WSSGs occur over wider regions in the presence of RBCs. In most vessels, the circumferential component of WSSG is observed to be greater than the axial component in the presence of RBCs, while the opposite trend is observed when RBCs are not considered. These results underscore the important role of RBCs on WSS and WSSG that cannot be predicted by widely used 1D models of network blood flow. Furthermore, the subendothelium-scale variations of WSS and WSSG predicted by the present model have implications in terms of endothelial cell functions in the microvasculature.",Transient synaptic potentiation in nucleus accumbens shell during refraining from cocaine seeking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062493,Addiction biology,2019 05 07,"Repeated exposure to drug-associated cues without reward (extinction) leads to refraining from drug seeking in rodents. We determined if refraining is associated with transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) in nucleus accumbens shell (NAshell), akin to the t-SP measured in the NAcore during cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Using whole cell patch electrophysiology, we found that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in NAshell expressed increased ratio of AMPA to NMDA glutamate receptor currents during refraining, which normalized to baseline levels by the end of the 2-hour extinction session. Unlike t-SP observed in NAcore during reinstated drug seeking, neither dendrite spine head enlargement nor activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMP2/9) accompanied the increased AMPA:NMDA in NAshell during refraining. Refraining was also not associated with changes in paired pulse ratio, NMDA receptor current decay time, or AMPA receptor rectification index in NAshell MSNs. Our preliminary data in transgenic mice suggest that t-SP may increase D2-MSN inputs relative to D1-MSN inputs.","Specificity, strength and evolution of pretransplant donor-specific HLA antibodies determine outcome after kidney transplantation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062492,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2019 05 07,"In this cohort study (N=924), we investigated the evolution and clinical significance of pretransplant donor-specific HLA antibodies (preDSA), detected in the single-antigen beads assay but CDC-crossmatch-negative. Donor specificity of the preDSA (N=107) was determined by high-resolution genotyping of donor-recipient pairs. We found that in 52% of the patients with preDSA, preDSA spontaneously resolved within the first 3 months posttransplant. PreDSA that persisted posttransplant had higher pretransplant MFI values and more specificity against DQ. Patients with resolved and persistent DSA both had a high incidence of histological picture of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMRh ; respectively 54% and 59%). Patients with preDSA that persisted posttransplant had worse 10-year graft survival compared to resolved DSA and preDSA-negative patients. Compared to cases without preDSA, Cox modeling revealed an increased risk of graft failure only in the patients with persistent DSA, in the presence (HR=8.3) but also in the absence (HR=4.3) of ABMRh . In contrast, no increased risk of graft failure was seen in patients with resolved DSA. We conclude that persistence of preDSA posttransplant has a negative impact on graft survival, beyond ABMRh . Even in the absence of antibody-targeting therapy, low-MFI DSA and non-DQ preDSA often disappear early posttransplantation and are not deleterious for graft outcome.

At preheat stress (baseline) and when core temperature was elevated by 0.6 ± 0.2°C (mild) and 1.2 ± 0.3°C (moderate), arterial stiffness was measured in eight healthy younger (26 ± 5 years) and eight healthy older (70 ± 4 years) adults in the supine position. Arterial stiffness was estimated from carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV, applanation tonometry). cfPWV was higher at baseline in older adults (8.8 ± 2.3 m/sec vs. 5.6 ± 0.9 m/sec, P < 0.01) and this difference was maintained throughout passive heat stress (P < 0.01). cfPWV did not change (P ≥ 0.49) with passive heat stress in either younger (at moderate heat stress: 6.0 ± 1.0 m/sec) or older (at moderate heat stress: 8.5 ± 1.6 m/sec) adults. However, the influence of baseline cfPWV on the change in cfPWV during mild (r = -0.66, P = 0.04) and moderate (r = -0.87, P < 0.01) heat stress were inversely related in older adults, and the strength of these relations was not statistically different (P = 0.08). In younger adults, the influence of baseline cfPWV on the change in cfPWV during mild heat stress was also inversely related (r = -0.79, P = 0.01), while the strength of this relation was attenuated at moderate heat stress (r = -0.24, P = 0.30). Changes in arterial stiffness during passive heat stress in adults aged ≥65 year are likely dependent on the magnitude of baseline arterial stiffness and not necessarily age.",Hypoxia protects the liver from Small For Size Syndrome: a lesson learned from the associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062475,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2019 05 07,"Portal hyperperfusion and ""dearterialization"" of the liver remnant are the main pathogenic mechanisms for Small For Size syndrome (SFSS). ALPPS induces rapid remnant hypertrophy. We hypothesized similar increase in portal pressure/flow into the future liver remnant in ALPPS and SFSS-setting hepatectomies. In a rodent model, ALPPS was compared to SFSS-setting hepatectomy. We assessed mortality, remnant hypertrophy, hepatocyte proliferation, portal and hepatic artery flow, hypoxia-induced response and liver sinusoidal morphology. SFSS-hepatectomy rats were subjected to local (hepatic artery ligation) or systemic (Dimethyloxalylglycine) hypoxia. ALLPS prevented mortality in SFSS-setting hepatectomies. Portal hyperperfusion per liver mass was similar in ALLPS and SFSS. Compared to SFSS, efficient arterial perfusion of the remnant was significantly lower in ALPPS causing pronounced hypoxia confirmed by pimonidazole immunostaining, activation of hypoxia sensors and up-regulation of neo-angiogenic genes. Liver sinusoids, larger in ALPPS, collapsed in SFSS. Induction of hypoxia in SFSS reduced mortality. Hypoxia had no impact on hepatocyte proliferation but contributed to the integrity of sinusoidal morphology. ALPPS hemodynamically differ from SFSS by a much lower arterial flow in ALPPS's FLR. We show that the ensuing hypoxic response is essential for the function of the regenerating liver by preserving sinusoidal morphology. This article is protected by copyright.

Previous studies confirmed that reduced TFAM expression sensitized tumours cells to chemical therapy reagents and ionizing irradiation (IR). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified that decreased expression of TFAM impaired the proliferation of tumour cells by inducing G1/S phase arrest and reducing the expression of E2F1, phospo-Rb, PCNA and TK1. Furthermore, we proved that knockdown of TFAM enhanced the interaction between p53 and MDM2, resulting in decreased expression of p53 and the downstream target TIGAR, and thus leading to elevated level of mitochondrial superoxide and DNA double-strand break (DSB) which were exacerbated when treated the cell with ionizing radiation. Those indicated that knockdown of TFAM could aggravate radiation induced DSB levels through affecting the production of mitochondria derived reactive oxygen species. Our current work proposed a new mechanism that TFAM through p53/TIGAR signalling to regulate the sensitivity of tumour cells to ionizing radiation. This indicated that TFAM might be a potential target for increasing the sensitization of cancer cells to radiotherapy.",Synthesis of indoles via domino reaction of 2-fluorotoluenes and nitriles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062472,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 07,"Indoles are essential heterocycles in medicinal chemistry and, therefore, novel and efficient approaches to their synthesis are in high demand.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling is widely recognized exerting cardioprotective effect in various cardiomyopathy. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the protective effects of the CAP are associated with AMPK signalling in ICM. In vivo, coronary artery of rats was ligated for 4 weeks to induce the ICM and then treated with PNU-282987 (CAP agonist) and BML-275 dihydrochloride (AMPK antagonist) for 4 weeks. In vitro, primary macrophages harvested from rats were induced inflammation by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and then treated with PNU-282987 and BML-275 dihydrochloride. In vivo, exciting CAP by PUN-282987 elicited an activation of AMPK signalling, alleviated ventricular remodeling, modified the cardiac electrophysiological function, reduced the cardiac expression of collagens and inflammatory cytokines and maintained the integrity of ultrastructure in the ischemic heart. However, the benefits of CAP excitation were blunted by AMPK signaling antagonization. In vitro, excitation of the CAP was observed inhibiting the nuclear transfer of NF-κB p65 of macrophages and promoting the transformation of Ly-6Chigh macrophages into Ly-6Clow macrophages. However, inhibiting AMPK signalling by BML-275 dihydrochloride reversed the CAP effect on LPS-treated macrophages. Finally, our findings suggest that eliciting the CAP modulates the inflammatory response in ICM through regulating AMPK signalling.",A nationwide study on the incidence of mesenteric ischaemia after surgery for rectal cancer demonstrates an association with high arterial ligation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062468,Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,2019 05 20,"The incidence of mesenteric ischaemia after resection for rectal cancer has not been investigated in a population-based setting.

Exploitation of its restricted conformational freedom led to the development of the d-Pro-l-Pro (corresponding to (R)-Pro-(S)-Pro) segment as a 'templating' unit, frequently used in the design of β-hairpin peptidomimetics, in which conformational stability is however inherently linked to the cis-trans isomerization of the prolyl amide bonds. In this context, the stereoelectronic properties of the CF3 group can grant distinctive help in conformational control. Herein, the impact of α-trifluoromethylated proline analogues is examined for the design of enhanced β-turn inducers.

A series of CNT/PU nanocomposites with different weight ratios (2:10, 3:10, and 6:10wt%) were obtained. Scanning electron microscopy, conductivity analysis, water contact angle measurements, and tensile tests were used to characterize the scaffolds. FESEM showed that CNTs were adhered on PU nanofibers and created an interconnected web-like structures. The SEM images also revealed that the diameters of nanofibers were decreased by increasing CNTs. The electrical conductivity, tensile strength, Young's modulus, and hydrophilicity of CNT/PU nanocomposites also enhanced after adding CNTs. The scaffolds revealed suitable cytocompatibility for H9c2 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

It is shown that controlled extent of carboxylation of lignin improves the stability at physiological conditions of LNPs formed upon solvent exchange. Functionalization with DSS and iRGD peptides maintains the spherical morphology and moderate polydispersity of LNPs. The LNPs exhibit good cytocompatibility when cultured with PC3-MM2, MDA-MB-231, and A549 in the conventional 2D model and in the 3D cell spheroid morphology. Importantly, the 3D cell models reveal augmented internalization of peptide-functionalized LNPs and improve antiproliferative effects when the LNPs are loaded with a cytotoxic compound. Overall, LNPs-DSS show equal or even superior cellular internalization than the LNPs-iRGD, suggesting that DSS can also be used to enhance the cellular uptake of NPs into different types of cells, and release different cargos intracellularly.",Whole-genome analysis identifying candidate genes of altitude adaptive ecological thresholds in yak populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062447,Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie,2019 05 07,"The domestic yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol of animal husbandry on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Ovarian tissue cryopreservation presents as an alternative but has limitations with a potential risk of reintroducing malignant cells in patients who recovers from cancer, those of chemotherapy prior to tissue cryopreservation. The so-called ""artificial ovary"" aims to resolve this issue by transplanting isolated follicles with or without a biological scaffold. The artificial ovary may also offer an effective alternative option for those who cannot benefit from traditional assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). To date, in animal studies and human trial, the artificial ovary restored endocrine function, achieved in vivo follicular development, and resulted in successful pregnancies. However, development of a technique for higher follicular recovery rate, and a more optimized design of delivery scaffold, better transplantation techniques to prevent post-surgical ischemia, and consideration for genetic safety are required for safer and consistent human clinical applications. Ideas from different transplantation surgeries (e.g. entire ovary, ovarian cortex, and transplantation with tissue-engineered products) can be applied to enhance the efficacy of artificial ovarian transplantation. For the better application of artificial ovary, a deeper understanding of mechanical and biochemical properties of the ovary and folliculogenesis after cryopreservation, transplantation with or without scaffold, as well as development of sophisticated in vivo imaging techniques of transplanted artificial ovary, need to precede its efficient clinical application.",Change in risk for narcolepsy over time and impact of definition of onset date following vaccination with AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccine (Pandemrix) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062443,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2019 05 07,To estimate risk for narcolepsy in defined time windows following exposure to adjuvanted A(H1N1) pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix) and impact of different definitions of index date for the narcolepsy diagnosis.,Design of a new pH-activatable cell-penetrating peptide for drug delivery into tumor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062442,Chemical biology & drug design,2019 05 07,"Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) were considered as potential drug delivery vectors due to their remarkable membrane translocation capacity.

Here, we designed a new pH-activatable CPP, LHHLLHHLHHLLHH-NH2 (LH), by substitution of all lysines and two leucines of LKKLLKLLKKLLKL-NH2 (LK) with histidines. As expected, histidine-rich LH could be activated and penetrate into cells at pH 6.0, whereas its membrane transduction activity could be shielded at pH 7.4. In contrast, LK showed no obviously different cellular uptake at both pH conditions. Importantly, LH was significantly less cytotoxicity compared with LK at both pH values, suggesting a better safety for further application.

Psoriatic patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2012 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The age-, sex- and index date-matched non-exposed group was selected from the same database. The relationship between psoriasis and the risk of BP was investigated using Cox proportional hazards analyses. Psoriasis was significantly associated with an increased risk of BP (hazard ratio, 3.05; 95% confidence interval, 2.10-4.43; P < 0.001). The mean interval between the diagnoses of psoriasis and BP was 2.86 years, with the highest occurrence in the first year after psoriasis diagnosis, and gradually decreasing with each year of observation. Psoriatic patients with BP were significantly younger than BP patients in the non-exposed group (71.6 ± 13.9 vs 76.6 ± 7.7 years, respectively; P = 0.030). A higher proportion of patients with coexisting psoriasis and BP received phototherapy (20%). In conclusion, psoriasis was independently associated with a 3.05-fold increased risk of BP, and psoriatic patients with BP were younger, with over one-third of BP cases diagnosed in the first year after incident psoriasis. Therefore, clinicians treating patients with psoriasis may be aware of the possibility of the development of BP.",Aberrant localization of signaling proteins in skin cancer: Implications for treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062427,Molecular carcinogenesis,2019 05 07,"Aberrant subcellular localization of signaling proteins can provide cancer cells with advantages such as resistance to apoptotic cell death, increased invasiveness and more rapid proliferation. Nuclear to cytoplasmic shifts in tumor-promoting proteins can lead to worse patient outcomes, providing opportunities to target cancer-specific processes. Herein, we review the significance of dysregulated protein localization with a focus on skin cancer. Altered localization of signaling proteins controlling cell cycle progression or cell death is a common feature of cancer. In some instances, aberrant subcellular localization results in an acquired prosurvival function. Taking advantage of this knowledge reveals novel targets useful in the development of cancer therapeutics.",Impact of obesity and metabolic abnormalities on the risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasia after polypectomy in men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062426,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2019 06 07,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome are well-known risk factors for the development of metachronous colorectal neoplasia (CRN).

Two intracellular PLA2 s, iPLA2 A and iPLA2 B, have been found in Spodoptera exigua. Both are calcium-independent cellular PLA2 . Their orthologs have been found in other insects. These two iPLA2 s are different in ankyrin motif of N terminal region. The objective of this study was to determine whether Toll/immune deficiency (IMD) signal pathways could mediate cellular immune responses via induction of iPLA2 expression. Both iPLA 2 s were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua, showing the highest expression in the adult stage. During larval stage, hemocyte is the main tissue showing expression of these iPLA2 s. Both iPLA2 s exhibited similar expression patterns after immune challenge with different microbial pathogens such as virus, bacteria, and fungi. Promoter component analysis of orthologs encoded in S. frugiperda indicated nuclear factor-κB- and Relish-responsible elements on their promoters, suggesting their expression in S. exigua under Toll/IMD immune signaling pathways. RNA interference (RNAi) of MyD88 or Pelle under Toll pathway suppressed inducible expression levels of both iPLA2 s in response to Gram-positive bacteria containing Lys-type peptidoglycan or fungal infection. In contrast, RNAi against Relish under IMD pathway suppressed both iPLA2 s in response to infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Under RNAi conditions, hemocytes significantly lost cellular immune response measured by nodule formation. However, addition of arachidonic acid (a catalytic product of PLA2 ) rescued such immunosuppression. These results suggest that Toll/IMD signal pathways can mediate cellular immune responses via eicosanoid signaling by inducing iPLA2 expression.",Nitrogen maintenance requirements and potential for nitrogen retention of pullets in growth phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062424,Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2019 05 07,"Experiments were conducted to estimate daily N maintenance requirements (NMRs) and the genetic potential for daily N retention (NRmax T) of pullets in growth phase. Three nitrogen balance trials were conducted, and a total of 48 Hy-line W-36 pullets were used in each trial in age periods (starter: 14-28, grower: 56-70 and developer: 98-112 days). The treatments consisted of six graded levels of nitrogen in the diets (L1 = 8, L2 = 16, L3 = 24, L4 = 32, L5 = 40 and L6 = 48 g N/kg of feed), formulated using the dilution technique. The regression analyses between nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion were performed to fit the exponential function and to determine the NMR. The daily NMRs that were estimated at 294, 331 and 355 mg/BWkg0.67 for the initial, grower and developer periods, respectively, were applied for further calculation of NRmax T as the threshold value of the function between N intake and daily N balance. The NRmax T was estimated by a statistical procedure following several iteration steps by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm until the sum of the squares of the residual was minimized. The NRmax T was estimated at 3,200, 2,633 and 1,826 mg/BWkg0.67 for starter, grower and developer periods respectively. The determined model parameters were the precondition for modelling of the amino acid requirement based on an exponential N-utilization model and depended on performance and dietary amino acid efficiency. This procedure will be further developed and applied in the subsequent study.",miR-202-5p protects rat against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury by downregulating the expression of Trpv2 to attenuate the Ca 2+ overload in cardiomyocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062423,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,This study was aimed to unveil micro RNA (miRNA) expression profiles in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) rats and explore whether and how dysregulated miRNAs were involved in the initiation and progression of MI/R in a calcium-dependent manner.,Regulatory mechanisms mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ in skin cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062422,Molecular carcinogenesis,2019 06 10,"Considerable progress has been made during the past 20 years towards elucidating the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) in skin cancer. In 1999, the original notion that PPARβ/δ was involved with epithelial cell function was postulated based on a correlation between PPARβ/δ expression and the induction of messenger RNAs encoding proteins that mediate terminal differentiation in keratinocytes. Subsequent studies definitively revealed that PPARβ/δ could induce terminal differentiation and inhibit proliferation of keratinocytes. Molecular mechanisms have since been discovered to explain how this nuclear receptor can be targeted for preventing and treating skin cancer. This includes the regulation of terminal differentiation, mitotic signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cellular senescence. Interestingly, the effects of activating PPARβ/δ can preferentially target keratinocytes with genetic mutations associated with skin cancer. This review provides the history and current understanding of how PPARβ/δ can be targeted for both nonmelanoma skin cancer and melanoma and postulates how future approaches that modulate PPARβ/δ signaling may be developed for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.",Effects of dietary calcium to available phosphorus ratios on bone metabolism and osteoclast activity of the OPG /RANK/RANKL signalling pathway in piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062421,Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2019 05 07,"Hydroxyapatite, a mineral form of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) that gives bones their rigidity, is the major and essential component of bones and teeth in the human and animal body.

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of dietary calcium to available phosphorus ratios (Ca/AP) on bone metabolism and osteoclast activity of the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) signalling pathway in piglets. At days 15 and 29, the piglets were assessed for growth performance, blood indicators, cytokines and the OPG/RANK/RANKL signalling pathway. Our results showed that piglets fed a dietary Ca/AP ratio of 2:1 increases growth performance and regulates blood indicators and cytokines (parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT), vitamin D3 (VD3 ), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) content). We also demonstrated that this ratio affects hormone secretion and further bone metabolism through the OPG/RANK/RANKL signalling pathway of osteoclasts. These results indicate that a suitable dietary Ca/AP ratio is vital for bone growth and reduce the incidence of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, providing a practical basis for the raising of piglets.",Young people's experiences of brief inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062419,Journal of paediatrics and child health,2019 05 07,To understand the experiences of young people with anorexia admitted to hospital for brief stays and to inform the design of contemporary inpatient treatment to better suit their needs in the context of a significant shift in practice from longer hospital admissions to shorter stays.,Impact of farnesoid X receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms on hepatic decompensation and mortality in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062417,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2019 06 14,"The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates critical pathways of hepatic metabolism, inflammation, and gut mucosal barrier.

This study explored the role of HOXB13 in glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tissue with the highest aggressive rate and mortality in adults. Through microarray and immunohistochemistry analyses, HOXB13 was highly expressed in GBM tissues. Furthermore, we showed that high-level expression of HOXB13 in GBM was associated with worse survival, suggesting that HOXB13 could be a prognostic marker for patients with GBM. GBM cells U87 and U251 overexpressing HOXB13 showed enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion relative to the control cells, while knockdown of HOXB13 led to decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities. In addition, dual-luciferase report assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data showed that HOXB13 directly bound to HOXC-AS3 promoter. HOXC-AS3 was involved in HOXB13-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells. In summary, this study revealed the prognostic potential of HOXB13 in GBM. We believed that HOXB13/HOXC-AS3 signaling axis can be served as therapeutic targets for this highly aggressive cancer.","Psychometric evaluation of the German version of a social support scale of FAFHES (Family Functioning, Family Health and Social Support).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062399,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2019 05 07,Family members often need to be supported in informal care of the elderly and desire to be involved into care planning and decision-making.

Abnormal knee kinematics and ""paradoxical"" anterior femoral translation in conventional TKA designs have been suggested as potential causes of patient dissatisfaction. However, there is a paucity of data on the in vivo kinematics and articular contact behavior of BCR-TKA. This study aimed to investigate in vivo kinematics, articular contact position, and pivot point location of the BCR-TKA during gait. In vivo kinematics of 30 patients with unilateral BCR-TKA during treadmill walking was determined using validated dual fluoroscopic imaging tracking technique. The BCR-TKA exhibited less extension than the normal healthy knee between heel strike and 48% of gait cycle. Although the average external rotation trend observed for BCR TKA was similar to the normal healthy knee, the range of motion was not fully comparable. The lowest point of the medial condyle showed longer anteroposterior translation excursion than the lateral condyle, leading to a lateral-pivoting pattern in 60% of BCR TKA patients during stance phase. BCR-TKA demonstrated no statistical significant differences in anterior-posterior translation as well as varus rotation, when compared to normal healthy knees during the stance phase. However, sagittal plane motion and tibiofemoral articular contact characteristics including pivoting patterns were not fully restored in BCR TKA patients during gait, suggesting that BCR TKA does not restore native tibiofemoral articular contact kinematics.",Comparative genomics of Bifidobacterium species isolated from marmosets and humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062394,American journal of primatology,2019 05 07,"The genus Bifidobacterium is purported to have beneficial consequences for human health and is a major component of many gastrointestinal probiotics. Although species of Bifidobacterium are generally at low relative frequency in the adult human gastrointestinal tract, they can constitute high proportions of the gastrointestinal communities of adult marmosets. To identify genes that might be important for the maintenance of Bifidobacterium in adult marmosets, ten strains of Bifidobacterium were isolated from the feces of seven adult marmosets, and their genomes were sequenced. There were six B. reuteri strains, two B. callitrichos strains, one B. myosotis sp. nov. and one B. tissieri sp. nov. among our isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the four species we isolated were most closely related to B. bifidum, B. breve and B. longum, which are species found in high abundance in human infants. There were 1357 genes that were shared by at least one strain of B. reuteri, B. callitrichos, B. breve, and B. longum, and 987 genes that were found in all strains of the four species. There were 106 genes found in B. reuteri and B. callitrichos but not in human bifidobacteria, and several of these genes were involved in nutrient uptake. These pathways for nutrient uptake appeared to be specific to Bifidobacterium from New World monkeys. Additionally, the distribution of Bifidobacterium in fecal samples from captive adult marmosets constituted as much as 80% of the gut microbiome, although this was variable between individuals and colonies. We suggest that nutrient transporters may be important for the maintenance of Bifidobacterium during adulthood in marmosets.",Molecular dynamics simulation study on the inhibitory effects of choline-O-sulfate on hIAPP protofibrilation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062393,Journal of computational chemistry,2019 05 07,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2Dm) is a neurodegenerative disease, which occurs due to the self-association of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), also known as human amylin. It was reported experimentally that choline-O-sulfate (COS), a small organic molecule having a tertiary amino group and sulfate group, can prevent the aggregation of human amylin without providing the mechanism of the action of COS in the inhibition process. In this work, we investigate the influence of COS on the full-length hIAPP peptide by performing 500 ns classical molecular dynamics simulations. From pure water simulation (without COS), we have identified the residues 11-20 and 23-36 that mainly participate in the fibril formation, but in the presence of 1.07 M COS these residues become totally free of β-sheet conformation. Our results also show that the sulfate oxygen of COS directly interacts with the peptide backbone, which leads to the local disruption of peptide-peptide interaction. Moreover, the presence of favorable peptide-COS vdW interaction energy and high coordination number of COS molecules in the first solvation shell of the peptide indicates the hydrophobic solvation of the peptide residues by COS molecules, which also play a crucial role in the prevention of β-sheet formation. Finally, from the potential of mean force (PMFs) calculations, we observe that the free energy between two peptides is more negative in the absence of COS and with increasing concentration of COS, it becomes unfavorable significantly indicating that the peptide dimer formation is most stable in pure water, which becomes less favorable in the presence of COS. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Bias induced by ignoring double truncation inherent in autopsy-confirmed survival studies of neurodegenerative diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062392,Statistics in medicine,2019 06 10,"Neurodegenerative diseases require an autopsy for confirmation of diagnosis. When death is the event of interest, studies based on autopsy-confirmed diagnoses result in right truncated survival times because individuals who live past the end of study date do not receive a pathological diagnosis and are therefore not included in the sample. Furthermore, many studies of neurodegenerative diseases recruit subjects only after the onset of the disease, which may result in left truncated survival times. Therefore, double truncation, the simultaneous presence of left and right truncation, is inherent in many autopsy-confirmed survival studies of neurodegenerative diseases. The main focus of this paper is to inform about the inherent double truncation in these studies and demonstrate how to properly estimate and compare survival distribution functions in this setting. We do so by conducting a case study of subjects with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This case study is supported by extensive simulation studies, which provide several new contributions to the literature on survival distribution estimation in the context of double truncation.",Determination of nikethamide by micellar electrokinetic chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062390,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,2019 05 07,"A simple, fast, sensitive and reproducible MEKC-UV method for the determination of nikethamide (NKD) in human urine and pharmaceutical formulation has been developed and validated.

The subject's wrist was placed on the table with the forearm in the pronated position. The transducer was placed on the dorsal surface of the distal radius and ulna, perpendicular to the long axis of the forearm. The center of the ulnar head was at the DRUJ level. The distance between the dorsal surface of the distal radius and the ulnar head was measured at an initial and a pressed-down position.

Peptoids can form a variety of self-assembling structures based on the type and sequence of the side chains attached to their backbones. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been useful in predicting the conformational structures of proteins and will be valuable tools for identifying combinations of peptoid side chains that may form interesting folded structures. However, peptoid models must address a major degree of freedom not common in proteins - the cis/trans isomerization of the peptide bond. This work presents CHARMM general force field (CGenFF) parameters developed to accurately represent peptoid conformational behavior, with an emphasis on a correct representation of both the cis and trans isomers of the peptoid backbone.

Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection and quantification were obtained in the range of 0.9-2.4 and 2.7-7.5 μg L-1 with preconcentration factors in the range of 450-472 in biological samples. This method was used for the determination of tramadol in biological samples (plasma, urine and saliva samples) with good recoveries.",The mTORC2-Akt cascade is crucial for c-Myc to promote hepatocarcinogenesis in mice and men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062368,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 06 13,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly form of liver cancer with limited treatment options. The c-Myc transcription factor is a pivotal player in hepatocarcinogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying c-Myc oncogenic activity in the liver remain poorly delineated. Mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) has been implicated in cancer by regulating multiple AGC kinases, especially AKT proteins. In the liver, AKT1 and AKT2 are widely expressed. While AKT2 is the major isoform downstream of activated PI3K and loss of Pten-induced HCC, the precise function of AKT1 in hepatocarcinogenesis is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that mTORC2 is activated in c-Myc-driven mouse HCC, leading to phosphorylation/activation of Akt1, but not Akt2. Ablation of Rictor inhibited c-Myc induced HCC formation in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered that loss of Akt1, but not Akt2, completely prevented c-Myc HCC formation in mice. Silencing of Rictor or Akt1 in c-Myc HCC cell lines inhibited p-Foxo1 expression and strongly suppressed cell growth in vitro. In human HCC samples, c-MYC activation is strongly correlated with p-AKT1 expression. Higher expression of RICTOR and AKT1, but not AKT2, is associated with poor HCC patient survival. In c-Myc mice, while Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, had limited efficacy to prevent c-Myc-driven HCC progression, dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor MLN0128 effectively promoted tumor regression by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the functional contribution of mTORC2/Akt1 along c-Myc induced hepatocarcinogenesis. AKT isoforms, AKT1 and AKT2, have distinct roles along HCC development and progression. Targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 may be required for effective treatment of human HCC displaying c-Myc amplification or overexpression. This article is protected by copyright.

The absolute oral bioavailability of WA remains unknown and human-related in vitro data are not available. Therefore, in the present study, the absolute oral bioavailability of WA in male rats and the in vitro screening of absorption factors by Q-trap and LC-MS/MS analysis were conducted to explore possible clinical properties of WA. The developed and validated analytical methods were successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic studies and in vitro measurement of WA. The oral bioavailability was determined to be 32.4 ± 4.8% based on intravenous (5 mg/kg) and oral (10 mg/kg) administrations of WA in male rats. The in vitro results showed that WA could be easily transported across Caco-2 cells and WA did not show as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Moreover, the stability of WA was similar between male rat and human in simulated gastric fluid (stable), in intestinal microflora solution (slow decrease) and in liver microsomes (rapid depletion, with a half-life of 5.6 min). As such, the first-pass metabolism of WA was further verified by rat intestine-liver in situ perfusion, revealing that WA rapidly decreased and 27.1% remained within 1 h, while the content of three major metabolites (M1, M4, M5) identified by Q-trap increased. This perfusion result is consistent with the oral bioavailability results in vivo. The first-pass metabolism of WA might be the main barrier in achieving good oral bioavailability in male rats and it is predicted to be similar in humans. This study may hold clinical significance.","Fermentation of pseudocereals quinoa, canihua, and amaranth to improve mineral accessibility through degradation of phytate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062366,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 06 05,"Pseudocereals are nutrient-rich grains with high mineral content but also phytate content. Phytate is a mineral absorption inhibitor. The study's aim was to evaluate phytate degradation during spontaneous fermentation and during Lactobacillus plantarum 299v® fermentation of quinoa, canihua, and amaranth grains and flours. It also aimed to evaluate the accessibility of iron, zinc, and calcium and to estimate their bioavailability before and after the fermentation of flours with starter culture.

The cloud of virtual point sources approximates the actual distribution of sources that can be discrete or continuous. In this manner, only the positions of the sources need to be determined. An upper bound for the uncertainty in the position of the sources was derived, which provides a criteria to distinguish real facts from eventual artefacts and distortions. Two very different experimental situations were used for the test (an artificially synthesized image and fluorescent microscopy images), showing excellent reconstructions and agreement with the predicted uncertainties, achieving up to a fivefold improvement in the resolution for the microscope. The method also provides the optimum number of sources to be used for the fit. LAY DESCRIPTION: A new method is presented that allows the reconstruction of an image with superresolution from a single frame taken with a standard fluorescent microscope. An improvement in the resolution of a factor between 3 and 5 is achieved depending on the noise of the measurement and how precisely the instrument response function (point spread function) is measured. The complete mathematical description is presented showing how to estimate the quality of the reconstruction. The method is based in the approximation of the actual intensity distribution of the object being measured by a superposition of point sources of equal intensity. The problem is converted from determining the intensity of each point to determining the position of the virtual sources. The best fit is found using a genetic algorithm. To validate the method several results of different nature are presented including an artificially generated image, fluorescent beads and labelled mitochondria. The artificial image provides a prior knowledge of the actual system for comparison and validation. The beads were imaged with our highest numerical aperture objective to show method capabilities and also acquired with a low numerical aperture objective to compare the reconstructed image with that acquired with a high numerical aperture objective. This same strategy was followed with the biological sample to show the method working in real practical situations.","High salt stress in the upper part of floating mats of Ulva prolifera, a species that causes green tides, enhances non-photochemical quenching.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062364,Journal of phycology,2019 05 07,"Salt stress is a major abiotic stress factor that can induce many adverse effects on photosynthetic organisms. Plants and algae have developed several mechanisms that help them respond to adverse environments. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is one of these mechanisms. The thalli of algae in the intertidal zone that are attached to rocks can be subject to salt stress for a short period of time due to the rise and fall of the tide. Ulva prolifera causes green tides and can form floating mats when green tides occur and the upper part of the thalli is subjected to high salt stress for a long period of time. In this study, we compared the Ulva prolifera photosynthetic activities and NPQ kinetics when it is subjected to different salinities over various periods of time. Thalli exposed to a salinity of 90 for 4 days showed enhanced NPQ, and photosynthetic activities decreased from 60 min after exposure up to 4 d. This indicated that the induction of NPQ in U. prolifera under salt stress is closely related to the stressing extent and stressing time. The enhanced NPQ in the treated samples exposed for 4 d may explain why the upper layer of the floating mats formed by U. prolifera thalli were able to survive in the harsh environment. Further inhibitor experiments demonstrated that the enhanced NPQ was xanthophyll cycle and transthylakoid proton gradient-dependent. However, photosystem II subunit S (PSBS) and light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) protein didn't over accumulate and may not be responsible for the enhanced NPQ.

However, next to information about stimulus identity we can exploit temporal ordering principles, such as regularity, periodicity, or grouping to generate predictions about the timing of future events. Such predictions may improve cognitive performance by optimising adaptation to dynamic stimuli. Here, we investigated the influence of temporal structure on verbal working memory by assessing immediate recall performance for aurally presented digit sequences (forward digit span) as a function of standard (1000 ms stimulus-onset-asynchronies, SOAs), short (700 ms), long (1300 ms) and mixed (700-1300 ms) stimulus timing during the presentation phase. Participant's digit spans were lower for short and mixed SOA presentation relative to standard SOAs. This confirms an impact of temporal structure on the classic ""magical number seven,"" suggesting that working memory performance can in part be regulated through the systematic application of temporal ordering principles.",Comparison of portable blood-warming devices under simulated pre-hospital conditions: a randomised in-vitro blood circuit study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062351,Anaesthesia,2019 05 10,"Pre-hospital transfusion of blood products is a vital component of many advanced pre-hospital systems. Portable fluid warmers may be utilised to help prevent hypothermia, but the limits defined by manufacturers often do not reflect their clinical use. The primary aim of this randomised in-vitro study was to assess the warming performance of four portable blood warming devices (Thermal Angel, Hypotherm X LG, °M Warmer, Buddy Lite) against control at different clinically-relevant flow rates. The secondary aim was to assess haemolysis rates between devices at different flow rates. We assessed each of the four devices and the control, at flow rates of 50 ml.min-1 , 100 ml.min-1 and 200 ml.min-1 , using a controlled perfusion circuit with multisite temperature monitoring. Free haemoglobin concentration, a marker of haemolysis, was measured at multiple points during each initial study run with spectrophotometry. At all flow rates, the four devices provided superior warming performance compared with the control (p < 0.001). Only the °M Warmer provided a substantial change in temperature at all flow rates (mean (95%CI) temperature change of 21.1 (19.8-22.4) °C, 20.4 (19.1-21.8) °C and 19.4 (17.7-21.1) °C at 50 ml.min-1 , 100 ml.min-1 and 200 ml.min-1 , respectively). There was no association between warming and haemolysis with any device (p = 0.949) or flow rate (p = 0.169). Practical issues, which may be relevant to clinical use, also emerged during testing. Our results suggest that there were significant differences in the performance of portable blood warming devices used at flow rates encountered in clinical practice.",Connecting plant-soil feedbacks to long-term stability in a desert grassland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062350,Ecology,2019 06 05,"Temporal fluctuations in plant species coexistence are key to understanding ecosystem state transitions and long-term maintenance of species diversity. Although plant microbiomes can alter plant competition in short-term experiments, their relevance to natural temporal patterns in plant communities is unresolved. In a semiarid grassland, the frequency and magnitude of change in plant species composition through time varied from relatively static to highly dynamic among patches across the landscape. We field tested whether these alternative successional trajectories correlated with alternative plant-soil interactions. In temporally stable patches, we found negative plant-soil feedbacks, where plants grew worse with conspecific than heterospecific soil biota-a mechanism that maintains stability in mathematical models. In contrast, feedbacks in temporally dynamic patches were neutral to positive. Importantly, the magnitude of feedbacks depended on plant frequency, enabling plant species to increase in cover when rare, which theory predicts will promote long-term, stable coexistence. Although our study does not determine the direction of causality, our results reveal a novel link between plant-microbe interactions and temporal stability of plant species coexistence and help to explain 20+ yr of plant abundance dynamics at the patch-to-landscape scales.","Evaluating Mean Level and Within-Person Consistency in Migraine Pain Intensity and Migraine-Related Disability for AVP-825 vs Oral Sumatriptan: Results from the COMPASS Study, A Randomized Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062349,Headache,2019 05 07,"Consistency of response across multiple attacks is typically measured as the proportion of study participants who achieve a categorical endpoint over a specified number of attacks (ie, 2-hour pain-free response in 2 of 3 attacks).

Upper body central venous catheters are usually placed such that their tip lies within the superior vena cava or at the cavo-atrial junction. Positioning the tip 'too low' in the right atrium has long been argued against on the basis that it increases the risk of perforation, leading to cardiac tamponade. Positioning the tip 'too high' in the brachiocephalic vein or above can also be problematic in that proximal migration can result in extravascular placement of the proximal lumen. Such an incident occurred at our hospital in 2016, resulting in extravasation of a vesicant medication causing tissue necrosis. We undertook a quality improvement project involving a standardised bundle of care and a peri-operative central venous catheter insertion checklist with the aim of reducing the risk of such an incident re-occurring. We conducted a three-month pre-intervention audit (n = 84) in 2016 and a post-intervention audit (n = 84) in 2017. Compared with the pre-intervention audit, the post-intervention audit coincided with a lower rate of central venous catheter tip malpositioning (5.6% vs. 9.2%); and a higher rate of 'optimal' central venous catheter tip position in the distal superior vena cava or cavo-atrial junction (45.1% vs. 29.2%). The central venous catheter insertion checklist also substantially improved documentation of sterility measures, insertion depth and post-insertional documentation of tip position on chest radiograph.","Multiproxy isotopic analyses of human skeletal material from Rapa Nui: Evaluating the evidence from carbonates, bulk collagen, and amino acids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062347,American journal of physical anthropology,2019 05 07,"Stable isotope ratio analysis of bulk bone collagen dominates research into past diet; however, bone carbonate and compound specific isotope analyses (CSIA) of amino acids provide alternative, yet complementary, lines of evidence toward that same research goal.

Simulation results show that the proposed methods have good small-sample properties under a wide range of conditions. The proposed methods are illustrated with examples, and R functions that implement the new methods are provided.",Measurement error in μCT-based three-dimensional geometric morphometrics introduced by surface generation and landmark data acquisition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062345,Journal of anatomy,2019 05 15,"Computed-tomography-derived (CT-derived) polymesh surfaces are widely used in geometric morphometric studies. This approach is inevitably associated with decisions on scanning parameters, resolution, and segmentation strategies. Although the underlying processing steps have been shown to potentially contribute artefactual variance to three-dimensional landmark coordinates, their effects on measurement error have rarely been assessed systematically in CT-based geometric morphometric studies. The present study systematically assessed artefactual variance in landmark data introduced by the use of different voxel sizes, segmentation strategies, surface simplification degrees, and by inter- and intra-observer differences, and compared their magnitude to true biological variation. Multiple CT-derived surface variants of the anuran (Amphibia: Anura) pectoral girdle were generated by systematic changes in the factors that potentially influence the surface geometries. Twenty-four landmarks were repeatedly acquired by different observers. The contribution of all factors to the total variance in the landmark data was assessed using random-factor nested permanovas. Selected sets of Euclidean distances between landmark sets served further to compare the variance among factor levels. Landmark precision was assessed by landmark standard deviation and compared among observers and days. Results showed that all factors, except for voxel size, significantly contributed to measurement error in at least some of the analyses performed. In total, 6.75% of the variance in landmark data that mimicked a realistic biological study was caused by measurement error. In this landmark dataset, intra-observer error was the major source of artefactual variance followed by inter-observer error; the factor segmentation contributed < 1% and slight surface simplification had no significant effect. Inter-observer error clearly exceeded intra-observer error in a different landmark dataset acquired by six partly inexperienced observers. The results suggest that intra-observer error can potentially be reduced by including a training period prior to the actual landmark acquisition task and by acquiring landmarks in as few sessions as possible. Additionally, the application of moderate and careful surface simplification and, potentially, also the use of case-specific optimal combinations of automatic local thresholding algorithms and parameters for segmentation can help reduce intra-observer error. If landmark data are to be acquired by several observers, it is important to ensure that all observers are consistent in landmark identification. Despite the significant amount of artefactual variance, we have shown that landmark data acquired from microCT-derived surfaces are precise enough to study the shape of anuran pectoral girdles. Yet, a systematic assessment of measurement error is advisable for all geometric morphometric studies.",Functional suppression of Epiregulin impairs angiogenesis and aggravates left ventricular remodeling by disrupting the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase1/2 signaling pathway in rats after acute myocardial infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062344,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 05 07,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a severe consequence of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, is often associated with high mortality and morbidity. Emerging evidence have shown that the inhibition of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway appears to protect against AMI. Epiregulin (EREG) is an autocrine growth factor that is believed to activate the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the expression patterns of EREG in AMI and to further study its effects on AMI induced experimentally in rats focusing on angiogenesis and left ventricular remodeling. Microarray-based gene expression profiling of AMI was used to identify differentially expressed genes. To understand the biological significance of EREG and whether it is involved in AMI disease through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, rats after AMI were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against EREG, an ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, PD98059, or both of them. The microarray data sets GSE66360 and GSE46395 showed that EREG was robustly induced in AMI. Both siRNA-mediated depletion of EREG and PD98059 treatment were shown to significantly increase infarct size and left ventricular cardiomyocyte loss and enhance left ventricular remodeling. In addition, we also found that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway was inhibited following siRNA-mediated EREG inhibition and PD98059 could enhance the effects of EREG inhibition on AMI. In conclusion, these findings highlight that the silencing of EREG inhibits angiogenesis and promotes left ventricular remodeling by disrupting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, providing a novel therapeutic target for limiting AMI.",Healthy user bias in comparative safety studies for brand-name versus generic products; the example of warfarin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062343,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 05 07,"Warfarin (Coumadin® ) was selected as a case study to examine confounding when comparing a product across different manufacturers because it is a narrow therapeutic index drug with prevalent beliefs for brand-name superiority. Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with atrial fibrillation and an incident outpatient warfarin prescription from July 2006 through July 2015 were included in the study population (N = 746,098). Substantial imbalances were observed between brand-name warfarin and generics for: 1) clinical comorbidity, 2) socioeconomic status, 3) prescriber specialty, 4) recent ambulatory and emergent care, 5) drug adherence, 6) pharmacy setting (e.g. retail, mail-order), and 7) risk scores for bleeding and thrombosis. Patients receiving brand-name warfarin were healthier than patients receiving generic manufactured warfarin. Utilization of generic warfarin products also differed by geographical region and pharmacy setting. Manufacturer-level comparative-safety studies for causal inference should carefully consider the presence of these imbalances and their potential for introducing healthy user bias.

Recent clinical trials of anti-amyloid β-protein (Aβ) therapies have not proved to be successful. Thus, glucose-insulin metabolism in the brain is thought to be an alternative therapeutic target. Various types of antidiabetic drugs such as insulin, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, biguanides, and others have been reported to be effective on cognitive impairment in animal models and patients with DM or AD. Here, recent reports are reviewed. While we identified apomorphine (APO) as a novel drug that promoted intracellular Aβ degradation and improved memory function in an AD mouse model, more recently, we have revealed that APO treatment improves neuronal insulin resistance and activates insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a major Aβ-degrading enzyme.

Additionally, there may be a dementia subgroup associated with specific DM-related metabolic abnormalities rather than with AD pathology or cerebrovascular diseases. This type of dementia, not showing hypoperfusion in the parietotemporal lobe on SPECT or cerebrovascular lesions on MRI, was characterized by old age, high hemoglobin A1c level, long duration of diabetes, high frequency of insulin therapy, low frequency of apolipoprotein E4 carrier, less-severe medial temporal lobe atrophy, impaired attention and executive function, less-impaired word recall, and slow progression of cognitive impairment and might be referred to as ""diabetes-related dementia"" (DrD). 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B PET shows often negative or equivocal amyloid accumulation in the brain, indicating different from AD pathology. In addition to insulin resistance, elevated inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products were associated with cognitive impairment in this type of dementia. Glycemic controls can improve some domains of cognitive function, such as attention and executive functions, in subjects with DrD. Frequencies of frailty and sarcopenia/dynapenia are significantly higher in DrD than in AD, indicating that geriatric interventions are necessary to improve clinical outcomes for patients with DrD. DrD can be considered as a controllable or modifiable dementia.

However, it remains unclear how DM accelerates AD pathology in the brain. Cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) is one of the nonhuman primates used for biomedical research, and we can observe spontaneous formation of AD pathology, such as senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), with the advance of aging. Furthermore, obesity is occasionally observed and frequently leads to development of type II DM (T2DM) in laboratory-housed cynomolgus monkeys. These findings suggest that cynomolgus monkey is a useful species to study the relationship between T2DM and AD pathology. In T2DM-affected monkey brains, SPs were observed in frontal and temporal lobe cortices almost 5 years earlier than healthy control monkeys. Moreover, age-related endocytic pathology, such as intraneuronal accumulation of enlarged endosomes, was exacerbated in T2DM-affected monkey brains. Since accumulating evidences suggest that endocytic dysfunction is involved in Aβ pathology, T2DM may aggravate age-related endocytic dysfunction, leading to the acceleration of Aβ pathology.",Molecular Connection Between Diabetes and Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062327,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 07,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are both serious global health problems with high prevalence.

Some of these features, such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and deregulation of O-GlcNAcylation, may serve as molecular links between T2DM and AD. Research on these molecular links is reviewed and discussed in this chapter.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), one of the major lipid carriers in the brain, is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Several studies indicate that ApoE isoforms differentially affect not only lipid metabolism but also glucose metabolism or related pathways, suggesting that these risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD through some common mechanisms.

The discussion delineates why AD with its most characteristic clinical and pathological phenotypic profiles should be regarded as a brain form of diabetes, i.e., type 3 diabetes, and entertains the hypothesis that type 3 diabetes is just one of the categories of insulin resistance diseases that can occur independently or overlap with one or more of the others, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","Molecular Pathophysiology of Insulin Depletion, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, and Oxidative Stress in Alzheimer's Disease Brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062324,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 07,"Accumulating clinical data indicates that insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (DM) are major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the exact mechanisms on how insulin resistance and DM act as risk factors for AD remain unclear. Recent progress in gene expression profiling of AD brains revealed that brain insulin production and insulin signaling are significantly impaired, indicating that AD brain exhibits a feature of brain diabetes with depletion of brain insulin, which causes mitochondrial dysfunction with increased oxidative stress, thereby increasing sensitivity to peripheral diabetes. Such diabetic condition in early stage of AD brain can be exacerbated by peripheral diabetes, namely, through hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, or impaired insulin response. In this chapter, I reviewed mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in AD brain and discussed how those events are involved in AD pathogenesis.",Epidemiological Evidence of the Relationship Between Diabetes and Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062323,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 07,"Growing epidemiological evidence has suggested that subjects with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk for the development of dementia. However, the results for the subtypes of dementia are inconsistent. This review examined the risk of dementia in subjects with diabetes mellitus and discusses the possible mechanism underlying this association. Diabetes mellitus is associated with a 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater risk of dementia among community-dwelling elderly people. Notably, diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for not only vascular dementia but also Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying the association are unclear, but it may be multifactorial in nature, involving factors such as cardiovascular risk factors, glucose toxicity, changes in insulin metabolism, and inflammation. The optimal management of these risk factors in early life may be important to prevent future dementia. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies will be needed to prevent or reduce the development of dementia in subjects with diabetes mellitus.",Origins of Brain Insulin and Its Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062322,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019 05 07,"The brain or central nervous system (CNS) utilizes a vast amount of energy to sustain its basic functions, and most of the energy in the brain is derived from glucose. Whole-body energy and glucose homeostasis in the periphery of the human body are regulated by insulin, while the brain had been considered as an ""insulin-insensitive"" organ, because bulk brain glucose uptake is not affected by insulin in either rodents and humans. However, recently it has become clear that the actions of insulin are more widespread in the CNS and are a critical part of normal development, food intake, and energy balance, as well as plasticity throughout adulthood. Moreover, there are substantial evidence demonstrating that brain insulin is derived from pancreas, neurons, and astrocytes. In this chapter, I reviewed recent progress in roles of insulin in the brain, expression of insulin genes, and multiple origins of the brain insulin."

Here, we present a step-by-step protocol to use CellRouter, a multifaceted single-cell analysis platform that integrates subpopulation identification, gene regulatory networks, and trajectory inference to precisely and flexibly reconstruct complex single-cell trajectories. Subpopulations are either user-defined or identified by a graph-clustering approach in which a k-nearest neighbor graph (kNN) is created from cell-to-cell distances in a low-dimensional embedding. Edges in this graph are weighted by network similarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard index) to robustly encode phenotypic relatedness, creating a representation of single-cell transcriptomes suitable for community detection algorithms to identify clusters of densely connected cells. This subpopulation structure represents a map of putative cell-state transitions. CellRouter implements a flow network algorithm to explore this map and reconstruct cell-state transitions in complex single-cell, multidimensional omics datasets. We describe a step-by-step application of CellRouter to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation toward four major lineages-erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes-to demonstrate key components of CellRouter for single-cell trajectory analysis.",Modeling Gene Networks to Understand Multistability in Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062310,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"Stem cells are unique in their ability to differentiate into diverse phenotypes capable of displaying radically different, yet stable, gene expression profiles. Understanding this multistable behavior is key to rationally influencing stem cell differentiation for both research and therapeutic purposes. To this end, mathematical paradigms have been adopted to simulate and explain the dynamics of complex gene networks. In this chapter, we introduce strategies for building deterministic and stochastic mathematical models of gene expression and demonstrate how analysis of these models can benefit our understanding of complex observed behaviors. Developing a mathematical understanding of biological processes is of utmost importance in understanding and controlling stem cell behavior.",Quantitative Modelling of the Waddington Epigenetic Landscape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062309,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"C.H. Waddington introduced the epigenetic landscape as a metaphor to represent cellular decision-making during development. Like a population of balls rolling down a rough hillside, developing cells follow specific trajectories (valleys) and eventually come to rest in one or another low-energy state that represents a mature cell type. Waddington depicted the topography of this landscape as determined by interactions among gene products, thereby connecting genotype to phenotype. In modern terms, each point on the landscape represents a state of the underlying genetic regulatory network, which in turn is described by a gene expression profile. In this chapter we demonstrate how the mathematical formalism of Hopfield networks can be used to model this epigenetic landscape. Hopfield networks are auto-associative artificial neural networks; input patterns are stored as attractors of the network and can be recalled from noisy or incomplete inputs. The resulting models capture the temporal dynamics of a gene regulatory network, yielding quantitative insight into cellular development and phenotype.",Computational Tools for Quantifying Concordance in Single-Cell Fate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062308,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"Cells are dynamic biological systems that interact with each other and their surrounding environment. Understanding how cell extrinsic and intrinsic factors control cell fate is fundamental to many biological experiments. However, due to transcriptional heterogeneity or microenvironmental fluctuations, cell fates appear to be random. Individual cells within well-defined subpopulations vary with respect to their proliferative potential, survival, and lineage potency. Therefore, methods to quantify fate outcomes for heterogeneous populations that consider both the stochastic and deterministic features of single-cell dynamics are required to develop accurate models of cell growth and differentiation. To study random versus deterministic cell behavior, one requires a probabilistic modelling approach to estimate cumulative incidence functions relating the probability of a cell's fate to its lifetime and to model the deterministic effect of cell environment and inheritance, i.e., nature versus nurture. We have applied competing risks statistics, a branch of survival statistics, to quantify cell fate concordance from cell lifetime data. Competing risks modelling of cell fate concordance provides an unbiased, robust statistical modelling approach to model cell growth and differentiation by estimating the effect of cell extrinsic and heritable factors on the cause-specific cumulative incidence function.",Mathematical Modelling of Clonal Stem Cell Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062307,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"Studying cell fate dynamics is complicated by the fact that direct in vivo observation of individual cell fate outcomes is usually not possible and only multicellular data of cell clones can be obtained. In this situation, experimental data alone is not sufficient to validate biological models because the hypotheses and the data cannot be directly compared and thus standard statistical tests cannot be leveraged. On the other hand, mathematical modelling can bridge the scales between a hypothesis and measured data via quantitative predictions from a mathematical model. Here, we describe how to implement the rules behind a hypothesis (cell fate outcomes) one-to-one as a stochastic model, how to evaluate such a rule-based model mathematically via analytical calculation or stochastic simulations of the model's Master equation, and to predict the outcomes of clonal statistics for respective hypotheses.

The methodology encapsulated in RE:IN enabled the exploration of a space of possible network interaction models, allowing for uncertainty in whether individual interactions exist between the pluripotency factors. This concept of an ""abstract"" network was combined with automated reasoning that allows the user to eliminate models that are inconsistent with experimental observations.

How different genes interact among themselves to coordinate and maintain the overall gene expression profile observed in a cell is a key question in cellular biology. However, the immense complexity arising due to the scale and the nature of gene-gene interactions often hinders obtaining a global understanding of gene regulation. In this regard, network models of gene regulation based on gene-gene interactions, commonly referred to as gene regulatory networks (GRNs), serve important purpose of describing the overall interactions within a cell and provide a systematic approach to study their global behavior. In particular, in the context of cellular differentiation and reprogramming, where regulated changes in gene expression play a crucial role, precise knowledge of a cell type-specific GRN can enable control of the eventual cell fates with potential clinical applications. In this chapter, we describe our computational methodologies that we have tailor-made with purpose of applications to cell fate control. Briefly, we introduce the process of cellular differentiation and reprogramming, describe GRNs and common strategies to model them, and, finally, introduce the concept of determinants of cellular reprogramming and differentiation. In the Methods section, we elaborate on the different steps involved in the computational pipeline, including initial gene expression data processing, characterization of prior knowledge network, algorithm to remove non-cell type-specific edges, topological characterization of the inferred network, and Boolean network simulations to mimic cellular transitions. Finally, we provide a strategy to identify determinants of cellular reprogramming and differentiation based on the proposed computational methods.",Agent-Based Modelling to Delineate Spatiotemporal Control Mechanisms of the Stem Cell Niche.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062303,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 08,"Agent-based modelling (ABM) offers a framework to realistically couple subcellular signaling pathways to cellular behavior and macroscopic tissue organization.

These techniques are demonstrated through a case study on the simulation of a Notch-Delta Positive Feedback, Lateral Inhibition (PFLI) gene circuit in the intestinal crypts.

In a previous study, London, Burger, Thompson, and Toiviainen (Acta Psychologica, 164, 70-80, 2016) presented participants with original as well as ""time-stretched"" versions of classic R&B songs; time stretching slows down or speeds up a recording without changing its pitch or timbre. In that study we discovered a tempo anchoring effect (TAE): Although relative tempo judgments (original vs. time-stretched versions of the same song) were correct, they were at odds with BPM rates of each stimulus. As previous studies have shown that synchronous movement enhances rhythm perception, we hypothesized that tapping along to the beat of these songs would reduce or eliminate the TAE and increase the salience of the beat rate of each stimulus. In the current study participants were presented with the London et al. (Acta Psychologica, 164, 70-80, 2016) stimuli in nonmovement and movement conditions. We found that although participants were able to make BPM-based tempo judgments of generic drumming patterns, and were able to tap along to the R&B stimuli at the correct beat rates, the TAE persisted in both movement and nonmovement conditions. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis that movement would reduce or eliminate the TAE, we found a disjunction between correctly synchronized motor behavior and tempo judgment. The implications of the tapping-TAE dissociation in the broader context of tempo and rhythm perception are discussed, and further approaches to studying the TAE-tapping dissociation are suggested."

Alternatively, organic thin layers have also been successfully depth profiled with a low-energy cesium ion beam (Cs+), to exploit the high chemical reactivity of cesium atoms, acting as free-radical scavengers. Despite of this, little is known about the depth resolution associated with low-energy Cs+ sputtering on organic multilayers. In this work, amino acids multilayers, consisting of phenylalanine delta layers alternated with tyrosine spacers, were used as model systems to assess the depth resolution associated with 500 eV Cs+ depth profiles. High yields were obtained for quasi-molecular ions from both amino acids, and no significant chemical alteration was noticed under the monoatomic bombardment. A depth resolution as low as 4 nm is demonstrated without sensible degradation on a rather long profile depth (300 nm). Limited depth resolution (> 10 nm) along with high molecular degradation was previously reported on similar systems by combining low-energy Cs+ with Ga+ analysis beam. The use of the Bi3+ analysis beam results in a dramatic improvement of both the characteristic molecular signal intensities and the depth resolution. Even though the analysis beam fluence is very low compared to the sputtering beam fluence, data suggest that further reducing the analysis Bi3+ fluence could improve the depth resolution by ~ 1 nm.",Fundamental Studies of New Ionization Technologies and Insights from IMS-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062287,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,2019 05 17,"Exceptional ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) developments by von Helden, Jarrold, and Clemmer provided technology that gives a view of chemical/biological compositions previously not achievable. The ionization method of choice used with IMS-MS has been electrospray ionization (ESI). In this special issue contribution, we focus on fundamentals of heretofore unprecedented means for transferring volatile and nonvolatile compounds into gas-phase ions singly and multiply charged. These newer ionization processes frequently lead to different selectivity relative to ESI and, together with IMS-MS, may provide a more comprehensive view of chemical compositions directly from their original environment such as surfaces, e.g., tissue. Similarities of results using solvent- and matrix-assisted ionization are highlighted, as are differences between ESI and the inlet ionization methods, especially with mixtures such as bacterial extracts. Selectivity using different matrices is discussed, as are results which add to our fundamental knowledge of inlet ionization as well as pose additional avenues for inquiry. IMS-MS provides an opportunity for comparison studies relative to ESI and will prove valuable using the new ionization technologies for direct analyses. Our hypothesis is that some ESI-IMS-MS applications will be replaced by the new ionization processes and by understanding mechanistic aspects to aid enhanced source and method developments this will be hastened.",Biocontrol activity of volatile organic compounds from Streptomyces alboflavus TD-1 against Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062286,"Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2019 06 13,"Aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic fungus that contaminates crops with carcinogenic aflatoxin. In the present work, the antifungal effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from Streptomyces alboflavus TD-1 against A. flavus were investigated. VOCs from 8-day-old wheat bran culture of S. alboflavus TD-1 displayed strong inhibitory effects against mycelial growth, sporulation, and conidial germination of A. flavus. Severely misshapen conidia and hyphae of A. flavus were observed by scanning electron microscopy after exposure to VOCs for 6 and 12 h, respectively. Rhodamine 123 staining of mitochondria indicated that mitochondria may be a legitimate antifungal target of the VOCs from S. alboflavus TD-1. Furthermore, the VOCs effectively inhibited aflatoxin B1 production by downregulating genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. Dimethyl trisulfide and benzenamine may play important roles in the suppression of A. flavus growth and production of aflatoxin.

These reported associations were then related to each student's level of gambling involvement and his or her problem gambling status. Results showed there to be a significant positive relationship between the number of gambling-related memory associations and reported level of gambling involvement as well as problem gambling status. Behaviour associations tended to be stronger than word associations, suggesting that each type of association may tap into a different facet of associative memory. Associations with problem gambling status were also stronger than associations with level of gambling involvement.

Western blot analyses were carried out for caspase-8 and caspase-9, Bid, Bax, and Bcl-2 in the cerebellum and immunohistochemistry of Bid, Bax, cytochrome C, and VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channels) in the cerebellar cortex of Wistar male rats with 0, 15, and 45 kindling stimulations. In the experimental group of 45 stimuli, we observed an increase in protein activation of caspase-9 and truncated Bid and Bax, in addition to a decrease in expression of pro-caspase-8 and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, determined by Western blot. Moreover, we observed a cytosolic immunopositivity for cytochrome C and a mitochondrial immunolocalization for truncated Bid and Bax in the group of 45 stimuli. In this work, we found an increase of caspase-8, a cysteine-protease that can activate caspase-3 triggering extrinsic apoptosis by signaling of death receptors. However, it also can activate the intrinsic pathway releasing Bid, which performs mitochondrial translocation of Bax, inactivating Bcl-2 and allowing the release of cytochrome C through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, promoting the activation of caspase-9 which activates caspase-3, the main executor caspase of apoptosis. Therefore, it is concluded that there is an activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in the cerebellum of rats exposed to the kindling model. Apoptosis signaling pathways can be analyzed as an important developing object of research about the epileptic activity.

We assessed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 39 healthy controls. The connection fibers between the DN and contralateral frontal cortex of all subjects were successfully reconstructed and studied. We demonstrated that multi-fiber probabilistic models must be used to resolve the challenge of crossing fibers. We also demonstrated that the entire pathway can be reconstructed without using any synaptic regions of interest along the path and that the reconstructed tracts connected the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle, contralateral red nucleus, and ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei of thalamus in the path traveling to the contralateral frontal cortex. The fibers in the pathway projected into all areas of the contralateral frontal cortex but were predominantly located in the primary motor and premotor areas. A large portion of fibers terminated in the prefrontal cortex, which included dorsolateral prefrontal areas, anterior prefrontal areas, and the Broca language area. Our findings provide robust, reproducible, and direct DTI-based evidence that the DN through the efferent cerebellar pathway has considerable contribution to high-level executive functions of the human brain.",The Effect of Cerebellar tDCS on Sequential Motor Response Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062282,"Cerebellum (London, England)",2019 05 07,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) transiently alters cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity. So far, few studies have investigated the behavioral effects of applying tDCS to the cerebellum. Given the cerebellum's inhibitory effects on cortical motor areas as well as its role in fine motor control and motor coordination, we investigated whether cerebellar tDCS can modulate response selection processes and motor sequence learning. Seventy-two participants received either cerebellar anodal (excitatory), cathodal (inhibitory), or sham (placebo) tDCS while performing a serial reaction time task (SRTT). To compare acute and long-term effects of stimulation on behavioral performance, participants came back for follow-up testing at 24 h after stimulation. Results indicated no group differences in performance prior to tDCS. During stimulation, tDCS did not affect sequence-specific learning, but anodal as compared to cathodal and sham stimulations did modulate response selection processes. Specifically, anodal tDCS increased response latencies independent of whether a trained or transfer sequence was being performed, although this effect became smaller throughout training. At the 24-h follow-up, the group that previously received anodal tDCS again demonstrated increased response latencies, but only when the previously trained sequence and a transfer sequence had to be performed in the same experimental block. This increased behavioral interference tentatively points to a detrimental effect of anodal cerebellar tDCS on sequence consolidation/retention. These results are consistent with the notion that the cerebellum exerts an inhibitory effect on cortical motor areas, which can impair sequential response selection when this inhibition is strengthened by tDCS.",The Impact of Genetic Counseling Educational Tools on Patients' Knowledge of Molecular Testing Terminology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062281,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 05 10,"Molecular testing is increasingly being integrated into cancer management. Despite rapid advancements, little work has been done to explore strategies for communicating with patients undergoing molecular tumor testing. This study evaluated the impact of genetic counseling educational tools on improving patients' understanding of key terms related to molecular testing. A genetic counseling intern designed a picture book to explain six words found in prior research to be difficult to understand (mutation, germline mutation, somatic mutation, biomarker, molecular testing, and targeted therapy). Participants who had previously discussed molecular testing with their oncologist were asked to define the terms. The same participants then received an explanation of each term either from the intern using the picture book in person or from a video presentation of the picture book. They were then asked to redefine each term afterward. The difference between the number of terms defined correctly pre- and post-intervention was compared between presentations. Sixty-three patients with melanoma, colon, lung, or breast cancer were recruited. After both interventions, correct understanding rates improved for all six terms, with significant improvement for germline mutation (p < 0.001), somatic mutation (p < 0.001), biomarker (p < 0.001), and molecular testing (p < 0.001). Understanding of targeted therapy improved significantly (p = 0.011) for the video presentation only. Mean change in knowledge scores did not differ between the two interventions (intern presentation 3.2 vs. video 2.9, p = 0.428).

Primary facilitators in this model are information-seeking about treatment options and patient-physician trust. Previous studies have investigated the role of each of these parameters individually. However, little is known about their convergent role in treatment decision-making. Therefore, we explored perspectives of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and healthcare professionals about the influence of health information-seeking and physician trust in the SDM process. Qualitative interviews with 20 MBC patients and 6 community oncologists, as well as 3 separate focus groups involving lay navigators, nurses, and academic oncologists, were conducted, recorded, and transcribed. Qualitative data analysis employed a content analysis approach, which included a constant comparative method to generate themes from the transcribed textual data. Five emergent themes were identified (1) physicians considered themselves as the patients' primary source of treatment information; (2) patients trusted their physician's treatment recommendations; (3) patients varied in their approach to seeking further health information regarding the discussed treatment options (e.g., internet websites, family and friends, support groups); (4) other healthcare professionals were cognizant of their fundamental role in facilitating further information-seeking; and (5) patient and physician discordant perspectives on shared decision making were present. Patient procurement of treatment information and the capacity to use it effectively in conjunction with patient trust in physicians play an important role in the shared decision-making process."

As an improvement over a conventional system, the new system can analyze 14 samples per run, evaluate two lymph nodes in ~ 17 min, and reduce inhibition of reactions. This study was aimed at evaluating clinical performance of the new system by comparing it with performance of histopathological analysis and a conventional OSNA system. A total of 150 lymph nodes in 63 breast cancer patients (T1-3) who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection were examined intraoperatively with the new OSNA system, the conventional system, and histopathological analysis. In comparison with histopathological analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rate of the new system were 93.9, 98.8, and 96.7%, respectively. In comparison with the conventional system, similar corresponding values were obtained: 96.9, 98.8, and 98.0%, respectively. The results show that clinical performance of the new OSNA system is equivalent to that of histopathological diagnosis and the conventional OSNA system. The new system is superior to the conventional one because of processing of a greater number of samples, shorter testing time, and the absence of inhibited reactions.",Arthroscopic Determination of Cartilage Proteoglycan Content and Collagen Network Structure with Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062256,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 05 07,"Conventional arthroscopic evaluation of articular cartilage is subjective and insufficient for assessing early compositional and structural changes during the progression of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Therefore, in this study, arthroscopic near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is introduced, for the first time, for in vivo evaluation of articular cartilage thickness, proteoglycan (PG) content, and collagen orientation angle. NIR spectra were acquired in vivo and in vitro from equine cartilage adjacent to experimental cartilage repair sites. As reference, digital densitometry and polarized light microscopy were used to evaluate superficial and full-thickness PG content and collagen orientation angle. To relate NIR spectra and cartilage properties, ensemble neural networks, each with two different architectures, were trained and evaluated by using Spearman's correlation analysis (ρ). The ensemble networks enabled accurate predictions for full-thickness reference properties (PG content: ρin vitro, Val= 0.691, ρin vivo= 0.676; collagen orientation angle: ρin vitro, Val= 0.626, ρin vivo= 0.574) from NIR spectral data.

Fish samples were collected bimonthly from October 2014 to September 2016. Fish community structure in terms of species composition, relative abundance, and trophic and conservation status was recorded. Spatial fish diversity was analyzed from riverine, transitional, and lacustrine zones. Sixty-two fish species were recorded wherein the family Cyprinidae dominated in number of species (26) followed by Bagridae (5). Shannon diversity index, evenness index, and species richness did not reveal significant variation (p > 0.05) across different zones. Relative abundance of individuals and species richness were maximum in the transitional zone and minimum in the lacustrine zone. Multi-dimensional scaling of fish assemblage revealed similar pattern in the riverine and transitional zones. Trophic guild of fishes indicated dominance of carnivorous species followed by planktivores. Conservation status (IUCN 2017.3) showed 4 fish species in Near Threatened category. The study suggests conservation of fish habitats to maintain diversity and sustained production. The baseline information generated in the study will be beneficial for monitoring the alteration in fish assemblage, conservation of fish diversity, and management planning.",Cost-effectiveness of boron (B) removal from irrigation water: an economic water treatment model (EWTM) for farmers to prevent boron toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062239,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Protection of water sources which are used for irrigation has raised great interest in the last years among the environmental strategists due to potential water scarcity worldwide. Excessive boron (B) in irrigation water poses crucial environmental problems in the agricultural zones and it leads to toxicity symptoms in crops, as well as human beings. In the present research, economic water treatment models consist of dried common wetland plants (Lemna gibba, Phragmites australis, and Typha latifolia) and Lemna gibba accumulation was tested and assessed to create a simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method for B removal from irrigation water. Significant amount of B was removed from irrigation water samples by EWTMs and B concentrations decreased below < 1 mg L-1 when the components were exposed to 4 and 8 mg L-1 initial B concentrations. Moreover, the results from batch adsorption study demonstrated that dried L. gibba had a higher B loading capacity compare to other dried plants, and B sorption capacity of dried L. gibba was found as 2.23 mg/g. The optimum pH value for sorption modules was found as neutral pH (pH = 7) in the batch adsorption experiment. Boron sorption from irrigation water samples fitted the Langmuir model, mostly B removed from irrigation water during the first 2 h of contact time. Techno-economic analysis indicated that EWTM is a promising method that appears to be both economically and ecologically feasible, and it can also provide a sustainable and practical strategy for farmers to prevent B toxicity in their agricultural zones.",An effective treatment method for shale gas drilling cuttings solidified body.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062238,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"The exploration and production of shale gas technology provides a way for utilization of clean fuels. However, during the exploration process of shale gas, enormous amount of drilling cutting was generated and had to be solidified and landfilled. So the accumulation of shale gas drilling cutting solidified body (SGDS)causes severe land resource misuse and environmental complications. This study focuses on the utilization of SGDS as a raw material for the production of cement clinker, and the phase composition, microstructure, and environmental performance of the cement clinker was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum analysis (EDX), and soaking test, respectively. The results show that the cement clinker obtained mainly constitutes of typical Portland cement mineral (C3S, C2S, C3A, and C4AF). The leaching test indicated that the concentration of heavy metal ions in leachate is within the limits allowed by the state ""Technical specification for co-processing of solid wastes in cement kiln"" (GB 30760-2014).

Despite numerous successful laboratory experiments, the process remains difficult to predict in moderate arsenic conditions. We performed microcosm experiments using naturally contaminated groundwater (containing ca. 6 mg/L As) and natural organic matter (NOM) particles both collected from wetland soil. Macroscopic realgar precipitates, occasionally accompanied by bonazziite, a FeS phase, elementary S, calcite, and whewellite, appeared after 4 to 18 months. Realgar only precipitated in microcosms moderately poisoned by azide or antibiotics and those in which oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur took place. The biomineralization process was not affected by the presence of additional carbon sources or the diversity, community structure, and functional composition of the microbial community. Hydrogen sulfide concentration was greater in the realgar-free microcosms, suggesting that arsenic thiolation prevented precipitation of realgar. We compared our data to available microbial community data from soils with different rates of realgar precipitation, and found that the communities from realgar-encrusted NOM particles usually showed limited sulfate reduction and the presence of fermentative metabolisms, whereas communities from realgar-free NOM particles were strongly dominated by sulfate reducers. We argue that the limited sulfate supply and intensive fermentation amplify reducing conditions, which make arsenic sulfide precipitation plausible in high-sulfate, low-arsenic groundwaters.",The possible global hazard of cell phone radiation on thyroid cells and hormones: a systematic review of evidences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062236,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"The aim of this review was to investigate the effects of possible harmful waves from either cell phone use or being within the range of the cell phone from 450 to 3800 MHz on the thyroid cells and hormones.

After screening titles and abstracts, 139 studies were excluded, and finally 22 studies (comprising 7182 cases) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Of the 22 included studies, 11 studies reported changes in T3 and T4 levels (six reported a decrease in T3 levels and one reported increase in it); moreover, five found decreased T4 levels and two studies an increased level. In other 10 studies, TSH alteration was reported. Of these, two studies reported a decrease in TSH level and one reported an increase in the hormone levels, while in the remaining studies non-significant changes were reported. Finally, seven studies examined histological changes in the thyroid gland follicles and showed that the volume of these cells was reduced. Based on the evidence discussed above, the reduction in diameter of thyroid follicles is potentially linked with cell phone radiation. Exposure may negatively influence the iodine uptake in the thyroid gland or increases temperature effect on the thyroid gland. However, further research are needed in order to show that the level of TSH and thyroid hormone suppression by microwave.","Relationships of Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorder symptom severities with probable attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, aggression and negative affect among university students.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062235,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,2019 05 07,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate relationships of Internet addiction (IA) and Internet gaming disorder (IGD) symptom severities with probable attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aggression among university students, while controlling the effects of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Among these students, 987 of them, who play video games, were included in the analyses related with IGD. Correlation analyses revealed that the severities of the scale scores were mildly correlated with each other both among students who regularly use the Internet and students who play video games. Probable ADHD was associated with the severity of IA symptoms, together with depression and aggression, particularly physical aggression and hostility, in ANCOVA analyses. Similarly probable ADHD was also associated with the severity of IGD symptoms, together with depression and aggression, particularly physical aggression, anger and hostility, in ANCOVA analyses. These findings suggest that the presence of probable ADHD is related with both severity of IA and IGD symptoms, together with aggression and depression.",CRH stimulation improves 18F-FDG-PET detection of pituitary adenomas in Cushing's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062234,Endocrine,2019 05 07,"In MRI-negative cases Cushing's disease (CD), surgeons perform a more extensive exploration of the pituitary gland, with fewer instances of hormonal remission. 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has a limited role in detecting adenomas that cause CD (corticotropinomas).

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between the hie-sho interview scores and female hormones, fat intake, Kupperman index in pre- (pre group) and post- (post group) menopausal women. The hie-sho interview scores, Kupperman index questionnaire results, dietary survey to analyze fat intake, and body weight were analyzed, and plasma estradiol, progesterone, and lipid levels were measured in the subjects in the pre (n = 9) and post (n = 11) groups. Plasma female hormones and fat intake were different, but the total Kupperman index was not different between pre and post groups. Plasma progesterone was positively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the post group. Plasma triglyceride was positively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the pre group. Intake of cholesterol, arachidonic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid was negatively correlated with the hie-sho score only in the pre group. The positive correlation between total Kupperman index and hie-sho score was observed only in the pre group.

Moreover, iron is one of the most important trace elements, and its deficiency can lead to various pathological conditions and stunted growth. In the current study, a combination of xylanase and iron nanoparticles is used to assess the overall effect on poultry growth. Endoxylanase enzyme was obtained from Aspergillus awamori SAIB-17 (identified on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis). The characterization of purified endoxylanase revealed that the Km and Vmax were 0.25 g/ml and 833.33 nkat/ml/s, respectively. Effect of pH and temperature showed that pH 4.5 and temperature 45 °C was best for enzyme activity. Iron nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation of ferric chloride and ferrous chloride. Characterization of nanoparticles using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and SEM revealed that the mean diameter of synthesized iron nanoparticles was around 50 nm. These nanoparticles have no inhibitory effect on endoxylanase up to concentration of 20 ppm. Iron oxide nanoparticles along with endoxylanase were used as additives in different concentrations and were fed to the groups of broiler chicks. It was observed that the group fed with 40 nkat of endoxylanase and 15 ppm of iron nanoparticles showed 54.5% (2010 ± 103.58) more weight gain by the fifth week as compared with the control group. The iron analysis in the muscles showed no increase in iron concentration while histopathology slides showed no morphological changes in liver cells. The combination of iron oxide nanoparticles and xylanase proved to have great potential to be used in poultry feed for large-scale meat production without any toxicological effects.","Clinical, biochemical, neuroradiological and molecular characterization of Egyptian patients with glutaric acidemia type 1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062211,Metabolic brain disease,2019 05 07,"Glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA1) is an inherited metabolic autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by a deficiency in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). Untreated patients suffer primarily from severe striatal damage. More than 250 variants in the GCDH gene have been reported with a variable frequency among different ethnic groups. In this study, we aimed to characterize 89 Egyptian patients with GA1 and identify the variants in the 41 patients who were available for genotyping. All of our patients demonstrated clinical, neuroradiological, and biochemical characteristics that are consistent with a diagnosis of GA1. All patients presented with variable degrees of developmental delay ranging from mild to severe. Most of the 89 patients presented with acute onset type (71.9%), followed by insidious (19%) and asymptomatic (9%). A delay in diagnosis was inversely associated with macrocephaly. The prevalence rate ratio (PR) for macrocephaly that was associated with each 6-month delay was 0.95 (95%CI 0.91-0.99). However, high body weight was associated with a higher likelihood of having macrocephaly (PR 1.16, 95%CI 1.06-1.26 per 1 SD increment of Z score weight). However, body weight was inversely associated with the morbidity score. Consanguinity level was 64% among our patient's cohort and was positively associated with the C5DC level (β (95%CI) 1.06 (0.12-1.99)). Forty-one patients were available for genotyping and were sequenced for the GCDH gene. We identified a total of 25 variants, of which the following six novel variants were identified: three missense variants, c.320G > T (p.Gly107Val), c.481C > T (p.Arg161Trp) and c.572 T > G (p.Met191Arg); two deletions, c.78delG (p.Ala27Argfs34) and c.1035delG (p.Gly346Alafs*11); and one indel, c.272_331del (p.Val91_Lys111delinsGlu). All of the novel variants were absent in the 300 normal chromosomes. The most common variant, c.*165A > G, was detected in 42 alleles, and the most commonly detected missense variant, c.1204C > T (p.Arg402Trp), was identified in 29 mutated alleles in 15/41 (34.2%) of patients. Our findings suggest that GA1 is not uncommon organic acidemia disease in Egypt; therefore, there is a need for supporting neonatal screening programs in Egypt.","Expression, Purification, and Polyethylene Glycol Site-Specific Modification of Recombinant Human Interleukin 24 in Escherichia coli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062210,The protein journal,2019 05 07,"Interleukin 24 (IL-24) has a broad spectrum of specific antitumor activities without affecting normal cells.

After induced by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), the target protein rhIL-24 was expressed as insoluble inclusion body, which was solubilized and denatured by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The denatured rhIL-24 was diluted to refold in the optimized buffer overnight at the protein concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The refolded rhIL-24 was mainly in the form of soluble aggregate, but high-purity monomer rhIL-24 was obtained through size exchange chromatography with the addition of SDS in elution buffer. The tertiary structure of rhIL-24 was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Western blot analysis showed that rhIL-24 could be site-specifically modified by mPEG5000-ALD. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay showed no significant difference between mPEG5000-ALD-rhIL-24 and rhIL-24 in inhibiting the growth of melanoma cell line A375 in vitro. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that PEG modification could significantly improve the stability and prolong the half-life of rhIL-24 from 8.41 to 13.2 h. The data strongly suggested that mPEG-ALD 5000 could site-specifically modify rhIL-24 expressed in E. coli. The PEG modification significantly prolonged the half-life of rhIL-24 without reducing its antitumor activity in vitro.",Psychosocial Functioning in Women with Early Breast Cancer Treated with Breast Surgery With or Without Immediate Breast Reconstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062209,Annals of surgical oncology,2019 05 07,"To compare psychosocial function outcomes in early breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy alone (MA), and mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) at 1 year after surgery.",Effect of Therapeutic Touch on Sleep Quality in Elders Living at Nursing Homes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062207,Journal of religion and health,2019 05 07,"This study was carried out to investigate the effect of therapeutic touch on sleep quality in the elderly people living in the nursing homes.

CCL18 promotes breast cancer invasiveness by binding to its cognate receptor PITPNM3 and activating the downstream signaling pathways. The high level of CCL18 in serum or tumor stroma is associated with tumor metastasis and poor patients overall survival. In this study, we identify an effective small molecular compound (SMC) to antagonize the effect of CCL18. We screen more than 1000 SMCs from Sun Yat-sen University SMC library and select 15 top scored SMCs by using computer-aided virtual screening based on the structure of CCL18. Then in vitro cell migration assay narrows down the selected 15 SMCs to the most effective SMC-21598. We find 10 µM SMC-21598 significantly inhibits CCL18-induced breast cancer cells adherence, invasiveness, and migration. Our further surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays reveal that SMC-21598 binds tightly to CCL18, which blocks the binding of CCL18 with its receptor PITPNM3. The in vivo animal experiments show that SMC-21598 doesn't significantly affect xenografts growth, but inhibits lung metastasis. Our study provides a potential lead compound to antagonize CCL18 function. It would be of great significance to develop SMC drugs to ameliorate breast cancer metastasis and prolong patients' survival.","Vitamin D supplementation after the second year of life: joint position of the Committee on Nutrition, German Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (DGKJ e.V.), and the German Society for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (DGKED e.V.).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062205,Molecular and cellular pediatrics,2019 06 10,"Low vitamin D serum concentrations have been associated with rickets and other disorders in observational studies.

A high-temperature adapted strain (HTAS) of the predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes was selected from its conventional strain (CS), via long-term heat acclimation and frequent heat hardenings in our previous studies. However, the environment of high temperature is usually associated with enhanced ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the present study, the physiological effects of UV-B radiation on survival rate and egg damage of N. barkeri were investigated, as well as the activities and expression profiles of antioxidant enzymes to UV-B radiation stress. UV-B radiation had deleterious effects on egg hatchability and survival of N. barkeri. Adults of the HTAS strain were less UV-B resistant than those of the CS strain; they also had lower levels of enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase against oxidative damage and weaker upregulation of SOD genes. The mRNA expression of three SOD genes of CS adult females immediately increased whereas that of HTAS showed almost no difference under UV-B stress for 1 h. The results showed the HTAS of N. barkeri had lower fitness under UV-B stress compared with the CS of N. barkeri. These results suggested that long-term heat acclimation may exert a profound impact on the developmental physiology of N. barkeri.",How Group-Based Interventions Can Improve Services for People with Severe Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062202,Current obesity reports,2019 05 07,"Rising demand for specialised ""Tier 3"" weight management services in England is exceeding capacity, leading many services to offer group-based care programmes.

The waylaying effect of pollinators is often studied at a single spatial scale; to date, little is known about the best spatial extent at which waylaying effect of pollinators can be measured. In this study, we selected a landscape with mass-flowering tufted vetches to determine the spatial scale of waylaying effect of honey bees as well as the consequence of waylaying effect on vetch pollination service. The spatial scale of waylaying effect was determined by the strongest association between honey bee density and distance, selected from a gradient of nested circular buffers centering on apiaries in three different locations. Linear models were used to predict the influence of flower visitor densities on pollination service. For our landscape, honey bee densities were best associated with distances at spatial scales of 500 m, 1150 m, and 1400 m respectively for the three locations of apiaries. Honey bee was the only pollinator whose density displayed a positive relationship with pollination service. At the scales of effect, honey bee density and pollination service declined along the distance. Our findings suggest that the waylaying effect of pollinators needs to be examined at a specific spatial scale and farmers who use honey bees to pollinate their mass-flowering crops need to consider the spatial scale of waylaying effect of pollinators in order to maximize pollination service within agricultural ecosystems.",Tick saliva and its role in pathogen transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062185,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2019 05 07,"Tick saliva is a complex mixture of peptidic and non-peptidic molecules that aid engorgement. The composition of tick saliva changes as feeding progresses and the tick counters the dynamic host response. Ixodid ticks such as Ixodes ricinus, the most important tick species in Europe, transmit numerous pathogens that cause debilitating diseases, e.g. Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Tick-borne pathogens are transmitted in tick saliva during blood feeding; however, saliva is not simply a medium enabling pathogen transfer. Instead, tick-borne pathogens exploit saliva-induced modulation of host responses to promote their transmission and infection, so-called saliva-assisted transmission (SAT). Characterization of the saliva factors that facilitate SAT is an active area of current research. Besides providing new insights into how tick-borne pathogens survive in nature, the research is opening new avenues for vaccine development.",High-Sensitivity and Long-Life Microchannel Plate Processed by Atomic Layer Deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062184,Nanoscale research letters,2019 06 10,"As a key component of electron multiplier device, a microchannel plate (MCP) can be applied in many scientific fields.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the morphology, element distribution, and structure of samples by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. Output current of different thickness of Al2O3 was studied and an optimal thickness was found. Experimental tests show that the average gain of ALD-MCP was nearly five times better than that of traditional MCP, and the ALD-MCP showed better sensitivity and longer lifetime.",Use of waste canola oil as a low-cost substrate for rhamnolipid production using Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062183,AMB Express,2019 06 10,"Rhamnolipids are glycolipid biosurfactants that are primarily produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have gained a great deal of interest for their numerous industrial applications and environmentally friendly properties. In this study, we explored the potential of waste canola oil as a low-cost and environmentally friendly substrate for the production of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa. Four different 23 full factorial designs were used to assess the effect of three independent factors on rhamnolipid production, including carbon source (canola oil and waste canola oil), nitrogen source [(NH4)2SO4 and NaNO3] and production time (7 and 14 days). The highest observed yield was 3585.31 ± 66.24 mg/L when P. aeruginosa was cultured for 14 days with 3% v/v waste canola oil and 4 g/L of NaNO3. The nitrogen source proved to be a crucial factor, as the use of NaNO3 rather than (NH4)2SO4 led to a 30-fold increase in production yield. The observed yield when waste canola oil was used was similar to, and even slightly higher than, that obtained using canola oil. Our results showed that waste canola oil has great potential for use as a carbon source for rhamnolipid production by P. aeruginosa, thus paving the way for the development of a low-cost, efficient, and environmentally friendly bioprocess for the production of rhamnolipids.",Pain in Cancer Survivors: How to Manage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062182,Current treatment options in oncology,2019 05 10,"Managing pain in cancer survivors requires that oncologists understand the common painful syndromes that can occur from treatment or disease. Assessment no longer singularly focuses on pain characteristics (e.g., intensity, quality, location), now incorporating a strong focus on functional impairment and potential improvement that might occur with adequate treatment. Improvement in function is now the goal used to measure success. In addition, assessment must incorporate risk factors that might predispose patients to substance use disorder so that interventions can be implemented to mitigate this risk. Universal precautions are measures that help assess and ensure adherence to the treatment plan and may include the use of agreements, urine toxicology, and review of dispensing information derived from state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). These are generally obtained annually for all individuals, although some states have instituted mandatory review of the PDMP whenever prescribing an opioid. For patients at moderate to high risk for misuse of opioids, where opioids are warranted for the treatment of their pain syndrome, universal precautions are instituted more frequently. Other measures may include prescribing a 1- to 2-week supply of medications if compulsive use leads the patient to running out of drug early, and in some cases, family members may be employed to dispense daily allotments of the medication. When opioids are no longer indicated, gradual tapering of the drug by approximately 10% per month is generally sufficient to prevent withdrawal symptoms and ensure patient acceptance.",Wearable haptic interfaces for applications in gynecologic robotic surgery: a proof of concept in robotic myomectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062181,Journal of robotic surgery,2019 05 07,"Uterine fibromatosis is common in women, with an estimated prevalence of up to 15-50% after 35 years. About 80% of women affected by fibromatosis have symptoms and require medical or surgical treatment. Nowadays, the gold standard for the surgical treatment of uterine fibromatosis is the use of minimally invasive surgery. The surgical skills and improvements offered by robotic approach can be relevant in reproductive surgery, in particular in minimally invasive myomectomy. However, the lack of tactile feedback of robotic platform is an important technical drawback that can reduce the accuracy of surgical procedures. Here, we present the design and the preliminary test of the wearable fabric, yielding display wearable haptic interfaces able to generate a real-time tactile feedback in terms of stiffness for applications in gynecologic robotic surgery. We preliminarily tested the device in the simulation of a real scenario of conservative myomectomy with the final purpose of increasing the accuracy and precision during surgery. The future goal is the integration of a haptic device with the commercially available robotic surgical systems with the purpose of improving the precision and accuracy of the surgical operation, thus allowing a better understanding concerning the anatomical relationship of the target structures. This in turn could determine a change in the surgical strategy in some cases, letting some patients selected for a demolitive approach retaining their uterus. This could improve surgical outcomes in fertile women enrolled for minimally invasive surgery for uterine fibroids and may be a facilitation for young gynecological surgeons or during residency teaching plans and learning programs.",Bismuth Subsalicylate Coagulopathy in a Patient with Chronic Liver Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062178,Journal of medical toxicology : official journal of the American College of Medical Toxicology,2019 05 07,"Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is the active ingredient in over-the-counter antacid and antidiarrheal medications.

Based primarily on internal body composition, the ecological stoichiometry theory (EST) offers a framework to generalize interspecific patterns of these responses, yet the predictions and underlying assumptions of EST remain poorly tested across many species. We used controlled laboratory feeding experiments to measure homeostasis, nutrient release, and growth across seven field-collected aquatic invertebrate detritivore taxa fed wide resource carbon:nitrogen (C:N) and carbon:phosphorus (C:P) gradients. We found that most invertebrates exhibited strict stoichiometric homeostasis (average 1/H = - 0.018 and 0.026 for C:N and C:P, respectively), supporting assumptions of EST. However, the stoichiometry of new tissue production during growth intervals (growth stoichiometry) deviated - 30 to + 54% and - 145 to + 74% from initial body C:N and C:P, respectively, and across species, growth stoichiometry was not correlated with initial body stoichiometry. Notably, smaller non- and hemimetabolous invertebrates exhibited low, decreasing growth C:N and C:P, whereas larger holometabolous invertebrates exhibited high, often increasing growth C:N and C:P. Despite predictions of EST, interspecific sensitivity of egestion stoichiometry and growth rates to the resource gradient were weakly related to internal body composition across species. While the sensitivity of these patterns differed across taxa, such differences carried a weak phylogenetic signal and were not well predicted by EST. Our findings suggest that traits beyond internal body composition, such as feeding behavior, selective assimilation, and ontogeny, are needed to generalize interspecific patterns in consumer growth and nutrient release across resource quality gradients.",Differential reproductive investment in co-occurring oviparous and viviparous common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) and implications for life-history trade-offs with viviparity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062164,Oecologia,2019 06 13,"Live-bearing reproduction (viviparity) has evolved from egg-laying (oviparity) independently many times and most abundantly in squamate reptiles. Studying life-history trade-offs between the two reproductive modes is an inherently difficult task, as most transitions to viviparity are evolutionarily old and/or are confounded by environmental effects. The common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) is one of very few known reproductively bimodal species, in which some populations are oviparous and others viviparous. Oviparous and viviparous populations can occur in sympatry in the same environment, making this a unique system for investigating alternative life-history trade-offs between oviparous and viviparous reproduction. We find that viviparous females exhibit larger body size, smaller clutch sizes, a larger reproductive investment, and a higher hatching success rate than oviparous females. We find that offspring size and weight from viviparous females was lower compared to offspring from oviparous females, which may reflect space constraints during pregnancy. We suggest that viviparity in common lizards is associated with increased reproductive burden for viviparous females and speculate that this promoted the evolution of larger body size to create more physical space for developing embryos. In the context of life-history trade-offs in the evolution of viviparity, we suggest that the extent of correlation between reproductive traits, or differences between reproductive modes, may also depend on the time since the transition occurred.",Digestive mutualism in a pitcher plant supports the monotonic rather than hump-shaped stress-gradient hypothesis model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062163,Oecologia,2019 05 07,"The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the strength and frequency of facilitative interactions increase monotonically with increasing environmental stress, but some empirical studies have found this decrease at extreme stress levels, suggesting a hump-shaped SGH instead. However, empirical studies of the SGH are often hindered by confounding resource and non-resource stress gradients. Nepenthes pitcher plants trap animal prey using modified-leaf pitfall traps which are also inhabited by organisms known as inquilines. Inquilines may assist pitchers in the digestion of trapped prey. This interaction is known as a digestive mutualism and is both mutualistic and facilitative by definition. Inquiline species may also facilitate each other via processing chain commensalisms. We used in vitro experiments to examine the isolated effect of resource stress on the outcomes of two facilitative interactions: (i) digestive mutualism-facilitation of pitcher nutrient sequestration by two inquiline dipteran larvae, culicids and phorids; (ii) processing chain commensalism-facilitation between these two inquiline taxa. The net nutritional benefit of phorids on N. gracilis was found to conform more to a monotonic rather than hump-shaped SGH model. However, the effect of culicids on N. gracilis and the effects of culicids and phorids on each other were weak. These findings provide compelling evidence that changes in facilitation along an isolated resource stress gradient conform to the predictions of the monotonic SGH model rather than that of the revised hump-shaped model, and highlight the importance of isolating stress gradients in empirical tests of the SGH.",Induction chemotherapy plus IMRT alone versus induction chemotherapy plus IMRT-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062162,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2019 06 16,"To evaluate the value of concurrent chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), we performed this retrospective cohort study to compare the efficiency and toxicities of induction chemotherapy plus IMRT alone (IC + RT) versus induction chemotherapy plus IMRT-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IC + CCRT).",Diffusion weighted imaging evidence of extra-callosal pathways for interhemispheric communication after complete commissurotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062161,Brain structure & function,2019 06 15,"The integrity of white matter architecture in the human brain is related to cognitive processing abilities. The corpus callosum is the largest white matter bundle interconnecting the two cerebral hemispheres. ""Split-brain"" patients in whom all cortical commissures have been severed to alleviate intractable epilepsy demonstrate remarkably intact cognitive abilities despite the lack of this important interhemispheric pathway. While it has often been speculated that there are compensatory alterations in the remaining interhemispheric fibers in split-brain patients several years post-commissurotomy, this has never been directly shown. Here we examined extra-callosal pathways for interhemispheric communication in the brain of a patient who underwent complete cerebral commissurotomy using diffusion weighted imaging tractography. We found that compared with a healthy age-matched comparison group, the split-brain patient exhibited increased fractional anisotropy (FA) of the dorsal and ventral pontine decussations of the cortico-cerebellar interhemispheric pathways. Few differences were observed between the patient and the comparison group with respect to FA of other long-range intrahemispheric fibers. These results point to specific cerebellar anatomical substrates that may account for the spared interhemispheric coordination and intact cognitive abilities that have been extensively documented in this unique patient.",The ethylene receptor regulates Typha angustifolia leaf aerenchyma morphogenesis and cell fate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062160,Planta,2019 06 13,"Ethylene receptor is crucial for PCD and aerenchyma formation in Typha angustifolia leaves. Not only does it receive and deliver the ethylene signal, but it probably can determine the cell fate during aerenchyma morphogenesis, which is due to the receptor expression quantity. Aquatic plant oxygen delivery relies on aerenchyma, which is formed by a programmed cell death (PCD) procedure. However, cells in the outer edge of the aerenchyma (palisade cells and septum cells) remain intact, and the mechanism is unclear. Here, we offer a hypothesis: cells that have a higher content of ethylene receptors do not undergo PCD. In this study, we investigated the leaf aerenchyma of the aquatic plant Typha angustifolia. Ethephon and pyrazinamide (PZA, an inhibitor of ACC oxidase) were used to confirm that ethylene is an essential hormone for PCD of leaf aerenchyma cells in T. angustifolia. That the ethylene receptor was an indispensable factor in this PCD was confirmed by 1-MCP (an inhibitor of the ethylene receptor) treatment. Although PCD can be avoided by blocking the ethylene receptor, excessive ethylene receptors also protect cells from PCD. TaETR1, TaETR2 and TaEIN4 in the T. angustifolia leaf were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) using polyclonal antibodies. The result showed that the content of ethylene receptors in PCD-unsusceptible cells was 4-14 times higher than that one in PCD-susceptible cells, suggesting that PCD-susceptible cells undergo the PCD programme, while PCD-unsusceptible cells do not due to the content difference in the ethylene receptor in different cells. A higher level of ethylene receptor content makes the cells insensitive to ethylene, thereby avoiding cell death and degradation.",The role of body mass index in determining clinical and quality of life outcomes after laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062159,Surgical endoscopy,2019 05 07,"Current literature is conflicted regarding the efficacy of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) among obese patients complaining of pathologic reflux or otherwise symptomatic hiatal hernias.

Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched to retrieve studies on the efficacy and safety of DOACs versus LMWH in treating patients with cancer from January 1980 to October 2018. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding. Our study included two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nine observational studies, together comprising 4509 patients with cancer. The pooled estimates indicated that DOACs led to a modest reduction recurrent VTE in the RCTs [RR: 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.96, P = 0.03] and in the observational studies (RR: 0.74, 95% CI, 0.58-0.93, P = 0.011), without increasing the risk of major bleeding for observational studies (P = 0.805), but increased for RCTs (P = 0.017). The same trends were observed in the rivaroxaban subgroup. Moreover, subgroup analyses according to the treatment duration indicated that DOACs significantly reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE (P = 0.006 at 6 months; P < 0.001 at 12 months) without significant differences in major bleeding compared with LMWH at 6 or 12 months. Patients with cancer who received DOACs exhibited a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with no increased risk of major bleeding compared with LMWH. DOACs may be an alternative choice for long-term anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer.","New porphyrins: synthesis, characterization, and computational studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062142,Molecular diversity,2019 05 07,"New trans-A2B2-porphyrins substituted at phenyl positions were synthesized from 4-methylphthalic acid as a starting material through sequential multistep reactions.

We assessed the usefulness of ESP through our clinical experience. All GAFs were successfully managed by ESP procedures. After the procedure, the stent positioning and expansion were appropriately evaluated by radiological assessments over time. The stent was removed after endoscopic confirmation of fistula closure on days 8, 23, and 71. Only one patient with a long-term indwelling stent developed a manageable secondary gastrobronchial fistula as a procedure-related complication.

We aimed to analyze the association of maternal nut intake during pregnancy with child neuropsychological outcomes. We included 2208 mother-child pairs from a population-based birth cohort in four regions of Spain. The follow up settings were during pregnancy (first and third trimesters), birth, 1.5, 5 and 8 years. Neuropsychological examinations were based on Bayley Scales of Infant Development (1.5 years), McCarthy scales of Children's Abilities (5 year), Attention Network Test (ANT, 8 year) and N-Back test (8 year). Nut intake in pregnancy was reported through a validated food frequency questionnaire during the first and the third trimester. Multivariable regressions analyzed associations after controlling for priori selected confounders notably maternal education, social class, body mass index, energy intake, fish intake, omega-3 supplements, alcohol consumption and smoking habits during pregnancy. Children within the highest tertile of maternal nut consumption during first pregnancy trimester (> 32 g/week) had a decrease of 13.82 ms [95% confidence interval (CI) - 23.40, - 4.23] in the ANT-hit reaction time standard error, compared to the first tertile (median 0 g/w). A similar protective association pattern was observed with the other cognitive scores at the different child ages. After correcting for multiple testing using Bonferroni familywise error rate (FWER), Hochberg FWER and Simes false discovery rate, ANT-hit reaction time standard error remained significant. Final model estimates by inverse probability weighting did not change results. Third pregnancy trimester nut intake showed weaker associations. These data indicate that nut intake during early pregnancy is associated with long-term child neuropsychological development. Future cohort studies and randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm this association pattern in order to further extend nutrition guidelines among pregnant women.",Is systolic blood pressure high in patients with acute aortic dissection on first medical contact before hospital transfer?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062118,Heart and vessels,2019 05 07,"Acute aortic dissection (AAD) cases are thought to have high blood pressure (BP) on admission; however, little data are available on BP prior to admission. The purpose of this study was to investigate systolic blood pressure (SBP) very early after symptom onset and before hospital transfer in patients with AAD to determine whether SBPs were high, and also whether SBPs were higher or lower compared with SBPs at hospital admission. We obtained results using three-year data derived from the Tokyo Acute Aortic Super Network Database. First, we selected 830 patients with AAD for which the ""duration from symptom onset to first medical contact by ambulance crews"" (SO-FMC) was within 60 min. We examined the SBPs of such patients. Next, we selected 222 patients with AAD whose SBPs were measured both at FMC, within 15 min after symptom onset, and at hospital admission, and compared SBPs at FMC with those at hospital admission. Among types A (n = 190) and B (n = 117), in patients with an SO-FMC ≤ 15 min, the median SBP was 100 mmHg and 178 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively; 9% and 50% (p < 0.001) of such patients, respectively, exhibited an SBP ≥ 180 mmHg; and 43% and 10% (p < 0.001) of such patients, respectively, had an SBP < 90 mmHg. Of patients with types A (n = 124) and B (n = 98) AAD whose SBPs were measured both at FMC, within 15 min after symptom onset, and at hospital admission, SBPs at FMC were higher than those at hospital admission for the SBP ≥ 180 mmHg subgroups of both type A (194 mmHg vs. 159 mmHg, p < 0.001) and type B (199 mmHg vs. 186 mmHg, p < 0.001). Approximately 10 min after symptom onset and before hospital transfer, the measured SBPs of many patients with type A AAD were not necessarily high. However, the SBPs of cases with type B AAD were high as previously reported for SBP on admission. In addition, for the subgroup of SBP ≥ 180 mmHg at FMC within 15 min after symptom onset, SBPs at FMC were significantly higher than those at hospital admission for both types A and B; the higher SBP at symptom onset may have been partially associated with being a trigger of AD.",Habitual coffee intake reduces all-cause mortality by decreasing heart rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062117,Heart and vessels,2019 05 07,"It is well known that subjects with metabolic syndrome show an elevated resting heart rate. We previously reported that elevated heart rate was significantly related to all-cause mortality, and that coffee consumption was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that higher coffee consumption may decrease all-cause mortality by reducing resting heart rate. We performed a longitudinal epidemiological study in Tanushimaru (a cohort of the Seven Countries Study). A total of 1920 residents aged over 40 years received health checkups in 1999. We measured components of metabolic syndrome, and eating and drinking patterns were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. We followed up the participants annually for 15 years. During the follow-up period, 343 of the participants died. Of these, 102 subjects died of cancer, 48 of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases, and 44 of infectious diseases. Multivariate analyses revealed that higher coffee consumption was inversely associated with resting heart rate. Kaplan-Meier curves found lower mortality rates in the higher coffee consumption groups. In the lower coffee consumption groups, elevated hazard ratios of all-cause death were observed in the increased heart rate quintiles, whereas heart rate was not associated with all-cause death in the higher coffee consumption groups. These significant associations remained after further adjustment for confounders. This prospective study suggests that higher coffee consumption may have a protective effect against all-cause death due to reducing resting heart rate.",Improving an Escherichia coli-based biocatalyst for terpenol glycosylation by variation of the expression system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062116,Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,2019 05 07,"Glycosides are becoming increasingly more relevant for various industries as low-cost whole-cell-biocatalysts are now available for the manufacture of glycosides.

Three hundred seven patients (199 without any fractures of the spine, and 108 patients with at least one fracture of the L1, L2, L3, or L4 vertebral bodies) who had DEXA studies were evaluated. Ancillary data from DEXA output was analyzed. The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. Support vector machines (SVMs) with 10-fold cross-validation and different kernels were used to identify the best kernel based on the greatest area under the curve (AUC) and the best training vectors in the training dataset. The SVM with the best kernel was then applied to the test dataset to assess the accuracy of the SVM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the SVMs using different kernels in the test dataset were compared using DeLong's test. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel had the greatest AUC in the training dataset (AUC = 0.9258). The AUC of the SVM classifier with the linear kernel in the test dataset was 0.8963. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel had an overall average accuracy of 91.8% in the test dataset. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive of the SVM classifier with the linear kernel to detect lumbar spine fractures were 81.8%, 97.4%, 94.7%, and 90.5%, respectively. The SVM classifier with the linear kernel ROC curve had a significantly better AUC than the SVM classifier with the cubic polynomial kernel (P = 0.034) for discriminating between patients with lumbar spine fractures and control patients, but not significantly different from the SVM classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel (P = 0.317) or the SVM classifier with a sigmoid kernel (P = 0.729). All fractures identified by the SVM classifiers were not prospectively identified by the radiologist. SVM analysis of ancillary data obtained from routine DEXA studies can identify lumbar spine fractures without the use of vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) DEXA imaging or radiation, and identify fractures missed by radiologists.",Lung Nodule Detection in CT Images Using a Raw Patch-Based Convolutional Neural Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062113,Journal of digital imaging,2019 05 07,"Remarkable progress has been made in image classification and segmentation, due to the recent study of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To solve the similar problem of diagnostic lung nodule detection in low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans, we propose a new Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system using CNNs and CT image segmentation techniques. Unlike former studies focusing on the classification of malignant nodule types or relying on prior image processing, in this work, we put raw CT image patches directly in CNNs to reduce the complexity of the system. Specifically, we split each CT image into several patches, which are divided into 6 types consisting of 3 nodule types and 3 non-nodule types. We compare the performance of ResNet with different CNNs architectures on CT images from a publicly available dataset named the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI). Results show that our best model reaches a high detection sensitivity of 92.8% with 8 false positives per scan (FPs/scan). Compared with related work, our work obtains a state-of-the-art effect."

It relies on the use of (a) an invasive reaction that is catalyzed by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1), and (b) graphene oxide (GO)-based fluorescence signalling. The presence of target DNA mediates the formation of the invasive structure, and this induces FEN 1 to catalyze multiple cycles of cleavage reaction at the junction, thereby liberating numerous fluorophore-labeled flaps. The released flaps are intentionally designed too short to be adsorbed onto GO. Hence, intense green fluorescence whose maximum emission is observed at 520 nm after excitation at 480 nm is restored even in the presence of GO. The method can be applied to the determination of target DNA from Chlamydia trachomatis, one of the major pathogenic bacteria causing sexually transmitted diseases. The assay is sensitive and specific with the limit of detection of 6.7 pM, and was applied to reliable determination of Chlamydia trachomatis DNA in human serum.

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the accuracy of near-infrared spectroscopy to estimate cerebral oxygenation in HD patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Our hypothesis was that rSO2 values would underestimate cerebral oxygenation in HD patients. This study included 113 patients (7 HD patients and 106 non-HD ones) undergoing cardiac or major aortic surgery between December 2015 and November 2017. We evaluated the validity of rSO2 by comparing it with ipsilateral jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2). In HD and non-HD patients, rSO2 and SjvO2 showed a weak correlation (R2: 0.46 and 0.28 in HD and non-HD patients, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis revealed that bias (95% limits of agreement) of rSO2 compared to SjvO2 was - 19.2% ( - 41.7-3.3%) in HD patients and - 1.9% (- 19.3-15.5%) in non-HD ones. The large negative bias suggests that the rSO2 values measured using near-infrared spectroscopy substantially underestimate cerebral oxygenation in HD patients.","Score of the preoperative absolute number of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils as a prognostic indicator for patients with gastric cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062094,Surgery today,2019 05 07,"The association between the preoperative absolute neutrophil count (NC), lymphocyte count (LC), and monocyte count (MC) in the peripheral blood and the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients has not been investigated widely.",Parotid salivary duct carcinoma: a single institution's 20-year experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062093,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019 05 07,The aim of the study was to assess the treatment results of the parotid gland salivary duct carcinoma (SDC).,Standardization of laparoscopic extrafascial hysterectomy: anatomic considerations to protect the ureter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062091,Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,2019 05 07,To describe the procedure of laparoscopic extrafascial hysterectomy to avoid ureter injury.,Increasing the dose of oral vitamin K prophylaxis and its effect on bleeding risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062090,European journal of pediatrics,2019 06 14,"Vitamin K prophylaxis in infancy aims to prevent life-threatening vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). The Dutch prophylactic oral daily regimen was increased sixfold from 25 to 150 μg because of a high failure rate. To evaluate the efficacy of this new regimen, incidences of intracranial VKDB under both regimens were compared using both general and targeted surveillance. Late VKDB in the general pediatric population was identified by the Netherlands Pediatric Surveillance Unit, between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2016. Additionally, infants with intracranial vitamin K deficiency bleeding were identified using the Dutch Pediatric Intensive Care Evaluation registry. The incidence of intracranial VKDB as assessed by general and targeted surveillance decreased from 1.6 per 100,000 (95% CI, 0.4-5.1) to 1.3 per 100,000 (95% CI, 0.5-3.2) and from 3.1 per 100,000 live births (95% CI, 1.9-5.0) to 1.2 per 100,000 live births (95% CI, 0.6-2.3), respectively. Median time between consecutive cases in the latter increased from 24 to 154 days (p < 0.001).Conclusion: A sixfold increase in oral vitamin K prophylaxis was associated with a surprisingly modest reduction in the incidence of intracranial VKDB, indicating that factors other than the dose need addressing to improve efficacy. What is Known: • The efficacy of intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis is threatened by an increasing number of parents opting out. • Oral prophylaxis represents an attractive and less invasive alternative but is inferior, especially in infants with malabsorption of vitamin K due to cholestasis. What is New: • Increasing the daily oral dose of vitamin K sixfold had a surprisingly modest effect on the incidence of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding. • This finding indicates that factors other than the dose must play an important role."

Female gender, older age at onset, good premorbid adjustment, abrupt onset, shifting polymorphic symptomatology and absence of schizophrenic features have been found to be predictive factors of diagnostic stability in ATPDs. Nevertheless, most of these findings need to be replicated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic stability of patients with ATPD, and to determine whether previously accepted predictors of diagnostic stability for ATPD could be externally validated in our cohort. To that end, a prospective 2-year observational study was conducted on patients with first-episode ATPD. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine factors associated with ATPD diagnostic stability at the end of the follow-up period. The following prior knowledge variables were analyzed: female gender, older age at onset, good premorbid adjustment, abrupt onset, shifting polymorphic symptomatology and absence of schizophrenic features. Sixty-eight patients with first-episode ATPD completed the follow-up, of whom 55.9% (n = 38) retained their diagnosis of ATPD at the end of the study. Multivariate analysis revealed that diagnostic stability was independently significantly associated with the presence of shifting polymorphic symptomatology (OR = 7.42, 95% CI 1.65-33.30; p = 0.009) and the absence of schizophrenic features (OR = 6.37, 95% CI 1.47-27.54; p = 0.013) at the onset of the psychotic disorder. Our findings provide empirical support for the ICD-11 proposal restricting the new ATPD category to the acute polymorphic disorder without schizophrenia symptoms.","A single-center, open-label study investigating the excretion balance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled idasanutlin and an intravenous tracer dose of [13C]-labeled idasanutlin in a single cohort of patients with solid tumors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062077,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,2019 06 13,"Idasanutlin, a selective small-molecule MDM2 antagonist in phase 3 testing for refractory/relapsed AML, is a non-genotoxic p53 activator with oral administration.

The mechanisms behind this long-known phenomenon remained elusive so far, precluding a targeted therapeutic intervention. This study demonstrates that the prevalent activation of AKT in gliomas increases the ER protein-folding capacity and enables tumor cells to utilize a side effect of RhoA activation: the perturbation of the IRE1α-mediated decay of SPARC mRNA. Once translation is initiated, glioblastoma cells rapidly secrete SPARC to block Nogo-A from inhibiting migration via RhoA. By advanced ultramicroscopy for studying single-cell invasion in whole, undissected mouse brains, we show that gliomas require SPARC for invading into white matter structures. SPARC depletion reduces tumor dissemination that significantly prolongs survival and improves response to cytostatic therapy.

The method is demonstrated with US influenza data from the 2004-2005 through 2016-2017 influenza seasons. The transmission rate and noise intensity stochastically work together to generate the yearly peaks in infections. The local lagged adapted generalized method of moments is tested for forecasting ability. Forecasts are made for the 2016-2017 influenza season and for infection data in year 2017. The forecast method qualitatively matches a single influenza season.

However, it may be difficult to recognize this syndrome in the absence of all three characteristic clinical manifestations. A 3-year-old girl presented with early onset symmetric polyarthritis and developed granulomatous uveitis at 13 years of age. However, Blau syndrome was suspected at 21 years of age when she was diagnosed to have disseminated granulomas in liver and kidneys. Diagnosis of Blau syndrome was confirmed by finding a mutation in NOD2 gene (p.Arg334Gln; FP2678). She was initiated on adalimumab therapy and she showed good response to this treatment. We did a literature search to find out all reported cases of Blau syndrome with disseminated granulomatous inflammation and all cases of Blau syndrome that were treated with adalimumab therapy. Seventeen patients with Blau syndrome have been reported to have granulomas at unusual locations (liver; kidneys; lungs; salivary glands; intestine; and lymph nodes). Adalimumab has been reported to be used in 33 patients with Blau syndrome. The indication to initiate adalimumab in large majority of these patients was persistence of uveitis. A possibility of Blau syndrome should be considered in all children presenting with early onset arthritis (especially with the presence of boggy swelling) and granulomatous uveitis. Granulomas in the liver and kidney are uncommon disease manifestations.

The Bacteroidetes comprise a dominant phylum in the human gut microbiota whose members thrive on dietary and endogenous glycans by employing a diversity of highly specific, multi-gene polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL), which encode a variety of carbohydrases, transporters, and sensor/regulators. PULs invariably also encode surface glycan-binding proteins (SGBPs) that play a central role in saccharide capture at the outer membrane. Here, we present combined biophysical, structural, and in vivo characterization of the two SGBPs encoded by the Bacteroides ovatus mixed-linkage β-glucan utilization locus (MLGUL), thereby elucidating their key roles in the metabolism of this ubiquitous dietary cereal polysaccharide. In particular, molecular insight gained through several crystallographic complexes of SGBP-A and SGBP-B with oligosaccharides reveals that unique shape complementarity of binding platforms underpins specificity for the kinked MLG backbone vis-à-vis linear β-glucans. Reverse-genetic analysis revealed that both the presence and binding ability of the SusD homolog BoSGBPMLG-A are essential for growth on MLG, whereas the divergent, multi-domain BoSGBPMLG-B is dispensable but may assist in oligosaccharide scavenging from the environment. The synthesis of these data illuminates the critical role SGBPs play in concert with other MLGUL components, reveals new structure-function relationships among SGBPs, and provides fundamental knowledge to inform future (meta)genomic, biochemical, and microbiological analyses of the human gut microbiota.",Autophagy in hypoxic ovary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062072,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 07,"Oxygen deprivation affects human health by modulating system as well as cellular physiology. Hypoxia generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), causes oxidative stress and affects female reproductive health by altering ovarian as well as oocyte physiology in mammals. Hypoxic conditions lead to several degenerative changes by inducing various cell death pathways like autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis in the follicle of mammalian ovary. The encircling somatic cell death interrupts supply of nutrients to the oocyte and nutrient deprivation may result in the generation of ROS. Increased level of ROS could induce granulosa cells as well as oocyte autophagy. Although autophagy removes damaged proteins and subcellular organelles to maintain the cell survival, irreparable damages could induce cell death within intra-follicular microenvironment. Hypoxia-induced autophagy is operated through 5' AMP activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response and protein kinase C delta-c-junN terminal kinase 1 pathways in a wide variety of somatic cell types. Similar to somatic cells, we propose that hypoxia may induce granulosa cell as well as oocyte autophagy and it could be responsible at least in part for germ cell elimination from mammalian ovary. Hypoxia-mediated germ cell depletion may cause several reproductive impairments including early menopause in mammals.",Saturation of acyl chains converts cardiolipin from an antagonist to an activator of Toll-like receptor-4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062071,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 07,"Cardiolipins (CLs) are tetra-acylated diphosphatidylglycerols found in bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. In healthy mammals, CLs are unsaturated, whereas saturated CLs are found in blood cells from Barth syndrome patients and in some Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that unsaturated but not saturated CLs block LPS-induced NF-κB activation, TNF-α and IP-10 secretion in human and murine macrophages, as well as LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β release in human blood mononuclear cells. Using HEK293 cells transfected with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptor Myeloid Differentiation 2 (MD2), we demonstrate that unsaturated CLs compete with LPS for binding TLR4/MD2 preventing its activation, whereas saturated CLs are TLR4/MD2 agonists. As a consequence, saturated CLs induce a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages characterized by TNF-α and IP-10 secretion, and activate the alternative NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in human blood-derived monocytes. Thus, we identify that double bonds discriminate between anti- and pro-inflammatory properties of tetra-acylated molecules, providing a rationale for the development of TLR4 activators and inhibitors for use as vaccine adjuvants or in the treatment of TLR4-related diseases.",Effect of mechanical percussion combined with patient position change on the elimination of upper urinary stones/fragments: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062070,Urolithiasis,2019 05 07,"The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of mechanical percussion combined with changed patient position (MPPP) on elimination of residual stones/fragments in the upper urinary tract.

The determination of S. Paratyphi B variants requires a time-consuming process and complex biochemical tests. Therefore, a quadruplex real-time PCR method, based on the allelic discrimination of molecular markers selected from the scientific literature and from whole genome sequencing data produced in-house, was developed in this study, to be applied to Salmonella isolates. This method was validated with the analysis of 178 S.

There are several major types of functional lncRNAs which participate in some important cellular pathways. LncRNA-RNA interaction controls mRNA translation and degradation or serves as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge for silencing. LncRNA-protein interaction regulates protein activity in transcriptional activation and silencing. LncRNA guide, decoy, and scaffold regulate transcription regulators of enhancer or repressor region of the coding genes for alteration of expression. LncRNA plays a role in cellular responses including the following activities: regulation of chromatin structural modification and gene expression for epigenetic and cell function control, promotion of hematopoiesis and maturation of immunity, cell programming in stem cell and somatic cell development, modulation of pathogen infection, switching glycolysis and lipid metabolism, and initiation of autoimmune diseases. LncRNA, together with miRNA, are considered the critical elements in cancer development. It has been demonstrated that tumorigenesis could be driven by homeostatic imbalance of lncRNA/miRNA/cancer regulatory factors resulting in biochemical and physiological alterations inside the cells. Cancer-driven lncRNAs with other cellular RNAs, epigenetic modulators, or protein effectors may change gene expression level and affect the viability, immortality, and motility of the cells that facilitate cancer cell cycle rearrangement, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. Molecular medicine will be the future trend for development. LncRNA/miRNA could be one of the potential candidates in this category.

It is defined as cryptogenic ischemic stroke after the exclusion of a lacunar infarct, a significant (≥50%) stenosis of extracranial or intracranial arteries and a cardiac source of embolism. Initially, there was hope that these patients would benefit from anticoagulation. This was based on the suspicion that imaging criteria of stroke mimic features of embolism from cardiac sources or the great arteries. In two large randomized trials with 12,600 patients neither rivaroxaban nor dabigatran could reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Based on these results, current research is focused on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as a potential cause of stroke in these patients. Several randomized trials could show that by prolongation of monitoring to 30 days atrial fibrillation can be detected in approximately 10% of the patients. Using continuous monitoring (e. g. by implantable loop recorders) atrial fibrillation can even be detected in one quarter of the patients. Not all stroke patients can receive such an intensive monitoring. Therefore, this article summarizes the evidence and presents the resulting recommendations for patient selection and staged rhythm diagnostics and discusses a recently presented algorithm of an expert group for use in daily clinical practice.","A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of ulimorelin and metoclopramide in the treatment of critically ill patients with enteral feeding intolerance: PROMOTE trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062046,Intensive care medicine,2019 05 10,"Enteral feeding intolerance (EFI) is a frequent problem in the intensive care unit (ICU), but current prokinetic agents have uncertain efficacy and safety profiles.

Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 05 07,"Mainly additive gene action governed inheritance of haploid male fertility, although epistatic effects were also significant. Recurrent selection for haploid male fertility resulted in substantial improvement in this trait. The doubled haploid (DH) technology offers several advantages in maize breeding compared to the traditional method of recurrent selfing. However, there is still great potential for improving the success rate of DH production. Currently, the majority of haploid plants are infertile after chromosome doubling treatment by antimitotic agents such as colchicine and cannot be selfed for production of DH lines. Improvement in haploid male fertility (HMF) by selection for a higher spontaneous chromosome doubling rate (SDR) has the potential to increase DH production efficiency. To investigate the gene action governing SDR in two breeding populations, we adapted the quantitative-genetic model of Eberhart and Gardner (in Biometrics 22:864-881. https://doi.org/10.2307/2528079 , 1966) for the case of haploid progeny from ten DH lines and corresponding diallel crosses. Furthermore, we carried out three cycles of recurrent selection for SDR in two additional populations to evaluate the selection gain for this trait. Additive genetic effects predominated in both diallel crosses, but epistatic effects were also significant. Entry-mean heritability of SDR observed for haploid progeny of these populations exceeded 0.91, but the single-plant heritability relevant to selection was low, ranging from 0.11 to 0.19. Recurrent selection increased SDR from approximately 5-50%, which suggests the presence of few QTL with large effects. This improvement in HMF is greater than the effect of standard colchicine treatment, which yields at maximum 30% fertile haploids. Altogether, the results show the great potential of spontaneous chromosome doubling to streamline development DH lines and to enable new breeding schemes with more efficient allocation of resources.",The knotless cinch-bridge technique for delaminated rotator cuff tears leads to a high healing rate and a more favorable short-term clinical outcome than suture-bridge repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062044,"Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",2019 05 07,To compare functional outcomes and magnetic resonance image (MRI) tendon integrity following either the suture bridge or the knotless cinch-bridge technique used for arthroscopic double-layer rotator cuff repair.,"Despite patient-reported outcomes improve, patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome do not increase their objectively measured sport and physical activity level 1 year after hip arthroscopic surgery.

With the development of the tools of synthetic biology, more progress has been made toward this goal in the last 5 years than in the previous five decades. Most of the effort has focused on nitrogenase genes from Klebsiella oxytoca, which has complex gene regulation. There may be advantages in using nitrogenase genes from cyanobacteria, which comprise large polycistronic gene clusters that may be easier to manipulate and eventually express in a plant. The fact that some diatoms have a cyanobacterial nitrogen fixing organelle further supports the idea that a cyanobacterial nitrogenase gene cluster may function in a newly-engineered, cyanobacterial-based plant organelle, a nitroplast. This review describes recent attempts to express the nif genes from Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Leptolyngbya boryana dg5 and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 in heterologous cyanobacteria in the context of the organization of the nitrogenase genes and their regulation by the transcription factor CnfR via its highly conserved binding sites.",Cloning and analysis of Ophiocordyceps xuefengensis mating type (MAT) loci.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062026,FEMS microbiology letters,2019 05 07,"The entomopathogenic fungus Ophiocordyceps xuefengensis, a recently described species and identified as the sister taxon of Ophiocordyceps sinensis, is a desirable alternative to O. sinensis. The mating systems of fungi play a vitally important role in the regulation of sexual reproduction and evolution, but the mating type loci of O. xuefengensis were completely unknown. In this study, the mating systems of O. xuefengensis were analyzed. The conserved α-box region of the MAT1-1-1 and HMG-box of MAT1-2-1 were successfully obtained by PCR amplification. The distribution of both mating types in different tissues of wild and cultivated O. xuefengensis growth was detected and analyzed. The results showed that the asci always harbored both mating types, whereas the sclerotium, the stipe and each isolated strain of wild O. xuefengensis always had only one idiomorph, either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2, which confirmed that O. xuefengensis is heterothallic. The MAT1-1 locus of O. xuefengensis harbors MAT1-1-1, MAT1-1-2 and MAT1-1-3, and MAT1-2 contains the MAT1-2-1 gene. Southern blot analysis showed the MAT-1-1-1 and MAT-1-2-1 genes were single-copy in O. xuefengensis. These results will help to understand its life cycle and support artificial cultivation of O. xuefengensis.",Aspergillus niger citrate exporter revealed by comparison of two alternative citrate producing conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062025,FEMS microbiology letters,2019 05 15,"Currently, there is no consensus regarding the mechanism underlying Aspergillus niger citrate biosynthesis and secretion. We hypothesise that depending on the experimental setup, extracellular citrate accumulation can have fundamentally different underlying transcriptomic landscapes. We show that varying the amount and type of supplement of an arginine auxotrophic A. niger strain results in transcriptional down-regulation of citrate metabolising enzymes in the condition in which more citrate is accumulated extracellularly. This contrasts with the transcriptional adaptations when increased citrate production is triggered by iron limitation. By combining gene expression data obtained from these two very distinct experimental setups with hidden Markov models and transporter homology approaches, we were able to compile a shortlist of the most likely citrate transporter candidates. Two candidates (An17g01710 and An09g06720m.01) were heterologously expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and one of the resultant mutants showed the ability to secrete citrate. Our findings provide steps in untangling the complex interplay of different mechanisms underlying A. niger citrate accumulation, and we demonstrate how a comparative transcriptomics approach complemented with further bioinformatics analyses can be used to pinpoint a fungal citrate exporter.",Biochemical insights into the recombinant 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-β-O-acetyltransferase enzyme from the Taxol-producing endophytic fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062024,FEMS microbiology letters,2019 05 07,"10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-β-O-acetyltransferase (DBAT) is a key rate-limiting enzyme of the Taxol biosynthetic pathway, which is uncharacterized in Taxol-producing endophytic fungi. Here, an open reading frame of DBAT was cloned from the Taxol-producing endophytic fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae (LtDBAT). The LtDBAT enzyme was heterologously expressed and purified by the affinity and gel filtration chromatography methods. The molecular weight of the purified protein was 49 kDa and its identity was confirmed by western blot. The purified LtDBAT enzyme was capable of catalyzing 10-deacetylbaccatin III into baccatin III, as shown by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The mass spectra of baccatin III were identical to the authentic baccatin III. The LtDBAT enzyme was characterized and the kinetic parameters of catalysis were determined. In addition, localization of LtDBAT was performed by using confocal microscopy and the result showed that the enzyme was localized in lipid droplets. Together, this study provides biochemical insights into the fungal recombinant DBAT enzyme that is involved in the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. In the near future, engineering of the LtDBAT enzyme and the Taxol biosynthetic pathway in endophytic fungi could be an eco-friendly and economically feasible alternative source for production of Taxol and its precursors.",Analysis of Risk Factors for Posterior C1 Screw-Related Complication: A Retrospective Study of 358 Posterior C1 Screws.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062023,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2019 05 07,"Although C1 screw fixation is becoming popular, only a few studies have discussed about the risk factors and the patterns of C1 screw complications.","Tsr4 and Nap1, two novel members of the ribosomal protein chaperOME.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062022,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 07,"Dedicated chaperones protect newly synthesized ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) from aggregation and accompany them on their way to assembly into nascent ribosomes. Currently, only nine of the ∼80 eukaryotic r-proteins are known to be guarded by such chaperones. In search of new dedicated r-protein chaperones, we performed a tandem-affinity purification based screen and looked for factors co-enriched with individual small subunit r-proteins. We report the identification of Nap1 and Tsr4 as direct binding partners of Rps6 and Rps2, respectively. Both factors promote the solubility of their r-protein clients in vitro. While Tsr4 is specific for Rps2, Nap1 has several interaction partners including Rps6 and two other r-proteins. Tsr4 binds co-translationally to the essential, eukaryote-specific N-terminal extension of Rps2, whereas Nap1 interacts with a large, mostly eukaryote-specific binding surface of Rps6. Mutation of the essential Tsr4 and deletion of the non-essential Nap1 both enhance the 40S synthesis defects of the corresponding r-protein mutants. Our findings highlight that the acquisition of eukaryote-specific domains in r-proteins was accompanied by the co-evolution of proteins specialized to protect these domains and emphasize the critical role of r-protein chaperones for the synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes.",MAFFT-DASH: integrated protein sequence and structural alignment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062021,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 07,"Here, we describe a web server that integrates structural alignments with the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment (MSA) tool. For this purpose, we have prepared a web-based Database of Aligned Structural Homologs (DASH), which provides structural alignments at the domain and chain levels for all proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and can be queried interactively or by a simple REST-like API. MAFFT-DASH integration can be invoked with a single flag on either the web (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) or command-line versions of MAFFT. In our benchmarks using 878 cases from the BAliBase, HomFam, OXFam, Mattbench and SISYPHUS datasets, MAFFT-DASH showed 10-20% improvement over standard MAFFT for MSA problems with weak similarity, in terms of Sum-of-Pairs (SP), a measure of how well a program succeeds at aligning input sequences in comparison to a reference alignment. When MAFFT alignments were supplemented with homologous sequences, further improvement was observed. Potential applications of DASH beyond MSA enrichment include functional annotation through detection of remote homology and assembly of template libraries for homology modeling.","Measles, mumps and rubella vs diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis-inactivated-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b as the most recent vaccine and risk of early 'childhood asthma'.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062020,International journal of epidemiology,2019 05 07,"Live vaccines may have beneficial non-specific effects.

In the present study, we have focused on the inflammatory signals modulated by the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Under homeostatic conditions, these species turn on the COX-1-dependent arachidonic acid (AA) pathway towards the release of anti-inflammatory enzymes. However, the excess release of these ions induces negative effects in the form of inflammation by turning on the COX-2-dependent AA pathway to release pro-inflammatory enzymes. In the present study, we observed the shunting of the COX-2-dependent AA pathway towards the release of anti-inflammatory enzymes with the supplementation of organic dietary selenium in the form of seleniferous maize extracts. We observed that 500 nM selenium concentration in Se-maize extracts downregulated the COX-2 and mPGES-1 expressions by 3.8- and 3.2-fold and upregulated the GPx-1 and H-PGDS expressions by 5.0- and 5.4-fold, respectively. To facilitate more availability of Se from the dietary matrices, Se-maize extracts were incubated with rMETase. It was observed that the enzyme-treated cells increased the downregulation of COX-2 and mPGES-1 expressions by 24.8- and 21.0-fold and the upregulation of GPx-1 and H-PGDS expressions by 13.2- and 16.5-fold, respectively.",Effects of mono- and divalent cations on the structure and thermodynamic properties of polyelectrolyte gels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062008,Soft matter,2019 06 10,"Measurements are reported on the effect of monovalent and divalent salts on the swelling behavior and supramolecular structure of sodium polyacrylate gels (NaPA) made by osmotic swelling pressure and small angle neutron scattering measurements. The swelling response of the gels in solutions of ten different monovalent salts is found to be practically identical indicating that the principal effect of monovalent ions is screening the electrostatic repulsion among the charged groups on the polyelectrolyte chains; i.e., chemical differences between the monovalent ions do not play a significant role. Introducing Ca2+ ions into the equilibrium NaCl solution results in a sharp volume transition of the gels. The threshold Ca2+ ion concentration at which the transition occurs increases with increasing NaCl concentration in the surrounding bath. It is demonstrated that the swelling behavior of NaPA gels exhibits universal properties in solutions containing both NaCl and CaCl2. Osmotic swelling pressure measurements reveal that both the second and third virial coefficients decrease with increasing CaCl2 concentration until the volume transition is reached. The macroscopic measurements are complemented by small angle neutron scattering that reveals the variation of the thermodynamic length scales as the volume transition is approached.

This is quite common in cases of conoid teeth, diastemas or loss of dental structure by abrasion, erosion or attrition. The aim of this article is to present a step-by-step protocol to achieve conservative preparations for ceramic veneers, called the mock-up driven technique.

One area of expansion has been the use of telemedicine due to progression in communication technologies. Telemedicine offers the opportunity to overcome barriers of access, improve patient satisfaction, improve healthcare outcomes and streamline communication between patients and providers. The primary modalities of telemedicine can be grouped into categories of 'remote monitoring,' 'store and forward' and 'interactive telemedicine.' These modalities of telemedicine have been practiced and explored within the scope of hepatology such as in liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma and management of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). There are numerous telemedicine-based CHC management studies and programs that have developed in New Mexico, the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as globally in Australia and Canada. In Northern California, the University of New Mexico telemedicine-based model of 'ECHO' has been extended to develop community-based champions to screen-link-treat CHC patients with the goal to eliminate hepatitis C. Despite the advantages to telemedicine, there are still many barriers to seamless integration due to reimbursement and up-front cost.

However, the mechanism of their activation has not been elucidated. To explore how oncogenic signaling pathways could be involved in the process, we examined the expression of fetal/neonatal genes in liver tumors induced by the introduction of myristoylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT), HRas proto-oncogene, guanosine triphosphatase (HRASV12), and MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (Myc), in various combinations, into mouse hepatocytes in vivo. Distinct sets of fetal/neonatal genes were activated in HRAS- and HRAS/Myc-induced tumors: aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C18 (Akr1c18), glypican 3 (Gpc3), carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 2 (Abcd2), and trefoil factor 3 (Tff3) in the former; insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA binding protein 3 (Igf2bp3), alpha fetoprotein (Afp), Igf2, and H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) in the latter. Interestingly, HRAS/Myc-induced tumors comprised small cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of delta-like noncanonical Notch ligand 1 (Dlk1), Nanog homeobox (Nanog), and sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2). Both HRAS- and HRAS/Myc-induced tumors showed decreased DNA methylation levels of Line1 and Igf2 differentially methylated region 1 and increased nuclear accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, suggesting a state of global DNA hypomethylation. HRAS/Myc-induced tumors were characterized by an increase in the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferase [Dnmt1, Dnmt3]) and demethylation (ten-eleven-translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 [Tet1]), sharing similarities with the fetal liver. Although mouse hepatocytes could be transformed by the introduction of HRAS/Myc in vitro, they did not express fetal/neonatal genes and sustained global DNA methylation, suggesting that the epigenetic alterations were influenced by the in vivo microenvironment. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that human hepatocellular carcinoma cases with nuclear MYC expression were more frequently positive for AFP, IGF2, and DLK1 compared with MYC-negative tumors. Conclusion: The HRAS signaling pathway and its interactions with the Myc pathway appear to reactivate fetal/neonatal gene expression in hepatocytic tumors partly through epigenetic alterations, which are dependent on the tumor microenvironment.",Interleukin-33/ST2-Mediated Inflammation Plays a Critical Role in the Pathogenesis and Severity of Type I Autoimmune Hepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061955,Hepatology communications,2019 05 09,"Interleukin (IL)-33 was recently described as a new member of the IL-1 family; members of this family have proinflammatory activity. IL-33 and its soluble receptor ST2 (sST2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. This study investigated serum IL-33 and sST2 in type I autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and the relationship of these molecules with clinical and pathologic parameters. Subjects included 65 patients with AIH who were diagnosed in our hospital. The control population included 17 healthy individuals and 36 patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Mean age at AIH diagnosis was 55.5 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 6:59. Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels were significantly higher in patients with AIH than in those with PBC or controls. Importantly, immunohistochemistry revealed high IL-33 expression in liver sections from patients with AIH. In particular, serum IL-33 and sST2 levels were significantly higher in acute-onset AIH than in chronic-onset AIH. Serum IL-33 levels were positively correlated with serum total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and necroinflammatory activity in AIH. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis and found serum IL-33 levels to be independent factors for severe activity. Serum sST2 levels were positively correlated with serum TB and ALT and negatively correlated with serum albumin and prothrombin time in AIH. In particular, serum sST2 levels were significantly higher in severe symptoms of AIH. Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels in patients with AIH responsive to treatment with prednisolone were significantly decreased after treatment. Interestingly, serum IL-33 level was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse. Conclusion: IL-33/ST2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis and severity of AIH and may be a promising target for AIH therapy.",Adipose-Specific Lipin-1 Overexpression Renders Hepatic Ferroptosis and Exacerbates Alcoholic Steatohepatitis in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061954,Hepatology communications,2019 06 10,"Lipin-1 is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase involved in the generation of diacylglycerol during synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. Ethanol-mediated inhibitory effects on adipose-specific lipin-1 expression were associated with experimental steatohepatitis in rodents. In the present study, using an adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression transgenic (Lpin1-Tg) mouse model, we tested a hypothesis that adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression in mice might dampen ethanol-induced liver damage. Experimental alcoholic steatohepatitis was induced by pair-feeding ethanol to Lpin1-Tg and wild-type (WT) mice using the chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding protocol. Unexpectedly, following the chronic-plus-binge ethanol challenge, Lpin1-Tg mice exhibited much more pronounced steatosis, exacerbated inflammation, augmented elevation of serum liver enzymes, hepatobiliary damage, and fibrogenic responses compared with the WT mice. Mechanistically, overexpression of adipose lipin-1 in mice facilitated the onset of hepatic ferroptosis, which is an iron-dependent form of cell death, and subsequently induced ferroptotic liver damage in mice under ethanol exposure. Concurrently, adipose lipin-1 overexpression induced defective adiponectin signaling pathways in ethanol-fed mice. Conclusion: We identified ferroptosis as a mechanism in mediating the detrimental effects of adipose-specific lipin-1 overexpression in mice under chronic-plus-binge ethanol exposure. Our present study sheds light on potential therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of human alcoholic steatohepatitis.","A Behavioral Health Program for Alcohol Use Disorder, Substance Abuse, and Depression in Chronic Liver Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061953,Hepatology communications,2019 05 09,"Alcohol use disorder, substance abuse, and depression are illnesses that deteriorate the quality of life (QOL) of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Screening and behavioral health programs integrated into routine practice can mitigate the deleterious effects of such illnesses but have not been adopted in hepatology practices. We implemented a behavioral health program based on the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) model and assessed its acceptability and effectiveness in improving QOL. This was a quality improvement study. Patients with CLD and a scheduled outpatient visit in the hepatology clinic were screened while waiting for their appointment. All patients who screened positive for any of the three illnesses were offered a brief intervention (BI) at the point of care and at 3 months by a trained social worker. The BI used the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. Severity of illness was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Participants completed an acceptability survey at 6 months. We screened 303 patients; 61.7% were positive for any of the three illnesses assessed. Among the positive patients, depression was most common (48.4%), alcohol and substance abuse were each 26%. For the 95 patients who underwent BI, QOL improved from baseline to 3 and 6 months (P < 0.001) and patients with depression improved the most. Depression was the only independent predictor of change in QOL over time. Of the enrolled patients, 82% agreed BIs improved their overall care and 87% indicated a desire to continue with the behavioral program. Conclusion: An outpatient behavioral health program based on the SBIRT model is acceptable to patients with CLD and may help improve QOL over time.",Effect of a Multistrain Probiotic on Cognitive Function and Risk of Falls in Patients With Cirrhosis: A Randomized Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061952,Hepatology communications,2019 05 09,"Probiotics can modulate gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, and immune response and could therefore improve cognitive dysfunction and help avoid potential consequences, such as falls, in patients with cirrhosis.

Nonadherence (31.5%) and indication issues (29.1%) were the most prevalent MRP types. The risk of potential harm associated with MRPs was low in 18.9% of instances, medium in 33.1%, and high in 48.0%, as categorized by a clinician panel using a risk matrix tool. Patients had a greater incidence rate of high-risk MRPs if they had a higher Child-Pugh score (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.56); greater comorbidity burden (IRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29); and were taking more medications (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22). A total of 221 MRPs (58.9%) were resolved following pharmacist intervention. A greater proportion of high-risk MRPs were resolved compared to those of low and medium risk (68.9% versus 49.7%; P < 0.001). During the 12-month follow-up period, intervention patients had a lower incidence rate of unplanned admissions compared to usual care (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30-0.92). Conclusion: High-risk MRPs are prevalent among adults with decompensated cirrhosis. Pharmacist intervention facilitated identification and resolution of high-risk MRPs and was associated with reduced incidence rate of unplanned hospital admissions in this group.",Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt: A Possible Risk Factor for Direct-Acting Antiviral Treatment Failure in Patients With Hepatitis C?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061950,Hepatology communications,2019 05 09,"Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies have revolutionized the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, achieving sustained virological response (SVR) rates of >90% even in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. Having observed an unusual case of repeated DAA therapy failures in a patient with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), we assessed a possible association between prior TIPS placement and DAA failure. A structured search of our clinical database revealed 10 patients who had received DAA therapy after TIPS placement. At the time of therapy, most patients (8; 80%) presented with a Child-Pugh score B, and the following DAA regimens were used: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin (5 patients), sofosbuvir/daclatasvir ± ribavirin (3), sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (2), and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (1). In total, 5 patients (50%) achieved an SVR, whereas a virological relapse occurred in the other half of the cases, including 2 patients with multiple relapses. In this patient cohort, SVR rates were unusually low for all regimens: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin, 3/5 (60%); sofosbuvir/daclatasvir ± ribavirin, 2/3 (66%); sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, 0/2 (0%); and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, 0/1 (0%), and patients with a TIPS made up a relevant proportion of DAA failures in patients with cirrhosis at our center: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, 2/18 (11%); sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, 1/4 (25%); sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, 2/3 (66%); and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, 1/1 (100%). Conclusion: We observed a high rate of virological relapse in patients with a TIPS who received DAA treatment and therefore postulate that TIPS placement may be a possible risk factor for DAA failure due to the profound hemodynamic changes evoked by the intervention. Longer treatment duration or addition of ribavirin might be warranted in these patients.",Looking Into the Crystal Ball: Predicting the Future Challenges of Fibrotic NASH Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061949,Hepatology communications,2019 05 09,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide, and its aggressive form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming a leading cause for end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States. In patients with NASH, the presence of advanced fibrosis is considered the most important prognostic factor in predicting liver-related morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications to treat patients with NASH-induced advanced fibrosis. However, the field of drug development to treat NASH and fibrosis has witnessed major advances over the past 5 years with several medications in phase III trials. Results from some of these trials are expected in 2019 with potential FDA approval in 2020. Clinicians who treat patients with NAFLD are likely to face several challenges over the next few years related to identifying patients with advanced fibrosis who may derive most benefit from pharmacologic treatment, the requirement for liver biopsy to assess histologic severity and response to treatment, and the urgent need to validate noninvasive tests to replace liver biopsy-to determine treatment initiation, response, futility, and the need for combination therapy with multiple drugs. Conclusion: In this review, we aim to dissect each of these challenges and attempt to provide suggested solutions while fully realizing that knowledge gaps still exist where future research is likely to provide urgently needed answers."

Most of them mainly study the contribution of substrate, excitation wavelength, exposure time, pH and added cations to plasmon-assisted surface catalytic reactions. However, we mainly study focuses on the effects of solvents on the dimerization of PATP to DMAB under the action of Ag nanoparticles (NPs). In experiments, a variety of diols was selected as solvents for the probe molecule PATP, and power-dependent SERS spectra were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. From the laser-dependent SERS spectrum, we found that the characteristic peak enhancement effect of the product DMAB in different solvents is significantly different. That is, different solvents could regulate the rate at which DMAB is produced from PATP. Based on the experimental results, we further explored how different diol solvents regulate the response of PATP to DMAB. Our conclusion is that the solvent in the system can quickly capture the hot electrons generated by the decay of the plasmon, so that the remaining holes can oxidize PATP to form DMAB. The ability to trap hot electrons is different due to the difference in the position of the functional groups in the solvent, so that the photocatalytic reaction rate of the hole-oxidized PATP is different. The ability to capture electrons varies depending on the position of the functional groups in the solvent, so the oxidation rate of the photocatalytic reaction is also different. This work not only deepens our understanding of the mechanism of hole-driven surface catalysis oxidation reaction, but also provides a convenient method for regulating the rate of catalytic oxidation.",A mathematical model for evaluating the role of trypanocide treatment of cattle in the epidemiology and control of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness in Uganda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061906,Parasite epidemiology and control,2019 05 09,"Human and animal African trypanosomiases impose a large economic and health burden in their endemic regions.

Women and land, I argue, occupy particular places in Indian techno-pastoral imaginaries as the nation-state recalibrates profits that can be harvested from the regenerative capacities of life itself. Through a case study of southern Karnataka, where the megapolis of Bangalore is located, I show that working class women and agricultural land have a shared genealogy in the region's bio-economic development. I study three historical moments where population and food production have vexed state authorities: the South Indian famine of 1875-1876 that left more than 20% of the population dead; the early 20th century efforts at building the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam, and state-sponsored birth control clinics in the 1930s; and the 1950s-1960s population control programmes and Green Revolution interventions. The growing literature on bio-economies focuses on pharmaceutical industries; clinical trials; and commodification of organs, tissues and cells; however, by working with surrogate mothers incorporated not as labourers but with their wombs coded as land, this study attempted to map the long histories of bio-economies, spanning land and living tissue, in and around Bangalore. I argue that rather than bio-economies, the term 'necro-economies' might be more useful for describing how land and women are incorporated into techno-pastoral desires.",Rights-holders or refugees? Do gay men need reproductive justice?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061902,Reproductive biomedicine & society online,2019 05 09,"A thriving North American industry has emerged designed to help gay men become biological parents through surrogacy and egg donation. Taking as given that gay men have the same ethical right to pursue such reproductive technologies as heterosexual couples or individuals, this article asks whether access to egg donation and surrogacy for gay men specifically could be considered a matter not just of (consumer) rights, but of justice. The idea of shifting discourse about reproduction from the language of 'rights' to that of 'justice' is most notably articulated by women of colour. Their call for reproductive justice seeks to expand discussion beyond the narrow right to an abortion (as a negative privacy right) to encompass broader, positive rights, such as the rights to bear healthy children and to raise them in safe environments. What, if anything, might we learn from reproductive justice movements about how to frame gay men's desire/demand for access to surrogacy? While I find several productive connections between the two groups, two factors lead me to argue against understanding gay access to surrogacy as a matter of justice: first, the necessary reliance on women's reproductive labour; and second, the largely non-structural causes of gay couples' inability to reproduce. Nevertheless, by considering two driving forces behind gay male assisted reproduction - social norms favouring biological family formation and the need for family security - I ultimately conclude that a basis for solidarity exists between gay men and reproductive justice movements. That basis is a concept like 'procreative liberty'."

Novel curative adjuncts are needed. Oncolytic viral therapy has shown preclinical promise against colon cancer but lacks robust efficacy in clinical trials and raises regulatory concerns without real-time tracking of viral replication. Novel potent vectors are needed with adjunctive features to enhance clinical efficacy. We have thus used homologous recombination and high-throughput screening to create a novel chimeric poxvirus encoding a human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) at a redundant tk locus. The resulting virus (CF33-hNIS) consistently expresses hNIS and demonstrates replication efficiency and immunogenic cell death in colon cancer cells in vitro. Tumor-specific CF33-hNIS efficacy against colon cancer results in tumor regression in vivo in colon cancer xenograft models. Early expression of hNIS by infected cells makes viral replication reliably imageable via positron emission tomography (PET) of I-124 uptake. The intensity of I-124 uptake mirrors viral replication and tumor regression. Finally, systemic delivery of radiotherapeutic I-131 isotope following CF33-hNIS infection of colon cancer xenografts enhances and sustains tumor regression compared with virus treatment alone in HCT116 xenografts, demonstrating synergy of oncolytic viral therapy with radioablation in vivo.",Influence of video-based feedback on self-assessment accuracy of endoscopic skills: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061880,Endoscopy international open,2019 05 09,"Background and study aims  Novice endoscopists are inaccurate in self-assessment of procedures. One means of improving self-assessment accuracy is through video-based feedback. We aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of three video-based interventions on novice endoscopists' self-assessment accuracy of endoscopic competence. Materials and methods  Novice endoscopists (performed < 20 previous procedures) were recruited. Participants completed a simulated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on a virtual reality simulator. They were then randomized to one of three groups: self-video review (SVR), which involved watching a recorded video of their own performance; benchmark review (BVR), which involved watching a video of a simulated EGD completed by an expert; and self- and benchmark video (SBVR), which involved both videos. Participants then completed two additional simulated EGD cases. Self-assessments were conducted immediately after the first procedure, after the video intervention and after the additional two procedures. External assessments were conducted by two experienced endoscopists, who were blinded to participant identity and group assignment through video recordings. External and self-assessments were completed using the global rating scale component of the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Competency Assessment Tool (GiECAT GRS). Results  Fifty-one participants completed the study. The BVR group had significantly improved self-assessment accuracy in the short-term, compared to the SBVR group ( P  = .005). The SBVR group demonstrated significantly improved self-assessment accuracy over time ( P  = .016). There were no significant effects of group or of time for the SVR group. Conclusions  Video-based interventions, particularly combined use of self- and benchmark video review, can improve accuracy of self-assessment of endoscopic competence among novices.",Endoscopic submucosal dissection in management of colorectal tumors near or involving a diverticulum: a retrospective case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061878,Endoscopy international open,2019 05 09,"Background and study aims  Surgery is the standard treatment for colon tumors associated with diverticulum. U se of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to treat such tumors is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of ESD in treating superficial colorectal tumors situated near or involving diverticulum. Patients and methods  Consecutive patients from two referral centers who had colorectal tumors near or involving diverticulum treated by ESD were retrospectively studied. Clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results  Of the 12 patients studied, six had tumors near diverticulum and six had tumors involving diverticulum. The overall en-bloc R0 resection rate, median tumor size and procedure time were 67 %, 26.5 mm (range, 15 - 80 mm) and 110 minutes (range, 50 - 220 minutes), respectively. For tumors near diverticulum group, the en-bloc R0 resection rate was 100 % and no adverse events (AEs) or residual/recurrent tumors were observed. In contrast, for intradiverticular tumors group, the en-bloc R0 resection rate was low at 33 %, and one AE (perforation) was observed. The diverticula were ≥ 6 mm in diameter in the patients with incomplete resection. However, all but one diverticulum was unrecognized before ESD. Two residual tumors were detected at the 12-month surveillance and one required surgery. Conclusions  This case series indicates that ESD is safe and feasible for treating colorectal tumors near a diverticulum and might be feasible for tumors involving a diverticulum smaller than 6 mm. Selection for smaller diverticulum size may contribute to higher en-bloc R0 resection rates."
