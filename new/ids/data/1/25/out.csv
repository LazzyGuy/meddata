Based on this, by adopting the ecological MEs recognition paradigm, this study aimed to explore ME recognition in people with subthreshold depression. A 4 (background expression: happy, neutral, sad and fearful) Ã— 4 (ME: happy, neutral, sad, and fearful) study was designed; two groups of participants (experimental group with subthreshold depression vs. healthy control group, 32 participants in each group) were asked to complete the ecological ME recognition task, and the corresponding accuracy (ACC) and reaction time (RT) were analyzed. Results: (1) Under different background conditions, recognizing happy MEs had the highest ACC and shortest RT. (2) There was no significant difference in the ACC and RT between experimental and control groups. (3)In different contexts, individuals with subthreshold depression tended to misjudge neutral, sad, and fearful MEs as happy, while neutral MEs were misjudged as sad and fearful. (4) The performance of individuals with subthreshold depression in the ecological ME recognition task were influenced by the type of ME; they showed highest ACC and shortest RT when recognizing happy MEs (vs. the other MEs). Conclusions: (1) The performance of individuals' ecological ME recognition were influenced by the background expression, and this embodied the need for ecological ME recognition. (2) Individuals with subthreshold depression showed normal ecological ME recognition ability. (3) In terms of misjudgment, individuals with subthreshold depression showed both positive and negative bias, when completing the ecological ME recognition task.

Sadness is represented by specific physical pain through verbal knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042783,PloS one,2019 05 19,"People describe sadness as ""heartache."" The link between sadness and physical pain such as heartache has been empirically proven; however, the mental foundations that support the connection between sadness and pain remain unclear. The present study hypothesized that the connection between sadness and specific physical pain is established by concepts referred to as ""sadness-pain concept,"" which are internalized based on features relating to interactions between the body and external situations. We examined the use of pain-related onomatopoeias as metaphorical words for expressing sadness, setting three primary goals for our study: (i) to identify sadness-pain words usable for both sadness and physical pains, (ii) to determine the specific sadness-pain words used for certain sadness situations, and (iii) to reveal the pain-related characteristics that are linked to such sadness situations. Sixty-nine participants were asked to rate 28 pain-onomatopoeic words in terms of the types of emotions, sadness situations, body parts, and characteristics of pain respectively. Consequently, seven words were identified as sadness-pain words. Furthermore, the specific sadness situations related to each sadness-pain word were determined. Situation-dependent sadness-pain words, for example, zukin zukin for loss, were found to be associated with specific body parts and pain properties. These findings indicate that the shared representation of sadness and physical pain as an emotional concept is based on interactions between the body and external situations.",Developing population health research priorities in Asian city state: Results from a multi-step participatory community engagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042782,PloS one,2019 05 19,To identify a broad range of research priorities to inform the studies seeking to improve population health outcomes based on the engagement of diverse stakeholders.,Protein expression profiling of plasma and lungs at different stages of metastatic development in a human triple negative breast cancer xenograft model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042781,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The main objective of this study was to identify single proteins or protein networks that might be used as diagnostic biomarkers or for therapeutic purposes by evaluating the protein expression profiling of plasma and lungs at different stages of metastatic development in a human triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model. MDA-MB-231 tumour cells were injected into the mammary fat pads on one side of the groin area. The mice were sacrificed day 19 (pre-metastases) and day 54 (metastases). Non-injected mice served as controls. Plasma was collected and lungs harvested for both immunohistochemistry and protein analysis. The most striking observation in plasma was the initial reduction in haptoglobin level at the pre-metastatic stage, to a following significant increase in haptoglobin level at the metastatic stage, with a more than 4000-fold increase from the pre-metastatic to the metastatic phase. A corresponding increase in haptoglobin level was also found in lung tissue after metastasis. Fibrinogen beta chain also had a similar change in expression level in plasma as haptoglobin, however not as prominent. There were also changes in plasma thrombospondin-4 and transferrin receptor protein 1 levels, from an increase at the pre-metastatic stage, to a significant fall when metastases were established. This suggests that especially changes in haptoglobin, but also fibrinogen beta chain, thrombospondin-4 and transferrin receptor protein 1 is indicative of metastasis, at least in this breast cancer model, and should be further evaluated as general breast cancer biomarkers.",FOXO1 transcription factor plays a key role in T cell-HIV-1 interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042779,PLoS pathogens,2019 06 10,"HIV-1 is dependent on the host cell for providing the metabolic resources for completion of its viral replication cycle. Thus, HIV-1 replicates efficiently only in activated CD4+ T cells. Barriers preventing HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ T cells include a block that limits reverse transcription and also the lack of activity of several inducible transcription factors, such as NF-ÎºB and NFAT. Because FOXO1 is a master regulator of T cell functions, we studied the effect of its inhibition on T cell/HIV-1 interactions. By using AS1842856, a FOXO1 pharmacologic inhibitor, we observe that FOXO1 inhibition induces a metabolic activation of T cells with a G0/G1 transition in the absence of any stimulatory signal. One parallel outcome of this change is the inhibition of the activity of the HIV restriction factor SAMHD1 and the activation of the NFAT pathway. FOXO1 inhibition by AS1842856 makes resting T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection. In addition, we found that FOXO1 inhibition by either AS1842856 treatment or upon FOXO1 knockdown induces the reactivation of HIV-1 latent proviruses in T cells. We conclude that FOXO1 has a central role in the HIV-1/T cell interaction and that inhibiting FOXO1 with drugs such as AS1842856 may be a new therapeutic shock-and-kill strategy to eliminate the HIV-1 reservoir in human T cells.",A core set of venom proteins is released by entomopathogenic nematodes in the genus Steinernema.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042778,PLoS pathogens,2019 06 10,"Parasitic helminths release molecular effectors into their hosts and these effectors can directly damage host tissue and modulate host immunity. Excreted/secreted proteins (ESPs) are one category of parasite molecular effectors that are critical to their success within the host. However, most studies of nematode ESPs rely on in vitro stimulation or culture conditions to collect the ESPs, operating under the assumption that in vitro conditions mimic actual in vivo infection. This assumption is rarely if ever validated. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are lethal parasites of insects that produce and release toxins into their insect hosts and are a powerful model parasite system. We compared transcriptional profiles of individual Steinernema feltiae nematodes at different time points of activation under in vitro and in vivo conditions and found that some but not all time points during in vitro parasite activation have similar transcriptional profiles with nematodes from in vivo infections. These findings highlight the importance of experimental validation of ESP collection conditions. Additionally, we found that a suite of genes in the neuropeptide pathway were downregulated as nematodes activated and infection progressed in vivo, suggesting that these genes are involved in host-seeking behavior and are less important during active infection. We then characterized the ESPs of activated S. feltiae infective juveniles (IJs) using mass spectrometry and identified 266 proteins that are released by these nematodes. In comparing these ESPs with those previously identified in activated S. carpocapsae IJs, we identified a core set of 52 proteins that are conserved and present in the ESPs of activated IJs of both species. These core venom proteins include both tissue-damaging and immune-modulating proteins, suggesting that the ESPs of these parasites include both a core set of effectors as well as a specialized set, more adapted to the particular hosts they infect.",Quality of postoperative pain management in Ethiopia: A prospective longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042777,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The annual number of surgical operations performed is increasing throughout the world.

Based on Danish register data with a large number of control variables, a propensity score matching estimator was applied to assess the effectiveness of the bridging intervention. The results show that the bridging intervention was effective in increasing educational enrollment and completion for all participants. The effects of the intervention were particularly large for participants assessed to be 'not ready for education' and those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders suggesting that the bridging intervention may be especially beneficial for these subgroups.",The Stress-Chip: A microfluidic platform for stress analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042764,PloS one,2019 05 19,"An organism's ability to mount a physiological response to external stressors is fundamental to its interaction with the environment. Experimental exploration of these interactions benefits greatly from the ability to maintain tight control of the environment, even under conditions in which it would be normal for the subject to flee the stressor. Here we present a nematode research platform that pairs automated image acquisition and analysis with a custom microfluidic device. This platform enables tight environmental control in low-density, single-worm arenas, which preclude animal escape while still allowing a broad range of behavioral activities. The platform is easily scalable, with two 50 arena arrays per chip and an imaging capacity of 600 animals per scanning device. Validating the device using dietary, osmotic, and oxidative stress indicates that it should be of broad use as a research platform, including eventual adaptation for additional stressors, anthelmintic-drug screening, and toxicology studies.",Epigenetic control of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in endothelial cells during inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042763,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. Alterations in ACE expression or activity are associated with various pathological phenotypes, particularly cardiovascular diseases. In human endothelial cells, ACE was shown to be negatively regulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Î±. To examine, whether or not, epigenetic factors were involved in ACE expression regulation, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and RNA interference experiments directed against regulators of DNA methylation homeostasis i.e., DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs), were performed. TNFÎ± stimulation enhanced DNA methylation in two distinct regions within the ACE promoter via a mechanism linked to DNMT3a and DNMT3b, but not to DNMT1. At the same time, TET1 protein expression was downregulated. In addition, DNA methylation decreased the binding affinity of the transcription factor MYC associated factor X to the ACE promoter. In conclusion, DNA methylation determines the TNFÎ±-dependent regulation of ACE gene transcription and thus protein expression in human endothelial cells.","A novel sequencing-based vaginal health assay combining self-sampling, HPV detection and genotyping, STI detection, and vaginal microbiome analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042762,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The composition of the vaginal microbiome, including both the presence of pathogens involved in sexually transmitted infections (STI) as well as commensal microbiota, has been shown to have important associations for a woman's reproductive and general health. Currently, healthcare providers cannot offer comprehensive vaginal microbiome screening, but are limited to the detection of individual pathogens, such as high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the predominant cause of cervical cancer. There is no single test on the market that combines HPV, STI, and microbiome screening. Here, we describe a novel inclusive vaginal health assay that combines self-sampling with sequencing-based HPV detection and genotyping, vaginal microbiome analysis, and STI-associated pathogen detection. The assay includes genotyping and detection of 14 hrHPV types, 5 low-risk HPV types (lrHPV), as well as the relative abundance of 31 bacterial taxa of clinical importance, including Lactobacillus, Sneathia, Gardnerella, and 3 pathogens involved in STI, with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. For each of these taxa, reference ranges were determined in a group of 50 self-reported healthy women. The HPV sequencing portion of the test was evaluated against the digene High-Risk HPV HC2 DNA test. For hrHPV genotyping, agreement was 95.3% with a kappa of 0.804 (601 samples); after removal of samples in which the digene hrHPV probe showed cross-reactivity with lrHPV types, the sensitivity and specificity of the hrHPV genotyping assay were 94.5% and 96.6%, respectively, with a kappa of 0.841. For lrHPV genotyping, agreement was 93.9% with a kappa of 0.788 (148 samples), while sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 92.9%, respectively. This novel assay could be used to complement conventional cervical cancer screening, because its self-sampling format can expand access among women who would otherwise not participate, and because of its additional information about the composition of the vaginal microbiome and the presence of pathogens.",Proteome and allergenome of the European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042761,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The European house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is of significant medical importance as it is a major elicitor of allergic illnesses. In this analysis we have undertaken comprehensive bioinformatic and proteomic examination of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus airmid, identified 12,530 predicted proteins and validated the expression of 4,002 proteins. Examination of homology between predicted proteins and allergens from other species revealed as much as 2.6% of the D. pteronyssinus airmid proteins may cause an allergenic response. Many of the potential allergens have evidence for expression (n = 259) and excretion (n = 161) making them interesting targets for future allergen studies. Comparative proteomic analysis of mite body and spent growth medium facilitated qualitative assessment of mite group allergen localisation. Protein extracts from house dust contain a substantial number of uncharacterised D. pteronyssinus proteins in addition to known and putative allergens. Novel D. pteronyssinus proteins were identified to be highly abundant both in house dust and laboratory cultures and included numerous carbohydrate active enzymes that may be involved in cuticle remodelling, bacteriophagy or mycophagy. These data may have clinical applications in the development of allergen-specific immunotherapy that mimic natural exposure. Using a phylogenomic approach utilising a supermatrix and supertree methodologies we also show that D. pteronyssinus is more closely related to Euroglyphus maynei than Dermatophagoides farinae.",Bioeconomy from experts' perspectives - Results of a global expert survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042759,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Effective global collaboration is crucial to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It requires an understanding of the needs of individual countries and their expectations related to bioeconomy. With the aim to explore the prospective developments in the global bioeconomy over the next 20 years, the German Bioeconomy Council, an independent advisory body to the German Federal Government, commissioned BIOCOM-AG to invite experts from around the globe to share their insights in a global expert survey. The survey was conducted online in autumn 2017. 345 experts from 46 countries completed the questionnaire about future developments and strategies in the global bioeconomy. As claimed by the experts, the upcoming bioeconomy must primarily meet humanity's needs in the energy, agriculture, and food sectors. Moreover, innovative products based on renewable resources are anticipated to be of great importance. Even though all UN SDGs will be affected by future bioeconomy success stories, five SDGs stood out within the sample: SDG 12: 'responsible consumption and production'; SDG 9: 'industry, innovation and infrastructure'; SDG 13: 'climate action'; SDG 7: 'affordable and clean energy'; and SDG 11: 'sustainable cities and communities'. About three quarters of the experts emphasized the need to specifically address three conflicting goals in any future bioeconomy strategy: non-food uses of arable land, use of crop land to produce feedstock for meat, milk and egg production and, finally, the conversion of virgin forests into agricultural land. Most experts stated that reducing food loss and waste is crucial to eradicating the world hunger problem. The proposed solutions relied greatly on innovation and technological development. Bioeconomy expertise and know-how should be shared in close cooperation between developed and developing economies to reach UN SDGs. A supportive political framework would be the ultimate goal towards furthering the progress of a future bioeconomy all over the world.",Male clients of male sex workers in West Africa: A neglected high-risk population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042757,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Research on male clients of male sex workers (MCMSW) has been neglected for a long time globally. We aimed to characterize MCMSW and to identify factors associated with their sexual practices using data from the prospective cohort study CohMSM conducted in Burkina Faso, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Mali and Togo. Our study focused on HIV-negative men who have sex with other men (MSM), recruited between 06/2015 and 01/2018 by a team of trained peer educators. Scheduled study visits at 6, 12 and 18 months included medical examinations, HIV screening, risk-reduction counselling and face-to-face interviews to collect information on their sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and HIV risk-reduction strategies (HIV-RRS). Three stigmatization sub-scores were constructed (experienced, perceived and internalized). Mixed-effects logistic regression was used for data analysis. Of the 280 participants recruited at baseline, 238, 211 and 118, respectively, had a follow-up visit at 6, 12 and 18 months. Over a total of 847 visits, 47 transactional sex (TS) encounters were reported by 38 MCMSW (13.6%). Of the latter, only one participant reported systematic TS (2.6%), 18 (47.4%) stopped reporting TS after baseline, while 6 (15.8%) reported TS after baseline. Thirteen participants (34.2%) reported occasional TS. After adjusting for country of study and age, the following self-reported factors were associated with a greater likelihood of being MCMSW: protected anal sex, exclusively insertive anal sex with male sexual partners, avoidance of sex after consuming psychoactive products and experiencing stigmatization (all during the previous 6 months). The majority of MCMSW in this study practiced HIV-RRS with male sexual partners, including engaging in protected anal sex, avoidance of sex when consuming psychoactive products, and practising exclusively insertive anal sex.","Estimation of potential soil erosion in the Prosecco DOCG area (NE Italy), toward a soil footprint of bottled sparkling wine production in different land-management scenarios.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042756,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Agricultural lands are the widest Human-modified ecosystems, making crop production the most extensive form of land use on Earth. However, in conventional agricultural land management, soil erosion may be boosted up to 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the natural rates of soil production, making unproductive about the 30% of the world's arable. Nowadays in Europe, vineyards represent the most erosion-prone agricultural lands, especially in Mediterranean countries, showing the highest erosion rates in comparison to other type of land uses. Prosecco wine is produced in NE Italy by a rate of 400 M bottles per year, with the fastest growing demand in the global market at present. A production of 90 M bottles year-1 is currently running in the historical Prosecco DOCG (215 km2), in a steep hilly landscape of Veneto Region (Conegliano-Valdobbiadene). To sustain wine production, agricultural intensification is at present increasing, by re-setting of hillslopes and land use changes towards new vineyard plantations. The aim of this study is to estimate and to map potential soil erosion rate, calculating a sort of ""soil footprint"" for wine production in different agricultural land-management scenarios. RUSLE model was adopted to estimate potential soil erosion in Mg ha-1 year-1, by using high resolution topographic data (LiDAR), 10 years rainfall data analysis, detailed land use and local soil characteristics. For a conventional land-management scenario the estimated that total potential soil erosion in the Prosecco DOCG area is 411,266 Mg year-1, with an erosion rate of 19.5 Mg ha year-1. Modelled soil erosion is mainly clustered on steep slopes, with rates higher than 40 Mg ha-1 year-1. In Prosecco vineyards potential soil erosion could reach 300,180 Mg year-1, by a mean rate of 43.7 Mg ha-1 year-1, which is 31 times higher than the upper limit of tolerable soil erosion threshold defined for Europe. In contrast, simulation of different nature-based scenarios (hedgerows, buffer strips, and grass cover) showed soil erosion could be effectively reduced: a 100% inter-row grass cover showed a reduction of almost 3 times in vineyards (from 43.7 to 14.6 Mg ha-1 year-1), saving about 50% of soil in the whole Prosecco DOCG. The soil footprint modelled for a conventional land-management scenario is about 3.3 kg every bottle produced; in contrast it would be reduced to 1.1 kg/bottle in the completely green land-management scenario. This study, as the first estimation of potential soil erosion at Prosecco DOCG scale, suggests that an integrated and public soil erosion monitoring system is strongly needed in viticultural area, by implementing direct/indirect field measures with spatial analyses at agricultural landscape scale.",Altered superoxide dismutase-1 activity and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042755,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Inflammation and oxidative stress are linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this work, we analyzed patients' blood markers of antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress and inflammation in individuals with T2DM, in pre-diabetes state (pre-DM) and controls without diabetes. Patients were divided into three groups, according to glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): <7%, 7-9%, and >9%. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities, total thiols, nitric oxide (â€¢NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels of the individuals were measured. Plasma SOD activity was higher in T2DM subjects compared to the controls. While total thiols levels were lower in T2DM groups when compared to pre-DM, the values remained unchanged when compared to controls. ICAM-1 levels of T2DM groups were lower than in controls, while GPx activity, â€¢NO, and TNF-Î± levels were similar among all groups. A positive correlation was found between SOD and HbA1c levels. Concluding, individuals with T2DM present altered SOD activity, total thiols, and ICAM-1 levels, which might contribute to further complications. There is a positive correlation between SOD activity and HbA1c levels. No apparent correlation exists between total thiols and ICAM-1 levels and with any other of the parameters evaluated in this study.",Gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A qualitative preference study of patients and parents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042754,PloS one,2019 05 19,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive weakness and early death.

To examine this issue, a multivariate, regression-based difference-in-differences (DD) analysis was applied. The ""treatment"" group is immigrant families with a U.S. citizen child that is 130% of the federal poverty level or below in states with restrictive immigrant related legislation and the ""control"" group is native families meeting the same federal poverty level guidelines as well as low-income immigrant families in states without the restrictive legislation. The research findings show that there does not appear to be a chilling effect associated with restrictive state laws on participation in the food stamp program. Food insecurity is an immediate need that may override the impediments to enrollment due to immigration status, causing families to apply despite a negative climate toward immigrants. For policy makers and immigrant advocates it is important to know where chilling effects might not occur in order to work with politicians and federal agencies on crafting sound evidence-based policy. Independent of any chilling effect, the model shows that immigrant families are less likely to enroll in food stamp benefits, consistent with other literature. In addition, independent of the effects of restrictive immigration legislation, both non-citizen and naturalized mothers were less likely to be in a family with food stamp benefits compared to similar native-born mothers. This indicates that all states have a gap in food stamp program enrollment that merits further attention and research.","Cereal processing at Early Neolithic GÃ¶bekli Tepe, southeastern Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042741,PloS one,2019 05 19,"We analyze the processing of cereals and its role at Early Neolithic GÃ¶bekli Tepe, southeastern Anatolia (10th / 9th millennium BC), a site that has aroused much debate in archaeological discourse. To date, only zooarchaeological evidence has been discussed in regard to the subsistence of its builders. GÃ¶bekli Tepe consists of monumental round to oval buildings, erected in an earlier phase, and smaller rectangular buildings, built around them in a partially contemporaneous and later phase. The monumental buildings are best known as they were in the focus of research. They are around 20 m in diameter and have stone pillars that are up to 5.5 m high and often richly decorated. The rectangular buildings are smaller and-in some cases-have up to 2 m high, mostly undecorated, pillars. Especially striking is the number of tools related to food processing, including grinding slabs/bowls, handstones, pestles, and mortars, which have not been studied before. We analyzed more than 7000 artifacts for the present contribution. The high frequency of artifacts is unusual for contemporary sites in the region. Using an integrated approach of formal, experimental, and macro- / microscopical use-wear analyses we show that Neolithic people at GÃ¶bekli Tepe have produced standardized and efficient grinding tools, most of which have been used for the processing of cereals. Additional phytolith analysis confirms the massive presence of cereals at the site, filling the gap left by the weakly preserved charred macro-rests. The organization of work and food supply has always been a central question of research into GÃ¶bekli Tepe, as the construction and maintenance of the monumental architecture would have necessitated a considerable work force. Contextual analyses of the distribution of the elements of the grinding kit on site highlight a clear link between plant food preparation and the rectangular buildings and indicate clear delimitations of working areas for food production on the terraces the structures lie on, surrounding the circular buildings. There is evidence for extensive plant food processing and archaeozoological data hint at large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn. As no large storage facilities have been identified, we argue for a production of food for immediate use and interpret these seasonal peaks in activity at the site as evidence for the organization of large work feasts.","Wolves, but not dogs, are prosocial in a touch screen task.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042740,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Prosociality is important for initiating cooperation. Interestingly, while wolves rely heavily on cooperation, dogs' do so substantially less thus leading to the prediction that wolves are more prosocial than dogs. However, domestication hypotheses suggest dogs have been selected for higher cooperation, leading to the opposing prediction- increased prosocial tendencies in dogs. To tease apart these hypotheses we adapted a paradigm previously used with pet dogs to directly compare dogs and wolves. In a prosocial choice task, wolves acted prosocially to in-group partners; providing significantly more food to a pack-member compared to a control where the partner had no access to the food. Dogs did not. Additionally, wolves did not show a prosocial response to non-pack members, in line with previous research that social relationships are important for prosociality. In sum, when kept in the same conditions, wolves are more prosocial than their domestic counterpart, further supporting suggestions that reliance on cooperation is a driving force for prosocial attitudes.",The role of low-level image features in the affective categorization of rapidly presented scenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042739,PloS one,2019 05 19,"It remains unclear how the visual system is able to extract affective content from complex scenes even with extremely brief (< 100 millisecond) exposures. One possibility, suggested by findings in machine vision, is that low-level features such as unlocalized, two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier spectra can be diagnostic of scene content. To determine whether Fourier image amplitude carries any information about the affective quality of scenes, we first validated the existence of image category differences through a support vector machine (SVM) model that was able to discriminate our intact aversive and neutral images with ~ 70% accuracy using amplitude-only features as inputs. This model allowed us to confirm that scenes belonging to different affective categories could be mathematically distinguished on the basis of amplitude spectra alone. The next question is whether these same features are also exploited by the human visual system. Subsequently, we tested observers' rapid classification of affective and neutral naturalistic scenes, presented briefly (~33.3 ms) and backward masked with synthetic textures. We tested categorization accuracy across three distinct experimental conditions, using: (i) original images, (ii) images having their amplitude spectra swapped within a single affective image category (e.g., an aversive image whose amplitude spectrum has been swapped with another aversive image) or (iii) images having their amplitude spectra swapped between affective categories (e.g., an aversive image containing the amplitude spectrum of a neutral image). Despite its discriminative potential, the human visual system does not seem to use Fourier amplitude differences as the chief strategy for affectively categorizing scenes at a glance. The contribution of image amplitude to affective categorization is largely dependent on interactions with the phase spectrum, although it is impossible to completely rule out a residual role for unlocalized 2-D amplitude measures.",FluoroCellTrack: An algorithm for automated analysis of high-throughput droplet microfluidic data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042738,PloS one,2019 05 19,"High-throughput droplet microfluidic devices with fluorescence detection systems provide several advantages over conventional end-point cytometric techniques due to their ability to isolate single cells and investigate complex intracellular dynamics. While there have been significant advances in the field of experimental droplet microfluidics, the development of complementary software tools has lagged. Existing quantification tools have limitations including interdependent hardware platforms or challenges analyzing a wide range of high-throughput droplet microfluidic data using a single algorithm. To address these issues, an all-in-one Python algorithm called FluoroCellTrack was developed and its wide-range utility was tested on three different applications including quantification of cellular response to drugs, droplet tracking, and intracellular fluorescence. The algorithm imports all images collected using bright field and fluorescence microscopy and analyzes them to extract useful information. Two parallel steps are performed where droplets are detected using a mathematical Circular Hough Transform (CHT) while single cells (or other contours) are detected by a series of steps defining respective color boundaries involving edge detection, dilation, and erosion. These feature detection steps are strengthened by segmentation and radius/area thresholding for precise detection and removal of false positives. Individually detected droplet and contour center maps are overlaid to obtain encapsulation information for further analyses. FluoroCellTrack demonstrates an average of a ~92-99% similarity with manual analysis and exhibits a significant reduction in analysis time of 30 min to analyze an entire cohort compared to 20 h required for manual quantification.",Biotic factors influencing the unexpected distribution of a Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) population in a young coastal forest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042737,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Pacific martens (Martes caurina) are often associated with mature forests with complex structure for denning, resting, and efficient hunting. Nonetheless, a small isolated population of the Humboldt subspecies of Pacific martens (Martes caurina humboldtensis) occupies a narrow strip of young, coastal forest (< 70 years old) but not inland mature forest in the central Oregon Coast Range. We examined factors contributing to this unexpected distribution of martens by 1) analyzing marten diets using DNA metabarcoding to assess 90 scats, 2) using camera traps to assess differences in the relative abundances of prey, competitors, and predators across a coastal to inland gradient of vegetation types, and 3) quantifying differences in extent of fruit-producing shrubs and vegetation structure within vegetation types. Diets of martens were diverse (12, 10, and 3 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians respectively), and most fall and winter scats contained fruit. Voles, mice, and varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) were dominant prey items. Voles, mice, and most birds, but not varied thrushes, were more commonly observed in the coastal shrub-dominated forest than in inland forest. The coastal shrub-dominated forest had the highest diversity of vertebrates and potential prey overall. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), a key potential predator, were more commonly detected in inland forest. Of potential competitors, western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) were more commonly detected in inland forest, with gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) detected almost exclusively in coastal forests. Vegetation in coastal forests appears to provide, at least seasonally, more prey and fruit, and more overhead shrub cover compared with inland forest. Remaining plausible hypotheses for the restricted distribution of marten to coastal forests include increased prey, fruit, and overhead cover, and reduced predation risk from bobcats.","The benthic sea-silk-thread displacement of a sessile bivalve, Pinctada imbricata radiata (Leach, 1819) in the Arabian-Persian Gulf.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042736,PloS one,2019 05 19,"A number of molluscs within the Class Bivalvia are defined by their ability to secrete fine silk like threads known as byssus which are used to anchor themselves to solid substrates. With relatively few exceptions the majority of these species remain in a sedentary state throughout their life attached via their byssal threads. However, observations of adult Pinctada imbricata radiata pearl oysters made during this study revealed this species' ability to implement active movement. Byssal threads were secreted in a sequence of attachment and detachment phases, which resulted in the active displacement of the oyster. The oyster was observed, in the laboratory over a 9 day period, travelling a distance of 28cm in a horizontal path. After horizontal displacement, a vertical climbing phase was observed until the oyster reached the water surface at which point the byssus was discarded and the animal dropped, drifting in accordance with water current intensity. It is possible that these adaptations of byssal use are a result of environmentally induced evolutionary change within P. i. radiata.",Effects of a novel low volume resuscitation solutions on coagulation and platelet function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042735,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Novel crystalloid solutions containing polyethylene glycol polymers (PEG-20k) produce dramatic resuscitation effects but dose-dependently produce a hypocoagulative state.

Community-level changes after anthropogenic land-use change have been studied in a variety of organisms, but the effects on arthropods of medical and veterinary importance remain poorly characterized. Shifts in diversity, abundance, and community composition of such arthropods, like mosquitoes, can significantly impact vector-borne disease dynamics due to varying vectorial capacity between different species. In light of these potential implications for vector-borne diseases, we investigated changes in mosquito species assemblage after suburbanization by sampling mosquitoes in neighborhoods of different ages in Wake County, North Carolina, US. We found that independent of housing density and socioeconomic status, mosquito diversity measures decreased as suburban neighborhoods aged. In the oldest neighborhoods, the mosquito assemblage reached a distinct suburban climax community dominated by the invasive, peridomestic container-breeding Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of many pathogens of human concern, and its dominance in suburban areas places it in close proximity with humans, allowing for heightened potential of host-vector interactions. While further research is necessary to explicitly characterize the effects of mosquito community simplification on vector-borne disease transmission in highly suburbanized areas, the current study demonstrates that suburbanization is disrupting mosquito communities so severely that they do not recover their diversity even 100 years after the initial disturbance. Our understanding of the community-level effects of anthropogenic land-use change on arthropod vectors will become increasingly important as we look to mitigate disease spread in a global landscape that is continually developed and altered by humans."

The current study was designed to evaluate solar lentigo hyperpigmentation, skin architecture and clinician and patient assessments comparing a dermocosmetic lightening product (active) with a moisturizing product (control) according to clinical, digital and subjective analyses in 72 lesions over 12-month follow up period. Statistically significant differences were observed between the lesions treated with the active compared to the control in terms of papillary brightness (p = 0.03) and contrast (p = 0.03), and in the limitation of dermal-epidermal junction destructuring (p = 0.03) according to dermal-epidermal junction destructuring score at Reflectance Confocal Microscopy. Luminance (p = 0.04) and redness (p = 0.03) were improved at color analysis, and physician and patient evaluations favored the active in efficacy and patient satisfaction investigations.

Beside demonstrating the efficacy of this topical lightening product, we propose a ""destructuring score"", which improves the robustness of solar lentigo's evaluation, and can be used in future studies to standardize the quantitative comparisons of different treatment options.","What is really out there? Review of the genus Okenia Menke, 1830 (Nudibranchia: Goniodorididae) in the Mediterranean Sea with description of two new species.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042722,PloS one,2019 05 19,"The precise number of Okenia taxa inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, as well as their general taxonomy, varies according to different specialists. So far, eight valid species have been reported from the area: Okenia aspersa (Alder & Hancock, 1845), Okenia cupella (Vogel & Schultz, 1970), Okenia elegans (Leuckart, 1828), Okenia hispanica ValdÃ©s & Ortea, 1995, Okenia impexa Er.

Of these, only three (O. elegans, O. hispanica, and O. mediterranea) have their type localities in the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the others were described from different biogeographic areas and later included in the Mediterranean biota. We carried out a review on Mediterranean Okenia species through an integrative approach, based on a wide literature search and a morphological and molecular analysis of available type material and samples collected recently. The present study confirmed the presence of O. aspersa, O. elegans, O. hispanica, and O. mediterranea in the Mediterranean Sea, although leaving remaining questions about some of those taxa. The distribution of O. cupella, O. impexa, and O. zoobotryon is limited to the western Atlantic, and of O. leachii to the eastern Atlantic.

The data were drawn from the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys. CMDs were assessed using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R), a questionnaire focusing on past week neurotic symptoms. The presence of CMDs was defined as a CIS-R total score of 12 and above. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between living alone and CMDs, and to identify mediators in this association. The prevalence of CMDs was higher in individuals living alone than in those not living alone in all survey years. Multivariable analysis showed a positive association between living alone and CMDs in all survey years (1993: odds ratio [OR] = 1.69; 2000: OR = 1.63; and 2007: OR = 1.88). Overall, loneliness explained 84% of the living alone-CMD association. Living alone was positively associated with CMDs.

Consequently, people's perception of wild animals is based on what they see on (social) media. The way in which (social) media portrays non-domesticated animals determines our perception of and behaviour to these animals. People like to interact with animals, which is why venues which offer the opportunity to interact with non-domesticated animals are popular wildlife tourist attractions (WTAs). However, these WTAs more often than not profit at the expense of animal welfare, conservation and human safety. Participation in such WTAs should therefore be discouraged. Through (social) media we are regularly exposed to images of non-domesticated animals in close interactions with humans. Exposure to such images seems to blur the line between what is a friendly domesticated animal and what is a potentially dangerous wild animal. Such images may also increase our desire to engage in interactions with non-domesticated animals ourselves and reduce moral concerns about the use of non-domesticated animals for such interactions, thereby promoting WTAs in which tourists can interact with non-domesticated animals. Wild cat species are commonly used in the wildlife tourism industry to interact with tourists. In this study, we determine whether portrayal of wild cat species in interactions with humans promotes WTAs with wild cats. We presented respondents with an image of a wild cat species (lion, cheetah, caracal) in a control setting, walked by a human (WTA), petted by a human (WTA) or in the wild and asked them to answer a fixed set of questions. We found that portraying wild cat species in interactions with humans reduced the fear of wild cats, encouraged people to regard WTAs with wild cats as acceptable and stimulated them to participate in such activities themselves.",The sustainable impact of an educational approach to improve the appropriateness of laboratory test orders in the ICU.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042718,PloS one,2019 05 19,"Few studies described strategies to improve the use of diagnostic tests in intensive care units (ICU).

There is a close association between the anatomical characteristics and physiological and ecological functions of plants, but we still have a very limited knowledge of anatomical traits. For example, (1) we do not know if herbs and grasses have anatomical patterns similar to those of woody plants, and (2) the variation among different woody plants in the same ecosystem is unclear. In the present study, we analysed the anatomical structures of the fine root systems of various groups of vascular plants (ferns, eudicot herbs, monocots and woody plants) from the same ecosystem (a natural secondary forest on Mao'er Mountain, Heilongjiang, China) to answer the following questions: (1) How does the anatomy of the fine roots change with root order in various plant groups in the same ecosystem? (2) What is the pattern of variation within group? The results show that anatomical traits can be divided into 3 categories: traits that indicate the root capacity to transport resource along the root (stele diameter, xylem cell diameter and xylem cell area); traits that indicate absorptive capacity cortical thickness, (the number of cortical cell layers and the diameter of cortical cells); and traits that are integrated indicators (diameter and the stele to root diameter ratio). The traits indicate the root capacity to transport resource along the root order is generally similar among groups, but absorptive capacity is very different. The shift in function is the main factor influencing the fine root anatomy. Some traits show large variation within groups, but the variations in other traits are small. The traits indicate that the lower-order roots (absorbing roots) in distinct groups are of the first one or two root order in ferns, the first two or three orders in eudicot herbs, the first (only two root orders) or first two orders (more than three root orders) in monocots and the first four or five root orders in woody plants and the other roots are higher-order roots (transport roots).

The nuclear genome was found to be diploid, containing four chromosomes with sizes of ranging from 2.2 to 4.0 Mbp. A 75 Kbp mitochondrial genome was also identified. Comparing the homologous chromosomes, we detected that 0.32% of nucleotides were polymorphic, i.e. formed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 40.6% of them were found in coding regions (i.e. 0.13% of all nucleotides formed SNPs and were in coding regions). In addition, 8,538 indels were found. The total number of protein coding genes was 4897, of them, 4,284 were annotated on chromosomes; and the mitochondrial genome contained 18 protein coding genes. Additionally, 595 genes, which were annotated, were on contigs not associated with chromosomes. A number of genes was duplicated, most of them as tandem repeats, including a six-gene cluster located on chromosome 3. There were also examples of interchromosomal gene duplications, including a duplication of a six-gene cluster, which was found on both chromosomes 1 and 4. Gene copy number analysis suggested loss of heterozygosity for 372 genes. This may reflect adaptation to relatively harsh but constant conditions of continuous fermentation. Analysis of gene topology showed that most of these losses occurred in clusters of more than one gene, the largest cluster comprising 33 genes. Comparative analysis against the wine isolate CBS 2499 revealed 88,534 SNPs and 8,133 indels. Moreover, when the scaffolds of the CBS 2499 genome assembly were aligned against the chromosomes of CBS 11270, many of them aligned completely, some have chunks aligned to different chromosomes, and some were in fact rearranged.

However, the function of Amot and the Hippo pathway transcription coactivator Yap1 in the central nervous system remains unclear. We found that Amot is a critical mediator of dendritic morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal cells and Purkinje cells in the brain. Amot function in developing neurons depends on interactions with Yap1, which is also indispensable for dendrite growth and arborization in vitro. The conditional deletion of Amot and Yap1 in neurons led to a decrease in the complexity of Purkinje cell dendritic trees, abnormal cerebellar morphology, and impairments in motor coordination. Our results indicate that the function of Amot and Yap1 in dendrite growth does not rely on interactions with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors or the expression of Hippo pathway-dependent genes. Instead, Amot and Yap1 regulate dendrite development by affecting the phosphorylation of S6 kinase and its target S6 ribosomal protein.",Dynamic balance between vesicle transport and microtubule growth enables neurite outgrowth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042702,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 03,"Whole cell responses involve multiple subcellular processes (SCPs). To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.",Mouse genome-wide association and systems genetics identifies Lhfp as a regulator of bone mass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042701,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a strong predictor of osteoporotic fracture. It is also one of the most heritable disease-associated quantitative traits. As a result, there has been considerable effort focused on dissecting its genetic basis. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a panel of inbred strains to identify associations influencing BMD. This analysis identified a significant (P = 3.1 x 10-12) BMD locus on Chromosome 3@52.5 Mbp that replicated in two separate inbred strain panels and overlapped a BMD quantitative trait locus (QTL) previously identified in a F2 intercross. The association mapped to a 300 Kbp region containing four genes; Gm2447, Gm20750, Cog6, and Lhfp. Further analysis found that Lipoma HMGIC Fusion Partner (Lhfp) was highly expressed in bone and osteoblasts. Furthermore, its expression was regulated by a local expression QTL (eQTL), which overlapped the BMD association. A co-expression network analysis revealed that Lhfp was strongly connected to genes involved in osteoblast differentiation. To directly evaluate its role in bone, Lhfp deficient mice (Lhfp-/-) were created using CRISPR/Cas9. Consistent with genetic and network predictions, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from Lhfp-/- mice displayed increased osteogenic differentiation. Lhfp-/- mice also had elevated BMD due to increased cortical bone mass. Lastly, we identified SNPs in human LHFP that were associated (P = 1.2 x 10-5) with heel BMD. In conclusion, we used GWAS and systems genetics to identify Lhfp as a regulator of osteoblast activity and bone mass.",Detection of clinical and neurological signs in apparently asymptomatic HTLV-1 infected carriers: Association with high proviral load.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042700,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 10,"Several studies suggest that HTLV-1 infection may be associated with a wider spectrum of neurologic manifestations that do not meet diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP. These conditions may later progress to HAM/TSP or constitute an intermediate clinical form, between asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and those with full myelopathy. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of HTLV-1-associated disease in subjects without HAM/TSP, and the relationship between these findings with HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL).",Uncovering functional signature in neural systems via random matrix theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042698,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 10,"Neural systems are organized in a modular way, serving multiple functionalities. This multiplicity requires that both positive (e.g. excitatory, phase-coherent) and negative (e.g. inhibitory, phase-opposing) interactions take place across brain modules. Unfortunately, most methods to detect modules from time series either neglect or convert to positive, any measured negative correlation. This may leave a significant part of the sign-dependent functional structure undetected. Here we present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for the identification of sign-dependent modules in the brain. Our method filters out both local (unit-specific) noise and global (system-wide) dependencies that typically obfuscate the presence of such structure. The method is guaranteed to identify an optimally contrasted functional 'signature', i.e. a partition into modules that are positively correlated internally and negatively correlated across. The method is purely data-driven, does not use any arbitrary threshold or network projection, and outputs only statistically significant structure. In measurements of neuronal gene expression in the biological clock of mice, the method systematically uncovers two otherwise undetectable, negatively correlated modules whose relative size and mutual interaction strength are found to depend on photoperiod.",Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042697,Nature,2019 05 23,"Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.",Effects of MDMA on attention to positive social cues and pleasantness of affective touch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042696,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 05 07,"The psychostimulant drug Â±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) reportedly produces distinctive feelings of empathy and closeness with others. MDMA increases social behavior in animal models and has shown promise in psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). How it produces these prosocial effects is not known. This behavioral and psychophysiological study examined the effects of MDMA, compared with the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine (MA), on two measures of social behavior in healthy young adults: (i) responses to socially relevant, ""affective"" touch, and (ii) visual attention to emotional faces. Men and women (Nâ€‰=â€‰36) attended four sessions in which they received MDMA (0.75 or 1.5â€‰mg/kg), MA (20â€‰mg), or a placebo in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Responses to experienced and observed affective touch (i.e., being touched or watching others being touched) were assessed using facial electromyography (EMG), a proxy of affective state. Responses to emotional faces were assessed using electrooculography (EOG) in a measure of attentional bias. Subjective ratings were also included. We hypothesized that MDMA, but not MA, would enhance the ratings of pleasantness and psychophysiological responses to affective touch and increase attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. Consistent with this, we found that MDMA, but not MA, selectively enhanced ratings of pleasantness of experienced affective touch. Neither drug altered the ratings of pleasantness of observed touch. On the EOG measure of attentional bias, MDMA, but not MA, increased attention toward happy faces. These results provide new evidence that MDMA can enhance the experience of positive social interactions; in this case, pleasantness of physical touch and attentional bias toward positive facial expressions. The findings are consistent with evidence that the prosocial effects are unique to MDMA relative to another stimulant. Understanding the behavioral and neurobiological processes underlying the distinctive social effects of MDMA is a key step to developing the drug for psychiatric disorders.",Higher Expression of Linc00152 Promotes Bladder Cancer Proliferation and Metastasis by Activating the Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042695,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 10,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have demonstrated that Linc00152 is highly expressed in multiple cancer types and its genes show tumor-promoting characteristics. However, the efficacy and biological mechanism of Linc00152 in bladder cancer remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS We study investigated the relative expression and promoter methylation of Linc00152 in 126 cases of bladder cancer tissues by qRT-PCR and Bisulfite sequencing PCR. qRT-PCR was used to assess the relative expression of Linc00152 in 4 human bladder cancer cell lines. To explore the biological properties of Linc00152, we performed cell growth and soft-agar colony-formation assays, flow cytometry analyses, wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay. Western blot analysis was used to detect the underlying mechanisms of Linc00152 in bladder cancer. RESULTS We found that Linc00152 was highly expressed in 126 cases of bladder carcinoma tissues (p<0.001) and 4 cell lines (p<0.01), and Linc00152 is more commonly expressed in patients with advanced-stage cancer (p=0.021). Knockdown of Linc00152 by using siRNAs in bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and HT-1197) suppressed cell viability and growth by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (p<0.001), as well as inhibiting cell migration and invasion (p<0.001). In addition, the quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot results suggest that knockdown of Linc00152 reduced Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This research shows that Linc00152 is highly expressed in patients with bladder cancer and the possible carcinogenic effect of Linc00152 in bladder cancer occurs through activating the Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling pathway, and could be a new biomarker for diagnosis and prevention of this cancer.",Risks of Completed Suicide of Community Individuals with ICD-10 Disorders Across Age Groups: A Nationwide Population-Based Nested Case-Control Study in South Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042694,Psychiatry investigation,2019 05 21,"Suicide is the leading cause of death in 10-39-year-olds in South Korea, and the second highest rate among the OECD countries.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 04,"The interaction of charges in dielectric materials is screened by the dielectric constant of the bulk dielectric. In dielectric theories, screening is assigned to surface charges appearing from preferential orientations of dipoles along the local field in the interface. For liquid dielectrics, such interfacial orientations are affected by the interfacial structure characterized by a separate interfacial dipolar susceptibility. We argue that dielectric properties of polar liquids should be characterized by two distinct susceptibilities responsible for local response (solvation) and long-range response (dielectric screening). A microscopic model for dipolar screening in polar liquids is developed here. It shows that the standard bulk dielectric constant is responsible for screening at large distances. The potential of mean force between ions in polar liquids becomes oscillatory at short distances. Oscillations arise from the coupling of collective longitudinal excitations (dipolarons) of the polar liquid with its interfacial density profile. Interfacial electrostatics demonstrates a crossover beyond the solute radius ofâ€‰â€‰âˆ¼1â€‰nm from the scaling laws roughly consistent with continuum expectations for small solutes to new scaling trends characterizing the much softer nano-scale solute-solvent interface. This crossover also marks the transition to a continuum-type electrostatic screening between ions, when short-distance oscillation of the potential of mean force become strongly damped. Screening oscillations are enhanced for more structured interfaces.",Photogalvanic effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under double illumination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042680,Journal of physics.

It is found that, in such conditions, the steady photocurrent appears. The effect originates from the valley-selective pumping by the circular-polarized light, the trigonal symmetry of the valleys and the linear polarization of intraband electromagnetic field, that produces a polar in-plane asymmetry of the electron and hole distribution functions, leading to the photocurrent. The approach is based on the solution of the classical kinetic equation for carriers with accounting for the quantum interband excitation.",A highly sensitive and low-background fluorescence assay for pesticides residues based on hybridization chain reaction amplification assisted by magnetic separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042679,Methods and applications in fluorescence,2019 05 16,"Due to the concern over food safety, it is important to detect the pesticides residues in agricultural products. Here, a highly sensitive and low background fluorescent strategy for the detection of pesticides residues has been developed. The fluorescence intensity of N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) binding G-quadruplex could be turn off because of inhibiting effect of the pesticides on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. For that, four single-stranded DNAs (named linker, trigger, H1 and H2, respectively) are rational designed and T-Hg-T mismatches duplex DNAs as a recognizer combined with the separation of magnetic beads. The design of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy assisted by magnetic separation has been adopted to improve the detection sensitivity. In the presence of pesticides, the amount of the thiol group generated by hydrolysis reaction of acetylcholine (ACh) is reduced, lead to release of less trigger DNA. Therefor subsequent HCR process is retarded with decreased fluorescence intensity. The reduced fluorescence intensity has a quantitative relationship with the pesticide concentration. The limit of detection of chlorpyrifos was estimated to be 2.0 ng ml-1. It has been applied to detect the pesticides residues in real samples.",Interplay Between Primary Cilia and Autophagy and Its Controversial Roles in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042678,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2019 05 02,"Primary cilia and autophagy are two distinct nutrient-sensing machineries required for maintaining intracellular energy homeostasis, either via signal transduction or recycling of macromolecules from cargo breakdown, respectively.

OPLL is developed mostly in the cervical spine and clinical presentations of OPLL are majorly myelopathy and/or radiculopathy, with serious neurological pathology resulting in paralysis of extremities and disturbances of motility lowering the quality of life. OPLL is known to be an idiopathic and multifactorial disease, which genetic factors and non-genetic factors including diet, obesity, physical strain on the posterior longitudinal ligament, age, and diabetes mellitus, are involved into the pathogenesis. Up to now, surgical management by decompressing the spinal cord is regarded as standard treatment for OPLL, although there might be the risk of development of reprogression of ossification. The molecular pathogenesis and efficient therapeutic strategy, especially pharmacotherapy and/or preventive intervention, of OPLL has not been clearly elucidated and suggested. Therefore, in this review, we tried to give an overview to the present research results on OPLL, in order to shed light on the potential pharmacotherapy based on molecular pathophysiologic aspect of OPLL, especially on the genetic/genomic factors involved into the etiology of OPLL.",Arg-Leu-Tyr-Glu Suppresses Retinal Endothelial Permeability and Choroidal Neovascularization by Inhibiting the VEGF Receptor 2 Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042676,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2019 05 02,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pivotal role in pathologic ocular neovascularization and vascular leakage via activation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). This study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic mechanisms and effects of the tetrapeptide Arg-Leu-Tyr-Glu (RLYE), a VEGFR2 inhibitor, in the development of vascular permeability and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In cultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs), treatment with RLYE blocked VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2, Akt, ERK, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to suppression of VEGFA-mediated hyper-production of NO. Treatment with RLYE also inhibited VEGF-A-stimulated angiogenic processes (migration, proliferation, and tube formation) and the hyperpermeability of HRMECs, in addition to attenuating VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability in mice. The anti-vascular permeability activity of RLYE was correlated with enhanced stability and positioning of the junction proteins VE-cadherin, Î²-catenin, claudin-5, and ZO-1, critical components of the cortical actin ring structure and retinal endothelial barrier, at the boundary between HRMECs stimulated with VEGF-A. Furthermore, intravitreally injected RLYE bound to retinal microvascular endothelium and inhibited laser-induced CNV in mice. These findings suggest that RLYE has potential as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of CNV by preventing VEGFR2-mediated vascular leakage and angiogenesis.",DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Evaluation of bone fragility in endocrine disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042675,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 02,"An underlying disease affecting bone health is present in up to 40% and 60% of osteoporotic post-menopausal women and men respectively. Among the disorders leading to a secondary form of osteoporosis, the endocrine diseases are highly represented. A frequent finding in patients affected with an endocrine-related forms of bone disease is that the skeletal fragility is partially independent of the bone density, since the fracture risk in these patients is related more to a reduction of bone quality than to a decrease of bone mass. As a consequence, bone mineral density evaluation by dual-X-ray Absorptiometry may be inadequate for establishing the risk of fracture in the setting of the endocrine-related forms of osteoporosis. In the recent years several attempts to non-invasively estimating bone quality have been done. Nowadys, some new tools are available in the clinical practice for optimizing the fracture risk estimation in patients with endocrine disorders. The aim of this review is to summarise the evidences regarding the role of the different imaging tools for evaluating bone density and bone quality in the most frequent forms of endocrine-related osteoporosis, such as obesity, diabetes, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercortisolism and hypogonadism.

CF-1 female mice were administered with 10% ethanol in drinking water for 17 days prior to and up to day 10 of gestation. Control females received water without ethanol. Treated females had reduced frequency of implantation sites with expanded vascular lumen (p<0.05), Î±-SMA-immunoreactive spiral arteries in proximal mesometrial decidua, reduced PCNA-positive endothelial cells (p<0.01) and diminished uterine NK cell numbers (p<0.05) in proximal decidua compared to controls. The VEGF expression (laser capture microscopy, RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry) was reduced in decidual tissue after perigestational alcohol consumption (p<0.05). The uNK-DBA+ cells of treated females had reduced VEGF immunoexpression compared to controls (p<0.01). Very low decidual and endothelial cell KDR immunoreactivity and reduced decidual gene and protein KDR expression was found in treated females compared to controls (p<0.001). Instead, strong FLT-1 immunoexpression was detected in decidual and uNK cells (p<0.05) in the proximal decidua from treated females compared to controls. In conclusion, perigestational alcohol ingestion induces the reduction of lumen expansion of spiral arteries, concomitant with reduced endothelial cell proliferation and uNK cell population, and uncompleted remodeling of the artery smooth muscle. These effects were supported by low decidual VEGF and KDR gene and protein expression and increased FLT-1 expression, suggesting that VEGF and KDR reduction may contribute, in part, to mechanisms involved in deficient decidual angiogenesis after perigestational alcohol consumption in mouse.",Suppressive effect of melatonin on osteoclast function via osteocyte calcitonin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042672,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 05 02,"Many studies have investigated the actions of melatonin on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. However, the underlying mechanisms, especially regarding osteocyte function, remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of melatonin action on bone tissue via osteocyte function. Chick calvariae were employed as a model. In ovo injection of melatonin (5, 50 and 500 Âµg) dose-dependently decreased the mRNA expression levels of cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in chick calvariae without affecting the expression levels of receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand or osteoprotegerin. Surprisingly enough, the expression of calcitonin mRNA in chick calvariae was significantly raised. After 3 days of in vitro treatment of melatonin (10-7 and 10-5 M) on newly hatched chick calvariae, both calcitonin mRNA expression in calvariae and the concentration of calcitonin in cultured medium were augmented in a dose-dependent manner, coincident with the decreased mRNA expression levels of cathepsin K and MMP9. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the expression of the melatonin receptors and calcitonin by osteocytes buried in bone matrix. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of melatonin receptors, calcitonin and sclerostin (a marker of osteocyte) were strongly and positively correlated. In conclusion, we demonstrated the expression of the melatonin receptors and calcitonin expression in osteocytes for the first time, and suggest a new mechanism underlying the suppressive effect of melatonin on osteoclasts via up-regulation of calcitonin secretion by osteocytes."

Individualized prediction tools can provide valuable insights for shared decision-making. The authors aim to evaluate the feasibility of predicting short- and long-term PROMs, reoperations, and perioperative parameters by machine learning (ML) methods.METHODSData were derived from a prospective registry. All patients had undergone single- or multilevel mini-open facet-sparing decompression for LSS. The prediction models were trained using various ML-based algorithms to predict the endpoints of interest. Models were selected by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The endpoints were dichotomized by minimum clinically important difference (MCID) and included 6-week and 12-month numeric rating scales for back pain (NRS-BP) and leg pain (NRS-LP) severity and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), as well as prolonged surgery (> 45 minutes), extended length of hospital stay (> 28 hours), and reoperations.RESULTSA total of 635 patients were included. The average age was 62 Â± 10 years, and 333 patients (52%) were male. At 6 weeks, MCID was seen in 63%, 76%, and 61% of patients for ODI, NRS-LP, and NRS-BP, respectively. At internal validation, the models predicted MCID in these variables with accuracies of 69%, 76%, and 85%, and with AUCs of 0.75, 0.79, and 0.92. At 12 months, 66%, 63%, and 51% of patients reported MCID; the observed accuracies were 62%, 74%, and 66%, with AUCs of 0.68, 0.72, and 0.79. Reoperations occurred in 60 patients (9.5%), of which 27 (4.3%) occurred at the index level. Overall and index-level reoperations were predicted with 69% and 63% accuracy, respectively, and with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.61. In 15%, a length of surgery greater than 45 minutes was observed and predicted with 78% accuracy and AUC of 0.54. Only 15% of patients were admitted to the hospital for longer than 28 hours. The developed ML-based model enabled prediction of extended hospital stay with an accuracy of 77% and AUC of 0.58.CONCLUSIONSPreoperative prediction of a range of clinically relevant endpoints in decompression surgery for LSS using ML is feasible, and may enable enhanced informed patient consent and personalized shared decision-making.

The bone mineral density (BMD) of the S1 body and L1 was measured in HU with preoperative lumbar CT. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on midaxial and midsagittal images of the S1 body. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the criterion of L1 HU â‰¤ 110 HU were used to diagnose osteoporosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the use of HUs of the S1 body to diagnose osteoporosis.RESULTSThe interobserver and intraobserver reliability of measuring HU of the S1 body was excellent with intraclass correlation coefficients over 0.8 (p < 0.001). The correlation between HUs of the S1 body and average T-score of L1-4 was significant with Pearson correlation coefficients â‰¥ 0.60 (p < 0.001). The AUCs for using HUs of the S1 body to diagnose osteoporosis were 0.86 and 0.88 for axial HU and sagittal HU, respectively (p < 0.001). The HU thresholds with balanced sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing osteoporosis were 202 HU for axial HU (sensitivity: 76%; specificity: 76%) and 185 HU for sagittal HU (sensitivity: 80%; specificity: 80%).CONCLUSIONSBoth sagittal and axial HUs of the S1 body are useful tools for assessing BMD and diagnosing osteoporosis. Measuring HUs of the S1 body preoperatively from lumbar CT may help with surgical planning for patients with lumbar degenerative diseases.",The biomechanical effect of single-level laminectomy and posterior instrumentation on spinal stability in degenerative lumbar scoliosis: a human cadaveric study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042658,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVEDegenerative lumbar scoliosis, or de novo degenerative lumbar scoliosis, can result in spinal canal stenosis, which is often accompanied by disabling symptoms. When surgically treated, a single-level laminectomy is performed and short-segment posterior instrumentation is placed to restore stability. However, the effects of laminectomy on spinal stability and the necessity of placing posterior instrumentation are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the stability of lumbar spines with degenerative scoliosis, characterized by the range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) stiffness, after laminectomy and placement of posterior instrumentation.METHODSTen lumbar cadaveric spines (T12-L5) with a Cobb angle â‰¥ 10Â° and an apex on L3 were included. Three loading cycles were applied per direction, from -4 Nm to 4 Nm in flexion/extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). Biomechanical evaluation was performed on the native spines and after subsequent L3 laminectomy and the placement of posterior L2-4 titanium rods and pedicle screws. Nonparametric and parametric tests were used to analyze the effects of laminectomy and posterior instrumentation on NZ stiffness and ROM, respectively, both on an individual segment's motion and on the entire spine section. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to study the correlation between disc degeneration and spinal stability.RESULTSThe laminectomy increased ROM by 9.5% in FE (p = 0.04) and 4.6% in LB (p = 0.01). For NZ stiffness, the laminectomy produced no significant effects. Posterior instrumentation resulted in a decrease in ROM in all loading directions (-22.2%, -24.4%, and -17.6% for FE, LB, and AR, respectively; all p < 0.05) and an increase in NZ stiffness (+44.7%, +51.7%, and +35.2% for FE, LB, and AR, respectively; all p < 0.05). The same changes were seen in the individual segments around the apex, while the adjacent, untreated segments were mostly unaffected. Intervertebral disc degeneration was found to be positively correlated to decreased ROM and increased NZ stiffness.CONCLUSIONSLaminectomy in lumbar spines with degenerative scoliosis did not result in severe spinal instability, whereas posterior instrumentation resulted in a rigid construct. Also, prior to surgery, the spines already had lower ROM and higher NZ stiffness in comparison to values shown in earlier studies on nonscoliotic spines of the same age. Hence, the authors question the clinical need for posterior instrumentation to avoid instability.",Comparison of full-endoscopic and minimally invasive decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis in the setting of degenerative scoliosis and spondylolisthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042656,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVEThe management of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with concurrent scoliosis and/or spondylolisthesis remains controversial.

The safety and efficacy of full-endoscopic versus minimally invasive surgery (MIS) ULBD in this patient population is studied here for the first time.METHODSA retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on 45 consecutive LSS patients with concurrent scoliosis (â‰¥ 10Â° coronal Cobb angle) and/or spondylolisthesis (â‰¥ 3 mm). Patient demographics, operative details, complications, and imaging characteristics were reviewed. Outcomes were quantified using back and leg visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year.RESULTSA total of 26 patients underwent full-endoscopic and 19 underwent MIS-ULBD with an average follow-up period of 12 months. The endoscopic cohort experienced a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (p = 0.014) and fewer adverse events (p = 0.010). Both cohorts experienced significant improvements in VAS and ODI scores at all time points (p < 0.001), but the endoscopic cohort demonstrated significantly better early ODI scores (p = 0.024).CONCLUSIONSEndoscopic and MIS-ULBD result in similar functional outcomes for LSS with mild to moderate deformity, while the endoscopic approach demonstrates a favorable rate of complications.

PROs included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), numeric rating scale (NRS) for back pain, NRS for leg pain, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and North American Spine Society (NASS) satisfaction questionnaire. Multivariate models were constructed to adjust for patient characteristics, surgical variables, and baseline PRO values.RESULTSThe mean age of the MIS cohort was 67.1 Â± 11.3 years (MIS TLIF 62.1 years vs MIS decompression 72.3 years) and consisted of 79 (55.2%) women (MIS TLIF 55.6% vs MIS decompression 54.9%). The proportion in each cohort reaching the 24-month follow-up did not differ significantly between the cohorts (MIS TLIF 83.3% and MIS decompression 84.5%, p = 0.85). MIS TLIF was associated with greater blood loss (mean 108.8 vs 33.0 ml, p < 0.001), longer operative time (mean 228.2 vs 101.8 minutes, p < 0.001), and longer length of hospitalization (mean 2.9 vs 0.7 days, p < 0.001). MIS TLIF was associated with a significantly lower reoperation rate (14.1% vs 1.4%, p = 0.004). Both cohorts demonstrated significant improvements in ODI, NRS back pain, NRS leg pain, and EQ-5D at 24 months (p < 0.001, all comparisons relative to baseline). In multivariate analyses, MIS TLIF-as opposed to MIS decompression alone-was associated with superior ODI change (Î² = -7.59, 95% CI -14.96 to -0.23; p = 0.04), NRS back pain change (Î² = -1.54, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.30; p = 0.02), and NASS satisfaction (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.82; p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONSFor symptomatic, single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis, MIS TLIF was associated with a lower reoperation rate and superior outcomes for disability, back pain, and patient satisfaction compared with posterior MIS decompression alone. This finding may aid surgical decision-making when considering MIS for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.",Upright MRI after decompression of spinal stenosis and concurrent spondylolisthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042654,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVEThe treatment of patients with spinal stenosis and concurrent degenerative spondylolisthesis is controversial. Two large randomized controlled clinical trials reported contradictory results. The authors hypothesized that a substantial number of patients will show evidence of micro-instability after a sole decompression procedure.METHODSThis study was a retrospective analysis of all cases of lumbar spinal stenosis treated at the Frankfurt University Clinic (UniversitÃ¤tsklinik Frankfurt) from 2010 through 2013. Patients who had associated spondylolisthesis underwent upright MRI studies in flexion and extension for identification of subtle signs of micro-instability. Clinical outcome was assessed by means of SF-36 bodily pain (BP) and physical functioning (PF) scales.RESULTSA total of 21 patients were recruited to undergo upright MRI studies. The mean duration of follow-up was 65 months (SD 16 months). Of these 21 patients, 10 (47%) showed signs of micro-instability as defined by movement of > 4 mm on flexion/extension MRI. Comparison of mean SF-36 BP and PF scores in the group of patients who showed micro-instability versus those who did not showed no statistically significant difference on either scale.CONCLUSIONSThere seems to be a substantial subset of patients who develop morphological micro-instability after sole decompression procedures but do not experience any clinically significant effect of the instability.",Predictive model for long-term patient satisfaction after surgery for grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: insights from the Quality Outcomes Database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042653,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVESince the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, providers and hospitals have increasingly prioritized patient-centered outcomes such as patient satisfaction in an effort to adapt the ""value""-based healthcare model. In the current study, the authors queried a prospectively maintained multiinstitutional spine registry to construct a predictive model for long-term patient satisfaction among patients undergoing surgery for Meyerding grade I lumbar spondylolisthesis.METHODSThe authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database for patients undergoing surgery for grade I lumbar spondylolisthesis between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2016. The primary outcome of interest for the current study was patient satisfaction as measured by the North American Spine Surgery patient satisfaction index, which is measured on a scale of 1-4, with 1 indicating most satisfied and 4 indicating least satisfied. In order to identify predictors of higher satisfaction, the authors fitted a multivariable proportional odds logistic regression model for â‰¥ 2 years of patient satisfaction after adjusting for an array of clinical and patient-specific factors. The absolute importance of each covariate in the model was computed using an importance metric defined as Wald chi-square penalized by the predictor degrees of freedom.RESULTSA total of 502 patients, out of a cohort of 608 patients (82.5%) with grade I lumbar spondylolisthesis, undergoing either 1- or 2-level decompression (22.5%, n = 113) or 1-level decompression and fusion (77.5%, n = 389), met the inclusion criteria; of these, 82.1% (n = 412) were satisfied after 2 years. On univariate analysis, satisfied patients were more likely to be employed and working (41.7%, n = 172, vs 24.4%, n = 22; overall p = 0.001), more likely to present with predominant leg pain (23.1%, n = 95, vs 11.1%, n = 10; overall p = 0.02) but more likely to present with lower Numeric Rating Scale score for leg pain (median and IQR score: 7 [5-9] vs 8 [6-9]; p = 0.05). Multivariable proportional odds logistic regression revealed that older age (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.09-2.76; p = 0.009), preoperative active employment (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.67; p = 0.015), and fusion surgery (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.30-4.06; p = 0.002) were the most important predictors of achieving satisfaction with surgical outcome.CONCLUSIONSCurrent findings from a large multiinstitutional study indicate that most patients undergoing surgery for grade I lumbar spondylolisthesis achieved long-term satisfaction. Moreover, the authors found that older age, preoperative active employment, and fusion surgery are associated with higher odds of achieving satisfaction.","Reduction and monosegmental fusion for lumbar spondylolisthesis with a long tab percutaneous pedicle screw system: ""swing"" technique.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042652,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVEWith the development of minimally invasive procedures, percutaneous pedicle screw systems have been used to attempt to correct spondylolisthesis. No previous studies have reported on reduction measures using long tab percutaneous pedicle screws for spondylolisthesis. Additional intraoperative correction has been proposed with the ""swing"" technique. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of standard minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) with the efficacy of MIS-TLIF with the ""swing"" technique (MIS-TLIF and swing) in lumbar spondylolisthesis.METHODSThis was a matched-control study and included 30 consecutive patients who were followed up for 6 months after surgery. Of those patients, 15 were treated with operative reduction via MIS-TLIF with the ""swing"" technique, whereas the other 15 were treated with the standard MIS-TLIF procedure. The swing technique is a new reduction procedure for use with long tab percutaneous screws. In the swing technique, the entire system is swung back and forth several times after all constructs are placed. Only patients with Meyerding grade I or II lumbar spondylolisthesis were included in the study (18 with grade I and 12 with grade II). Perioperative and clinical outcomes, radiological parameters (Meyerding grade, percentage of slip, slip correction rate, segmental lordosis, and lumbar lordosis) were compared between groups at 6 months after surgery.RESULTSDemographic data did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Postoperative clinical outcomes showed significant improvement in both groups. Postoperative radiological parameters showed that the degree of spondylolisthesis (swing: 4.7% vs standard: 8.9%) and reduction rate (swing: 77.3% vs standard: 57.1%) favored the swing group. The swing technique effectively decreased the degree of spondylolisthesis (swing: 24.1% to 4.7% vs standard: 21.8% to 8.9%). No complications related to the procedure were reported.CONCLUSIONSMIS-TLIF with the ""swing"" technique with long tab percutaneous pedicle screws is a safe and effective reduction method for monosegmental spondylolisthesis. This technique cannot only alleviate symptoms but also achieve nearly completely reduction of slippage.",Radiographic outcomes of endoscopic decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042651,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVELumbar central stenosis can theoretically be decompressed with minimal bone removal via an endoscopic approach. Although multiple studies have demonstrated an adequate radiographic decompression, none has quantified the volume of bone removal after endoscopic decompression. The objective of this study was to quantify the 3D volume of bone removed from the lamina and facet joints during endoscopic decompression for lumbar central and lateral recess stenosis.METHODSThis retrospective study included adults with lumbar spinal stenosis who underwent endoscopic decompression of a single level or 2 noncontiguous lumbar levels. Central stenosis on MRI was graded preoperatively and postoperatively using the Schizas scale. A computer program was developed in MATLAB to semiautomatically perform a 3D volumetric analysis of preoperative and postoperative lumbar CT scans. The volumetric percentage of bone removed from the lamina and facet joints ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of approach was quantified.RESULTSNineteen patients with 21 treated lumbar levels were included in the study. Preoperatively, the number of levels with Schizas stenosis grades B, C, and D were 5, 12, and 4, respectively. Stenosis grades improved postoperatively to grades A, B, C, and D for 17, 3, 1, and 0 levels, respectively. All levels improved by at least 1 stenosis grade. The volumetric percentage of laminar bone removed was 15.5% (95% CI 11.2%-19.8%, p < 0.001) from the ipsilateral lamina and 8.8% (95% CI 5.7%-11.8%, p < 0.001) from the contralateral lamina. The percentage of facet joint resection was 5.3% (95% CI 4.2%-6.4%, p < 0.001) and 4.3% (95% CI 2.2%-6.4%, p < 0.001) for the ipsilateral and contralateral facet joints, respectively. Average pain scores, as measured by the visual analog scale, improved from 7.9 preoperatively to 2.2 by 3-10 months postoperatively (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONSEndoscopic lumbar decompression achieves improvement in the radiographic grade of lumbar central stenosis with minimal bone removal from the lamina and facet joints. Future prospective studies are needed to validate the findings of this study with more comprehensive clinical outcomes.",Long-term clinical outcomes after bilateral laminotomy or total laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis: a single-institution experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042648,Neurosurgical focus,2019 05 02,"OBJECTIVELumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most common spinal disease in the geriatric population, and is characterized by a compression of the lumbosacral neural roots from a narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal. LSS can result in symptomatic compression of the neural elements, requiring surgical treatment if conservative management fails. Different surgical techniques with or without fusion are currently treatment options. The purpose of this study was to provide a description of the long-term clinical outcomes of patients who underwent bilateral laminotomy compared with total laminectomy for LSS.METHODSThe authors retrospectively reviewed all the patients treated surgically by the senior author for LSS with total laminectomy and bilateral laminotomy with a minimum of 10 years of follow-up. Patients were divided into 2 treatment groups (total laminectomy, group 1; and bilateral laminotomy, group 2) according to the type of surgical decompression. Clinical outcomes measures included the visual analog scale (VAS), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). In addition, surgical parameters, reoperation rate, and complications were evaluated in both groups.RESULTSTwo hundred fourteen patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (105 and 109 patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively). The mean age at surgery was 69.5 years (range 58-77 years). Comparing pre- and postoperative values, both groups showed improvement in ODI and SF-36 scores; at final follow-up, a slightly better improvement was noted in the laminotomy group (mean ODI value 22.8, mean SF-36 value 70.2), considering the worse preoperative scores in this group (mean ODI value 70, mean SF-36 value 38.4) with respect to the laminectomy group (mean ODI 68.7 vs mean SF-36 value 36.3), but there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. Significantly, in group 2 there was a lower incidence of reoperations (15.2% vs 3.7%, p = 0.0075).CONCLUSIONSBilateral laminotomy allows adequate and safe decompression of the spinal canal in patients with LSS; this technique ensures a significant improvement in patients' symptoms, disability, and quality of life. Clinical outcomes are similar in both groups, but a lower incidence of complications and iatrogenic instability has been shown in the long term in the bilateral laminotomy group."

Metformin, one of the biguanides used for the treatment of diabetes, is also known to reduce the risk of cancer development and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), including the expression of CD133. However, the mechanism underlying the reduction of the expression of CD133 by metformin is not yet understood. This study shows that metformin suppressed CD133 expression mainly by affecting the CD133 P1 promoter via adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling but not the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). AMPK inhibition rescued the reduction of CD133 by metformin. Further experiments demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPÎ²) was upregulated by metformin and that two isoforms of CEBPÎ² reciprocally regulated the expression of CD133. Specifically, the liver-enriched activator protein (LAP) isoform increased the expression of CD133 by directly binding to the P1 promoter region, whereas the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) isoform suppressed the expression of CD133. Consistent with these findings, a three dimensional (3D) culture assay and drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that LAP-overexpressing cells formed large spheroids and were more resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment, whereas LIP-overexpressing cells were more sensitive to 5-FU and showed combined effects with metformin. Our results indicated that metformin-AMPK-CEBPÎ² signaling plays a crucial role in regulating the gene expression of CD133. Additionally, regulating the ratio of LAP/LIP may be a novel strategy for targeting CSCs for the treatment of cancer.",In-situ burning with chemical herders for Arctic oil spill response: Meta-analysis and review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042623,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 13,"With increased oil exploration and marine activity in the warming Arctic, there is an increased risk of future oil spills in the Arctic region. In-situ burning (ISB), along with the use of chemical herders (to thicken the slick of spilled oil) has emerged as a potentially viable oil-spill response technique for various Arctic scenarios. The purpose of this research review is to document the field use, research, and analysis regarding the use of ISB to address an offshore oil spill response in the Arctic, with a specific focus on the use of chemical herders to aid ISB in Arctic waters. The compilation of this work involved a systematic review of available experimental data, studies on actual spill-response events, and resulting recommendations on this topic. Both peer-reviewed and available gray literature from the early 1970s through 2018 were evaluated. Selection criteria centered on herders for use with ISBs, Arctic conditions as they relate to ISB, and operational windows of opportunity and environmental risk for this type of oil spill response. From the available literature, more than a hundred articles are referenced herein, and annotated summaries provided. There is general agreement that ISB should be classified as a viable response option for the Arctic offshore to be implemented as part of a multi-layered approach (ASTM 2014; Fritt-Rasmussen et al. 2017; NRC 2014; Rolandsen 2018). In addition, there continue to be gaps noted concerning the availability of monitoring/surveillance personnel and equipment, and logistical/safety considerations for working in the Arctic, as well as specific information on the fate and potential impact of herders and burn residue on Arctic receptors (NRC 2014; Nuka 2016; US-DOI and USGS 2011). This review provides background information for researchers, responders, decision-makers, communities, and is a resource when developing and approving an oil spill response plan or planning future research which includes the use of ISB and herders.",A 30-year record reveals re-equilibration rates of 137Cs in marine biota after the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident: Concentration ratios in pre- and post-event conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042622,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 07,"Concentration ratios (CRs), expressed by dividing 137Cs activity in seawater by that in marine biota (mainly fish), were obtained from the monitoring of 137Cs in coastal areas around Japan between 1984 and 2016. Before the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident (1984-2010), mean CRs of 137Cs, mainly from global fallout (i.e. CRGF), were almost constant for each species throughout the monitoring period, but were different among species, while the values for several species were dependent on their length (i.e. CRGF-SIZE). Thus, CRGF and CRGF-SIZE values for 29 of marketable species are given here as references for conditions where marine biota are in approximate equilibrium (or steady state) with their host water with respect to 137Cs activities in the marine environment. After the FDNPP accident (2011-2016), the impact of the accident has been sustained in eastern Japan waters as indicated by apparent CRs (CRas) which are being used here as indicators of disequilibrium between organisms and their host water. The recession rates of this disequilibrium (the effective CRa half-lives) ranged from 100 to 1100â€¯days. The identified distinct variation was due to the sample locations, even for the same species, because of the change in 137Cs activity concentrations in their host water and diet preference differences. Variation among species, even those captured from the same area, was mainly due to diet differences as well as metabolic-physiological differences in 137Cs retention. Thus, our results from >30â€¯years of systematically monitoring have helped quantify the recession rates of post-FDNPP disequilibrium of 137Cs in biota for assessment of how long term is required from contaminated condition by underlying spatial, inter- and intra-species factors.",Chronic repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on sleeping quality and mood status in drug dependent male inpatients during abstinence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042621,Sleep medicine,2019 06 14,Drug abstinence is accompanied by aversive experiences and lasting changes in mood status and worsening sleep quality.

In particular, limited information is available on the effects of metals on scleractinian corals which are foundation species that form vital structural habitats supporting other biota. This study investigated the effects of dissolved nickel and copper on the coral Acropora muricata and its associated microbiota. Corals collected from the Great Barrier Reef were exposed to dissolved nickel (45, 90, 470, 900 and 9050â€¯Î¼g Ni/L) or copper (4, 11, 32 and 65â€¯Î¼g Cu/L) in flow through chambers at the National Sea Simulator, Townsville, Qld, Australia. After a 96-h exposure DNA metabarcoding (16S rDNA and 18S rDNA) was undertaken on all samples to detect changes in the structure of the coral microbiome. The controls remained healthy throughout the study period. After 36â€¯h, bleaching was only observed in corals exposed to 32 and 65â€¯Î¼g Cu/L and very high nickel concentrations (9050â€¯Î¼g Ni/L). At 96â€¯h, significant discolouration of corals was only observed in 470 and 900â€¯Î¼g Ni/L treatments, the highest concentrations tested. While high concentrations of nickel caused bleaching, no changes in the composition of their microbiome communities were observed. In contrast, exposure to copper not only resulted in bleaching, but altered the composition of both the eukaryote and bacterial communities of the coral's microbiomes. Our findings showed that these effects were only evident at relatively high concentrations of nickel and copper, reflecting concentrations observed only in extremely polluted environments. Elevated metal concentrations have the capacity to alter the microbiomes which are inherently linked to coral health.","Synthesis, inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo characterization of new benzoxazole and benzothiazole-based sigma receptor ligands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042618,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"A new set of 5-chlorobenzoxazole- and 5-chlorobenzothiazole-based derivatives containing the azepane ring as a basic moiety was designed, synthesized and evaluated through binding assays to measure their affinity and selectivity towards Ïƒ1 and Ïƒ2 receptors.

Recent evidence indicates that multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) can potentially provide an effective strategy to develop innovative therapies directed towards the onset and progression of this multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder. In this work we designed, synthesized and evaluated a new series of MTDLs bearing the rivastigmine skeleton (ChE-inhibitor) linked to known metal-chelating moieties with linkers of different length. For all the novel derivatives, AChE/BuChE inhibitory activity, ROS scavenging activity and potential cytotoxicity have been assessed. For the best compound (4), copper chelating properties and neuroprotective effects were also evaluated. Our data demonstrated that hybrid derivative 4 is able to effectively inhibit AChE and BuChE and to chelate copper, showing a protective action on neurons.

However, complexities associated with parameter interactions and their spatial heterogeneity may introduce high uncertainty in the parameterization of a PBHM. The Budyko curve framework offers an effective approach for evaluating the variability in the water balance components from a PBHM and can be used to explore the link between model performance with parameter heterogeneities and the Budyko curve characteristics. In this work a PBHM was calibrated using a multi-site calibration strategy, which was built upon a step-wise calibration algorithm combined with multiple calibration targets including river discharges, evapotranspiration and ground water heads, to reduce compensation errors caused by component interactions. This strategy was used for the Kalamazoo River watershed in Michigan, USA, with obvious physiographic and land surface heterogeneities. The Budyko framework characterized the water balance variability at the sub-watershed scale; two empirical methods were used to evaluate the calibrated PBHM parameters using Budyko-estimated values and to assess the physical relevance of the parameters. The relative infiltration capacity is found to play an important role in affecting the spatial variability of the annual water balance of this watershed. This work brings out the importance of optimizing calibration strategies by linking catchment heterogeneities with processes reasoning in order to understand the underlying hydrologic controls.",CHK1-CENP B/MAD2 is associated with mild oxidative damage-induced sex chromosome aneuploidy of male mouse embryos during in vitro fertilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042615,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 05 19,"A high incidence of aneuploidy is observed in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived embryos, but the formation and repair mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of slightly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by in vitro culture conditions on embryo aneuploidy and the roles of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein, mitotic arrest-deficient 2 (MAD2), and the DNA damage response (DDR) protein, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), in aneuploidy repair. By assessing chromosome abnormalities via DAPI staining, karyotype analysis and next-generation sequencing technology, we demonstrated that mild oxidative damage mainly increased the risk of sex chromosome aneuploidy in male mouse embryos (41,XXY,+X and 41,XYY,+Y) through chromosome mis-segregation during the first mitosis. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation technology revealed that mild oxidative damage inhibited the expression of male reproduction-related proteins, including a kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4), whose gene is located on mouse/human Chromosome X. Under mild oxidative damage, abrogation of MAD2 by MAD2 inhibitor-1 (M2I-1) or CHK1 by siRNA microinjection increased sex chromosome mosaicism rate and reduced mitosis-promoting factor (MPF) activity. CHK1 inhibition also reduced kinetochore localization of centromere protein B (CENP B) and MAD2. These findings show that DDR and SAC are responsible for repair of sex chromosome mosaicism via the pCHK1 (S345)-CENP B/MAD2-MPF pathway; further, IVF may have negative effects on male offspring's reproduction ability, which ultimately depends on their continued repair capability. Therefore, we suggest that antioxidants, especially those targeting improved CHK1-MAD2 function, may be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce aneuploidy formation of IVF-derived embryos and to maintain genome integrity of embryo and offspring."

From 1986 to 1994 Dr. Selby was teaching different graduate courses at department of psychology at East Texas State University at Texarkana. He became a pioneer of spinal surgery and founded Lumbar Spine Society. Dr Selby was a world citizen neurosurgeon and advocated international standards of training in neurosurgery. In 1985 -1994 he was a chairman of Archives Committee of American Association of Neurological Surgeons.

In this process, white adipose tissue (WAT) performs immune activities because of the dysregulated expression of adipokines. Excessive fat is accumulated in farmed fish, thereby threatening fish health. Studies have shown that adipose tissue is also an active immune organ in fish, capable of participating in and influencing immune responses. Adipocytes are the main cellular component of adipose tissue; however, little is known about the relationship between adipocyte and inflammation in fish. In this study, we analyzed transcriptome changes during adipogenesis in the primary culture of grass carp adipocytes using bioinformatics. The results showed that inflammatory signaling pathway may be activated during grass carp adipocyte differentiation, such as NFÎºB signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and Adipocytokine signaling pathway, indicating that grass carp adipocytes have immune activities. Exposure to LPS induced expression of adipokines genes in adipocytes and preadipocytes, including NF-kB, IL-6, MCP-1 and TNFÎ±, suggesting that preadipocytes and adipocytes both have immune response and the immune activity is conserved in vertebrates white adipocytes. Further study found that these immune marker genes were higher expressed in adipocytes compared with preadipocytes in LPS-induced inflammation. In summary, adipocyte should be considered as an active immune site in fish. Adipocytes have greater potency compared with preadipocytes in LPS-induced inflammation. This study indicated that adipocytes and preadipocytes may have different contribution in inflammation.",Frequency of goose and duck down causation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis within an 80-patient cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042573,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2019 06 10,"A variety of antigens have been identified as causative of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), which is characterized by inflammation to the lung parenchyma that is induced by exposure.

This results in production of a toxic mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) that leads to neuronal dysfunction and death. Currently, no disease-modifying treatments are available; however, numerous therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering HTT levels in the brain are under development. To date, studies have not closely examined the contribution of mHTT in neurons vs astrocytes to disease pathophysiology. To better understand the role of astrocytes in HD pathophysiology and the need for cell type specific targeting of HTT lowering therapeutic strategies, AAV capsids were employed that selectively transduce neurons, or both neurons and astrocytes. These vectors carrying miRNA sequences directed against HTT were injected into the YAC128 mouse model of HD to selectively lower HTT expression in neurons alone versus neurons and astrocytes. The results suggested that HTT lowering in neurons alone was not sufficient to rescue the motor phenotype in YAC128 mice. Furthermore, HTT lowering in both cell types was required to achieve maximal functional benefit. The study suggested that astrocyte dysfunction may play a critical role in HD pathogenesis, and thus astrocytes represent an important therapeutic target.",Altered brain functional connectivity and correlation with psychological status in patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042571,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"The study investigated the alteration of brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns and analyzed the relationship between FC and psychological statue in pulsatile tinnitus (PT) patients by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The eligible PT patients (29) and healthy subjects (29) were enrolled. Brain activity, FC and clinical characteristics, including tinnitus handicap inventory, duration, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression were evaluated. A significantly increased brain activity in the left cerebellum and left inferior temporal gyrus was observed in PT patients. An abnormally increased FC was focused on the left cerebellum and left inferior temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and right occipital gyrus, as well as, the inferior temporal gyrus and thalamus, the putamen and caudate nucleus. Decreased FC was demonstrated between the left cerebellum and bilateral angular gyrus, as well as, the left inferior temporal gyrus and orbital gyrus of the medial prefrontal lobe. A negative correlation was established between the scores of sleep quality and anxiety and the values of FC (in the inferior temporal gyrus and bilateral thalamus). These results suggest an abnormal activity of non-auditory cortex (the cerebellum and inferior temporal gyrus), and the alteration of FC patterns are responsible for PT. Some psychological factors may not be correlated with FC in PT patients.",Event-related alpha desynchronization in touch - Comparing attention and perception.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042570,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"An event-related decrease in alpha power contralateral to the presentation of a stimulus is now a well-established phenomenon. Two distinct accounts of the functional role of alpha changes are present in the literature that either focus on alpha changes observed during attentional or simple perceptual tasks. This study directly compares tasks that invoke alpha decreases during exogenous, endogenous and perceptual processing. Using a data driven approach to compare alpha changes we show that alpha decreases differ only between exogenous and endogenous attention tasks for only a short time window, 500-600â€‰ms after cue onset. We suggest this indicates a role for alpha in voluntary orientating and stimulus predictability."

Recent evidence indicates that social categorization is more sensitive and malleable to elemental facial features than previously assumed. At the same time, perception of social categories can be crafted by top-down factors, including prior knowledge, motivations, and social expectations. In this review, we summarize extant wisdom and propose a model that goes beyond traditional accounts that have conceived stereotypes and prejudices as the end result of ""reading out"" social categories in the face, and have assumed a hierarchical brain organization. Our model proposes recursive and dynamic interactions amid distant brain regions. Accordingly, the reciprocal exchange of sensory evidence and predictions biases and ""explains away"" visual input in face perception regions until a compromise is achieved and social perception stabilizes. Ideally, this effort would contribute to shape a research field at the interface between neural and social sciences, which is often referred to as social vision.",Diagnosis and management of cracked tooth by quantitative light-induced fluorescence technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042556,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,2019 05 02,The aim of this case report was to describe the process of diagnosis and treatment of a cracked tooth using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF).,Photodynamic Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (PACT) using Methylene blue inhibits the viability of the biofilm produced by Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042554,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,2019 05 02,"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus, an etiological agent of human infections, presenting high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Gene regulatory mechanisms,2019 06 12,"Removal of introns by pre-mRNA splicing is fundamental to gene function in eukaryotes. However, understanding the mechanism by which exon-intron boundaries are defined remains a challenging endeavor. Published reports support that the recruitment of U1 snRNP at the 5'ss marked by GU dinucleotides defines the 5'ss as well as facilitates 3'ss recognition through cross-exon interactions. However, exceptions to this rule exist as U1 snRNP recruited away from the 5'ss retains the capability to define the splice site, where the cleavage takes place. Independent reports employing exon 7 of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) genes suggest a long-distance effect of U1 snRNP on splice site selection upon U1 snRNP recruitment at target sequences with or without GU dinucleotides. These findings underscore that sequences distinct from the 5'ss may also impact exon definition if U1 snRNP is recruited to them through partial complementarity with the U1 snRNA. In this review we discuss the expanded role of U1 snRNP in splice-site selection due to U1 ability to be recruited at more sites than predicted solely based on GU dinucleotides.",Extracellular regulation of airway smooth muscle contraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042549,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 06 11,"The molecular mechanisms governing the contraction of airway smooth muscle have always been at the forefront of asthma research. New extracellular molecules affecting the contraction of airway smooth muscle are steadily being discovered. Although interesting, this is disconcerting for researchers trying to find a mend for the significant part of asthma symptoms caused by contraction. Additional efforts are being deployed to understand the intracellular signaling pathways leading to contraction. The goal being to find common pathways that are essential to convey the contractile signal emanating from any single or combination of extracellular molecules. Not only these pathways exist and their details are being slowly unveiled, but some carry the signal inside-out to interact back with extracellular molecules. These latter represent targets with promising therapeutic potential, not only because they are molecules downstream of pathways essential for contraction but also because their extracellular location makes them readily accessible by inhaled drugs.",Molecular evolution of CRH and CRHR subfamily before the evolutionary origin of vertebrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042548,Peptides,2019 05 21,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is well-cited for its important role in governing the stress responses via neuroendocrine system in vertebrates. After the identification of homologs of CRH receptor (CRHR) in both deuterostome and arthropod lineages, it was suggested that the ancestral homolog of CRH-CRHR molecular system is present in the bilaterian. However, homolog sequences from arthropods differ considerably from vertebrate CRH-like peptide sequences. Due to the significant difference between the biological system, as well as the gene regulatory network, of protostome and that of vertebrate, physiological studies on the protostomes may not provide important insight into the evolutionary history of vertebrate CRH system, while tunicate and amphioxus, two close relatives to vertebrate, which have diverged before two rounds of whole genome duplication (2WGDs) do. Given the identification of amphioxus CRH-like peptide by our group, this review aims to reexamine the current hypotheses on the evolution of CRH subfamily. It is generally accepted that paralogs of CRH and CRHR have been produced through 2WGDs, which occurred during the early vertebrate evolution. The identification of a single crh-like gene in amphioxi and tunicates by in silico search and the presence of two paralogons with a total of 5 crh-like genes in gnathostomes has shown that an additional duplication event might have happened to the ancestral crh-like gene before 2WGDs. On the other hand, the evolution of crhr gene subfamily appears to be mainly influenced by 2WGDs and only two receptor genes have been retained in the genomes of jawed vertebrates.",A survey of sepsis knowledge among Canadian emergency department registered nurses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042531,Australasian emergency care,2019 06 16,"With the rise of patients with sepsis presenting to emergency departments, emergency nurses, as frontline healthcare workers, require current clinical knowledge of sepsis.

The molecular and genetic mechanisms regulating these changes remain elusive. In this study, we showed Sema6D as a novel signaling molecule regulating perinatal cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation. SEMA6D is a member of the Semaphorin family of signaling molecules. To reveal its function during cardiogenesis, we specifically inactivated Sema6D in embryonic cardiomyocytes using a conditional gene deletion approach. All mutant animals showed hypoplastic myocardial walls in neonatal hearts due to reduced cell proliferation. We further revealed that expression of MYCN and its downstream cell cycle regulators is impaired in late fetal hearts in which Sema6D is deleted, suggesting that SEMA6D acts through MYCN to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation. In early postnatal mutant hearts, expression of adult forms of sarcomeric proteins is increased, while expression of embryonic forms is decreased. These data collectively suggest that SEMA6D is required to maintain late fetal/early neonatal cardiomyocytes at a proliferative and less mature status. Deletion of Sema6D in cardiomyocytes led to reduced proliferation and accelerated maturation. We further examined the consequence of these defects through echocardiographic analysis. Embryonic heart deletion of Sema6D significantly impaired the cardiac contraction of male adult hearts, while having a minor effect on female mutant hearts, suggesting that the effect of Sema6D-deletion in adult hearts is sex dependent.",Protective transcriptional mechanisms in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042488,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 06 16,"Heart failure is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several lines of evidence suggest that physical activity and exercise can pre-condition the heart to improve the response to acute cardiac injury such as myocardial infarction or ischemia/reperfusion injury, preventing the progression to heart failure. It is becoming more apparent that cardioprotection is a concerted effort between multiple cell types and converging signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms of cardioprotection are not completely understood. What is clear is that the mechanisms underlying this protection involve acute activation of transcriptional activators and their corresponding gene expression programs. Here, we review the known stress-dependent transcriptional programs that are activated in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to preserve function in the adult heart after injury. Focus is given to prominent transcriptional pathways such as mechanical stress or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²), and gene expression that positively regulates protective PI3K/Akt signaling. Together, these pathways modulate both beneficial and pathological responses to cardiac injury in a cell-specific manner.",Match fitness landscapes for macromolecular interaction networks: Selection for translational accuracy and rate can displace tRNA-binding interfaces of non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042487,Theoretical population biology,2019 05 12,"Advances in structural biology of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have revealed incredible diversity in how aaRSs bind their tRNA substrates.

We used results from coding theory to prove bounds and equalities on fitness in match landscapes assuming additive interaction energies, macroscopic aminoacylation kinetics including proofreading, site-specific modifiers of interaction, and selection for translational accuracy in multiple, perfectly encoded site-types. Using genotypes based on extended Hamming codes we show that over a wide array of interface sizes and numbers of encoded cognate pairs, selection for translational accuracy alone is insufficient to displace the tRNA-binding interfaces of aaRSs. Yet, under combined selection for translational accuracy and rate, site-specific modifiers are selected to adaptively displace the tRNA-binding interfaces of non-cognate aaRS-tRNA pairs. We describe a remarkable correspondence between the lengths of perfect RNA (quaternary) codes and the modal sizes of small non-coding RNA families.",Integrated InÂ Vitro and In Silico Modeling Delineates the Molecular Effects of a Synbiotic Regimen on Colorectal-Cancer-Derived Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042485,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"By modulating the human gut microbiome, prebiotics and probiotics (combinations of which are called synbiotics)Â may be used to treat diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Methodological limitations have prevented determining the potential combinatorial mechanisms of action of such regimens. WeÂ expanded our HuMiX gut-on-a-chip model to co-cultureÂ CRC-derived epithelial cells with a model probiotic under a simulated prebiotic regimen, and we integrated the multi-omic results with in silico metabolic modeling. In contrast to individual prebiotic or probiotic treatments, the synbiotic regimen caused downregulation of genes involved in procarcinogenic pathways and drug resistance, and reduced levels of the oncometabolite lactate. Distinct ratios of organic and short-chain fatty acids were produced during the simulated regimens. Treatment of primary CRC-derived cells with a molecular cocktail reflecting the synbiotic regimen attenuated self-renewal capacity. Our integrated approach demonstrates the potentialÂ of modeling for rationally formulating synbiotics-based treatments in the future.",Deformation Microscopy for Dynamic Intracellular and Intranuclear Mapping of Mechanics with High Spatiotemporal Resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042484,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"Structural heterogeneity is a hallmark of living cells that drives local mechanical properties and dynamic cellular responses. However, the robust quantification of intracellular mechanics is lacking from conventional methods. Here, we describe the development of deformation microscopy, which leverages conventional imaging and an automated hyperelastic warping algorithm to investigate strain history, deformation dynamics, and changes in structural heterogeneity within the interior of cells and cell nuclei. Using deformation microscopy, we found that partial or complete disruption of LINC complexes in cardiomyocytes inÂ vitro and lamin A/C deficiency in myocytes inÂ vivo abrogate dominant tensile loading in the nuclear interior. We also found that cells cultured on stiff substrates or in hyperosmotic conditions displayed abnormal strain burden and asymmetries at interchromatin regions, which are associated with active transcription.

The membrane's lipid composition defines fluidity, thickness, and protein activity and is controlled by the intricate actions of lipid gene-encoded enzymes. However, a comprehensive analysis of each protein's contribution to the lipidome is lacking. Here, we present such a comprehensive and functional overview of lipid genes in Escherichia coli by individual overexpression or deletion of these genes. We developed a high-throughput lipidomic platform, combining growth analysis, one-step lipid extraction, rapid LC-MS, and bioinformatic analysis into one streamlined procedure. This allowed the processing of more than 300 samples per day and revealed interesting functions of known enzymes and distinct effects of individual proteins on the phospholipidome. Our data demonstrate the plasticity of the phospholipidome and unexpected relations between lipid classes and cell growth. Modeling of lipidomic responses to short-chain alcohols provides a rationale for targeted membrane engineering.",Promiscuous Targeting of Cellular Proteins by Vpr Drives Systems-Level Proteomic Remodeling in HIV-1 Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042482,Cell reports,2019 05 15,"HIV-1 encodes four ""accessory proteins"" (Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef), dispensable for viral replication inÂ vitro but essential for viral pathogenesis inÂ vivo. Well characterized cellular targets have been associated with Vif, Vpu, and Nef, which counteract host restriction and promote viral replication. Conversely, although several substrates of Vpr have been described, their biological significance remains unclear. Here, we use complementary unbiased mass spectrometry-based approaches to demonstrate that Vpr is both necessary and sufficient for the DCAF1/DDB1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of at least 38 cellular proteins, causing systems-level changes to the cellular proteome. We therefore propose that promiscuous targeting of multiple host factors underpins complex Vpr-dependent cellular phenotypes and validate this in the case of G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our model explains how Vpr modulates so many cell biological processes and why the functional consequences of previously described Vpr targets, identified and studied in isolation, have proved elusive.",A 3D Atlas of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Expansion by Multi-dimensional RNA-Seq Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042481,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"In vertebrates, hematopoiesis occurring in different niches is orchestrated by intrinsic and extrinsic regulators. Previous studies have revealed numerous linear and planar regulatory mechanisms. However, a multi-dimensional transcriptomic atlas of any given hematopoietic organ has not yet been established. Here, we use multiple RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, including cell type-specific, temporal bulk RNA-seq, inÂ vivo GEO-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), to characterize the detailed spatiotemporal transcriptome during hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of zebrafish. Combinatorial expression profiling reveals that, in the CHT niche, HSPCs and their neighboring supporting cells are co-regulated by shared signaling pathways and intrinsic factors, such as integrin signaling and Smchd1. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis unveils the strong association between cell cycle status and HSPC differentiation. Taken together, weÂ report a global transcriptome landscape that provides valuable insights and a rich resource to understand HSPC expansion in an intact vertebrate hematopoietic organ.",Anaerobic Glycolysis Maintains the Glomerular Filtration Barrier Independent of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042480,Cell reports,2019 05 14,"The cellular responses induced by mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. Intrigued by the lack of almost any glomerular phenotype in patients with profound renal ischemia, we comprehensively investigated the primary sources of energy of glomerular podocytes. Combining functional measurements of oxygen consumption rates, glomerular metabolite analysis, and determination of mitochondrial density of podocytes inÂ vivo, we demonstrate that anaerobic glycolysis and fermentation of glucose to lactate represent the key energy source of podocytes. Under physiological conditions, we could detect neither a developmental nor late-onset pathological phenotype in podocytes with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis machinery, defective mitochondrial fusion-fission apparatus, or reduced mtDNA stability and transcription caused by podocyte-specific deletion of Pgc-1Î±, Drp1, or Tfam, respectively. Anaerobic glycolysis represents the predominant metabolic pathway of podocytes. These findings offer a strategy to therapeutically interfere with the enhanced podocyte metabolism in various progressive kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)."

The molecular changes associated with the loss of nuclear TDP-43 in human tissues are not entirely known. Using subcellular fractionation and fluorescent-activated cell sorting to enrich for diseased neuronal nuclei without TDP-43 from post-mortem frontotemporal degeneration-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) human brain, we characterized the effects of TDP-43 loss on the transcriptomeÂ and chromatin accessibility. Nuclear TDP-43 loss is associated with gene expression changes that affect RNA processing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, histone processing, and DNA damage. Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is also associated with chromatinÂ decondensation around long interspersed nuclearÂ elements (LINEs) and increased LINE1 DNA content. Moreover, loss of TDP-43 leads to increased retrotransposition that can be inhibited with antiretroviral drugs, suggesting that TDP-43 neuropathology is associated with altered chromatin structure including decondensation of LINEs.",Nuclear eIF4E Stimulates 3'-End Cleavage of Target RNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042468,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is nuclear and cytoplasmic where it plays roles in export and translation of specific transcripts, respectively. When we were studying its mRNA export activity, we unexpectedly discovered that eIF4E drives the protein expression of elements of the 3'-end core cleavage complex involved in cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA), including CPSF3, the enzyme responsible for cleavage, as well as its co-factors CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF4, Symplekin, WDR33, and FIP1L1. Using multiple strategies, we demonstrate that eIF4E stimulates 3'-end cleavage of selected RNAs. eIF4E physically interacts with CPSF3, CPSF1, and uncleaved target RNA, suggesting it acts directly and indirectly on the pathway. Through these effects, eIF4E can generate better substrates for its mRNA export and translation activities. Thus, we identified an unanticipated function for eIF4E in 3'-end processing of specific target RNAs, and this function could potentially affect the expression of a broad range of oncoproteins.",Identification of a Locus in Mice that Regulates the Collateral Damage and Lethality of Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042467,Cell reports,2019 05 10,"Arenaviruses can cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans, which can progress to organ failure and death. The underlying mechanisms causing lethality and person-to-person variation in outcome remain incompletely explained. Herein, we characterize a mouse model that recapitulates many features of pathogenesis observed in humans with arenavirus-induced hemorrhagic disease, including thrombocytopenia, severe vascular leakage, lung edema, and lethality. The susceptibility of congenic B6.PL mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection is associated with increased antiviral TÂ cell responses in B6.PL mice compared with C57BL/6 mice and is TÂ cell dependent. Pathogenesis imparted by the causative locus is inherited in a semi-dominant manner in F1 crosses. The locus includes PL-derived sequence variants in both poorly annotated genes and genes known to contribute to immune responses.

Modern genomics has accelerated IEM discovery, but assessing the impact of genomic variants is still challenging. Here, we integrate genomics and metabolomics to identify a cause of lactic acidosis and epilepsy. The proband is a compound heterozygote for variants in LIPT1, which encodes the lipoyltransferase required for 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase (2KDH) function. Metabolomics reveals abnormalities in lipids, amino acids, and 2-hydroxyglutarate consistent with loss of multiple 2KDHs. Homozygous knockin of a LIPT1 mutation reduces 2KDH lipoylation in utero and results in embryonic demise. In patient fibroblasts, defective 2KDH lipoylation and function are corrected by wild-type, but not mutant, LIPT1 alleles. Isotope tracing reveals that LIPT1 supports lipogenesis andÂ balances oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism. Altogether, the data extend the role of LIPT1 in metabolic regulation and demonstrate how integrating genomics and metabolomics can uncover broader aspects of IEM pathophysiology.",Exploring the InÂ Vivo Role of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter in Brown Fat Bioenergetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042465,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"The mitochondrial calcium uniporter has been proposed to coordinate the organelle's energetics with calcium signaling. Uniporter current has previously been reported to be extremely high in brown adipose tissue (BAT), yet it remains unknown how the uniporter contributes to BAT physiology. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a mouse model lacking Mcu, the pore forming subunit of the uniporter, specifically in BAT (BAT-Mcu-KO). BAT-Mcu-KO mice lack uniporter-based calcium uptake in BAT mitochondria but exhibit unaffected cold tolerance, diet-induced obesity, and transcriptional response to cold in BAT. Unexpectedly, we found in wild-type animals that cold powerfully activates the ATF4-dependent integrated stress response (ISR) in BAT and upregulates circulating FGF21 and GDF15, raising the hypothesis that the ISR partly underlies the pleiotropic effects of BAT on systemic metabolism. Our study demonstrates that the uniporter is largely dispensable for BAT thermogenesis and demonstrates activation of the ISR in BAT in response to cold.",Active Protein Neddylation or Ubiquitylation Is Dispensable for Stress Granule Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042464,Cell reports,2019 05 11,"Stress granule (SG) formation is frequently accompanied by ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) impairment and ubiquitylated protein accumulation. SGs, ubiquitin, and UPS components co-localize, but the relationship between the ubiquitin pathway and SGs has not been systematically characterized. We utilize pharmacological inhibition of either the ubiquitin- or NEDD8-activating enzyme (UAE or NAE) to probe whether active ubiquitylation or neddylation modulate SG dynamics. We show that UAE inhibition results in rapid loss of global protein ubiquitylation using ubiquitin-specific proteomics. Critically, inhibiting neither UAE nor NAE significantly affected SG formation or disassembly, indicating that active protein ubiquitylation or neddylation is dispensable for SG dynamics. Using antibodies with varying preference for free ubiquitin or polyubiquitin and fluorescently tagged ubiquitin variants in combination with UAE inhibition, we show that SGs co-localize primarily with unconjugated ubiquitin rather than polyubiquitylated proteins. These findings clarify the role of ubiquitin in SG biology and suggest that free ubiquitin may alter SG protein interactions.",APP-Mediated Signaling Prevents Memory Decline in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042463,Cell reports,2019 05 11,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its metabolites play key roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Whereas short amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides derived from APP are pathogenic, the APP holoprotein serves multiple purposes in the nervous system through its cell adhesion and receptor-like properties. Our studies focused on the signaling mediated by the APP cytoplasmic tail. We investigated whether sustained APP signaling during brain development might favor neuronal plasticity and memory process through a direct interaction with the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit GÎ±S (stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit). Our results reveal that APP possesses autonomous regulatory capacity within its intracellular domain that promotes APP cell surface residence, precludes AÎ² production, facilitates axodendritic development, and preserves cellular substrates of memory. Altogether, these events contribute to strengthening cognitive functions and are sufficient to modify the course of AD pathology.",Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Chain Length Correlates with Insolubility in Mouse Models of Polyglucosan-Associated Neurodegenerative Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042462,Cell reports,2019 06 10,"Lafora disease (LD) and adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) are glycogen storage diseases characterized by a pathogenic buildup of insoluble glycogen. Mechanisms causing glycogen insolubility are poorly understood. Here, in two mouse models of LD (Epm2a-/- and Epm2b-/-) and one of APBD (Gbe1ys/ys), the separation of soluble and insoluble muscle glycogen is described, enabling separate analysis of each fraction. Total glycogen is increased in LD and APBD mice, which, together with abnormal chain length and molecule size distributions, is largely if not fully attributed to insoluble glycogen. Soluble glycogen consists of molecules with distinct chain length distributions and differential corresponding solubility, providing a mechanistic link between soluble and insoluble glycogen inÂ vivo. Phosphorylation states differ across glycogen fractions and mouse models, demonstrating that hyperphosphorylation is not a basic feature of insoluble glycogen. Lastly, model-specific variances in protein and activity levels of key glycogen synthesis enzymes suggest uninvestigated regulatory mechanisms.",LOVIT Is a Putative Vesicular Histamine Transporter Required in Drosophila for Vision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042461,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"Classical fast neurotransmitters are loaded into synaptic vesicles and concentrated by the action of a specific vesicular transporter before being released from the presynaptic neuron. In Drosophila, histamine is distributed mainly in photoreceptors, where it serves as the main neurotransmitter for visual input. In a targeted RNAi screen for neurotransmitter transporters involved in concentrating photoreceptor synaptic histamine, we identified an SLC45 transporter protein, LOVIT (loss of visual transmission). LOVIT is prominently expressed in photoreceptor synaptic vesicles and is required for Drosophila visual neurotransmission. Null mutations of lovit severely reduced the concentration of histamine in photoreceptor terminals. These results demonstrate a LOVIT-dependent mechanism, maintaining the synaptic concentration of histamine, and provide evidence for a histamine vesicular transporter besides the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) family.",InÂ Vivo Functional Mapping of a Cortical Column at Single-Neuron Resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042460,Cell reports,2019 05 02,"The cerebral cortex is organized in vertical columns that contain neurons with similar functions. The cellular micro-architecture of such columns is an essential determinant of brain dynamics and cortical information processing. However, a detailed understanding of columns is incomplete, even in the best studied cortical regions, and mostly restricted to the upper cortical layers. Here, we developed a two-photon Ca2+-imaging-based method for the serial functional mapping of all pyramidal layers of the mouse primary auditory cortex at single-neuron resolution in individual animals. We demonstrate that the best frequency-responsive neurons are organized in all-layers-crossing narrow columns, with fuzzy boundaries and a bandwidth of about one octave. This micro-architecture is, in many ways, different from what has been reported before, indicating the region and stimulus specificity of functional cortical columns inÂ vivo."

A key step in this process is the filtering of the ""distracting"" sensory inputs that may disturb action selection. Because it has been suggested that, in principle, action selection may also be processed by shared circuits in vertebrate and invertebrates, we wondered whether invertebrates show the ability to filter out ""distracting"" stimuli during a goal-directed action, as seen in vertebrates. In this experiment, action selection was studied in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster by investigating their reaction to the abrupt appearance of a visual distractor during an ongoing locomotor action directed to a visual target. We found that when the distractor was present, flies tended to shift the original trajectory toward it, thus acknowledging its presence, but they did not fully commit to it, suggesting that an inhibition process took place to continue the unfolding of the planned goal-directed action. To some extent flies appeared to take into account and represent motorically the distractor, but they did not engage in a complete change of their initial motor program in favor of the distractor. These results provide interesting insights into the selection-for-action mechanism, in a context requiring action-centered attention, that might have appeared rather early in the course of evolution. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Action selection and maintenance of a goal-directed action require animals to ignore irrelevant ""distracting"" stimuli that might elicit alternative motor programs. In this study we observed, in Drosophila melanogaster, a top-down mechanism inhibiting the response toward salient stimuli, to accomplish a goal-directed action. These data highlight, for the first time in an invertebrate organism, that the action-based attention shown by higher organisms, such as humans and nonhuman primates, might have an ancestral origin.",Slow oscillatory changes of DPOAE magnitude and phase after exposure to intense low-frequency sounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042448,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 02,"Sensitive sound detection within the mammalian cochlea is performed by hair cells surrounded by cochlear fluids. Maintenance of cochlear fluid homeostasis and tight regulation of intracellular conditions in hair cells are crucial for the auditory transduction process but can be impaired by intense sound stimulation. After a short, intense low-frequency sound, the cochlea shows the previously described bounce phenomenon which manifests itself as slow oscillatory changes of hearing thresholds and otoacoustic emissions. Here, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were recorded after exposing Mongolian gerbils to intense low-frequency sounds (200 Hz, 100 dB SPL) with different exposure times up to one hour. After all sound exposure durations, a certain percentage of recordings (up to 80 % after 1.5 min-long exposure) showed oscillatory DPOAE changes, similar to the bounce phenomenon in humans. Changes were quite uniform with respect to size and time course, and they were independent from sound exposure duration. Changes showed states of hypo- and hyperactivity with either state preceding the other. The direction of changes was suggested to depend on the static position of the cochlear operating point. As assessed with DPOAEs, no indication for a permanent damage after several or long exposure times was detected. We propose that sensitivity changes occur due to alterations of the mechano-electrical transduction process of outer hair cells. Those alterations could be induced by different challenged homeostatic processes with slow electromotility of outer hair cells being the most plausible source of the bounce phenomenon.",The human vestibulo-ocular reflex and saccades: normal subjects and the effect of age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042447,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 08,"Here we characterise in eighty normal subjects (16-84 years (mean(SD), 47(19) years) the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and saccades in response to three-dimensional head-impulses with a monocular video head impulse test (vHIT) of the right eye. Impulses towards the right lateral, right anterior and left posterior canals (means: 0.98, 0.91, 0.79) had slightly higher mean gains compared to their counterparts (0.95, 0.86, 0.76). In the older age-group (>60 yrs), gains of left posterior canal dropped 0.09 and left anterior canals rose 0.09 resulting in symmetry. All canal gains reduced with increasing head velocity (0.02-0.13 per 100 Â°/s). Comparison of lateral canal gains calculated using five published algorithms yielded lower values (~0.80) when a narrow detection window was used. Low amplitude refixation saccades (amplitude: 1.11Â±0.98 Â°, peak velocity: 63.9Â±34.0 Â°/s at 262.0Â±93.9 ms) were observed amongst all age-groups (frequency: 40.2Â±23.4 %), increasing in amplitude, peak-velocity and frequency in older subjects. Impulses towards anterior canals showed the least frequent saccades and lateral and posterior canals were similar, but while lateral canal impulses showed the smallest saccades the posterior canal showed the largest saccades. Saccade peak-velocity ~ amplitude 'main sequence' slope was steeper for the horizontal canals compared to the vertical planes (60 Â°/s vs. < 40 Â°/s per 1Â°). We found small but significant asymmetries in monocular vHIT gain that changed with age.

In a first experiment, we manipulated the predictability of the interception location. A target moved along a haphazardly curved path, and subjects attempted to tap on it when it entered a hitting zone. The hitting zone was either a large ring surrounding the target's starting position (ring condition) or a small disk that became visible before the target appeared (disk condition). The interception location gradually became apparent in the ring condition, whereas it was immediately apparent in the disk condition. In the ring condition, subjects pursued the target with their gaze. Their heads and hands gradually moved in the direction of the future tap position. In the disk condition, subjects immediately directed their gaze toward the hitting zone by moving both their eyes and heads. They also moved their hands to the future tap position sooner than in the ring condition. In a second and third experiment, we made the target's movement more predictable. Although this made the targets easier to pursue, subjects now shifted their gaze to the hitting zone soon after the target appeared in the ring condition. In the disk condition, they still usually shifted their gaze to the hitting zone at the beginning of the trial. Together, the experiments show that predictability of the interception location is more important than predictability of target movement in determining how we move to intercept targets. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that if people are required to intercept a target at a known location, they direct their gaze to the interception point as soon as they can rather than pursuing the target with their eyes for as long as possible. The predictability of the interception location rather than the predictability of the path to that location largely determines how the eyes, head, and hand move.",Reciprocal Intralimb Transfer of Skilled Isometric Force Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042443,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 02,"Motor control theories propose that the same motor plans can be employed by different effectors (e.g. the hand and arm). Skills learned with one effector can therefore 'transfer' to others, which has potential applications in clinical situations. However, evidence from adaptation suggests this effect is not reciprocal; learning can be generalized from proximal-to-distal effectors (e.g. arm to hand), but not from distal-to-proximal effectors (e.g. hand to arm). We propose that skill learning may not follow the same pattern, as it relies on multiple learning processes beyond error detection and correction. Participants learned a skill task involving the production of isometric forces. We assessed their ability to perform the task with the hand and arm. One group trained to perform the task using only their hand, while a second trained using only their arm. In a final assessment, we found that participants who trained with either effector improved their skill in performing the task with both their hand and arm. There was no change in a control group that did not train between assessments, indicating that gains were related to the training, not the multiple assessments. These results indicate that in contrast to adaptation, motor skills can generalize from both proximal-to-distal and distal-to-proximal effectors. We propose this is due to differences in the processes underlying skill acquisition in comparison to adaptation.",Oscillations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits - Implications for Parkinson's disease and other neurologic and psychiatric conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042442,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 02,"Cortico-basal ganglia circuits are thought to play a crucial role in the selection and control of motor behaviors and have also been implicated in the processing of motivational content and in higher cognitive functions.

In particular, synchronized oscillations have been a frequent finding suggesting that excessive synchronization of neuronal activity may be a pathophysiological mechanism involved in a wide range of neurologic and psychiatric conditions.

Cell physiology,2019 05 02,"Î²3-adrenoceptor (Î²3-AR) agonists are used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, however their mechanism of action has not been determined. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of Î²3-adrenoceptor (Î²3-AR) agonists on cholinergic versus purinergic-receptor mediated contractions of the detrusor and to examine the mechanisms underlying inhibition of the purinergic responses by Î²3-AR agonists. Isometric tension recordings were made from strips of murine detrusor and whole cell current recordings were made from freshly isolated detrusor myocytes using the patch clamp technique. Transcriptional expression of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) sub-types in detrusor strips was assessed using RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. The Î²3-AR agonists BRL37344 and CL316243 (100nM) inhibited cholinergic nerve-mediated contractions of the detrusor by 19 & 23%, respectively, but did not reduce contractions induced by the cholinergic agonist carbachol (300nM). In contrast, these Î²3-AR agonists inhibited purinergic nerve-mediated responses by 55 & 56%, respectively and decreased the amplitude of contractions induced by the P2X receptor agonist, a,Î²-methylene ATP, by 40 & 45%. The adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin inhibited purinergic responses and these effects were mimicked by a combination of the PKA activator 6-MB-cAMP and the EPAC activator 007-AM. Application of ATP (1Î¼M) evoked reproducible P2X currents in isolated detrusor myocytes voltage clamped at -60 mV. These responses were reduced in amplitude in the presence of BRL37344 and also by 007-AM. This study demonstrates that Î²3-AR agonists, reduce post-junctional purinergic responses in the detrusor via a pathway involving activation of the cAMP effector, EPAC.",Long Noncoding RNAs in Intestinal Epithelium Homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042423,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 08,"The epithelium of the mammalian intestinal mucosa is a rapidly self-renewing tissue in the body and its homeostasis is preserved through well-controlled mechanisms. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate a variety of biological functions and are intimately involved in pathogenesis of diverse human diseases. Here we highlight the roles of several lncRNAs expressed in the intestinal epithelium, including uc.173, SPRY4-IT1, H19, and Gata6, in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium, focusing on the emerging evidence of lncRNAs in the regulation of intestinal mucosal regeneration and epithelial barrier function. We also discuss recent results that the interactions between lncRNAs with microRNAs and the RNA-binding protein HuR influence epithelial homeostasis. With rapidly advancing knowledge of lncRNAs, there is also growing recognition that lncRNAs in the intestinal epithelium might be promising therapeutic targets in our efforts to protect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium in response to stressful environments.",MicroRNA-140 inhibits skeletal muscle glycolysis and atrophy in endotoxin-induced sepsis in mice via the WNT signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042421,American journal of physiology. Cell physiology,2019 05 02,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted from infection. This study aimed at exploring the role of microRNA-140 (miR-140) in septic mice. Wnt family member 11 (WNT11) was verified to be a target gene of miR-140 after bioinformatic prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Importantly, miR-140 negatively regulated WNT11. We initially induced the model of sepsis by endotoxin, and then ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were performed to explore the functional role of miR-140 in sepsis. Additionally, cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber, lactic acid production and 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and tyrosine (Tyr) production in extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscles, as well as serum levels of inflammatory factors were examined. The effect of miR-140 on the expression of WNT signaling pathway-related and apoptosis-related factors in skeletal muscle tissue were determined. The experimental results indicated that up-regulated miR-140 or silenced WNT11 increased cross-sectional areas of muscle fiber, while decreasing lactic acid production, skeletal muscle cell apoptosis (corresponding to down-regulated Bax, and Caspase-3 and up-regulated Bcl-2), as well as reduced proteolytic rate of Tyr and 3-MH. Also, overexpressed miR-140 or silenced WNT11 reduced inflammation as reflected by decreased serum levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-Î±. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-140 was shown to suppress the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, accompanied by decreased expression of WNT11, Î²-catenin, and GSK-3Î². Taken together, up-regulation of miR-140 could potentially inhibit skeletal muscle lactate release, an indirect measure of glycolysis, and atrophy in septic mice through suppressing the WNT signaling pathway via inhibiting WNT11 expression.",Impact of Consensus Molecular Subtype on Survival in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Results From CALGB/SWOG 80405 (Alliance).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042420,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2019 06 13,To determine the predictive and prognostic value of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) that represent a merging of gene expression-based features largely in primary tumors from six independent classification systems and provide a framework for capturing the intrinsic heterogeneity of CRC in patients enrolled in CALGB/SWOG 80405.,Hydrogen peroxide inhibits neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus via potassium channel activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042419,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 06 10,"The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is an important homeostatic and reflex center for neuroendocrine, respiratory and autonomic regulation, including during hypoxic stressor challenges. Such challenges increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) to modulate synaptic, neuronal and ion channel activity. Previously we have shown in the nucleus tractus solitarii, another cardiorespiratory nucleus, that the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced membrane hyperpolarization and reduced action potential discharge (APd) via increased potassium (K+) conductance at the resting potential. Here, we sought to determine the homogeneity of influence and mechanism of action of H2O2 on PVN neurons. This was accomplished by recording PVN neurons in isolation and in an acute slice preparation which leaves neurons in their semi-intact network. Regardless of preparation, H2O2 hyperpolarized PVN neurons and decreased APd. In the slice, peroxide also decreased spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic current frequency but not amplitude. To examine potential mechanisms, we examined the influence of K+ channel blockers barium, cesium, and glibenclamide on membrane potential, as well as the ionic currents active at resting potential and outward potassium currents (IK) upon depolarization. The H2O2 hyperpolarization was blocked by K+ channel blockers. H2O2 did not alter currents between -50 and -110 mV. However, peroxide induced an outward K+ current at -50 mV, yet at potentials more positive to 0 mV H2O2 decreased IK. Elevated intracellular antioxidant catalase eliminated H2O2 effects. These data indicate that H2O2 alters synaptic and neuronal properties of PVN neurons likely via membrane hyperpolarization and alteration of IK+, which may ultimately alter cardiorespiratory reflexes.",Cardiac hypertrophy in mice submitted to a swimming protocol: influence of training volume and intensity on myocardial renin-angiotensin system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042418,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 30,"Exercise promotes physiological cardiac hypertrophy and activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays an important role in cardiac physiology, both through the classical axis [angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) activated by angiotensin II (ANG II)] and the alternative axis [proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MASR) activated by angiotensin-(1-7)]. However, very intense exercise could have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. We aimed to analyze the cardiac hypertrophy phenotype and the classical and alternative RAS axes in the myocardium of mice submitted to swimming exercises of varying volume and intensity for the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Male Balb/c mice were divided into three groups, sedentary, swimming twice a day without overload (T2), and swimming three times a day with a 2% body weight overload (T3), totaling 6 wk of training. Both training groups developed similar cardiac hypertrophy, but only T3 mice improved their oxidative capacity. We observed that T2 had increased levels of MASR, which was followed by the activation of its main downstream protein AKT; meanwhile, AT1R and its main downstream protein ERK remained unchanged. Furthermore, no change was observed regarding the levels of angiotensin peptides, in either group. In addition, we observed no change in the ratio of expression of the myosin heavy chain Î²-isoform to that of the Î±-isoform. Fibrosis was not observed in any of the groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that increasing exercise volume and intensity did not induce a pathological hypertrophy phenotype, but instead improved the oxidative capacity, and this process might have the participation of the RAS alternative axis.",Personality traits and negative consequences associated with binge drinking and marijuana use in college students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042417,The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,2019 06 10,"Background: Binge drinking is common in college students, and many drink in quantities greater than the standard definition of bingeing. Combined use of additional substances, particularly marijuana, is also common. Objectives: Increased impulsivity and sensation seeking are risk factors for bingeing, and this study was designed to characterize their association with extreme compared to standard bingeing, as well as with combined bingeing and marijuana use. Negative consequences of alcohol use were also investigated. Methods: Self-report personality measures and a measure of the negative consequences of alcohol use were given to a sample of 221 college students (109 females) sorted into a control and 4 binge groups based upon their patterns of bingeing and marijuana use. Narrowly defined, non-overlapping measures of impulsivity and sensation seeking were analyzed to assess the association of these personality measures with substance-use patterns and negative consequences of bingeing. Results: Standard bingers did not differ from non-bingeing controls on either impulsivity or sensation seeking, whereas extreme bingers had significantly higher impulsivity and sensation seeking scores than controls and also significantly higher sensation seeking than standard bingers. Exploratory analyses of a broader set of personality scales showed that a disinhibition scale was alsoÂ significant predictor of substance use group. A number of personality traits significantly predicted substance use patterns as well as specific negative consequences of bingeing. Conclusions: Impulsivity, sensation seeking and disinhibition are significant associates of substance use patterns and the negative consequences of use in college students.",Mathematical modeling informs the impact of changes in circadian rhythms and meal patterns on insulin secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042416,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 02,"Disruption of circadian rhythms have been associated with metabolic syndromes including obesity and diabetes. A variety of metabolic activities are under circadian modulation, as local and global clock gene knockouts result in glucose imbalance and increased risk of metabolic diseases. Insulin release from the pancreatic Î²-cells exhibit daily variation, and recent studies have found that insulin secretion, not production, is under circadian modulation. As consideration of daily variation in insulin secretion is necessary to accurately describe glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we describe a mathematical model that incorporates the circadian modulation via insulin granule trafficking. We use this model to understand the effect of oscillatory characteristics on insulin secretion at different times of the day. Furthermore, we integrate the dynamics of clock genes under the influence of competing environmental signals (light/dark cycle and feeding/fasting cycle) and demonstrate how circadian disruption and meal size distribution changes the insulin secretion pattern over a 24-hour day.",A review of mechanical and synaptic processes in otolith transduction of sound and vibration for clinical VEMP testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042414,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 02,"Older studies of mammalian otolith physiology have focused mainly on sustained responses to low-frequency (<50Hz) or maintained linear acceleration. So the otoliths have been regarded as accelerometers. Thus evidence of otolithic activation and high precision phase locking to high-frequency sound and vibration appears to be very unusual. However those results are exactly in accord with a substantial body of knowledge of otolith function in fish and frogs. It is likely that phase locking of otolith afferents to vibration is a general property of all vertebrates. This review examines the literature about the activation and phase locking of single otolithic neurons to air-conducted sound (ACS) and bone-conducted vibration (BCV), in particular the high precision of phase locking shown by mammalian irregular afferents which synapse on striolar type I hair cells by calyx endings. Potassium in the synaptic cleft between the type I hair cell receptor and the calyx afferent ending may be responsible for the tight phase locking of these afferents even at very high discharge rates. Since frogs and fish do not possess full calyx endings, it is unlikely that they show phase locking with such high precision and to such high frequencies as has been found in mammals. The high-frequency responses have been modelled as the otoliths operating in a seismometer mode rather than an accelerometer mode. These high-frequency otolithic responses constitute the neural basis for clinical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) tests of otolith function.",Response to coincident inputs in electrically coupled primary afferents is heterogeneous and is enhanced by H-current (IH) modulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042413,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 02,"Electrical synapses represent a widespread modality of interneuronal communication in the mammalian brain. These contacts, by lowering the effectiveness of random or temporally uncorrelated inputs,endow circuits of coupled neurons with the ability to selectively respond to simultaneous depolarizations. This mechanism may support coincidence detection, a property involved in sensory perception, organization of motor outputs and improvement of signal to noise ratio. While the role of electrical coupling is well established, little is known about the contribution of the cellular excitability and its modulations to the susceptibility of groups of neurons to coincident inputs. Here, we obtained dual whole cell patch-clamp recordings of pairs of mesencephalic trigeminal (MesV) neurons in brainstem slices from rats, to evaluate coincidence detection and its determinants. MesV neurons are primary afferents involved in the organization of orofacial behaviors whose cell bodies are electrically coupled mainly in pairs through soma-somatic gap junctions. We found that coincidence detection is highly heterogeneous across the population of coupled neurons. Further, combined electrophysiological and modeling approaches reveal that this heterogeneity arises from the diversity of MesV neurons' intrinsic excitability. Consistently, increasing these cells' excitability by upregulating the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (IH) triggered by cGMP, results in a dramatic enhancement of the susceptibility of coupled neurons to coincident inputs. In conclusion, the ability of coupled neurons to detect coincident inputs is critically shaped by their intrinsic electrophysiological properties, emphasizing the relevance of neuronal excitability for the many functional operations supported by electrical transmission in mammals."

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 02,"Previous studies have characterized the physiological interactions between central nervous system (brain) and peripheral cardiovascular system (heart) during affective elicitation in the healthy, however questions related to the directionality of this functional interplay have been gaining less attention from the scientific community. Here, we explore brain-heart interactions during visual emotional elicitation in healthy subjects using measures of Granger causality (GC), a widely used descriptor of causal influences between two dynamical systems. The proposed approach inferences causality between instantaneous cardio-vagal dynamics estimated from inhomogeneous point-process models of the heartbeat, and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics in 22 healthy subjects who underwent pleasant/unpleasant affective elicitation by watching pictures from the International Affective Picture System database. Particularly, we calculated the GC indexes between the EEG spectrogram in the canonical Î¸, Î±, Î² and Î³ bands, and both the instantaneous mean heart rate and its continuous parasympathetic modulations (i.e., the instantaneous HF power). Thus, we looked for significant statistical differences among GC values estimated during resting state, neutral elicitation, and pleasant/unpleasant arousing elicitation. As compared with resting state, coupling strength increases significantly in the left hemisphere during positive stimuli, and in the right hemisphere during negative stimuli. Our results further reveal a correlation between emotional valence and lateralization of the dynamical information transfer going from-brain-to-heart, mainly localized in the prefrontal, somatosensory, and posterior cortices, and of the information transfer from-heart-to-brain, mainly reflected into the fronto-parietal cortex oscillations in the Î³ band (30-45Hz).",A Simple Method to Monitor Hepatic Gluconeogenesis and Triglyceride Synthesis Following Oral Sugar Tolerance Test in Obese Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042400,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 02,"Hepatic energy metabolism is a key element in many metabolic diseases. Hepatic anaplerosis provides carbons for gluconeogenesis (GNG) and triglyceride (TG) synthesis. We aimed to optimize a protocol that measures hepatic anaplerotic contribution for GNG, TG synthesis and hepatic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity using a single dose of oral [U-13C3] glycerol paired with an oral sugar tolerance test (OSTT) in a population with significant insulin resistance. The OSTT (75g glucose + 25 g fructose) was administered to 8 obese adolescent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) followed by ingestion of [U-13C3]glycerol at t=180 or t=210 min.13C labeling patterns of serum glucose and TG-glycerol were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. 13C enrichment in plasma TG-glycerol was detectable and stable from time 240-390 min with the [U-13C3]glycerol drink at t=180 min(3.65Â±2.3% to 4.47Â±1.4%; p>0.4), but the enrichment was undetectable at time 240 with the glycerol drink at t=210 min . Relative contribution from anaplerosis was determined at the end of the OSTT (18.5Â±3.4% (t=180 min) vs. 16.0Â±3.5% (t=210 min); p=0.27). [U-13C3]glycerol was incorporated into GNG 390 min after the OSTT with an enrichment of 7.5-12.5%.Glucose derived from TCA cycle activity was 0.3-1%, and the PPP activity was 2.8-4.7%. In conclusion, it is possible to obtain relative measurements of hepatic anaplerotic contribution to both GNG and TG esterification following an OSTT in a highly insulin resistant population using a minimally invasive technique. Tracer administration should be timed to allow enough de novo TG esterification and endogenous glucose release after the sugar drink.",Altered gastric tone and motility response to brainstem dopamine in a rat model of parkinsonism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042398,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 05 02,"The majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Recently, we described a nigro-vagal pathway, which uses dopaminergic (DA) inputs to dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and A2 area neurons to modulate gastric motility and tone. This pathway is disrupted in a rodent model of PD. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that brainstem dopaminergic modulation of gastric tone and motility is altered in a rodent model of PD. Male Sprague Dawley rats received 3 weekly intraperitoneal injections of 10mg/kg paraquat (PQ) or saline (control). In naive conditions, DA microinjection in the DMV induced a gastroinhibitory response in 100% of animals. In 19/28 of the paraquat-treated animals, however, microinjection of DA in the DVC induced a biphasic response with an initial increase in gastric tone and motility followed by a profound gastroinhibition. The excitatory response to DA microinjection was attenuated by a combination of DA1- and DA2-like receptor antagonists. Conversely, the inhibitory response was reduced by the DA2-like antagonist only. Pretreatment with the Î±2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, did not modulate the response to DA, thus excluding the involvement of the A2 area. At the end of the experiments, the induction of the parkinsonian phenotype was confirmed by the presence of Î±-synuclein immunoreactivity in the DMV and substantia nigra pars compacta. These data suggest a maladaptive neural plasticity in brainstem vagal circuits regulating gastric motility in paraquat-treated rats, which may be responsible for the gastric dysfunction observed in PD models.",Design of Planar Chiral Phosphoric Acids with a [2.2]Paracyclophanyl Backbone as Organocatalysts for the Highly Enantioselective Aza-Friedel-Crafts Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042397,Organic letters,2019 06 13,A new type of robust planar chiral phosphoric acid bearing a [2.2]paracyclophane scaffold was synthesized and shown to be an optimal catalyst in asymmetric aza-Friedel-Crafts reactions for the first synthesis of enantioenriched styryl indolylmethanamine derivatives in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (93->99% ee) under 0.5-1 mol % catalyst loading.,Equilibrium Protein Adsorption on Nanometric Vegetable Oil Hybrid Film/Water Interface Using Neutron Reflectometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042395,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 23,"Nanofilms of about 2 nm thickness have been formed at the air-water interface using functionalized castor oil (ICO) with cross-linkable silylated groups. These hybrid films represent excellent candidates for replacing conventional polymeric materials in biomedical applications, but they need to be optimized in terms of biocompatibility, which is highly related to protein adsorption. Neutron reflectivity has been used to study the adsorption of two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, at the silylated oil (ICO)-water interface in the absence and presence of salt at physiologic ionic strength and pH and at different protein concentrations. These measurements are compared to adsorption at the air-water interface. While salt enhances adsorption by a similar degree at the air-water and oil-water interfaces, the impact of the oil film is significant with adsorption at the oil-water interface 3-4-fold higher compared to that at the air-water interface. Under these conditions, the concentration profiles of the adsorbed layers for both proteins indicate multilayer adsorption. The thickness of the outer layer (oil side) is close to the dimension of the minor axis of the protein molecule, âˆ¼30 Ã…, suggesting a sideway orientation with the long axis parallel to the interface. The inner layer extends to 55-60 Ã…. Interestingly, in all cases, the composition of the oil film remains intact without significant protein penetration into the film. The optimal adsorption on these nanofilms, 1.7-2.0 mgÂ·m-2, is comparable to the results obtained recently on thick solid cross-linked films using a quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy, showing in particular that adsorption at these ICO film interfaces under standard physiological conditions is nonspecific. These results furnish useful information toward the elaboration of vegetable oil-based nanofilms in direct nanoscale applications or as precursor films in the fabrication of thicker macroscopic films for biomedical applications.",Computational Investigation of the Selective Cleavage of Diastereotopic Cyclopropane Bonds in 5-Spirocyclopropane Isoxazolidines Rearrangement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042393,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 06 10,"The complete path of the Brandi-Guarna rearrangement of 5-spirocyclopropane isoxazolidines has been investigated by means of density functional theory calculations to rationalize the competing formation of tetrahydropyridones and enaminones by the determination of the minimum energy reaction paths.

J. Org. Chem. 2001, 2001, 4223]. In addition, the results of this work suggest that in the presence of a stereogenic center at isoxazolidine C-4', the formation of a piperidinone or an enaminone as the final product depends on which of the two diastereotopic C-CH2 bonds of cyclopropane is cleaved in the second step of the process.

After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow for accurately predicting the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic SchrÃ¶dinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces, and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17, and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new data sets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala10): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 Ã…). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala10 on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala10 folds into a ""wreath-shaped"" configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol-1 according to the reference ab initio calculations.",Potassium Metal as Reliable Reference Electrodes of Nonaqueous Potassium Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042388,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 06 11,"Potassium metal electrochemical cells are widely utilized to examine potassium insertion materials for nonaqueous potassium-ion batteries.

Although a highly concentrated electrolyte of 3.9 M KN(SO2F)2/1,2-dimethoxyethane realizes the smallest polarization of 25 mV among all the electrolytes investigated in this study, the polarization of K metals is still larger than those of Li and Na metals. The issue of inaccurate rest potential is solved by pretreating the K electrodes with a plating-stripping process, which is essential in evaluating the intrinsic electrode performance of potassium insertion materials.","Structural Understanding, Photoswitchability, and Supergelation of a New Class of Four Ring-Based Bent-Shaped Liquid Crystal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042387,The journal of physical chemistry.

However, there is a lack of understanding about the fundamental relation between the reported high-defect crystal structure containing cation disorder and vacancies and the observed transport properties, which follow expectations for an ideal rock salt crystal structure. Here we have studied a series of undoped lead sulfide samples (Pb1- xS) with presumed small chemical variations. Crystallographic refinements of high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data give unphysically low lead occupancies (0.75-0.98), in contradiction with the measured charge carrier concentration, resistivity, mobility, and Seebeck coefficient, which show no signs of lead vacancies. A new Rietveld refinement model including preferred orientation parameters and anisotropic strain gives almost full lead occupancy and improved agreement factors. However, transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that there is no preferred orientation in this system. Instead it is the diffuse scattering due to directional correlated disorder in the structure that necessitates the additional parameters when modeling Bragg intensities.

Thus, cyclic peptides have been the focus of extensive bioengineering efforts. Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a superfamily of peptidic natural products that often contain macrocycles. In the RiPP family of lanthipeptides, macrocyclization is accomplished through formation of thioether cross-links between cysteines and dehydrated serines/threonines. The recent production of lanthipeptide libraries and development of methods to display lanthipeptides on yeast or phage highlights their potential for bioengineering and synthetic biology. In this regard, the prochlorosins are especially promising as the corresponding class II lanthipeptide synthetase ProcM matures numerous precursor peptides with diverse core peptide sequences. To facilitate future bioengineering projects, one of its native substrates, ProcA2.8, was subjected in this study to in-depth mutational analysis to test the limitations of ProcM-mediated cyclization. Alanine scan mutagenesis was performed on all residues within the two rings, and multiple prolines were introduced at various positions. Moreover, mutation, deletion, and insertion of residues in the region linking the two lanthionine rings was tested. Additional residues were also introduced or deleted from either ring, and inversion of ring forming residues was attempted to generate diastereomers. The findings were used for epitope grafting of the RGD integrin binding epitope within prochlorosin 2.8, resulting in a low nanomolar affinity binder of the Î±vÎ²3 integrin that was more stable toward proteolysis and displayed higher affinity than the linear counterpart.",White-Light Emission from the Structural Distortion Induced by Control of Halide Composition of Two-Dimensional Perovskites ((C6H5CH2NH3)2PbBr4- xCl x).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042372,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, which have a 2D orientation of the inorganic framework that determines largely the electronic characteristics and an organic cation in the interlayer that leads to a quantum well structure, have attracted a great deal of attention due to their superior stable optoelectronic properties. Especially, some of the greatest interest in 2D perovskites is their application in broad-band white-light emission for solid state lighting. We prepared (BZA)2PbBr4- xCl x (BZA= benzylammonium and x = 0, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, 4) to tune the white-light emission. In the (BZA)2PbBr4 perovskite structure, the bond lengths of Pb-Br for PbBr62- exhibit the same lengths of 2.98 and 3.00 Ã…, respectively. However, in PbCl6 octahedra the bridging Pb-Cl distances were 2.83/2.88 Ã… and 2.85/2.88 Ã…, respectively. The 2D perovskite (BZA)2PbCl4 exhibits a turquoise light emission due to its highly distorted structure, whereas (BZA)2PbBr4 emits a narrow blue emission. We controlled the white emission by mixing the two compounds in proportion and changed the color from blue to white using the intermediate compound (BZA)2PbBr4- xCl x ( x = 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5). The intermediate compound (BZA)2PbBr4- xCl x ( x = 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5) shifted in the white space of Commission Internationale de l'Ã‰clairage coordinates, which were (0.324, 0.383), (0.312. 0.369), (0.319, 0.374), and (0.338, 0.396), respectively. The correlated color temperature of all compounds was observed above 5000 K, which suggests that these perovskites could be utilized as ""cold"" white-light-emitting materials.","K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)XÂ·7H2O (X = Cl, Br): Syntheses, Characterizations, and Theoretical Studies of Noncentrosymmetric Halogen Borate-Carbonates with Short UV Cutoff Edges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042371,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"Two mixed halogen borate-carbonates K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)XÂ·7H2O (X = Cl, Br) have been successfully synthesized with the hydrothermal method.

The technique employs tandem stainless steel capillary columns, each coated with a pH adjusted water stationary phase. The first is a 0.5 m trap column coated with a pH 2.2 phase, while the second is an 11 m analytical column coated with a pH 11.4 phase. The first column traps basic analytes from injected samples, while the remaining components continue to elute and separate. Then, upon injection of a volatile aqueous ammonia solution, the basic analytes are released as desired to the analytical column where they are separated and analyzed. Separations are quite reproducible and demonstrate an average RSD of 1.2% for analyte retention times in consecutive trials. Using this approach, the retention of such analytes can be readily controlled and they can be held in the system for periods of up to 1 h without significant erosion of peak shape. As such, it can provide considerable control over analyte selectivity and resolution compared to conventional separations. Further, by employing a third conventional GC column to the series, both traditional hydrocarbon and enhanced organic base separations can be performed. The method is applied to the analysis of complex mixtures, such as gasoline, and much less matrix interference is observed as a result. The findings indicate that this approach could be a useful alternative for analyzing such samples.",A Single-Crystal Open-Capsule Metal-Organic Framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042369,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 15,"Micro-/nanocapsules have received substantial attention due to various potential applications for storage, catalysis, and drug delivery.

This rare open-capsule MOF can easily load the largest amounts of sulfur and iodine among known MOFs. In addition, derived from capsular-MOF and melamine through pyrolysis-phosphidation, we fabricated a nitrogen-doped capsular carbon-based framework with iron-nickel phosphide nanoparticles immobilized on capsular carbons interconnected by plentiful carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from synergistic effects between the carbon framework and highly surface-exposed phosphide sites, the material exhibits efficient multifunctional electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen reduction, achieving well-qualified assemblies of an overall water splitting (low potential of 1.59 V at 10 mAÂ·cm-2) and a rechargeable Zn-air battery (high peak power density of 250 mWÂ·cm-2 and excellent stability for 500 h), which afford remarkably practical prospects over previously known electrocatalysts.","Transformation of Uranyl Peroxide Studtite, [(UO2)(O2)(H2O)2](H2O)2, to Soluble Nanoscale Cage Clusters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042368,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"The dissolution behavior of uranyl peroxide studtite, [(UO2)(O2)(H2O)2](H2O)2, was examined under a wide range of alkaline aqueous environments with and without the addition of hydrogen peroxide.

A critical review of these differences and the connection among them can help to bridge our knowledge between university-based researchers and protocol practitioners in accounting and taking further mitigation actions. The purpose of this study is to provide a review of published research and protocols related to city carbon accounting, paying attention to both their science and practical actions. To begin with, the most cited articles in this field are identified and analyzed by employing a citation network analysis to illustrate the development of city-level carbon accounting from three perspectives. We also reveal the relationship between research methods and accounting protocols. Furthermore, a timeline of relevant organizations, protocols, and projects is provided to demonstrate the applications of city carbon accounting in practice. The citation networks indicate that the field is dominated by pure-geographic production-based and community infrastructure-based accounting; however, emerging models that combine economic system analysis from a consumption-based perspective are leading to new trends in the field. The emissions accounted for by various research methods consist essentially of the scope 1-3, as defined in accounting protocols. The latest accounting protocols include consumption-based accounting, but most cities still limit their accounting and reporting from pure-geographic production-based and community infrastructure-based perspectives. In conclusion, we argue that protocol practitioners require support in conducting carbon accounting, so as to explore the potential in mitigation and adaptation from a number of perspectives. This should also be a priority for future studies.",Enzyme-Driven Assembly and Disassembly of Hybrid DNA-RNA Nanotubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042366,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 05 15,"Living cells have the ability to control the dynamics of responsive assemblies such as the cytoskeleton by temporally activating and deactivating inert precursors. While DNA nanotechnology has demonstrated many synthetic supramolecular assemblies that rival biological ones in size and complexity, dynamic control of their formation is still challenging. Taking inspiration from nature, we developed a DNA-RNA nanotube system whose assembly and disassembly can be temporally controlled at physiological temperature using transcriptional programs. Nanotubes assemble when inert DNA monomers are directly and selectively activated by RNA molecules that become embedded in the structure, producing hybrid DNA-RNA assemblies. The reactions and molecular programs controlling nanotube formation are fueled by enzymes that produce or degrade RNA. We show that the speed of assembly and disassembly of the nanotubes can be controlled by tuning various reaction parameters in the transcriptional programs. We anticipate that these hybrid structures are a starting point to build integrated biological circuits and functional scaffolds inside natural and artificial cells, where RNA produced by gene networks could fuel the assembly of nucleic acid components on demand.",Method for Identification of Threonine Isoforms in Peptides by Ultraviolet Photofragmentation of Cold Ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042365,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"Identification of isomeric amino acid residues in peptides and proteins is challenging but often highly desired in proteomics. One of the practically important cases that require isomeric assignments is that associated with single-nucleotide polymorphism substitutions of Met residues by Thr in cancer-related proteins. These genetically encoded substitutions can yet be confused with the chemical modifications, arising from protein alkylation by iodoacetamide, which is commonly used in the standard procedure of sample preparation for proteomic analysis. Similar to the genetically encoded mutations, the alkylation also induces a conversion of methionine residues, but to the iso-threonine form. Recognition of the mutations therefore requires isoform-sensitive detection techniques. Herein, we demonstrate an analytical method for reliable identification of isoforms of threonine residues in tryptic peptides. It is based on ultraviolet photodissociation mass spectrometry of cryogenically cooled ions and a machine-learning algorithm. The measured photodissociation mass spectra exhibit isoform-specific patterns, which are independent of the residues adjacent to threonine or iso-threonine in a peptide sequence. A comprehensive metric-based evaluation demonstrates that, being calibrated with a set of model peptides, the method allows for isomeric identification of threonine residues in peptides of arbitrary sequence."

Through standard electrochemical measurements, catalytic activity, reversibility and stability, potentials of redox-active cofactors, and interfacial electron transfer rates can be readily measured. Mechanistic investigations on the high electrocatalytic rates and selectivity of enzymes may yield inspiration for the design of synthetic molecular and heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Electrochemical investigations of enzymes also aid in our understanding of their activity within their biological environment and why they evolved in their present structure and function. However, the conventional array of electrochemical techniques (e.g., voltammetry and chronoamperometry) alone offers a limited picture of the enzyme-electrode interface. How many enzymes are loaded onto an electrode? In which orientation(s) are they bound? What fraction is active, and are single or multilayers formed? Does this static picture change over time, applied voltage, or chemical environment? How does charge transfer through various intraprotein cofactors contribute to the overall performance and catalytic bias? What is the distribution of individual enzyme activities within an ensemble of active protein films? These are central questions for the understanding of the enzyme-electrode interface, and a multidisciplinary approach is required to deliver insightful answers. Complementing standard electrochemical experiments with an orthogonal set of techniques has recently allowed to provide a more complete picture of enzyme-electrode systems. Within this framework, we first discuss a brief history of achievements and challenges in enzyme electrochemistry. We subsequently describe how the aforementioned challenges can be overcome by applying advanced electrochemical techniques, quartz-crystal microbalance measurements, and spectroscopic, namely, resonance Raman and infrared, analysis. For example, rotating ring disk electrochemistry permits the simultaneous determination of reaction kinetics and quantification of generated products. In addition, recording changes in frequency and dissipation in a quartz crystal microbalance allows to shed light into enzyme loading, relative orientation, clustering, and denaturation at the electrode surface. Resonance Raman spectroscopy yields information on ligation and redox state of enzyme cofactors, whereas infrared spectroscopy provides insights into active site states and the protein secondary and tertiary structure. The development of these emerging methods for the analysis of the enzyme-electrode interface is the primary focus of this Account. We also take a critical look at the remaining gaps in our understanding and challenges lying ahead toward attaining a complete mechanistic picture of the enzyme-electrode interface.",Neural Circuits Associated with 5-HT1B Receptor Agonist Inhibition of Methamphetamine Seeking in the Conditioned Place Preference Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042352,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 06 10,"5-HT1B receptors (5-HT1BRs) modulate psychostimulant reward and incentive motivation in rodents. Here we investigated the effects of the 5-HT1BR agonist CP94253 (10 mg/kg, IP) on the acquisition and expression of methamphetamine (Meth) conditioned place preference (CPP) in C57BL/6 male mice. We subsequently examined the potential brain regions involved in CP94253 effects using FOS as a marker of neural activity. In the acquisition experiment, mice received the agonist 30 min before each of the Meth injections given during conditioning. In the expression experiment, mice that had acquired Meth-CPP were given either saline or CP94253 and were tested for CPP 30 min later. We found that CP94253 attenuated the expression of Meth-CPP, but had no effect on acquisition. Mice expressing Meth-CPP had elevated numbers of FOS+ cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and basolateral amygdala (BlA) and reduced FOS+ cells in the central amygdala (CeA) compared to saline controls. CP94253 given before the expression test, but not acutely in drug-naive mice, enhanced FOS+ cells in the VTA, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core, and the dorsomedial striatum and reversed the Meth-conditioned changes in FOS in the BlA and CeA. Approximately 50-70% of FOS+ cells in the NAc and VTA were GABAergic regardless of group. By contrast, we did not observe FOS-labeling in dopamine neurons in the VTA. The findings suggest that CP94253 attenuates the motivational effects of the Meth-associated environment and highlight the amygdala, VTA, NAc, and dorsomedial striatum as potential regions involved in this effect.",Why AÎ²42 Is Much More Toxic than AÎ²40.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042351,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 05 09,"Amyloid precursor A4 (770 amino acids (aa)) dimerizes and aggregates, as do its C-terminal (99 aa) and amyloid AÎ² (40,42 aa AÎ²40,AÎ²42) fragments.

To date, it remains a big challenge to fabricate mechanosensors with both high sensitivity and a wide sensing range. In nature, slit sensilla are crack-shaped sensory organs of arachnids, which are highly sensitive to tiny external mechanical stimuli. Here, inspired by the geometry of slit sensilla, a concept is developed that pretextures reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocoating into multiscale topographies with agminated crumples and interlaced cracks (crumpled & cracked RGO) through an efficient and scalable mechanically driven process. Both the sensitivity and the workable range can be facilely tuned by adjusting the crack density. The resulting mechanosensor exhibits a comprehensive superior performance including high sensitivity (a gauge factor of 205 to 3256), a wide and tunable sensing range (from 0-40 to 0-180%), long-term stability (over 5000 cycles), and multiple sensing functions. Based on its excellent performances, the mechanosensor can be used as a wearable electronic to in situ monitor subtle physiological signals and vigorous body actions.

Incorporation of an FR in a polymer typically leads to deterioration of its mechanical properties. It also manifests itself in non-negligible volatile organic compound (VOC) release, which in turn increases environmental risks carried by both the application and disposal of the corresponding consumer goods. Herein, we present a hierarchical strategy for the design of composite materials, which ensures simultaneous improvement of both mechanical and fire-safety properties of polymers while limiting the VOC release. Our strategy employs porous metal-organic framework (MOF) particles to provide a multifunctional interface between the FR molecules and the polymer. Specifically, we demonstrate that the particles of environmentally friendly HKUST-1 MOF can be infused by a modern FR-dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP)-and then embedded into widely used unsaturated polyesters. The DMMP-HKUST-1 additive endows the resulting composite material with improved processability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and computational modeling of the additive suggest the complete pore filling of HKUST-1 with DMMP molecules being bound to the open metal sites of the MOF.",Tunable Thermal Energy Transport across Diamond Membranes and Diamond-Si Interfaces by Nanoscale Graphoepitaxy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042348,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"The development of electronic devices, especially those that involve heterogeneous integration of materials, has led to increased challenges in addressing their thermal operational temperature demands. The heat flow in these systems is significantly influenced or even dominated by thermal boundary resistance at the interface between dissimilar materials. However, controlling and tuning heat transport across an interface and in the adjacent materials has so far drawn limited attention. In this work, we grow chemical vapor-deposited diamond on silicon substrates by graphoepitaxy and experimentally demonstrate tunable thermal transport across diamond membranes and diamond-silicon interfaces. We observed the highest diamond-silicon thermal boundary conductance (TBC) measured to date and increased diamond thermal conductivity due to strong grain texturing in the diamond near the interface. Additionally, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and a Landauer approach are used to understand the diamond-silicon TBC. These findings pave the way for tuning or increasing thermal conductance in heterogeneously integrated electronics that involve polycrystalline materials and will impact applications including electronics thermal management and diamond growth.",Thin Composite Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes from a Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity Precursor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042347,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"Ultra-thin composite carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were fabricated on well-defined inorganic alumina substrates using a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) as a precursor. Details of the pyrolysis-related structural development were elucidated using focused-beam, interference-enhanced spectroscopic ellipsometry (both in the UV-vis and IR range), which allowed accurate determination of the film thickness, optical properties as well as following the chemical transformations. The pyrolysis-induced collapse of thin and bulk PIM-derived CMS membranes was compared with CMS made from a well-known non-PIM precursor 6FDA-DABA. Significant differences between the PIM and non-PIM precursors were discovered and explained by a much larger possible volume contraction in the PIM. In spite of the differences, surprisingly, the gas separation properties did not fundamentally differ. The high-temperature collapse of the initially amorphous and isotropic precursor structure was accompanied by a significant molecular orientation within the formed turbostratic carbon network guided by the laterally constraining presence of the substrate. This manifested itself in the development of uniaxial optical anisotropy, which was shown to correlate with increases in gas separation selectivity for multiple technologically important gas pairs. Reduction of CMS skin thickness significantly below âˆ¼1 Î¼m induced large losses in permeability coefficients with only small to moderate effects on selectivity. Remarkably, skin thickness reduction and physical aging seemed to superimpose onto the same trend, which explains and strengthens some of the earlier fundamental insights.",Deliberate Modification of Fe3O4 Anode Surface Chemistry: Impact on Electrochemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042346,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 13,"Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of 8-10 nm have been successfully functionalized with various surface-treatment agents to serve as model systems for probing surface chemistry-dependent electrochemistry of the resulting electrodes. The surface-treatment agents used for the functionalization of Fe3O4 anode materials were systematically varied to include aromatic or aliphatic structures: 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, benzoic acid (BA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and propionic acid (PA). Both structural and electrochemical characterizations have been used to systematically correlate the electrode functionality with the corresponding surface chemistry. Surface treatment with ligands led to better Fe3O4 dispersion, especially with the aromatic ligands. Electrochemistry was impacted where the PA- and BA-treated Fe3O4 systems without the -SH group demonstrated a higher rate capability than their thiol-containing counterparts and the pristine Fe3O4. Specifically, the PA system delivered the highest capacity and cycling stability among all samples tested. Notably, the aromatic BA system outperformed the aliphatic PA counterpart during extended cycling under high current density, due to the improved charge transfer and ion transport kinetics as well as better dispersion of Fe3O4 NPs, induced by the conjugated system. Our surface engineering of the Fe3O4 electrode presented herein, highlights the importance of modifying the structure and chemistry of surface-treatment agents as a plausible means of enhancing the interfacial charge transfer within metal oxide composite electrodes without hampering the resulting tap density of the resulting electrode.",The Role of Local Bone Marrow Renin-Angiotensin System in Multiple Myeloma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042345,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,2019 05 02,"Angiotensin II acts as a growth promoter or angiogenic factor via type 1 receptors (AGTR1) in certain tumors.

Pediatric patients are also at further risk of serious adverse events secondary to challenges with airway management and variation in equipment sizing and weight-based medication dosing. Recent changes to Rhode Island Emergency Medical Services protocols, particularly the requirement for all non-traumatic cardiac arrests to be managed on scene for a minimum of 30 minutes, have led to discussion and controversy.

We posited that the combination of these two treatment strategies would be more beneficial for healing tendons than each treatment alone. Rat tail tendons were harvested and cultured without mechanical stress for 0, 4, or 10 days. Single and combination treatment with PRP and MMPIs with either broad- or narrow-spectrum (MMP-13 selective), was administered to 4-day stress-deprived (SD) tendons, an ex vivo model for moderate tendinopathy. This treatment was applied to the damaged tendons over 6 days. At the end of their culture time, the tendons were subjected to traction testing and pathohistology, immunohistochemistry, and viability assays. The results showed better histological features for the PRPâ€‰+â€‰narrow-spectrum MMPI group compared with all individual treatment modalities. Moreover, higher fiber density, more elongated nucleus shape, smaller space between fibers, and a trend toward higher mechanical strength were noted for PRPâ€‰+â€‰narrow-spectrum MMPI group compared with 10-day SD tendons. This study shows that the combination of PRPâ€‰+â€‰narrow-spectrum MMPI is a potentially effective treatment approach for tendinopathy.",Development of a Biconcave Mobile-Bearing Lumbar Total Disc Arthroplasty Concept Using Finite Element Analysis and Design Optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042323,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,2019 05 27,"Total disc arthroplasty (TDA) is a motion-preserving surgical treatment for spinal disorders. However, adverse surgical outcomes, such as abnormal kinematics, facet joint (FJ) overloading, and polyethylene (PE) failures, have limited wide application of lumbar TDAs. The objectives of this computational study were to elucidate how implant design and FJ articulation both influence metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) motion and contact mechanics, as well as to propose and refine a new mobile-bearing TDA concept which enhanced postoperative performance. Simulation results show that abnormal motions (lift-off and/or unsymmetrical motion) are alleviated in fixed-/mobile-bearing TDA-treated segments, as the FJ gap increases. It clearly demonstrates that FJ articulation guides segmental motion and interferes with intended MoP articulation. For an existing biconvex mobile-bearing design, component impingement leads to a peak PE stress of 20.8â€‰MPa (yield stress: 13â€‰MPa), indicating a high risk of PE creep/fracture. Therefore, we proposed a new TDA concept featuring a biconcave PE core with a smooth shape, in order to strengthen the PE rim and mitigate edge-loading. Furthermore, the biconcave-core TDA was optimally designed to promote normal segmental range of motion (ROM), or to minimize polyethylene contact pressure (PCP). In extension (the severest loading scenario), the biconvex-core TDA design caused a ROM 3.6Â° (+88%) greater than the intact segment and a peak PCP of 116.5â€‰MPa. In contrast, ROM-optimal or PCP-optimal biconcave-core TDA designs decreased the ROM difference to 0.0Â° or the peak PCP to 24.3â€‰MPa. Therefore, this new TDA design can potentially reduce the incidence of hypermotion and PE damage. Â© 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Percutaneous fenestration, or dry needling, techniques have been increasing in popularity, but despite their current use, there are no controlled laboratory studies to provide fundamental support for this practice. The objective of this study was to establish a model for percutaneous needling of the rat supraspinatus tendon using ultrasound guidance and to evaluate the biological response of needling healthy tendon. A total of 44 male Sprague-Dawley rats (477â€‰Â±â€‰39â€‰g) were used to evaluate the effect of dry needling on healthy supraspinatus tendon properties. Ten rats were reserved as un-needled control animals, and the remaining animals underwent either mild or moderate bilateral needling protocols and were sacrificed at 1 or 6 weeks post-needling (nâ€‰=â€‰8-10/group). Color Doppler ultrasound imaging was performed to analyze blood flow within the tendon. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were used to determine cellular, inflammatory, and extracellular matrix properties of the tissue. Finally, quasi-static tensile mechanical analysis was performed to obtain viscoelastic, structural, and material properties to evaluate the tendon healing outcome. Data were tested for normality, and then two-way analysis of variance tests were performed followed by post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. Both the mild and moderate needling groups caused a transient healing response at early time points as shown by a statistically significant (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) reduction in mechanical properties, and increase in blood flow, inflammation, and production of collagen III and glycosaminoglycans as compared to the control. Furthermore, mild needling properties returned to or exceeded pre-needling values at the 6-week time point. Clinical significance: Needling the rat supraspinatus tendon is a feasible technique that causes a transient healing response followed by a return to, or improvement of, normal tendon properties, indicating potential applicability in understanding the effects of current practices utilizing dry needling of tendons in humans.","Colonization, Baker's law, and the evolution of gynodioecy in Hawaii: implications from a study of Lycium carolinianum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042317,American journal of botany,2019 05 13,"As Baker's law suggests, the successful colonization of oceanic islands is often associated with uniparental reproduction (self-fertility), but the high incidence of dimorphism (dioecy, gynodioecy) on islands complicates this idea.

The aim of this study was to compare disc degeneration grading systems with each other, and with biomechanical measures of disc function. Sixty-six motion segments (T8-9 to L5-S1) were dissected from cadavers aged 48-98â€‰years. Disc function was assessed by measuring nucleus pressure (IDP) and maximum stresses in the annulus under 1â€‰kN of compression. Detailed ""scores"" of disc degeneration were based on independent radiographic, macroscopic, and microscopic evaluations. For each evaluation, scores were used to assign a degeneration ""grade"" (I-IV), and functional measures were then correlated with degeneration scores and grades. Results showed that all measures were reliable (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.82-0.99). Macroscopic and microscopic assessments were highly correlated with each other (r: 0.57-0.89, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) but only weakly correlated with radiographic features. The overall macroscopic and microscopic scores of degeneration increased significantly with age and at lower spinal levels, although the influence of age was less marked in the case of the microscopic scores. IDP decreased with age and at lower spinal levels, but annulus stresses were more variable. Importantly, IDP and annulus stresses decreased consistently with all measures of disc degeneration, and these associations remained strong after controlling for age, gender, and spinal level. We conclude that radiographic and tissue-based assessments of disc degeneration are consistent with each other, and are more closely related to mechanical (dys)function than to age or spinal level."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of UBM to induce matrix organization and tenogenesis using a novel in vitro model.

Hydrogels seeded with bone marrow cells (nâ€‰=â€‰6 adult horses) were cast using rat tail tendon ECMâ€‰Â±â€‰UBM, fixed under static tension and harvested at 7 and 21 days for construct contraction, cell viability, histology, biochemistry, and gene expression. By day 7, UBM constructs contracted significantly from baseline, whereas control constructs did not. Both control and UBM constructs contracted significantly by day 21. In both groups, cells remained viable over time and changed from round and randomly oriented to elongated along lines of tension with visible compaction of the ECM. There were no differences over time or between treatments for nuclear aspect ratio, DNA, or glycosaminoglycan content. Decorin, MMP-13, and Scleraxis expression increased significantly over time, but not in response to UBM treatment. Mohawk expression was constant over time. COMP expression decreased over time in both groups. Using a novel ECM hydrogel model, substantial matrix organization and cell differentiation occurred; however, addition of UBM failed to induce greater matrix organization than tendon ECM alone.

Thus, a method was developed and optimized, including loading, washing and elution steps, for the selective enrichment of phosphopeptides. To assess this potential, tryptic digest of three proteins (Î±- casein, Î²-casein and ovalbumin) was applied on poly(dibenzo-18-crown-6).

In water, SPTPCs self-assembled and a spontaneous spiropyran-to-merocyanine (SP-to-MC) isomerization occurred, resulting in coexistence of liposomes and fibers, and switching from the spiropyran (SP) to the merocyanine (MC) isomeric structure induced a reversible transition between these molecular assemblies. Study of the self-assembly of SPTPCs and photo-induced liposome-fiber assembly-transition revealed that the presence of MC enabled additional inter-membrane interaction during self-assembly and that the MC-stacking effect was the driving force for the assembly-transition. Exposure to UV light induced switching from SP to MC, where the planar structure of MC and the confinement of MC led to enhanced MC-stacking. The effect of MC-stacking was both advantageous and disadvantageous: MC-stacking perturbed the hydrophobic phase in the bilayer membrane and facilitated the liposome-to-fiber transition, otherwise the MC-stacking retarded switching of MC to SP, and caused an incomplete recovery of MC to SP during fiber-to-liposome recovery, thus a fatigue of SP was induced by MC-stacking during the liposome-to-fiber transition cycle. To decrease the intermolecular interactions and suppress MC-stacking, photo-inert triazole-phosphatidylcholine (TPC) was incorporated to prepare two-component TPC/SPTPC-liposomes, which exhibited better recovery kinetics. The photo-adaptive behavior of TPC/SPTPC-liposomes confirmed the disturbance of bilayer membranes by inter-membrane MC-stacking and the formation of MCTPC-enriched phases in the bilayer membrane.",Melleolides impact fungal translation via elongation factor 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042251,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 05 16,"Melleolides from the honey mushroom Armillaria mellea represent a structurally diverse group of polyketide-sesquiterpene hybrids.

This unique combination of cyclodextrin vesicles capable of specifically recognizing guest molecules with a plasmonic particle shell displaying multiple interparticle gaps acting as electromagnetic hotspots shows great potential for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) applications."

The number of dark fringes between two bright spots is equal to the topological charge (TC) of the vortex beam. Meanwhile, the intensity pattern varies with the sign of the TC. Based on this property, we proposed a convenient method to measure the TC of a vortex beam by observing its intensity pattern after passing through a twisting phase. This detection technique is mainly based on the use of a twisting phase, and the effect of parameters in the twisting phase is demonstrated and clearly studied.

We demonstrate how to correct for this effect using the intrinsic properties of the TM. For thin scattering media, we exploit the memory effect of the medium and the reference speckle to create a corrected TM. For highly scattering media where the memory effect is negligible, we use complementary reference speckles to compose a new TM, not compromised by the speckled reference anymore.

We demonstrated that heterologous prime-boost vaccination with the nuclear antigen 1 of EBV (EBNA1), either targeted to the DEC205 receptor on DCs or expressed from a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector, improved priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cell help. This help supported the expansion and maintenance of EBNA1-specific CD8+ T cells that are most efficiently primed by recombinant adenoviruses that encode EBNA1. These combined CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses protected against EBNA1-expressing T and B cell lymphomas, including lymphoproliferations that emerged spontaneously after EBNA1 expression. In particular, the heterologous EBNA1-expressing adenovirus, boosted by EBNA1-encoding MVA vaccination, demonstrated protection as a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for the respective lymphoma challenges. Our study shows that such heterologous prime-boost vaccinations against EBV-associated malignancies as well as symptomatic primary EBV infection should be further explored for clinical development.",The gut microbiota and graft-versus-host disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042160,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 05 05,"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a common complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation that negatively impacts quality of life in recipients and can be fatal. Animal experiments and human studies provide compelling evidence that the gut microbiota is associated with risk of GvHD, but the nature of this relationship remains unclear. If the gut microbiota is a driver of GvHD pathogenesis, then manipulation of the gut microbiota offers one promising avenue for preventing or treating this common condition, and antibiotic stewardship efforts in transplantation may help preserve the indigenous microbiota and modulate immune responses to benefit the host.",Impact of estrogens in males and androgens in females.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042159,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 05 05,"Androgens and estrogens are known to be critical regulators of mammalian physiology and development. While these two classes of steroids share similar structures (in general, estrogens are derived from androgens via the enzyme aromatase), they subserve markedly different functions via their specific receptors. In the past, estrogens such as estradiol were thought to be most important in the regulation of female biology, while androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were believed to primarily modulate development and physiology in males. However, the emergence of patients with deficiencies in androgen or estrogen hormone synthesis or actions, as well as the development of animal models that specifically target androgen- or estrogen-mediated signaling pathways, have revealed that estrogens and androgens regulate critical biological and pathological processes in both males and females. In fact, the concept of ""male"" and ""female"" hormones is an oversimplification of a complex developmental and biological network of steroid actions that directly impacts many organs. In this Review, we will discuss important roles of estrogens in males and androgens in females.",Data-Driven Blood Glucose Pattern Classification and Anomalies Detection: Machine-Learning Applications in Type 1 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042157,Journal of medical Internet research,2019 05 01,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that results in abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulations.

We show here that emperipolesis is a dynamic process mediated actively by both lineages, in part through the Î²2-integrin/ICAM-1/ezrin pathway. Tethered neutrophils enter in membrane-bound vesicles before penetrating into the megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic neutrophils develop membrane contiguity with the demarcation membrane system, thereby transferring membrane to the megakaryocyte and to daughter platelets. This phenomenon occurs in otherwise unmanipulated murine marrow in vivo, resulting in circulating platelets that bear membrane from non-megakaryocytic hematopoietic donors. Transit through megakaryocytes can be completed as rapidly as minutes, after which neutrophils egress intact. Emperipolesis is amplified in models of murine inflammation associated with platelet overproduction, contributing to platelet production in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify emperipolesis as a new cell-in-cell interaction that enables neutrophils and potentially other cells passing through the megakaryocyte cytoplasm to modulate the production and membrane content of platelets.",Effects of the golfer-ground interaction on clubhead speed in skilled male golfers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042142,Sports biomechanics,2019 05 13,"The purposes of this study were to characterise the golfer-ground interactions during the swing and to identify meaningful associations between the golfer-ground interaction force/moment parameters and the maximum clubhead speed in 63 highly skilled male golfers (handicap â‰¤ 3). Golfers performed shots in 3 club conditions (driver, 5-iron and pitching wedge) which were captured by an optical motion capture system and 2 force plates. In addition to the ground reaction forces (GRFs), 3 different golfer-ground interaction moments (GRF moments, pivoting moments and foot contact moments) were computed. The GRF moment about the forward/backward (F/B) axis and the pivoting moment about the vertical axis were identified as the primary moments. Significant (pÂ <Â 0.05) correlations of peak force parameters (all components in the lead foot and F/B component in the trail foot) and peak moment parameters (lead-foot GRF moment and trail-foot pivoting moment) to clubhead speed were found. The lead-foot was responsible for generating the GRF moment, while the trail foot contributed to the pivoting moment more. The instant the lead arm becomes parallel to the ground was identified as the point of maximum angular effort, and the loading onto the lead-foot near this point was critical in generating both peak moments.",The sidestep cutting manoeuvre requires exertion of lumbosacral lateral flexion torque to avoid excessive pelvic obliquity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042141,Sports biomechanics,2019 05 13,"During sidestep cutting, the pelvis is supported only on one side; this affects the athlete's posture. This study investigated the mechanism to avoid excessive pelvic obliquity during sidestep cutting. Ten physically active men performed sidestep cutting with maximal effort, and we captured the kinematics and kinetics with force platforms and an eight-camera motion capture system. Our results indicated that the stance hip exerted little abduction torque; however, lumbosacral lateral flexion torque was exerted towards the free-leg side (peak value: 3.39Â Â±Â 0.91Â N m/kg). Although bilateral hip joint forces acted to drop the free-leg side of the pelvis, the net torque around pelvic elevation/drop axis was nearly zero during the entire stance phase and the change in the angular momentum around the pelvic elevation/drop axis from touchdown to toe-off was negligible (-0.004Â Â±Â 0.003Â N mÂ s/kg). The integrated components of lateral flexor for elevating the free-leg side of the pelvis (0.220Â Â±Â 0.072Â N mÂ s/kg) were significantly larger than any other integrated components, which were all negligible (<0.010Â N mÂ s/kg). Thus, sidestep cutting requires the lumbosacral lateral flexion torque exertion to neutralise the passive action that drops the free-leg side of the pelvis.",Training rugby athletes with an external attentional focus promotes more automatic adaptions in landing forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042140,Sports biomechanics,2019 05 13,"Training to reduce landing forces is a common component of anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programmes. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of training incorporating instructions promoting an internal versus external attentional focus on landing forces in adolescent rugby athletes. Twenty-two rugby athletes were randomly allocated to groups that received instructions promoting an internal versus an external focus during a two week training programme. Landing forces were recorded before and after completion of the programme. During follow-up testing, landings were performed with and without a secondary cognitive task. Both groups exhibited a similar reduction in landing forces following training for trials performed without the secondary cognitive task. However, the groups responded differently when the secondary cognitive task was imposed. Athletes who were trained with an internal focus demonstrated a prominent increase in landing forces for trials that included the secondary cognitive task (vs. trials performed without the secondary cognitive task), whereas the secondary cognitive task had minimal influence for athletes who were trained with an external focus. It appears that training with an external focus may promote adaptations in landing mechanics that can be implemented more automatically.",The application of inertial measurement units and functional principal component analysis to evaluate movement in the forward 3Â½ pike somersault springboard dive.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042139,Sports biomechanics,2019 05 13,"Based on technological and analytical advances, the capability to more accurately and finitely examine biomechanical and skill characteristics of movement has improved. The purpose of this study was to use Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and Functional Principal Components Analysis (fPCA) to examine the role of movement variability (assessed via angular velocity), on 2 divers (1 international level; 1 national) performing the forward 3Â½ pike somersault dive. Analysis of angular velocity curves during ive-flight identified 5 fPCs, accounting for 96.5% of movement variability. The national diver's scatter plots and standard deviation of fPC scores illustrated larger magnitudes of angular velocity variability across dive flight. For fPC1 and fPC3, magnitudes of SD variability were 282.6 and 201.5, respectively. The international diver illustrated more consistent angular velocity profiles, with clustering of fPCs scores (e.g., fPC1 & 3Â =Â SD's of 75.2 & 68.0). To account for lower variability in the international diver, the ability to better coordinate movement sequences and functionally utilise feedback in response to initiation of the somersault position is highlighted. Overall, findings highlight how both IMUs and fPCA can more holistically and finitely examine the biomechanical and skill characteristics of movement sequences with the capability to inform athlete development.",Early versus delayed administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor following chemotherapy in pediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042138,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,2019 05 01,The optimal timing of initiating granulocyte-colony stimulating factor following chemotherapy in pediatric patients has not been clearly defined.

Although rarely, however, cetuximab needs to be discontinued in the absence of disease progression because of intolerable side effects. Here we describe the case of a 66-year-old man with a metastatic cancer of oral cavity, who had to discontinue maintenance cetuximab and who achieved prolonged disease control with metronomic capecitabine.

Spindle poles are asymmetric in composition. One spindle pole contains the oldest mitotic centriole, the mother centriole, where the majority of cenexin, the mother centriole appendage protein and PLK1 binding partner, resides. We hypothesized that PLK1 activity is greater at the cenexin-positive older spindle pole. Our studies found that PLK1 asymmetrically localizes between spindle poles under conditions of chromosome misalignment, and chromosomes tend to misalign toward the oldest spindle pole in a cenexin- and PLK1-dependent manner. During chromosome misalignment, PLK1 activity is increased specifically at the oldest spindle pole, and this increase in activity is lost in cenexin-depleted cells. We propose a model where PLK1 activity elevates in response to misaligned chromosomes at the oldest spindle pole during metaphase.",The UIG-1/CDC-42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor acts in parallel to CED-10/Rac1 during axon outgrowth in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042115,Small GTPases,2019 05 01,"During development of the brain, neuronal circuits are formed through the projection of axons and dendrites in response to guidance signals. Rho GTPases (Rac1/RhoA/Cdc42) are major regulators of axo-dendritic outgrowth and guidance due to their role in controlling actin cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion and motility. Functional redundancy of Rho GTPase-regulated pathways in neuronal development can mask the roles of specific GTPases. To examine potential Rho GTPase redundancy, we utilized a recently isolated hypomorphic mutation in a Caenorhabditis elegans Rac1 protein - CED-10(G30E) - which reduces the GTP binding and inhibits axon outgrowth of the PVQ interneurons. Here, we show that the CDC-42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor UIG-1 acts in parallel to CED-10/Rac1 to control PVQ axon outgrowth. UIG-1 performs this function in a cell-autonomous manner. Further, we found that transgenic expression of CDC-42 can compensate for aberrant CED-10(G30E)-regulated signalling during PVQ axon outgrowth. Together, our study reveals a previously unappreciated function for CDC-42 in PVQ axon outgrowth in C. elegans.",Essentialist Beliefs and Sexual Prejudice Toward Feminine Gay Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042114,Journal of homosexuality,2019 05 01,"We propose that feminine gay men are targets of essentialist beliefs that cast them as less natural and more entitative than masculine gay men, and that this pattern of low-naturalness/high-entitativity beliefs fuels increased sexual prejudice toward, and discomfort with, feminine gay men.

In Study 1, feminine versus masculine gay men were rated lower in naturalness and higher in entitativity, while masculine versus feminine lesbians did not elicit this pattern of beliefs. Study 2 replicated the effects of gay men's gender expression on essentialist beliefs, and demonstrated that feminine gay men arouse more prejudice and discomfort than masculine gay men because they are perceived as socially constructed (low in naturalness) and deeply homogeneous (high in entitativity).

Lynwood area vehicle tailpipe emissions were first surveyed in 1989 and 1991 because the area suffered with a large number of carbon monoxide (CO) air quality violations. These new measurements allow for the estimation of fuel specific CO and total hydrocarbon (HC) emissions reductions, changes in the longevity of emission-control components, and the prevalence of high emitters in the current fleet. Since 1989 CO emissions decreased approximately factors of 10 (120 Â± 8 to 12.3 Â± 0.2 gCO/kg of fuel) and 20 (210 Â± 8 to 10.4 Â± 0.4 gCO/kg of fuel) at our I-710/Imperial Highway and Long Beach Blvd. sites respectively. These reductions are also reflected in the local ambient air measurements. Tailpipe HC emissions have decreased by a factor of 25 (50 Â± 4 to 2.1 Â± 0.3 gHC/kg of fuel) since 1991 at the Long Beach Blvd. location. The decreases are so dramatic that the vast majority of vehicles now have HC measurements that are indistinguishable from zero. The decreases have increased the skewedness of the emissions distribution with the 99th percentile now responsible for more than 37% (CO) and 28% (HC) of the totals. Ammonia emissions collected in 2018 at both Lynwood locations peak with 20-year-old vehicles (1998 models), indicating long lifetimes for catalytic converters. In 1989 and 1991, the on-road Lynwood fleets had significantly higher emissions than fleets observed in other locations within the South Coast Air Basin. The 2018 fleets now have means and emissions by model year that are consistent with those observed at other sites in Los Angeles and the U.S. This indicates that modern vehicle combustion management and after-treatment systems are achieving their goals regardless of community income levels.",Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline Amendment 2018-2019.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042111,The Journal of urology,2019 06 10,The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate newly-published literature into the original ASTRO/AUA Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Prostatectomy Guideline and to provide an updated clinical framework for clinicians.,Risk of reaugmentation after enterocystoplasty using a reconfigured bowel segment in patients with spina bifida: a bi-institutional cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042110,The Journal of urology,2019 06 10,Reaugmentation cystoplasty rates vary in the literature but have been reported as high as 15%.

Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 06 10,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia that mainly affects the elderly. Several reports have demonstrated that aging is involved in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of IPF. Î±-klotho (KL) has been well characterized as an 'age-suppressing' hormone and can provide protection against cellular senescence and oxidative stress. In this study, Kl levels were assessed in human plasma and primary lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF-FB) and in lung tissue from mice exposed to bleomycin, which showed significant downregulation when compared to controls. Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing KL were protected against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with recombinant KL alone was not sufficient to inhibit TGF-b-induced collagen deposition and inflammatory marker expression. Interestingly, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)23, a pro-inflammatory circulating protein for which KL is a co-receptor, was upregulated in IPF and bleomycin lungs. To our surprise, FGF23 and KL co-administration led to a significant reduction in fibrosis and inflammation in IPF-FB; FGF23 administration alone or in combination with KL stimulated KL upregulation. We conclude that in IPF, downregulation of KL may contribute to fibrosis and inflammation and FGF23 may act as a compensatory anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory mediator via inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling. Upon restoration of KL levels, the combination of FGF23 and KL leads to resolution of inflammation and fibrosis. Altogether, these data provide novel insight into the FGF23/ KL axis and its anti-fibrotic/anti-inflammatory properties, which opens new avenues for potential therapies in aging-related diseases like IPF.",Caveolin-1 Scaffolding Domain Peptide Prevents Hyperoxia-Induced Airway Remodeling in a Neonatal Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042080,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 01,"Reactive airway diseases are significant sources of pulmonary morbidity in neonatal and pediatric patients. Supplemental oxygen exposure in premature infants contributes to airway diseases such as asthma, and promotes development of airway remodeling, characterized by increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Decreased plasma membrane caveolin-1 (CAV1) expression has been implicated in airway disease and may contribute to airway remodeling and hyperreactivity. Here, we investigated the impact of clinically relevant moderate hyperoxia (50% O2) on airway remodeling and caveolar protein expression in a neonatal mouse model. Within 12 hours of birth, litters of B6129SF2J mice were randomized to room air (RA) or 50% hyperoxia exposure for 7 days with or without Caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSD; caveolin-1 mimic; 10 ÂµL, 0.25 mM daily via intraperitoneal (IP) injection) followed by 14 days recovery in normoxia Moderate hyperoxia significantly increased airway reactivity and decreased pulmonary compliance at 3 weeks. Histologic assessment demonstrated airway wall thickening, and increased ASM mass following hyperoxia. RNA from isolated ASM demonstrated significant decreases in CAV1 and cavin-1 in hyperoxia exposed animals while cavin-3 was increased. Supplementation with IP CSD mitigated both the physiologic and histologic changes observed with hyperoxia. Overall, these data show that moderate hyperoxia is detrimental to developing airway and may predispose to airway reactivity and remodeling. Loss of CAV1 is one mechanism through which hyperoxia produces these deleterious effects. Supplementation of CAV1 using CSD or similar analogs may represent a new therapeutic avenue for blunting hyperoxia-induced pulmonary damage in neonates.",Maternal High Fat Diet Alters Lung Development and Function in the Offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042079,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 01,"The effects of maternal obesity on lung development have been recognized and speculation is that these diseases are not simply due to accelerated pulmonary decline with aging, but with a failure to achieve optimal lung development during early life. These studies tested the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters signaling pathways during the course of lung development that may affect life-long pulmonary health. Adult female mice were fed 60% fat (HFD) or 10% fat (CD) diets for 8 weeks prior to mating and through weaning. Pup lung tissues were collected at postnatal days (PN) 7, 21 and 90 (after receiving HFD or CD as adults). At PN7, body weights from HFD were greater than CD but lung weight to body weight ratios were lower. In lung tissues, NFkB-mediated inflammation was greater in HFD pups at PN21 and phospho-/total STAT3, phospho-/total VEGFR2, and total AKT protein levels were lower with maternal HFD and PTP1B levels were increased. Decreased PECAM levels were observed at PN21 and at PN90 in the pups exposed to maternal HFD. Morphometry indicated that the pups exposed to maternal or adult HFD had fewer alveoli and the effect was additive. Decreases in pulmonary resistance, elastance, and compliance were observed due to adult HFD diet and decreases in airway resistance and increases in inspiratory capacity due to maternal HFD. In conclusion, maternal HFD disrupts signaling pathways in the early developing lung and may contribute to deficiencies in lung function and increased susceptibility in adults.",Flow cytometric analysis of the leukocyte landscape during bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis in the rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042078,American journal of physiology.

For this purpose, we describe a novel panel of rat surface markers and strategy to identify and follow BAL cells over time. By combining surface markers in rat alveolar immune cells (CD45+, CD11b/c+), granulocytes and macrophages can be identified. Moreover, different activation states of macrophages (CD163+) can be observed: steady-state (CD86-, MHC-IIlow), activation during inflammation (CD86+, MHC-IIhigh), activation during remodeling (CD86+, MHCIIlow) and a population of newly recruited monocytes (CD163-, Î±-granulocyte-). Hydroxyproline measured as marker of collagen content in lung tissue showed positive correlation with the reparative phase (CD163- cells and TIMP and IL-10 increase). In conclusion, after a very early granulocytic recruitment, inflammation in rat lungs is observed by activated macrophages and high release of IL-6, and fibrotic remodeling is characterized by recovery of the macrophage population together with TIMP, IL-10 and IL-18 production. Recruited monocytes and a second peak of neutrophils appear in the transitioning phase, correlating with immunostaining of arginase 1 in the tissue, revealing the importance of events leading the changes from injury to aberrant repair.",Acute exposure to e-cigarettes causes inflammation and endothelial oxidative stress in non-smoking healthy young subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042077,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 06 10,"The effects of e-cigarette (e-cig) aerosol inhalation by nonsmokers have not been examined to date. The present study was designed to evaluate the acute response to aerosol inhalation of non nicotinized e-cigarettes in terms of oxidative stress and indices of endothelial activation in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC). Ten smoking-naÃ¯ve healthy subjects (mean age Â± SD = 28.7Â± 5.5 years) were subjected to an e-cig challenge following which their serum was monitored for markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)] and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx). The oxidative stress and inflammation burden of the circulating serum on the vascular network was also assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induction of ICAM-1 expression on HPMVEC. Our results show that serum indices of oxidative stress and inflammation increased significantly (p<0.05 as compared to baseline), reaching a peak at approximately 1-2 h post e-cig aerosol inhalation, and returning to baseline levels at 6 h. The circulatory burden of the serum (ICAM-1 and ROS) increased significantly at 2 h and returned to baseline values 6 h post e-cig challenge. ROS production by HPMVEC was found to occur via activation of the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) pathways. These findings suggest that in the absence of nicotine, acute e-cig aerosol inhalation leads to a transient increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. This can adversely affect the vascular endothelial network by promoting oxidative stress and immune cell adhesion. E-cig inhalation can potentially drive the onset of vascular pathologies.",Extrinsic acidosis suppresses glycolysis and migration while increasing network formation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042076,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 08,"Acidosis is common among critically ill patients, but current approaches to correct pH do not improve disease outcomes. During systemic acidosis, cells are either passively exposed to extracellular acidosis that other cells have generated (extrinsic acidosis) or they are exposed to acid which they generate and export into the extracellular space (intrinsic acidosis). Although endothelial repair following intrinsic acidosis has been studied, the impact of extrinsic acidosis on migration and angiogenesis is unclear. We hypothesized that extrinsic acidosis inhibits metabolism and migration but promotes capillary-like network formation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Extrinsic acidosis was modeled by titrating media pH. Two types of intrinsic acidosis were compared; including increasing cellular metabolism by chemically inhibiting carbonic anhydrases (CAs) IX and XII (SLC-0111) and with hypoxia. PMVECs maintained baseline intracellular pH for 24 hours with both extrinsic and intrinsic acidosis. Whole cell CA IX protein expression was decreased by extrinsic acidosis, but not affected by hypoxia. When extracellular pH was equally acidic, extrinsic acidosis suppressed glycolysis, whereas intrinsic acidosis did not. Extrinsic acidosis suppressed migration, but increased Matrigel network master junction and total segment length. CRISPR-Cas9 CA IX knockout PMVECs revealed an independent role of CA IX in promoting glycolysis, as loss of CA IX alone was accompanied by decreased hexokinase I and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1Î± expression and decreasing migration. 2-deoxy-D-glucose had no effect on migration, but profoundly inhibited network formation and increased N-cadherin expression. Thus, we report that while extrinsic acidosis suppresses endothelial glycolysis and migration, it promotes network formation.",Mesenchymal stem cells alleviate hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and enhance the pro-survival pathways in porcine islets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042075,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2019 06 11,"The utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising approach to serve as adjuvant therapy for islet transplantation. But the inability to translate promising preclinical results into sound therapeutic effects in human subjects indicates a lack of key knowledge of MSC-islet interactions that warrant further research. Hypoxia and oxidative stress are critical factors which lead to a tremendous loss of islet grafts. However, previous studies mainly focused on other aspects of MSC protection such as inducing revascularization, enhancing insulin secretion, and reducing islet apoptosis. In this study, we aim to investigate whether MSC can protect islet cells from hypoxic damage by inhibiting ROS production and the potential underlying pathways involved. We also explore the effects of MSC-derived exosomes and IL-6 on hypoxia-injured islets. Our data provide new molecular targets for developing MSC applications, and this may ultimately promote the efficiency of clinical islet transplantation.",Hydrogen-rich saline ameliorated LPS-induced acute lung injury via autophagy inhibition through the ROS/AMPK/mTOR pathway in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042074,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2019 06 11,"Acute lung injury (ALI), a common complication of many serious health issues, such as serious infection, burns, and shock, is one of the most common critical illnesses in clinical practice with a high mortality rate of 30-40%. There are still short of effective prevention and treatment measures. Evidence is growing that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) may be an effective drug for the prevention and treatment of ALI. However, the mechanisms involved in have not been clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the underling mechanisms by focusing on autophagy regulation. The results showed that HRS ameliorated lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI in mice by inhibiting autophagy over-activation through ROS/AMPK/mTOR pathway. HRS may be a new therapeutic strategy for ALI prevention and treatment in the future.","Physiological comparison of hemorrhagic shock and

Renal physiology,2019 05 01,"T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 promotes microvessel contraction ex vivo. It was hypothesized that in vivo, functional deletion of Cav3.1 but not Cav3.2 protects mice against angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate were measured continuously with chronically indwelling catheters during infusion of angiotensin II (30 ng/kg/min, 7 days) in wildtype, Cav3.1-/- and Cav3.2-/- mice. Plasma aldosterone and renin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays. In separate series, wildtype mice were infused with angiotensin II (100 ng/kg/min) with and without mineralocorticoid receptor blocker canrenoate. Cav3.1-/- and Cav3.2-/- mice exhibited no baseline difference in MAP compared with wildtype but day-night variation was blunted in both Cav3.1 and Cav3.2-/- mice. Angiotensin II increased significantly MAP in Wt, Cav3.1-/- and Cav3.2-/- mice with no differences between genotypes. Heart rate was significantly lower in Cav3.1-/- and Cav3.2-/- mice compared to control. After angiotensin II infusion, plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly lower in Cav3.1-/- compared to Cav3.2-/- mice. In response to angiotensin II, fibrosis was observed in heart sections from both Wt and Cav3.1-/- mice and whereas cardiac ANP mRNA was similar, BNP mRNA increase was mitigated in Cav3.1-/-. Angiotensin II at 100 ng/kg yielded elevated pressure and increased heart/body ratio in wildtype mice. The cardiac hypertrophy but not the hypertension was prevented by MR-blocker canrenoate. In conclusion, T-type channels Cav3.1and Cav3.2do not contribute to baseline blood pressure level and angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Cav3.1, not Cav3.2, contributes to aldosterone secretion.

Renal physiology,2019 06 12,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with nutrient surplus and kidney hyperfiltration, accelerating chronic renal failure. The potential involvement of podocyte damage in early MetS remains unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important determinant of renal damage, but whether it contributes to MetS-related podocyte injury remains unknown. Domestic pigs were studied after 16 wk of diet-induced MetS, MetS treated with the mitochondria-targeted peptide elamipretide (ELAM; 0.1 mgÂ·kg-1Â·day-1 sc) for the last month of diet, and lean controls (n = 6 pigs/group). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured using multidetector computed tomography, and podocyte and mitochondrial injury were measured by light and electron microscopy. Urinary levels of podocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (pEVs; nephrin positive/podocalyxin positive) were characterized by flow cytometry. Body weight, blood pressure, RBF, and GFR were elevated in MetS. Glomerular size and glomerular injury score were also elevated in MetS and decreased after ELAM treatment. Evidence of podocyte injury, impaired podocyte mitochondria, and foot process width were all increased in MetS but restored with ELAM. The urinary concentration of pEVs was elevated in MetS pigs and directly correlated with renal dysfunction, glomerular injury, and fibrosis and inversely correlated with glomerular nephrin expression. Additionally, pEV numbers were elevated in the urine of obese compared with lean human patients. Early MetS induces podocyte injury and mitochondrial damage, which can be blunted by mitoprotection. Urinary pEVs reflecting podocyte injury might represent early markers of MetS-related kidney disease and a novel therapeutic target.",A study of sirolimus and an mTOR kinase inhibitor (TORKi) in a hypomorphic Pkd1 mouse model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042058,American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2019 05 01,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by cyst formation and growth, which is partially driven by abnormal proliferation of tubular cells. There is activation of the pro-proliferative mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and 2) in PKD mouse kidneys. Sirolimus indirectly inhibits mTORC1. The novel mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi) directly inhibit mTOR kinase resulting in inhibition of both mTORC1 and 2. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of sirolimus versus the TORKi, torin2, on cyst growth and kidney function in the Pkd1 p.R3277C (Pkd1RC/RC) mouse model, a hypomorphic Pkd1 model orthologous to the human condition and to determine the effects of sirolimus versus torin2 on mTORC1 and 2 signaling in PKD1-/- cells and in the kidneys of Pkd1RC/RC mice. In vitro, both inhibitors reduced mTORC1 and mTORC2 phosphorylated substrates, and negatively impacted cellular metabolic activity as measured by the MTT assay. Pkd1RC/RC mice were treated with sirolimus or torin2 from 50 to 120 days of age. Torin2 was as effective as sirolimus in decreasing cyst growth and improving loss of kidney function. Both sirolimus and torin2 decreased pS6, p4E-BP1, pAkt and proliferation in Pkd1RC/RC kidneys. In conclusion, both torin2 and sirolimus were equally effective in decreasing cyst burden, improving kidney function, and mediated comparable effects on mTORC1 and 2 signaling and proliferation in the Pkd1RC/RC kidney.","Institutional, Subcultural, and Individual Determinants of Same-Sex Sexual Contact Among College Women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042057,Journal of sex research,2019 05 01,"While the collegiate hookup literature identifies the prevalence and conditions under which women engage in same-sex sexual behaviors, less is understood about the macro- and mesolevel features of universities predictive of women's engagement in these behaviors. How do predictors of same-sex contact differ for women who report engagement in nongenital versus genital sexual acts? Using the Online College Social Life Survey (OCSLS), this study examined 5,069 women from 21Â U.S. colleges and universities who reported at least one same-sex encounter in their lifetime to empirically evaluate how same-sex sexual histories are predicted by university structure and membership in student subcultures. Results find subcultural participation to have a regulative effect on what types of sexual behaviors women engaged in with other women. While Greek-affiliated women were significantly more likely to have engaged in solely nongenital sexual behavior, women in team-based athletics were more likely to report a genital sexual history with women. This study's focus on women's sexual behaviors as opposed to sexual identity affirms the influence of institutional contexts, subcultural dynamics, and their variability across U.S. campuses in producing the conditions and opportunities for varied forms of sexual interactions among college women.",Formulation and characterization of an optimized functional beverage from hibiscus ( Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) and green tea ( Camellia sinensis L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042056,Food science and technology international = Ciencia y tecnologia de los alimentos internacional,2019 05 01,"Hibiscus sabdariffa and Camellia sinensis are traditionally consumed as beverages and are good sources of health-promoting phenolic compounds. The objective of this work was to use response surface methodology to develop an optimized functional beverage with high total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and acceptable for potential consumers. Optimum infusion conditions were 4.9â€‰g of hibiscus calyces or C. sinensis leaves/100â€‰ml of water at 26â€‰â„ƒ for 291â€‰min. These conditions yielded a total phenolic content of 14.80â€‰Â±â€‰1.4 and 33.02â€‰Â±â€‰0.34â€‰mg gallic acid equivalents/100â€‰ml for hibiscus and green tea, respectively. The optimized beverages were combined in a 7:3 (hibiscus:green tea, v/v) ratio; a consumer preference test showed that this combination had an acceptable taste according to untrained panelists. A chromatographic analysis showed that this formulation contained flavonoids, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins as its main components. Our data suggested that hibiscus and green tea phenolic compounds were efficiently extracted using near-ambient temperature water for prolonged times, contrary to routine methods (high temperature, short time). Our method also preserved antioxidant capacity, possibly by avoiding chemical changes/degradation due to high temperatures. This process can be used to produce organoleptically acceptable functional beverages that deliver a varied phenolic compound profile to the consumer.",Longitudinal Assessment of the Association Between Pornography Use and Sexual Satisfaction in Adolescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042055,Journal of sex research,2019 05 01,"Pornography has been theorized to affect sexual satisfaction for decades, yet only two prospective studies, both conducted in the Netherlands, have explored this link among adolescents.

Using a panel sample of 775 female and 514 male Croatian high school students (Mage at baselineÂ =Â 15.9Â years, SDÂ =Â 0.52) and latent growth curve modeling with six observation points, we did not find a significant association between changes in the frequency of adolescents' pornography use over time and their sexual satisfaction at wave six.

Renal physiology,2019 05 01,"To garner insight into the renal regulation of calcium homeostasis, we performed an mRNA micro-array on kidneys from mice treated with the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist cinacalcet. This revealed decreased gene expression of the sodium/proton exchanger isoform 8 (NHE8) in response to CaSR activation. These results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, administration of vitamin D also decreased NHE8 mRNA expression. In contrast, renal NHE8 protein expression from the same samples was increased. To examine the role of NHE8 in transmembrane calcium fluxes, we employed the normal rat kidney (NRK) cell line. Cell surface biotinylation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated NHE8 apical expression. Functional studies found 5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) inhibitable NHE activity in NRK cells at concentrations minimally attenuating NHE1 activity in AP-1 cells. To determine how NHE8 might regulate calcium balance, we measured changes in intracellular calcium uptake by live-cell calcium imaging with the fluorophore FURA-2 AM. Inhibition of NHE8 with EIPA or by removing extracellular sodium enhanced calcium influx into NRK cells. Calcium influx was mediated by a voltage-dependent calcium channel rather than directly via NHE8. NRK cells express Cav1.3 and display verapamil sensitive calcium influx and NHE8 inhibition augmented calcium influx via a voltage-dependent calcium channel. Finally, proximal tubules perused ex vivo demonstrated increased calcium influx in the presence of luminal EIPA at a concentration that would inhibit NHE8. These studies are consistent with NHE8 regulating calcium uptake into the proximal tubule epithelium.",Vaccination with FAdV-8a induces protection against inclusion body hepatitis caused by homologous and heterologous strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042049,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2019 06 14,"Fowl aviadenoviruses (FAdV) are important avian pathogens, responsible for several poultry diseases prevalent worldwide, including inclusion body hepatitis (IBH). FAdV intraspecies cross-protection has been clearly demonstrated, but there is little evidence that any interspecies cross-protection exists. The present study aimed to assess the inter- and intraspecies protection between three FAdV field isolates (FAdV-8a, FAdV-8b, FAdV-11) identified in association with severe IBH outbreaks. Inocula prepared using inactivated plaque-purified virus with adjuvant Montanideâ„¢ ISA 71VG, were injected intramuscularly into 3-week-old SPF chickens. At 6-weeks of age, the birds were challenged with 106 TCID50 of homologous or heterologous virus intraperitoneally, and full post mortem examination performed at 4 days post-challenge. Various tissues were examined for gross and histological lesions and assessed for the presence of virus by PCR-HRM. All homologous-type vaccine/challenge groups exhibited protection against IBH lesions with no virus detected in the tissues. Unvaccinated groups challenged with virus showed evidence of FAdV-induced lesions; however, FAdV-8a demonstrated lower pathogenicity compared with FAdV-8b and FAdV-11. In the heterologous-type vaccine/challenge groups, FAdV-8a vaccine was shown to protect against challenge with both FAdV-8b and FAdV-11. FAdV-8a and 8b belong to species E and were therefore anticipated to cross-protect. However, FAdV-11 belongs to species D and therefore cross-protection by FAdV-8a was an uncharacteristic and unique finding of this study. Further research is required to disseminate the molecular basis for the interspecies cross-protection between FAdV-8a and FAdV-11. Nonetheless, the FAdV-8a isolate was shown to have substantial potential as a vaccine candidate in countries where FAdV-8a, 8b or 11 are prevalent."

This enzyme has a key role in epigenetic regulation, and its catalytic inactivation results in, e.g., mice embryo lethality. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism of the TDG-catalyzed N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis of the modified base 5-formylcytosine. Our results reveal a reaction pathway, which in its first step features a reorganization of the substrate that lowers the barrier height for the subsequent C1'-N1 bond dissociation. The suggested mechanism is consistent with the experimental data, as it is not acid-catalyzed and proceeds through an oxocarbenium-like transition state. It also provides insights into the catalytic roles of the Thr197 and Asn140 residues.",Ferroelectricity of the Orthorhombic and Tetragonal MAPbBr3 Single Crystal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042032,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 16,"Hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites (HOIPs) MAPbBr3 and their ramifications have emerged because of the photovoltaic, optical, and other fascinating performances of HOIPs in recent years. However, many intrinsic properties, such as crystal structure and ferroelectricity, are still controversial. In this work, the ferroelectricity of the orthorhombic and tetragonal MAPbBr3 single crystal was confirmed through the dielectric behavior versus bias electric field Îµ( E), the temperature-dependent pyroelectric current with positive/negative poling, and the positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements. The electric field dependence of dielectric constant curves shows a butterfly type shape in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase. The pyroelectric current shows two maxima at 155 and 245 K, corresponding to ferroelectric-ferroelectric and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions, respectively. In particular, the direction of the pyroelectric current can be reversed by a positive or negative poling electric field, which is the assertive evidence of ferroelectricity. The PUND measurements act as the most convincing proof of the ferroelectricity of the MAPbBr3 single crystal. This work reports new evidence of the ferroelectric properties of the MAPbBr3 single crystal, which provides the intrinsic property when considering their high power conversion efficiencies.",Inhibition of HIV Maturation via Selective Unfolding and Cross-Linking of Gag Polyprotein by a Mercaptobenzamide Acetylator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042030,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 08,"For HIV to become infectious, any new virion produced from an infected cell must undergo a maturation process that involves the assembly of viral polyproteins Gag and Gag-Pol at the membrane surface. The self-assembly of these viral proteins drives formation of a new viral particle as well as the activation of HIV protease, which is needed to cleave the polyproteins so that the final core structure of the virus will properly form. Molecules that interfere with HIV maturation will prevent any new virions from infecting additional cells. In this manuscript, we characterize the unique mechanism by which a mercaptobenzamide thioester small molecule (SAMT-247) interferes with HIV maturation via a series of selective acetylations at highly conserved cysteine and lysine residues in Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. The results provide the first insights into how acetylation can be utilized to perturb the process of HIV maturation and reveal a new strategy to limit the infectivity of HIV.",Mechanism of Catalytic O2 Reduction by Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042028,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 08,"The catalytic reduction of O2 to H2O is important for energy transduction in both synthetic and natural systems. Herein, we report a kinetic and thermochemical study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by iron tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe(TPP)) in N, N'-dimethylformamide using decamethylferrocene as a soluble reductant and para-toluenesulfonic acid ( pTsOH) as the proton source. This work identifies and characterizes catalytic intermediates and their thermochemistry, providing a detailed mechanistic understanding of the system. Specifically, reduction of the ferric porphyrin, [FeIII(TPP)]+, forms the ferrous porphyrin, FeII(TPP), which binds O2 reversibly to form the ferric-superoxide porphyrin complex, FeIII(TPP)(O2â€¢-). The temperature dependence of both the electron transfer and O2 binding equilibrium constants has been determined. Kinetic studies over a range of concentrations and temperatures show that the catalyst resting state changes during the course of each catalytic run, necessitating the use of global kinetic modeling to extract rate constants and kinetic barriers. The rate-determining step in oxygen reduction is the protonation of FeIII(TPP)(O2â€¢-) by pTsOH, which proceeds with a substantial kinetic barrier. Computational studies indicate that this barrier for proton transfer arises from an unfavorable preassociation of the proton donor with the superoxide adduct and a transition state that requires significant desolvation of the proton donor. Together, these results are the first example of oxygen reduction by iron tetraphenylporphyrin where the pre-equilibria among ferric, ferrous, and ferric-superoxide intermediates have been quantified under catalytic conditions.

Its release from aquatic sediments to the water column and potentially to the atmosphere, is a subject of great concern. A coupled macroscopic single-bubble mechanical/reaction-transport numerical model was used to explore the ascent of a mature CH4 bubble toward the seafloor in muddy aquatic sediment. Two bubble ascent scenarios were demonstrated: stable and dynamic. For small effective overburden loads (â‰¤11 kPa), stable ascent is followed by dynamic ascent (which has not been previously demonstrated to the best of the our knowledge). This ultimately leads to the bubble being released to the water column. Higher effective overburden loads induce only stable bubble ascent, which stops at the gas horizon frequently observed below the seafloor. The depth of the gas horizon increases, while bubble rise velocity decreases with an increase in the overburden load. It is shown that the bubble migration scenario is managed predominantly by inner bubble pressure, which defines a bubble solute exchange with ambient porewaters. Predicting a bubble ascent scenario in muddy sediment will further allow estimation of CH4 emission to the atmosphere and evaluation of changes in the effective mechanical properties of aquatic sediment due to the ascending bubbles.",Photo-Cross-Linked Poly(ethylene glycol) Diacrylate Hydrogels: Spherical Microparticles to Bow Tie-Shaped Microfibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042026,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"Bow tie-shaped fibers and spherical microparticles with controlled dimensions and shapes were fabricated with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogel utilizing hydrodynamic shear principles and a photopolymerization strategyÂ under a microfluidic regime. Decreasing the flow rate ratio between the core and sheath fluids from 25 (50:2) to 1.25 (100:80) resulted in increasing the particles size and reducing the production rate by 357 and 86%, respectively. The width of the fibers increased by a factor of 1.4 when the flow rate ratio was reduced from 2.5 to 1 due to the decrease of the shear force at the fluid/fluid interface. The stress at break and Young's modulus of the fibers were enhanced by 32 and 63%, respectively, when the sheath-to-core flow rate ratio decreased from 100:40 to 100:80. The fiber fabrication was simulated using the finite element method, and the numerical and experimental results were in agreement. Adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells and bone-marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells were seeded onto the fibrous scaffolds in vitro, and cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation were investigated.

M., and Shokat, K. M. (2016) Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery 15, 771-785]. The high prevalence of KRAS mutations and its essential role in many cancers make it a potentially attractive drug target; however, it has been difficult to create small molecule inhibitors of mutant K-Ras proteins. Here, we identified a putative small molecule binding site on K-RasG12D using computational analyses of the protein structure and then used a combination of computational and biochemical approaches to discover small molecules that may bind to this pocket, which we have termed the P110 site, due to its adjacency to proline 110. We confirmed that one compound, named K-Ras allosteric ligand KAL-21404358, bound to K-RasG12D, as measured by microscale thermophoresis, a thermal shift assay, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. KAL-21404358 did not bind to four mutants in the P110 site, supporting our hypothesis that KAL-21404358 binds to the P110 site of K-RasG12D. This compound impaired the interaction of K-RasG12D with B-Raf and disrupted the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. We synthesized additional compounds, based on the KAL-21404358 scaffold with more potent binding and greater aqueous solubility. In summary, these findings suggest that the P110 site is a potential site for binding of small molecule allosteric inhibitors of K-RasG12D.",Brillouin Light Scattering: Applications in Biomedical Sciences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042024,Chemical reviews,2019 06 11,"Brillouin spectroscopy and imaging are emerging techniques in analytical science, biophotonics, and biomedicine.

The influence of the different processing parameters, such as applied pressure and sintering atmosphere, on phase purity and microstructure of the produced ceramics was investigated. The addition of Sn to the (Zr,Ti)2AlC system was the key to achieve phase purity. Its effect on the crystal structure of a 211-type MAX phase was assessed by calculating the distortions of the octahedral M6C and trigonal M6A prisms due to steric effects. The M6A prismatic distortion values were found to be smaller in Sn-containing double solid solutions than in the (Zr,Ti)2AlC MAX phases.

Recent reports suggest that this subfamily has a novel function equal to the Hippo/MST subfamily as upstream kinases for Warts/Large tumor suppressor kinaseÂ (LATS) to suppress tissue growth. To study the in vivo functions of Mink1, Map4k4, and Tnik, we generated a compound knockout of these three genes in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The intestinal epithelia of the mutant animals were phenotypically normal up to approximately 12 months. The older animals then exhibited mildly increased proliferation throughout the lower GI tract. We also observed that the normally spatially organized Paneth cells in the crypt base became dispersed. The expression of one of the YAP pathway target genes Sox9 was increased while other target genes including CTGF did not show a significant change. Therefore, the Misshapen and Hippo subfamilies may have highly redundant functions to regulate growth in the intestinal epithelium, as illustrated in recent tissue culture models.",Long-term results of the Global Modular Replacement System tumor prosthesis for reconstruction after limb-sparing bone resections in orthopedic oncologic conditions: Results from a national cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042011,Journal of surgical oncology,2019 05 01,"We investigated implant revision, implant failure, and amputation risk after limb-sparing bone tumor surgery using the Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS) tumor prosthesis in patients suffering from bone sarcomas (BS), giant cell tumors (GCT), or metastatic bone disease (MBD).",Prostacyclin for pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042010,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 06 04,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterised by pulmonary vascular changes, leads to elevated pulmonary artery pressures, dyspnoea, a reduction in exercise tolerance, right heart failure, and ultimately death.Prostacyclin analogue drugs mimic endogenous prostacyclin which leads to vasodilation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and reversal of vascular remodelling.

In particular, microRNA 21 (miR-21) is upregulated in inflammatory environment and reported to induce anti-inflammatory responses. However, the involvement of miR-21 in pulpal inflammation and the precise mechanisms of anti-inflammatory reactions induced by miR-21 remain unclear. We hypothesized that miR-21-5p expression is induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) and that miR-21-5p downregulates the proinflammatory cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated hDPCs. We found that miR-21-5p was upregulated in LPS-stimulated hDPCs concomitant with elevated proinflammatory cytokine expression and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) phosphorylation. miR-21-5p and cytokine expression were downregulated by BAY11-7085 and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), specific and potent NF-ÎºB inhibitors. Enforced expression of miR-21-5p downregulated the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/NF-ÎºB signaling via reducing the expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), which further induced the decrease of proinflammatory cytokine expression. hDPCs forcibly overexpressing miR-21-5p downregulated the LPS-induced expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6; a component of the Toll-like receptor [TLR]/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4, a positive regulator of the TLR/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway), and proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, miR-21-5p inhibitor-transfected hDPCs upregulated the expression of TRAF6, PDCD4, and inflammatory cytokines following LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that miR-21-5p expression was induced by the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, which was in turn negatively regulated by miR-21-5p via downregulation of TRAF6 and PDCD4 expression in LPS-stimulated hDPCs.",Enteromius pinnimaculatus sp. nov.

This new species is distinguished from all other Gabonese Enteromius by the presence of several distinct spots on the dorsal fin in combination with three or four round spots on the flanks. In Africa, it is superficially similar to Enteromius walkeri and with which it shares an unusual allometry in that the proportional length of the barbels decreases as the fish grows. Nevertheless, one can distinguish these species by vertebral number, maximum standard length, the length of the anterior barbels, the length of the caudal peduncle and in most specimens, the number of lateral-line and circumpeduncular scales. These two species also inhabit widely separated drainages, with E. walkeri occurring in coastal drainages of Ghana including the Pra and Ankobra Rivers and the new species occurring in tributaries of the Louetsi and Bibaka Rivers of Gabon, which are part of the Ogowe and Nyanga drainages, respectively.

While MTs appear to be highly ordered structures, recent data suggest some randomness in their structure and dynamics. Part of this inherent randomness is attributed to errors and correction mechanisms are being investigated to overcome these 'mistakes.' However, this randomness may also be part of the normal intracellular function of MTs. It is possible that random events in MT structure and dynamics may contribute to their normal function and may even be part of an improved efficacy mechanism. An alternative view, wherein MT and kinetochore errors are part of required cell plasticity, is also discussed. These data may further support the concept of randomness in biological pathways as part of self-organization or accurate and enhanced function.",Proteasome 19S RP and translation preinitiation complexes are secreted within exosomes upon serum starvation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042005,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",2019 05 31,"The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of macroautophagy on exosome secretion. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released in the extracellular space upon fusion of multivesicular endosomes with the plasma membrane. They were initially discovered as a way to remodel the reticulocyte plasma membrane before entering the blood circulation (Current Opinion in Hematology 2010, 17:177-183) and are now essentially studied as mediators of intercellular communication. Using iTRAQ proteomics, we compared the protein composition of purified exosomes secreted by cells impaired or not for macroautophagy by Atg5 depletion, during serum starvation conditions or complete medium culture. We show that the absence of serum modifies exosomal content, especially inducing secretion of two cytoplasmic protein complexes, namely proteasomal 19S regulatory particle (RP) and components of noncanonical translation preinitiation complex (PIC). This process is enhanced when autophagy is impaired by Atg5 depletion. Moreover, we show that the proteasome 20S core particle (CP) is released in the extracellular space. However, in striking contrast to what seen for its 19S RP regulator, release is independent of the exosomal vesicles, Atg5 expression and cell culture conditions. Exosome secretion can thus be considered as a cell process that participates in and reflects cell homeostasis, and care must be taken when studying potential extracellular function of exosomes due to the possible copurification of proteasome 20S CP.",Pex20p functions as the receptor for non-PTS1/non-PTS2 acyl-CoA oxidase import into peroxisomes of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042004,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",2019 05 27,"Most soluble proteins targeted to the peroxisomal matrix contain a C-terminal peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) or an N-terminal PTS2 that is recognized by the receptors Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively. These receptors cycle between the cytosol and peroxisome and back again for multiple rounds of cargo delivery to the peroxisome. A small number of peroxisomal matrix proteins, including all six isozymes of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (Aox) of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, contain neither a PTS1 nor a PTS2. Pex20p has been shown to function as a co-receptor for Pex7p in the import of PTS2 cargo into peroxisomes. Here we show that cells of Y. lipolytica deleted for the PEX20 gene fail to import not only the PTS2-containing protein 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (Pot1p) but also the non-PTS1/non-PTS2 Aox isozymes. Pex20p binds directly to Aox isozymes Aox3p and Aox5p, which requires the C-terminal Wxxx(F/Y) motif of Pex20p. A W411G mutation in the C-terminal Wxxx(F/Y) motif causes Aox isozymes to be mislocalized to the cytosol. Pex20p interacts physically with members of the peroxisomal import docking complex, Pex13p and Pex14p. Our results are consistent with a role for Pex20p as the receptor for import of the non-PTS1/non-PTS2 Aox isozymes into peroxisomes.",Carboxylate-Assisted Oxidative Addition to Aminoalkyl PdII Complexes: C(sp3 )-H Arylation of Alkylamines by Distinct PdII /PdIV Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042003,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 24,"Reported is the discovery of an approach to functionalize secondary alkylamines using 2-halobenzoic acids as aryl-transfer reagents.

Several important aspects of the catalytic system were addressed, including the generation of oxygen vacancies (Ov), formation of N2O2 intermediates, scission of the N-O bond of N2O2 intermediates to form N2O or N2, and decomposition of N2O to form N2. Unlike most previous theoretical studies, which tend to explore the reaction mechanism of polyoxometalate (POM) systems based on the isolated anionic unit, here, we build a model of the catalytic system with neutral species by introduction of counter cations to model the solid structure of the Cu1/PMA SAC. The major findings of our present study are: (1) CO adsorption on Cu sites leads to the formation of cationic Cu carbonyl species; (2) the Oc atom at the surface of the PMA support can easily react with the adsorbed CO to generate a Cu-Ov pair; (3) the Cu-Ov pair embedded on PMA is found to be the active site, not only for the formation of N2O2* by the reaction of two NO molecules via an Eley-Rideal pathway but also for the decomposition of N2O to form N2; (4) the adsorption of a NO molecule on the Cu-Ov pair with a bridging model results in charge transfer from the Cu atom to the Ï€* antibonding orbital of the NO molecule; (5) IR spectroscopy of the key intermediates has been identified based on our DFT calculations; and (6) the Cu atom serves as an electron acceptor in Ov formation steps and an electron donor in N2O2 decomposition steps, and thus represents an electron reservoir. These results suggest that the POM-supported SAC with the cheaper Cu element is an efficient catalyst for the reaction between CO and NO.",Flow of condensed particles around a packing front visualized by drying colloidal suspensions on a tilted substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041983,Soft matter,2019 05 17,"A gravity effect was demonstrated for 10 nm particles drying in colloidal suspensions. The particles were well-dispersed and did not sediment. However, when a suspension was dried on a tilted directional cell, a clear downward flow of particles was observed around the packing front, which was the boundary between the packed particles layer and the suspension. Three particle sizes (10-110 nm) were examined, with the most pronounced effect being on the 10 nm particles. The primary origin of the downflow was attributed to condensation of particles near the packing front and the subsequent increase in the overall density of the condensed layer. Because of the flow, the packing front was not parallel to the drying interface and tilted cracks formed in the packed layer. A mathematical model was proposed that considered conservation of the suspended particles in the condensed layer. Three competing factors of particle transport (advection, particle consumption by packing, and particle transport by the downward flow) were used to explain the experimental results. Overall, the results suggested that simple substrate tilting would be useful to evaluate whether suspended particles are easily packed or not during drying.","1,2,4-Oxadiazole-5-ones as analogues of tamoxifen: synthesis and biological evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041982,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 05 16,"A series of 2,3,4-triaryl-substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-ones have been prepared as fixed-ring analogues of tamoxifen (TAM), a drug inhibitor of Estradiol Receptor (ER) used in breast cancer therapy, by an efficient synthetic protocol based on a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones to isocyanates.

We present a detailed analysis of positional and angular probability distributions of filaments with varying propulsive force and shear-flow. The distribution of the centre-of-mass of the filament shows adsorption near the surfaces, which diminishes with the flow. The excess density of filaments decreases with Weissenberg number as Wi-Î² with an exponent Î² â‰ˆ 0.8, in the intermediate shear range (1 < Wi < 30). The angular orientational moment also decreases near the wall as Wi-Î´ with Î´ â‰ˆ 1/5; the variation in orientational moment near the wall is relatively slower than the bulk. It shows a strong dependence on the propulsive force near the wall, with variation on force as Pe-1/3 for large Pe â‰¥ 1. The active filament shows orientational preference with flow near the surfaces, which splits into upstream and downstream swimming. The population splitting from a unimodal (propulsive force dominated regime) to bimodal phase (shear dominated regime) is identified in the parameter space of propulsive force and shear flow.",Voltammetric demonstration of thermally induced natural convection in aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041979,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"In electrochemical systems imperfect thermostating inevitably leads to the presence of bulk convective flows. As recognised by Nernst [Z. Phys. Chem., 1904, 52] damping of these bulk convective flows next to a solid surface, or at the electrode, leads to diffusional mass transport predominating locally. This work questions the exclusivity of diffusional transport and provides hitherto unexplored physical insights into how thermally induced flows in bulk solution can, on both macro- and microelectrodes, influence a voltammetric measurement. Imperfect thermostating results in flows in the bulk solution which are predicted and here expeimentally shown to be of the order of 100 Î¼m s-1. Here we show that even in the absence of natural convective flows induced by the electrochemical reaction itself, this thermally induced bulk convection can significantly affect the voltammetric response. First, evaporative losses from an open electrochemical cell can be sufficient to produce convective flows that can alter the electrochemical response. Second, electrodes with various sizes and geometries have been investigated and experimental results evidence that the sensitivity of an electrode to these flows in bulk solution is to a large extent controlled by the size of the surrounding non-conductive supporting substrate used to insulate parts of the electrode.","Fusaresters A-E, new Î³-pyrone-containing polyketides from fungus Fusarium sp.

We show that molecular modeling of GTP hydrolysis in the Ras-GAP active site reveals a diversity of mechanisms of the intrinsic chemical reaction depending on molecular groups at position 61 in Ras occupied by glutamine in the wild-type enzyme. First, a comparison of reaction energy profiles computed at the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) level shows that an assignment of the Gln61 side chain in the wild-type Ras either to QM or to MM parts leads to different scenarios corresponding to the glutamine-assisted or the substrate-assisted mechanisms. Second, replacement of Gln61 by the nitro-analog of glutamine (NGln) or by Glu, applied in experimental studies, results in two more scenarios featuring the so-called two-water and the concerted-type mechanisms. The glutamine-assisted mechanism in the wild-type Ras-GAP, in which the conserved Gln61 plays a decisive role, switching between the amide and imide tautomer forms, is consistent with the known experimental results of structural, kinetic and spectroscopy studies.

Molecular mechanics calculations in a semi-empirical framework and STM calculated images reveal that these states on the substrate originate from the enantiomer of the Ru(dbm)3 molecule in the case of three-lobed structure and from the rotation of the two phenyls in the top dbm moities for the bi-lobed form.",Tumor antigen-independent and cell size variation-inclusive enrichment of viable circulating tumor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041975,Lab on a chip,2019 06 10,"Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood provides a minimally-invasive alternative for basic understanding, diagnosis, and prognosis of metastatic cancer. The roles and clinical values of CTCs are under intensive investigation, yet most studies are limited by technical challenges in the comprehensive enrichment of intact and viable CTCs with minimal white blood cell (WBC) contamination. Here, we report a novel method based on contrast of cell magnetization in biocompatible ferrofluids (a colloidal magnetic nanoparticle suspension), termed as integrated ferrohydrodynamic cell separation (iFCS), that enriches CTCs in a tumor antigen-independent and cell size variation-inclusive manner, achieves a high throughput (12 mL h-1), high recovery rate (99.08% at down to âˆ¼10 cells per mL spike ratio), and low WBC contamination (533 cells for every one milliliter blood processed) and is biocompatible. This method will enable large cohort research to define the clinical and diagnostic value of CTC subtypes."

It converts 2OG into ethylene plus three CO2 molecules (ethylene-forming reaction) and also catalyzes the C5 hydroxylation of l-arginine coupled to the oxidative decarboxylation of 2OG (l-Arg hydroxylation reaction). To uncover the mechanisms of the dual transformations by EFE, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations were carried out. Based on the results, a branched mechanism was proposed. An FeII-peroxysuccinate complex with a dissociated CO2 generated through the nucleophilic attack of the superoxo moiety of the Fe-O2 species on the keto carbon of 2OG is the key common intermediate in both reactions. A competition between the subsequent CO2 insertion (a key step in the ethylene-forming pathway) and the O-O bond cleavage (leading to the formation of succinate) governs the product selectivity. The calculated reaction barriers suggested that the CO2 insertion is favored over the O-O bond cleavage. This is consistent with the product preference observed in experiments. By comparison with the results of AsqJ (an Fe/2OG oxygenase that leads to substrate oxidation exclusively), the protein environment was found to be crucial for the selectivity. Further calculations demonstrated that the local electric field of the protein environment in EFE promotes ethylene formation by acting as a charge template, exemplifying the importance of the electrostatic interaction in enzyme catalysis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the EFE catalysis and provide important clues for better understanding the unique ethylene-forming capability of EFE compared with other Fe/2OG oxygenases.",Enhancing the utility of 1JCH coupling constants in structural studies through optimized DFT analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041954,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 17,"Commonly used DFT methods for the calculation of 1JCH coupling constants have typically required the application of ad hoc correction factors, modification of functionals, or empirical scaling to improve the fit between predicted and experimental values.

Thus, the development of novel cationic lipids with a suitable positive charge is desirable for safe and efficient siRNA delivery. Herein, we fabricated a library of 21 tertiary amine-derived cationic lipids (TA) to achieve a balance between effectiveness and safe siRNA delivery. The screened TA13 liposomes, which consisted of TA13 and helper lipid DOPE at a mole ratio of 1â€‰:â€‰1, readily condensed siRNA to form lipoplexes (TA13 LPs), achieving stronger gene silencing in diverse cells than the commercially available vector Lipo2000. Moreover, the TA13 LPs demonstrated effective in vivo gene silencing and good safety in normal mice. The improved gene silencing efficiency of the TA13 LPs is ascribed to their capability of sequentially conquering the barriers met by in vivo siRNA delivery.

In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, a thermoresponsive cell culture platform composed only of a 'bulk' form of a PNIPAAm hydrogel with the Young's modulus being increased up to the MPa scale. The surface roughness of the bulk PNIPAAm hydrogel initially modulated by the cross-linker concentration was altered from the nm- to Î¼m-scale in response to a change in temperature above/below the low critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 Â°C. The appropriate control of the surface roughness allowed the stable attachment (above the LCST) and easy detachment (below the LCST) of diverse cells and enabled the harvest of cell sheets composed of cell lines (C2C12 and NIH3T3) or even primary cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells and keratinocytes). During their incubation at 37 Â°C, the cell lines were able to be attached on every surface of the prepared PNIPAAm cell culture platforms, whereas the primary cells were found to be only attached on a surface having a roughness below âˆ¼30 nm. Furthermore, in the aspect of cell sheet detachment at the incubation temperature of 20 Â°C, the cell sheets composed of cell lines were fully detached from the surface of the platform having a roughness of âˆ¼10 Î¼m or higher, while the cell sheets composed of primary cells were entirely detached from the surface with a roughness of âˆ¼19 Î¼m or higher. Based on such behaviors of the diverse cells at a given surface roughness, this study further suggests a universal thermoresponsive cell culture platform which allows the harvest of all types of cells from cell lines to primary cells in a desired shape.

The copy number of KIT was reduced by about 13%, suggesting the possibility of obtaining cells with corrected structural mutations of the KIT locus. Using single cell cloning, from 24 successfully expanded single cell clones derived from cells transfected with sgRNA targeting at intron 17, we obtained 3 clones with a single copy of KIT without the splice mutation. Taken together, the 12.5% (3/24) efficiency of correction of structural mutations of 450â€‰kb fragments is highly efficient, providing a solid basis for the generation of genome edited Yorkshire pigs with a normal KIT locus.

In OTM, a force is exerted on the tooth, creating compression of the periodontal ligament (PDL) on one side of the tooth, and tension on the other side. In response to these mechanical stresses, the balance of receptor activator of nuclear-factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) shifts to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. However, the mechanism of OPG expression in PDL cells under different mechanical stresses remains unclear. We hypothesized that compression and tension induce different microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, which account for the difference in OPG expression in PDL cells. To study miRNA expression profiles resulting from OTM, compression force (2â€‰g/cm2) or tension force (15% elongation) was applied to immortalized human PDL (HPL) cells for 24â€‰h, and miRNA extracted. The miRNA expression in each sample was analyzed using a human miRNA microarray, and the changes of miRNA expression were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.

Such grouping also occurs in individually randomized trials where treatment is administered in groups. Outcomes may be measured at the level of the subject, but also at the level of the group. The optimal design determines the number of groups and the number of subjects per group in the intervention and control conditions. It is found by taking a budgetary constraint into account, where costs are associated with implementing the intervention and control, and with taking measurements on subject and groups. The optimal design is found such that the effect of treatment is estimated with highest efficiency, and the total costs do not exceed the budget that is available. The design that is optimal for the outcome at the subject level is not necessarily optimal for the outcome at the group level. Multiple-objective optimal designs consider both outcomes simultaneously. Their aim is to find a design that has high efficiencies for both outcome measures.

Several bacterial antagonists have shown anti-Phytophthora effects in in vitro and greenhouse experiments. In this study, we report the effects of three Pseudomonas strains recovered from field grown potatoes against a collection of P. infestans isolates assembled for this study. The collection comprised 19 P. infestans isolates of both mating types A1 and A2, greatly varying in fungicide resistance and virulence profiles as deducted from leaf discs experiments on Black's differential set. The mycelial growth of all P. infestans isolates were fully inhibited when co-cultivated with the most active Pseudomonas strain (R47). Moreover, the isolates reacted differently to exposure to the less active Pseudomonas strains (S19 and R76). Leaf disc infection experiments with six selected P. infestans isolates showed that four of them, including highly virulent and fungicide-resistant ones, could be efficiently controlled by different potato-associated Pseudomonas strains."

Both venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( VA - ECMO ) and a percutaneous ventricular assist device ( pVAD ) provide hemodynamic support for patients with CS, but little is known about the best device for this population. We sought to compare outcomes of AMI patients treated with these devices. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with CS following AMI from April 2015 to March 2017 were enrolled prospectively if they received either device for AMI -related CS . If patients received both devices, they were analyzed according to the first used. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. In total, 51 patients received VA - ECMO or pVAD following AMI ; 20 received VA - ECMO, and 31 received pVAD . The mean age was 62.1Â±10.1Â years, and 39 (76.5%) were men. Twenty-four (47.1%) patients were ultimately supported by both devices simultaneously (20 pVAD -first, 4 VA - ECMO -first). Patients treated with pVAD or VA - ECMO were similar in baseline characteristics at initial device insertion except that the latter were on more vasopressors and were more likely to have an intra-aortic balloon pump. Seventeen (33.3%) had recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mean lactate was 4.86Â±3.96Â mmol/L, and mean cardiac index was 1.70Â±0.42Â L/min per m2. Of the 28 (54.9%) patients surviving to discharge, 11 had received VA - ECMO first and 17 had pVAD first ( P=0.99). Survival at 1 and 2Â years did not differ significantly between device groups ( P=0.42). Conclusions Following AMI -related CS , pVAD - and VA - ECMO -treated patients had similar outcomes. The use of both devices simultaneously was common, with almost half of patients in persistent CS after first device deployment.",Prognostic Implications of Door-to-Balloon Time and Onset-to-Door Time on Mortality in Patients With ST -Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041869,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 05 21,"Background In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, timely reperfusion therapy with door-to-balloon (D2B) time <90Â minutes is recommended by the current guidelines. However, whether further shortening of symptom onset-to-door (O2D) time or D2B time would enhance survival of patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction remains unclear. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of O2D or D2B time in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods and Results We analyzed 5243 patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction were treated at 20 tertiary hospitals capable of primary percutaneous coronary intervention in Korea. The association between O2D or D2B time with all-cause mortality at 1 year was evaluated. The median O2D time was 2.0Â hours, and the median D2B time was 59Â minutes. A total of 92.2% of the total population showed D2B time â‰¤90Â minutes. In univariable analysis, 1-hour delay of D2B time was associated with a 55% increased 1-year mortality, whereas 1-hour delay of O2D time was associated with a 4% increased 1-year mortality. In multivariable analysis, D2B time showed an independent association with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI , 1.51-2.39; P<0.001). Reducing D2B time within 45Â minutes showed further decreased risk of mortality compared with D2B time >90Â minutes (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI , 0.19-0.42; P<0.001). Every reduction of D2B time by 30Â minutes showed continuous reduction of 1-year mortality (90 to 60Â minutes: absolute risk reduction, 2.4%; number needed to treat, 41.9; 60 to 30Â minutes: absolute risk reduction, 2.0%; number needed to treat, 49.2). Conclusions Shortening D2B time was significantly associated with survival benefit, and the survival benefit of shortening D2B time was consistently observed, even <60 to 90Â minutes.",Characteristics of Chronic Maxillary Sinusitis in Patients With a History of Long-term Bisphosphonate Use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041868,American journal of rhinology & allergy,2019 05 01,"Bisphosphonates are widely used as bone stabilizers, which can cause major side effects including bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) that occurs more frequently in the mandible.

Our objective was to identify, from a set of environmental exposures, which exposure is associated with leukocyte mtDNA content and telomere length in adults. This study includes 175 adults from 50 to 65 years old from the cross-sectional Flemish Environment and Health study, of whom leukocyte telomere length and mtDNA content were determined using qPCR. The levels of exposure of seven metals, 11 organohalogens, and four perfluorinated compounds (PFHxS, PFNA, PFOA, PFOS) were measured. We performed sparse partial least-squares regression analyses followed by ordinary least-squares regression to assess the multipollutant associations. While accounting for possible confounders andÂ coexposures, we identified that urinary cadmium (6.52%, 95% confidence interval, 1.06, 12.28), serum hexachlorobenzene (2.89%, 018, 5.68), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (11.38%, 5.97, 17.08) exposure were positively associated ( p < 0.05) with mtDNA content, while urinary copper (-9.88%, -14.82, -4.66) and serum perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (-4.75%, -8.79, -0.54) exposure were inversely associated with mtDNA content. Urinary antimony (2.69%, 0.45, 4.99) and mercury (1.91%, 0.42, 3.43) exposure were positively associated with leukocyte telomere length, while urinary copper (-3.52%, -6.60, -0.34) and serum perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (-3.64%, -6.60, -0.60) showed an inverse association.

We demonstrate, via the use of several complementary scanning probe techniques, that the direct control of the state and thickness of this intercalated water film controls the charge injection properties of Pt/WS2 nanocontacts. A switch from unipolar to ambipolar transport was achieved by environmentally controlling the thickness of the intercalated water. We show that the effect persists even for multilayer flakes and that it is completely reversible, opening a new route toward the realization of novel electronics with environmentally controllable functionalities.",Zr-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Peroxidase-Like Activity for Ultradeep Oxidative Desulfurization: Mechanism of H2O2 Decomposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041865,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 23,"The restriction of sulfur content in fuels has become increasingly stringent as a result of the growing environmental concerns. Although several MOF-derived materials like POM@MOF composites have shown the ability to catalyze oxidative desulfurization (ODS), their catalytic activities inevitably obstructed by the encapsulated catalytic sites like POM due to the blockage of cavities. Therefore, MOFs with intrinsic and accessible catalytic sites are highly desirable for their applications in ultradeep ODS. Herein, four representative Zr-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs), namely, UiO-66, UiO-67, NU-1000, and MOF-808, were assessed for catalytic ODS. These MOFs were confirmed that they have peroxidase-like activity and can catalyze ODS with H2O2 as oxidant. Among them, MOF-808 showed the highest catalytic activity and it can fully desulfurize dibenzothiophene (DBT) in a model gasoline with a S concentration of 1000 ppm under 40 Â°C within 5 min. An extremely low apparent Arrhenius activation energy (22.0 KJÂ·mol-1) and an extraordinarily high TOF value (42.7 h-1) were obtained, ranking MOF-808 among the best catalysts for the catalytic DBT oxidation. Further studies confirmed that the excellent catalytic activity is mainly responsible for the high concentration of the accessible Zr-OH(H2O) catalytic sites decorated in MOF-808. The superoxide radicals (â€¢O2-) and hydroxyl radicals (â€¢OH) were identified and were proved to involve in the DBT oxidation. Besides, the effects of BrÃ¶nsted and lewis acidity to the catalytic efficiency were also discussed. Based on the experimental results, a plausible mechanism concerning on Zr-OH(H2O) groups promoting the H2O2 decomposion in to both â€¢O2- and â€¢OH was first proposed. Moreover, MOF-808 can be facilely reused for at least eight runs without significant loss of its catalytic activity. By the integration of facile synthesis, high catalytic efficiency, and good stability, MOF-808 thus represents a new benchmark catalyst for catalytic oxidative desulfurization.","Stability of Cubic FAPbI3 from X-ray Diffraction, Anelastic, and Dielectric Measurements.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041864,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 16,"Among the hybrid metal-organic perovskites for photovoltaic applications, FAPbI3 (FAPI) has the best performance regarding efficiency and the worst regarding stability, even though the reports on its stability are highly contradictory. In particular, since at room temperature the cubic Î± phase, black and with high photovoltaic efficiency, is metastable against the yellow hexagonal Î´ phase, it is believed that Î±-FAPI spontaneously transforms into Î´-FAPI within a relatively short time. We performed X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric measurements on loose powder of FAPI, and present the first complete dielectric and anelastic spectra of compacted FAPI samples under various conditions. We found that Î±-FAPI is perfectly stable for at least 100 days, the duration of the experiments, unless extrinsic factors induce its degradation. In our tests, degradation was detected after exposure to humidity, strongly accelerated by grain boundaries and the presence of Î´ phase, but it was not noticeable on the loose powder kept in air under normal laboratory illumination. These findings have strong implications on the strategies for improving the stability of FAPI without diminishing its photovoltaic efficiency through modifications of its composition.","1,3-Dioxane-Linked Bacterial Topoisomerase Inhibitors with Enhanced Antibacterial Activity and Reduced hERG Inhibition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041863,ACS infectious diseases,2019 05 09,"The development of new therapies to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is needed to counteract the significant threat that MRSA presents to human health.

B,2019 06 10,"In this work, CO adsorption and oxidation processes were studied with cyclic voltammetry and anodic adsorptive stripping chronoamperometry in two structural different ionic liquids (ILs) (i.e., 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Bmpy][NTf2] and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Bmim][NTf2]). Multiple redox processes were observed in the ILs. During the anodic oxidation processes, the NTf2- anion is oxidized to form NTf2â€¢ radical and CO is oxidized to CO2 and produces a proton in these ILs when a trace amount of water is present. The products of oxidation processes (NTf2â€¢ radical and proton) can be reduced at cathodic processes. Results show that the cation in these ILs can facilitate the formation of an electrolyte-electrode interface structure that influences the amount of CO adsorbed as well as the subsequent CO oxidation current and charge. By selecting the anodic and cathodic potentials, we developed an innovative electroanalytical method for CO sensing based on a simple double-potential adsorptive stripping chronoamperometry. The method allows calibration of the concurrent NTf2- anion and CO redox processes as well as the double-layer charging and discharging processes in the IL with the presence of a trace amount of water providing quantitative analysis of CO concentration with high accuracy and sensitivity. The reported method is the first work to show that quantitative CO detection can be achieved in the presence of complex dynamic interfacial processes in the ILs. The trace water present in the ILs is beneficial for CO oxidation, but a large amount of water is detrimental for the CO oxidation in ambient condition."

Recently, we reported that cadherin-22 (CDH22), a member of cadherin family, regulates self-renewal of mouse FGSCs via interaction with JAK-STAT signal pathway and Î²-catenin. In this study, the expression profiles of FGSCs and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) were analyzed to further reveal their similarity and difference, and AKT3 was predicted as a pivotal molecule for FGSCs self-renewal. Then, we demonstrated that CDH22 interacted with PI3K to phosphorylate AKT3 and subsequently enhanced the expression levels of N-myc and cyclin family in FGSCs to promote self-renewal. Moreover, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was identified as an essential factor for FGSCs self-renewal with a more complicated mechanism: GDNF-GFRA1 activates AKT3 via PI3K or Src family kinase (SFK), and SFK upregulates its target genes, Bcl6b, Etv5, and Lhx1, to promote self-renewal of FGSCs. However, Src, the key intermediate factor for SSCs, was not the functional molecule of SFK family in the GDNF signal network of FGSCs. Based on the observations of bioinformatics analysis and molecular evidence, we demonstrate the underlying links of potential factors which are critical to the self-renewal in FGSC and imply the therapeutic potentials of FGSCs in cure of female infertility.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2, ER, PR, p53, integrin alpha v beta 6 (Î±vÎ²6) integrin, Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) and pSMAD2/3 was performed on tissue microarrays of invasive carcinoma. We confirmed a previously reported high prevalence of HER2-amplified, ductal no special type invasive breast carcinoma amongst known TP53 germline pathogenic variant carriers 20 of 36 (56%). Furthermore we observed a high frequency of densely sclerotic tumour stroma in cancers from TP53 carriers (29/36, 80.6%) when compared with non-carriers, 50.9% (28/55), 34.7% (50/144), 41.4% (65/157), 43.8% (95/217) in groups 2-5 respectively. The majority of germline TP53 gene carrier breast tumours had a high intensity of integrin Î±vÎ²6, Î±-SMA and pSMAD2/3 expression in the majority of cancer cells. In conclusion, aggressive HER2 positive breast cancers with densely sclerotic stroma are common in germline TP53 carriers. High levels of Î±vÎ²6 integrin, Î±-SMA and pSMAD2/3 expression suggest that the dense stromal phenotype may be driven by upregulated transforming growth factor beta signalling.",Near-Infrared-Emitting Nitrogen-Doped Nanographenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041841,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 24,"The quantum-size effect, which enables nanographenes to emit photoluminescence (PL) in the UV to visible region, has inspired intense research.

By utilizing a ring-closure reaction between an aromatic 1,2-dicarboxylic acid and a 1,8-naphthalenediamine derivative, which produces a perimidine framework, nitrogen-doped nanographenes were realized. Two nanographenes produced by a one-pot reaction of edge-oxidized nanographene (GQD-2) with 1,8-naphthalenediamine derivatives (GQD-1â€‰a and GQD-1â€‰b) displayed an absorption band extending to >1000â€…nm; furthermore, the PL wavelength of GQD-1â€‰a was significantly red-shifted into the near-infrared (NIR) region in which it can be used for bioimaging.

Consequently, preventing avoidable RTAC represents a target for improvement in quality of care. The aim of this integrative review was to identify predictors of RTAC from inpatient rehabilitation. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ProQuest and CINAHL databases was used. Thematic analysis was used to examine extracted data. Strong evidence indicating that the principal predictors of RTAC are lower functional status on admission to rehabilitation, a more severe injury and a higher number of comorbidities was identified in this review. This is despite the heterogeneous nature of impairment groups and factors/measures examined. However, the relevance of some predictors of RTAC (such as, patient demographics, invasive devices and primary diagnoses) may be dependent on rehabilitation setting, impairment group or time between rehabilitation admission and RTAC (for example, below 3 days versus 30 days). Consequently, findings of this integrative review highlight that RTAC is a complex, multifactorial patient issue with a complex interplay between the predictors and reasons for RTAC.

Herein, crystalline phase-dependent charge collection is investigated by using rutile and anatase TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) to fabricate PSCs. The results show that rutile TiO2 ETL enhances the extraction and transportation of electrons to FTO and reduces the recombination, thanks to its better conductivity and improved interface with the CH3 NH3 PbI3 (MAPbI3 ) layer. Moreover, this may be also attributed to the fact that rutile TiO2 has better match with perovskite grains, and less trap density.

Recent advances in digital image analysis methods and machine learning have led to significant interest in extracting additional information from medical and digital whole-slide images in radiology and pathology, respectively. This has led to significant interest and research in radiomics and pathomics to correlate phenotypic features of disease with image analytics in order to identify image-based biomarkers. The expanding role of big data in radiology and pathology parallels the development and role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the daily practice of pathology. IHC methods were initially developed to provide additional information to help classify tumors and then transformed into an indispensable tool to guide treatment in many types of cancer. IHC markers are used in daily practice to identify specific types of cells and highlight their distributions in tissues in order to distinguish benign from neoplastic cells, determine tumor origin, subclassify neoplasms, and support and confirm diagnoses. In this regard, radiomics, pathomics, and IHC methods are very similar since they enable the extraction of image-based features to characterize various properties of diseases. Due to the dramatic advancements in recent radiomics research, we provide a brief overview of the role of established and emerging IHC biomarkers in various tumor types that have been correlated with radiologic biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy, predict prognosis, guide patient management, and select treatment strategies.

Cephalic extremities of 12 C. lanigera individuals obtained from a private farm, where this species was bred for fur, were used in this study. The ossicles were obtained either by direct surgical harvesting by mastoid approach or after a dermestid beetle exposure followed by anatomical dissection. The three ossicles that form the assembly are the malleus, incus and stapes. After the removal of these ossicles, a series of anatomical descriptions were made, followed by seriate sets of measurements. The malleus and incus form a joined-single unit called the maleo-incal complex, with an elongated straight appearance, also due to the development of the anterior process. The handle of the malleus and the long process of incus are almost perpendicular to the main axis of the maleo-incal complex. The presence of the muscular process on the handle of the malleus is recorded. The overall shape of the incus is given by the uneven development of the two processes and the reduced neck part. The stapes is the smallest of the components that maintains the well-known architecture in accordance with the general model. The morphology of all three ossicles is backed by a series of measurements, some standard, some adapted to the morphology of the ossicles.

Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) can potentially provide information about plume dynamics; however, the feasibility and likelihood of success are seldom evaluated before conducting a field study. Coupling flow and transport models with geoelectrical models provide a powerful way to assess the potential effectiveness of an actual ERI field campaign. We present a coupled approach for evaluating the feasibility of monitoring nitrate migration and remediation using 4D time-lapse ERI at a legacy nuclear waste facility. This kilometer-scale study focuses on depths below the water table (âˆ¼70â€‰m). A flow and transport model is developed to perform simulations of nitrate migration and removal via a hypothetical pump-and-treat system. A tracer injection is also simulated at the leading edge of the nitrate plume to enhance the conductivity contrast between the native subsurface and the groundwater fluids. Images of absolute bulk conductivity provide limited information concerning plume migration while time-lapse difference images, which remove the static effects of geology, provide more useful information concerning plume dynamics over time. A spatial moment analysis performed on flow and transport and ERI models matches well during the tracer injection; however, inversion regularization smoothing otherwise limits the value in terms of locating the center of mass. We find that the addition of a tracer enables ERI to characterize plume dynamics during pump-and-treat operations, and late-time ERI monitoring provides a conservative estimate of nitrate plume boundaries in this synthetic study.",The multiple roles of the unfolded protein response regulator IRE1Î± in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041814,Molecular carcinogenesis,2019 06 10,"Cancer is associated with a number of conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, cellular redox, and pH changes that result in accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trigger a stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a conserved cellular survival mechanism mediated by the ER transmembrane proteins activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1Î± (IRE1Î±) that act to resolve ER stress and promote cell survival. IRE1Î± is a kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) with multiple activities including unconventional splicing of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for the transcription factor X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1), degradation of other mRNAs in a process called regulated IRE1Î±-dependent decay (RIDD) and activation of a pathway leading to c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Each of these outputs plays a role in the adaptive and cell death responses to ER stress. Many studies indicate an important role for XBP1 and RIDD functions in cancer and new studies suggest that these two functions of the IRE1Î± RNase can have opposing functions in the early and later stages of cancer pathogenesis. Finally, as more is learned about the context-dependent role of IRE1Î± in cancer development, specific small molecule inhibitors and activators of IRE1Î± could play an important role in counteracting the protective shield provided by ER stress signaling in cancer cells.",Positional therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041813,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 06 04,"The modalities of therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) include behavioural and lifestyle modifications, positional therapy, oral appliances, surgery and continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP).

DIC is characterized by systemic intravascular coagulation activation (leading to deposition of intravascular platelets and fibrin) and simultaneous consumption of coagulation proteins and thrombocytes (which may cause bleeding complications). The clinical course of DIC in patients with malignancies is typically less intense compared with DIC complicating alternative clinical settings, including systemic inflammatory responses following infection or traumatic injury. A more slowly proceeding, less fulminant, and widespread hemostatic derangement can remain asymptomatic. Eventually, the ongoing consumption may result in low levels of platelets and coagulation factors, and bleeding complications (frequently localized at the site of the tumor or distant metastases) may be the first clinical manifestation of DIC. An alternative clinical scenario is dominated by thrombotic complications, ranging from clinically manifest vascular thrombosis to microvascular platelet plugs. The main principle of DIC management is adequate treatment of the precipitating disorder; however, there are clinical presentations that may require additional supportive strategies specifically aimed at the amelioration of the coagulopathy.",Fibrin and Fibrinolysis in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041799,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 06 03,"In 1878, Billroth discovered that tumor cells invest themselves in a fibrin thrombus, and he hypothesized that fibrin promotes tumor growth and invasion. Since then, many observations have supported this concept, showing that many hemostatic factors including fibrinogen, fibrin, and components of the fibrinolytic system have indeed a complex interaction with cancer growth and metastasis. Fibrin promotes cell migration by providing a matrix for tumor cell migration and by interactions with adhesive molecules and integrins. Fibrin-containing vascular endothelial growth factor promotes angiogenesis. Fibrin interacts with platelets and leukocytes, and promotes their respective carcinogenic properties. Fibrinolytic components exert different effects on tumors. Plasmin activates latent growth factors, and breaks down extracellular matrix (ECM), while urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and the uPA receptor (uPAR) form complexes with vitronectin and integrins to promote tumor cells to adhere to the ECM. This complex also binds the epidermal growth factor receptor on the tumor cell membrane, and signals the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. The complex also binds to the G protein-coupled receptors leading to cell proliferation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) inhibits apoptosis, and increases tumor cell survival. PAI-1 also enhances cell senescence, leading to production of tumorigenic cytokines by the senescence secretome. The presence of uPA/uPAR and PAI-1 represents a strong biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

Despite the high incidence and recurrent nature of these complications, there is no standardized approach to the management of glioma patients, and many challenges remain. Historically, the perceived risk of intracranial and intratumoral hemorrhage limited the use of anticoagulation, favoring nonpharmacological prophylaxis and treatment.

Molecular studies will increasingly enable prenatal diagnosis, confirm difficult diagnostic challenges, early intervention, and assist in prognostication. This approach facilitates specific individualization of treatment options, with personally targeted therapy expected to increase. There remain many challenges, however, in the clinic. Prior to any test there should be consideration of how the results may influence treatment, and also how they may affect the patient within their familial and social environments. Massive parallel sequencing has the capacity to produce results that create uncertainty that needs to be considered prior to testing. In this context, the potential benefits of adding phenotypic and genotypic personal data to large databases should be discussed with patients. There is a paradox in that personalized medicine is dependent on large datasets to interpret the significance of genetic variation.

Unraveling the underlying molecular defect provides the definitive diagnosis of IBDs, facilitating prognosis and clinical care, which are especially important for severe clinical syndromes and those that may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Until recently, Sanger sequencing of candidate genes has been the only method of molecular diagnosis, but this approach is time-consuming and costly and requires phenotype-based identification of any obvious candidate gene(s). Nowadays, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) allows the simultaneous and rapid investigation of multiple genes at a manageable cost.

Transcriptional regulation studies of a pararetroviral promoter involve both gene expression analyses and investigation of its structural/regulatory framework. The expression of reporter genes such as Î²-Glucuronidase (GUS) or Luciferase (LUC) transcriptionally fused to a promoter usually determines the strength or function of a target promoter. In parallel, DNA-protein interaction studies are employed to assess the functional relevance of predicted transcription factor binding sites in target pararetroviral promoter sequences. In this chapter, we will describe protocols used to determine the transgene integration and expression in transgenic plant systems.

Their promoter elements have been extensively exploited during the last two decades to construct effective gene expression systems. At the same time, the caulimoviral promoters have also been genetically manipulated with different molecular approaches to develop synthetic ""chimeras"" exhibiting precise functionality. Native and ""tailor-made"" synthetic promoters of Pararetroviruses are particularly attractive for formulating unique gene expression cassettes that perform extremely well in gene-stacking and gene-pyramiding in plant cells.

However, fire blight does not have a suitable model host, since its host range is limited to plants with complex genetics and relatively limited resources for genetic analysis. Here, we present a rationale for using apple fruitlets as a potential fire blight model host system, and describe a protocol for quantitative fruit inoculation, bacterial growth measurement, and symptom assessment. The use of apple fruitlets is applicable to the molecular genetic analysis of E. amylovora, including high-throughput genetic screens for E. amylovora virulence-defective mutants, and is potentially useful to study host resistance and responses to E. amylovora as well.",Infection Assay for Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris in Arabidopsis thaliana Mimicking Natural Entry via Hydathodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041772,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 05 01,"Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) causes the devastating disease Black rot in Brassicaceae.

Much less is known about how plants defend themselves in non-vegetative developmental stages and how they use organ level responses such as leaf abscission for defense.

Genes encoding the T3SS are not transcribed in P. syringae prior to contact with a potential host plant and must be expressed during initial stages of infection. Specific organic and amino acids exuded by plants were recently identified as signals that can induce expression of T3SS-associated genes. Here we describe a technique to produce exudates from intact Arabidopsis seedlings and evaluate the exudates for the presence of these bioactive metabolites. We provide procedures for exudate production as well as downstream assays to assess T3SS gene expression using a GFP transcriptional reporter. We also describe methods for preparing high-quality protein and RNA from exudate-treated bacteria to directly assess changes in mRNA and protein abundance.

Most frequent contact was observed in Porites (57%) followed by Favites 28% (nâ€‰=â€‰60), Acropora 26% (nâ€‰=â€‰48), Platygyra 5% (nâ€‰=â€‰5) and Symphyllia 4.2% (nâ€‰=â€‰3). Frequent discoloration and tissue loss were only observed in Porites. Continuous monitoring revealed that long-term algal physical contact prevents light required for polyp for photosynthesis and stops coral feeding ability. In this study, we also found mutual exclusion between Halimeda and coral recruit. Out of 180 coral colonies (size class between 5 and 15Â cm) comprised of Favites (nâ€‰=Â 74), Acropora (nâ€‰=â€‰20), Favia (nâ€‰=Â 79) and Porites (nâ€‰=Â 7) surveyed, none of them were found in Halimeda-dominated sites. The documented effects of recruitment exclusion and tissue mortality followed by algal interaction on major reef building corals (Porites) could affect replenishing process and health of the remaining healthy corals in the Palk Bay reef if algal proliferation rate is not controlled through proper management strategies.",Fabrication of novel amine-functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles for toxic metals: kinetic and isotherm modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041712,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 01,"In this research, an amine-functionalized magnetic silica nanosorbent was prepared using the co-precipitation technique, and this nanosorbent can be effortlessly detached using an external magnetic field. FTIR and SEM analyses identified that the nanosorbent holds extraordinary adsorption characteristics for toxic metals' (copper, cadmium, zinc, and nickel) removal. The adsorption-affecting parameters were optimized, and the thermodynamic studies assessed that the adsorption process seemed to be spontaneous, feasible, and exothermic. The pseudo-first-order and Freundlich models perfectly fit the kinetic and equilibrium data, respectively. Langmuir monolayer capacity of the nanosorbent was analyzed using nonlinear evaluation methods such as 419.9 mg/g for copper, 321.9 mg/g for nickel, 217.3 mg/g for cadmium, and 137.6 mg/g for zinc. The used adsorbent was simply rejuvenated using the 0.2 N HCl solution subsequently with intense agitation. The result of the present research confirms that the produced nanosorbent can be effectively utilized for industrial wastewater management.",Feasibility study on the utilization of coal mining waste for Portland clinker production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041711,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 01,"CMWs (coal mine wastes) as the waste products of coal exploitation or washing plants are a source of pollution that generates waste management problems, especially those that are very old and without a known owner. CMW chemical composition indicates that it contains SiO2-Al2O3-Fe2O3 in such percentages that it can be used in the production of Portland cement clinker, which can lead to potential savings in clinker production, not only in raw material but also in fuels if the CMW has a minimum calorific value and has not suffered self-combustion. After characterization of different CMWs from mining sites located in the north of Spain, six types of CMW have been selected and different raw meal formulations have been designed by software, maximizing the substitution rate of CMW and ensuring a correct raw meal chemical parameters. Along with a reference raw meal, all CMW clinkers were sintered, ground with gypsum, and tested determining the setting time, compressive strength, and soundness. The results of the physico-mechanical tests show that the mechanical performance of the CMW cements was consistent with the European requirements for a CEM Type I cement. CMW, especially those with a residual energetic content, can be utilized in clinker raw meal due to its availability in large quantities at low cost with the further significant benefits for waste management and environmental practices in mining and in cement production processes.",Influence of fungi and bag mesh size on litter decomposition and water quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041710,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Litter decomposition is a complex process that is influenced by many different physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental variables and leaf litter quality (e.g., nutrient content) are important factors that play a significant role in regulating litter decomposition. In this study, the effects of adding fungi and using different mesh size litter bags on litter (Populus tomentosa Carr. and Salix matsudana Koidz.) decomposition rates and water quality were investigated, and investigate the combination of these factors influences leaf litter decomposition. Dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) were measured during the 112-day experiment. The salix leaf litter (kÂ =â€‰0.045) displayed faster decomposition rates than those of populous leaf litter (kÂ =â€‰0.026). Litter decomposition was initially slow and then accelerated; and by the end of the experiment, the decomposition rate was significantly higher (pÂ =â€‰0.012, pÂ <â€‰0.05) when fungi were added to the treatment process compared to the blank, and litter bags with different mesh sizes did not influence the decomposition rate. The variations in the decomposition rates and nutrient content were influenced by litter quality and a number of environmental factors. The decomposition rate was most influenced by internal factors related to litter quality, including the N/P and C/P ratios of the litter. By quantifying the interact effect of environment and litter nutrient dynamic, to figure out the revetment plant litter decomposition process in a wetland system in biological physical and chemical aspects, which can help us in making the variables that determine decomposition rates important for assessing wetland function.",Gallic acid protects particulate matter (PM10) triggers cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation causing heart adverse events in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041709,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Previous studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter (PM) increased variety of health problems, particularly cardiovascular diseases leading to premature mortality. The cardiac effects of particulate matter containing PM10 include increased infarct size, decreased heart function, and increased arrhythmias in experimental ischemia-reperfusion models in rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 Î¼m (PM10) on isolated-rat heart and also to determine the efficacy of gallic acid (GA) as a preventive agent in oxidative damage. The healthy rats were divided into 8 equal groups which served as, control, GA, PM10 (0.5, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg), and PM10+GA groups. PM10 administered into the lungs via the trachea in two stages with 48-h interval. After all experiments, the electrocardiogram was recorded. Then, the hemodynamic parameters and ventricular arrhythmias in rat isolated-hearts were assessed using Langendorff apparatus and according to the Lambeth conventions. In addition, the inflammation and oxidative stress factors in cardiac tissues were evaluated in all groups. The obtained results showed that the exposure to PM caused to decrease in cardiac hemodynamic and electrocardiogram parameters. Also, in PM10 rat groups, the IL-6, TNF-Î±, and oxidative stress parameters were increased. Gallic acid preserved the value of cardiac parameters and inflammation in rat hearts. In summary, we added a novel therapeutic effect of gallic acid for cardiac dysfunction induced by particulate matter. These findings could be related to antioxidant and antiinflammation properties and the obtained results suggest that natural antioxidant like gallic acid could be a therapeutic agent in prevention and management of health issues in the polluted areas of the world.",Fresh underground light non-aqueous liquid (LNAPL) pollution source zone monitoring in an outdoor experiment using cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041708,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Real-time monitoring of source zone of light non-aqueous liquids (LNAPLs) is important for preventing accidental pollution and taking effective underground pollution remediation measures. As a high-precision monitoring technology, cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (CHERT) has been widely used to obtain static information regarding underground stratigraphic structures and dynamic information regarding fluid motion. The time-lapse data processing method can be used to obtain pollution zone dynamic change information. Since the leakage rate directly affects the diffusion range of pollution, this study simulated the initial evolution process of LNAPL pollution source regions under two different leakage rates. The time-lapse monitoring of the above process was performed using CHERT. The test results show that CHERT can be used to observe the migration of LNAPLs and the initial evolution of the contaminated area. Differences in leakage rate will result in variation in soil wettability and fluid distribution, which will cause changes in soil resistivity in the corresponding region. The low-saturation LNAPL-contaminated area may exhibit low-resistivity characteristics and is easily overlooked in field investigations. In addition, the degree of contamination in the saturated zone can be quantitatively evaluated by CHERT; however, the pollution range and oil saturation value determined by CHERT are underestimated. The results showed the electrical variation characteristics of the initial evolution process of the fresh pollution source area and provide data that will enable early warnings of LNAPL leakage. This shows that CHERT is a promising tool for monitoring LNAPL pollution source leakage even if further research is needed to fully understand the effect of hydrological processes on electronic signals.",Effect of prenatal PFOS exposure on liver cell function in neonatal mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041707,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a hepatotoxic pollutant, is detected in the human cord blood, and it may induce health risk to an embryo. In this study, we established intrauterine exposure to PFOS in mice to evaluate potential impacts of PFOS on postnatal day 1 (PND1) offspring through conducting biochemical tests, quantitative PCR, and immunostaining. As results, PFOS-exposed maternal mice showed marked hepatomegaly and induced liver steatosis in a high dose of 5 mg PFOS/kg. In PND1 mice, intrahepatic contents of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL were elevated by high-dose PFOS exposure, while intracellular HDL content was decreased. As shown in quantitative PCR, functional messenger RNAs of cytochrome P4A14 (CYP4A14) for fatty acid oxidation, CD36 for hepatic fatty acid uptake, and apolipoprotein B100 (APOB) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) for hepatic export of lipids in PND1 livers were changed when compared to those in PFOS-free controls. In further validations, immunofluorescence stains showed that hepatic CYP4A14 and CD36 immunoreactive cells were increased in PFOS-exposed PND1 mice. In addition, reduced immunofluorescence-positive cells of APOB and FGF21 were observed in PND1 livers. Collectively, these preliminary findings demonstrate that prenatal exposure to PFOS may affect lipid metabolism in liver cells of PND1 mice.",Exposure index of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas disaster and a comprehensive spectrum of cytogenetic analysis after 30 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041706,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Severity of clinical expression and high mortality could not facilitate establishing exposure index/association following MIC disaster in Bhopal. Mortality-based exposure stratification was critiqued by the International Medical Commission on Bhopal (IMCB). IMCB stratified exposure considering distance as surrogate at 2Â km intervals after 10Â years. The first follow-up cytogenetic screening of the pre-screened survivors after 30Â years has demonstrated chromosome abnormalities (CA). Exposure stratification was attempted considering cytogenetic screening conducted during 1986-1988. Elevation of CA appeared proportional to exposure status and authenticated the initial mortality-based stratification. The one-on-one comparison of the previous and present cytogenetics has described the individual response to MIC exposure over 30Â years. Chi-square test has been carried out for checking the cytogenetic changes at the individual level statistically, which revealed that differences of chromosomal aberrations collected immediately post-disaster and 30Â years later are nonsignificant. The prominence of interindividual variation was noticed in general. The impact of overall exposure was higher in males. Constitutional abnormalities in 8.5% of the study population, including translocation, inversion, deletion, fragile sites, etc., necessitate screening of blood-linked members. The incidence of acrocentric association was prominent in the study population. Normal karyotype in children born to severely exposed parents with congenital anomalies indicates necessity of molecular karyotyping and/or screening of mutations. The study highlights follow-up of the health of the index cases at shorter (3-6Â months) intervals. This comprehensive spectrum of cytogenetic report highlights immediate post-disaster chromosomal aberrations, the changes that occurred over 30Â years in conjunction with other environmental factors at the individual level, constitutive genomic aberrations, polymorphic variations, and chromosomal patterns in congenitally malformed children of the survivors, which collectively indicate the possibility of acquisition/persistence of stable aberrations in MIC-exposed lymphocytes through interaction with environmental/biological confounders.",Impacts of different aged landfill leachate on PVC corrosion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041705,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Landfill leachate is generally transferred to in situ facilities for advanced treatmentÂ by using a pipe system. Because of its harmful and complex compounds, leachate may react with pipe materials, leading to corrosion and scaling. This experimental study uses typical PVC pipe material and investigates its anti-corrosion performance by placing the material samples into different aged leachates. By evaluating the changes in different experimental parameters, including calcium, magnesium, and chloride ion concentration, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and pH, combined with a characterization of the material properties, we infer the main causes of pipe scaling-corrosion. Results show that the scaling is more intense in the younger leachate, and the concentration of calcium ions is the dominant influencing factor. The scaling might be resulted from joint actions of chemical precipitation and microbial metabolic activities. It is expectedÂ the study to provide useful insights into taking effective actions on anti-clogging, and enhance pipes design by selection of appropriate materials for future modification.",Effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides on child neurodevelopment in different age groups: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041704,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Exposure to pesticides is a major factor in the cause of dysfunction in the nervous system and neurodevelopment disorders in children at critical periods of great vulnerability. The aim of this study was to review scientific evidence published on neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in different stages, including neonates, infants, toddlers, preschool children, and school-age children. Full-text articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases between 1973 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. Results: Fifty studies were eligible for inclusion in this quantitative synthesis. Fifteen of these papers evaluated the effects on neonates and infants, 18 on the effects on toddlers and preschool children, and 24 the effects on school-age children. Considerable evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to OPs contributes to child neurodevelopment disorders in all stages, whereas data about the effects of postnatal exposure are limited. Therefore, the available evidence supports the theory that sensitive time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. Although 45 out of the total 50 selected articles found an association between OP exposure and child neurodevelopment, some of the evidence is controversial. A standardized methodology is needed to enable the comparison of the results in several studies, and further research studies are needed to warrant firmer conclusions. A systematic review of this evidence should be performed continuously to update the state of knowledge regarding neurodevelopmental effects associated with OP exposure."

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a critical brain area in mediating the affective pain. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Our recent study indicated that C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) and its sole receptor CXCR5 are involved in sensory sensitization in the spinal cord after spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Whether CXCL13/CXCR5 signaling in the ACC contributes to the pathogenesis of pain-related aversion remains unknown. Here, we showed that SNL increased the CXCL13 level and CXCR5 expression in the ACC after SNL. Knockdown of CXCR5 by microinjection of Cxcr5 shRNA into the ACC did not affect SNL-induced mechanical allodynia but effectively alleviated neuropathic pain-related place avoidance behavior. Furthermore, electrophysiological recording from layer II-III neurons in the ACC showed that SNL increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), decreased the EPSC paired-pulse ratio, and increased the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ratio, indicating enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Finally, superfusion of CXCL13 onto ACC slices increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs. Pre-injection of Cxcr5 shRNA into the ACC reduced the increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission induced by SNL. Collectively, these results suggest that CXCL13/CXCR5 signaling in the ACC is involved in neuropathic pain-related aversion via synaptic potentiation.",Superstitious Perception: Comparing Perceptual Prediction by Humans and Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041691,Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2019 05 01,"Recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have introduced new ways to model the complex processes of human vision. To date, the comparison of human vision and CNNs has focused on internal representations (i.e., receptive fields), with behavioral comparisons left largely unexplored. Here, we probe the influence of cognitive strategy on the similarity between CNN output and human behavior. We gave study participants a superstitious perception task (i.e., we asked them to detect an assigned target in white noise) while asking them to engage in either an active or passive attentional strategy. Previous research has shown that an active attentional strategy tends to engage central executive functions, whereas a passive strategy allows perceptual processes to unfold with limited central control. The results showed that the pattern of human responses in the superstitious perception task depended significantly on task strategy. Specifically, detecting targets superstitiously (i.e., false alarms) was correlated with evidence of a target's presence in the passive condition, but not in the active condition.Human data were compared to the performance of a CNN performing the same task, with the decision criterion of the CNN set to match the false alarm rates observed in the two strategy conditions of the human participants. CNN responses resembled those of human participants in the passive condition more closely than those in the active condition. This observation suggests that the CNN does a better job of mimicking human behavior when central executive functions are not engaged than when they are engaged. This, in turn, has important implications for what human participants are doing in the superstitious perception task. Namely, it implies that superstitious perception may have two important ingredients that are somewhat dissociable. First, there is the ability to detect weak signals in noise that correspond to the target image. This appears to be what participants are doing under passive strategy conditions; they allow externally generated signals to dominate their perceptual experience. Second, there is the ability to ignore the noise in favor of basing responses solely on internally generated signals. This seems to correspond more closely to what participants are doing under active strategy conditions, when attention is controlled by representations in memory. This research emphasizes the importance of modeling the full range of human responsiveness in even a simple noisy detection task.",Dynamic Protention: The Architecture of Real-Time Cognition for Future Events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041690,Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2019 05 01,"For over 30 years now, a body of physiological evidence has been acquired which indicates that cognitive operations coordinate via the phase synchronization of neuronal firing. While usually ascribed to ""binding,"" i.e., the putting together of basic perceptual features to form more complex perceptual units, this ascription is not without critics, who identify phase synchronization as a function of sensorimotor coordination. From the perspective of an experimental paradigm used to measure the effects of stimulus synchronization, we discuss what is ""bound"" and attempt a reconciliation between perceptual and sensorimotor accounts of oscillatory synchronization. Our evidence identifies a role for synchronization in protentive coding, this is to say, coding in anticipation of a future event, and hence describes the architecture of real-time cognition for future events.","Synthesis and anti-HIV activity of L-2',3'-Dideoxy-4'-selenonucleosides (L-4'-Se-ddNs).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041687,Archives of pharmacal research,2019 05 01,"Based on the potent anti-HIV activity of L-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (L-ddC), L-2',3'-dideoxy-4'-selenonucleosides (L-4'-Se-ddNs) have been synthesized from natural chiral template, L-glutamic acid, using Pummerer-type condensation as a key step.

For this reason the prevention of cardiovascular diseases should be undertaken very early both in the general population and, in a targeted manner, in subjects at cardiovascular risk. Preventive strategies should include measures to encourage physical activity and correct eating habits and to reduce exposure to pollutants. The main actors responsible for carrying out these preventive interventions are the local and national political authorities. Moreover, particular attention should be paid to the first thousand days of life starting from conception, to prevent unfavorable epigenetic modifications. In addition to initiatives aimed at the general population, interventions should be planned by the medical community to assess the individual risk profile.

NO is produced by the activity of the enzyme nitric oxide synthases (NOS). There is substantial and mounting evidence that slight abnormalities of NO may underlie a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. NO participates of the oxidative stress and inflammatory processes that contribute to the progressive dopaminergic loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the effects of neuronal NOS-targeted siRNAs on the injury caused in dopaminergic neurons by the toxin 6-hidroxydopamine (6-OHDA). First, we confirmed (immunohistochemistry and Western blotting) that SH-SY5Y cell lineage expresses the dopaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the protein under analysis, neuronal NOS (nNOS). We designed four siRNAs by using the BIOPREDsi algorithm choosing the one providing the highest knockdown of nNOS mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells, as determined by qPCR. siRNA 4400 carried by liposomes was internalized into cells, caused a concentration-dependent knockdown on nNOS, and reduced the toxicity induced by 6-OHDA (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Regarding in vivo action in the dopamine-depleted animals, intra-striatal injection of siRNA 4400 at 4Â days prior 6-OHDA produced a decrease in the rotational behavior induced by apomorphine. Finally, siRNA 4400 mitigated the loss of TH(+) cells in substantia nigra dorsal and ventral part. In conclusion, the suppression of nNOS enzyme by targeted siRNAs modified the progressive death of dopaminergic cells induced by 6-OHDA and merits further pre-clinical investigations as a neuroprotective approach for PD."

While abnormalities in the frontal lobe have also been reported, the associated white matter fiber bundles have not been investigated comprehensively due to the complexity in tracing them through fiber crossings. Furthermore, most studies have used a non-specific DTI model to understand white matter abnormalities. We present results from a first study that uses a multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data set coupled with an advanced multi-fiber tractography algorithm to probe microstructural measures related to axonal/cellular density and volume of fronto-striato-thalamic pathways in children with ADHD (N =â€‰30) and healthy controls (N =â€‰28). Head motion was firstly examined as a priority in order to assure that no group difference existed. We investigated 45 different white matter fiber bundles in the brain.

Decreased levels of BDNF in the aging brain are thought to usher cognitive impairment. BDNF is stored in dense core vesicles and released through exocytosis from the neurites. The exact mechanism for the regulation of BDNF secretion is not well understood. Munc18-1 (STXBP1) was found to be essential for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, but its involvement in BDNF secretion is not known. Interestingly, neurons lacking munc18-1 undergo severe degeneration in knock-out mice. Here, we report the effects of BDNF treatment on the presynaptic terminal using munc18-1-deficient neurons. Reduced expression of munc18-1 in heterozygous (+/-) neurons diminishes synaptic transmitter release, as tested here on individual synaptic connections with FM1-43 fluorescence imaging. Transduction of cultured neurons with BDNF markedly increased BDNF secretion in wild-type but was less effective in munc18-1 +/- cells. In turn, BDNF enhanced synaptic functions and restored the severe synaptic dysfunction induced by munc18-1 deficiency. The role of munc18-1 in the synaptic effect of BDNF is highlighted by the finding that BDNF upregulated the expression of munc18-1 in neurons, consistent with enhanced synaptic functions. Accordingly, this is the first evidence showing the functional effect of BDNF in munc18-1 deficient synapses and about the direct role of munc18-1 in the regulation of BDNF secretion. We propose a molecular model of BDNF secretion and discuss its potential as therapeutic target to prevent cognitive decline in the elderly.",Prion Efficiently Replicates in Î±-Synuclein Knockout Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041657,Molecular neurobiology,2019 05 01,"Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders associated with the conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an abnormal misfolded form named PrPSc. Other than accumulating in the brain, PrPSc can bind PrPC and force it to change conformation to PrPSc. The exact mechanism which underlies the process of PrPC/PrPSc conversion still needs to be defined and many molecules or cofactors might be involved. Several studies have documented an important role of PrPC to act as receptor for abnormally folded forms of Î±-synuclein which are responsible of a group of diseases known as synucleinopathies. The presence of PrPC was required to promote efficient internalization and spreading of abnormal Î±-synuclein between cells. In this work, we have assessed whether Î±-synuclein exerts any role in PrPSc conversion and propagation either in vitro or in vivo. Indeed, understanding the mechanism of PrPC/PrPSc conversion and the identification of cofactors involved in this process is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. Our results showed that PrPSc was able to efficiently propagate in the brain of animals even in the absence of Î±-synuclein thus suggesting that this protein did not act as key modulator of prion propagation. Thus, Î±-synuclein might take part in this process but is not specifically required for sustaining prion conversion and propagation.",Downregulated UCHL1 Accelerates Gentamicin-Induced Auditory Cell Death via Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041655,Molecular neurobiology,2019 05 01,"The clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics is partly limited by their ototoxicity. The pathogenesis of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity still remains unknown. Here, RNA-sequencing was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes in rat cochlear organotypic cultures treated with gentamicin (GM), and 232 and 43 genes were commonly up- and downregulated, respectively, at day 1 and 2 after exposure. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (Uchl1) was one of the downregulated genes whose expression was prominent in spiral ganglion cells (SGCs), lateral walls, as well as efferent nerve terminal and nerve fibers. We further investigated if a deficit of Uchl1 in organotypic cochlea and the House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells accelerates ototoxicity. We found that a deficit in Uchl1 accelerated GM-induced ototoxicity by showing a decreased number of SGCs and nerve fibers in organotypic cochlear cultures and HEI-OC1 cells. Furthermore, Uchl1-depleted HEI-OC1 cells revealed an increased number of autophagosomes accompanied by decreased lysosomal fusion. These data indicate that the downregulation of Uchl1 following GM treatment is deleterious to auditory cell survival, which results from the impaired autophagic flux. Our results provide evidence that UCHL1-dependent autophagic flux may have a potential as an otoprotective target for the treatment of GM-induced auditory cell death.",Carbamazepine interaction with direct oral anticoagulants: help from the laboratory for the personalized management of oral anticoagulant therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041653,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2019 05 01,"Current guidelines recommend caution in prescribing concomitant use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and antiepileptic drugs due to drug-drug interactions leading to potential risk of DOACs subtherapeutic concentration and treatment failure. Herein we report a significant interaction between carbamazepine (CZP) and apixaban, causing subtherapeutic concentration of the drug in a patient with atrial fibrillation who had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) episode. Another anti-Xa DOAC, edoxaban, administered to the patient after TIA occurrence did not show significant interaction with CZP. In addition to confirm that cautions should be used when antiepileptic and DOACs are concomitantly prescribed, the present case also demonstrates that, in the management of certain subsets of patients who need anticoagulant treatment, measurement of DOAC plasma concentration can help guide a personalized management and avoid adverse clinical outcomes.",Normal D-dimer levels in cancer patients with radiologic evidence of pulmonary embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041652,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2019 06 11,"Accurate and expeditious diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism in cancer patients improves patient outcomes. D-dimer is often used to rule out pulmonary embolism. However, this test is less accurate in cancer patients, and it is unclear whether cancer patients with normal D-dimer levels can present with pulmonary embolism. All consecutive patients who presented to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, USA, between May 2009 and November 2015 who underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography and plasma D-dimer level measurement were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and normal D-dimer levels were identified. Among the 8023 cancer patients identified, 1156 (14%) had pulmonary embolism. Only 35 patients with pulmonary embolism (3%) had normal plasma D-dimer levels. Twenty-six of these patients had acute pulmonary embolism and the other nine had subacute or chronic pulmonary embolism. Thirteen of the 26 acute cases were in patients with hematological cancer. Most patients (23/35, 66%) had subsegmental or segmental pulmonary embolism. Only one patient had pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary arteries. Although it is uncommon (3%), cancer patients with radiologic evidence of pulmonary embolism can present with normal D-dimer levels.

We designed our study to compare intraventricular velocities and gradients, obtained by vector flow mapping (VFM) technology during early diastole in consecutive patients diagnosed with mild and advanced diastolic dysfunction at echocardiography and a control group with a purpose to validate the hypothesis of relationship between new parameters and severity of diastolic dysfunction and conventional markers of elevated LV filling pressure. Two-dimensional streamline fields were obtained using VFM technology in 121 subjects (57 with normal diastolic function, 38 with mild diastolic dysfunction and 26 with advanced diastolic dysfunction). We measured several velocities and calculated a gradient along the selected streamline, which we compared between groups and correlated them with conventional echocardiographic parameters. Apical intraventricular velocity gradient (GrIV) was the lowest in control group, followed by mild and advanced diastolic dysfunction groups (5.3â€‰Â±â€‰1.9 vs. 6.8â€‰Â±â€‰2.5 vs. 13.6â€‰Â±â€‰5.0/s, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and showed good correlation with E/e' (râ€‰=â€‰0.751, pâ€‰<â€‰000.1).

Different degrees of diastolic dysfunction affect the Intraventricular velocity behavior during early diastole obtained by VFM. GrIV could discriminate between groups with different levels of diastolic dysfunction and was closely associated with classical echocardiographic indices of elevated LV filling pressure. GrIV/e' ratio has a potential to become a single parameter needed to assess left ventricular diastolic function.",The impact of probiotics and lactoferrin supplementation on piglet gastrointestinal microbial communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041632,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2019 05 01,"Probiotics and lactoferrin are currently being used in neonatal intensive care units in the hopes of reducing rates of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). While studies have shown that these measures can be clinically beneficial to premature babies, and there are ongoing trials to measure their impact on NEC and sepsis rates, little is known about how they may impact microbiota development. We thus employed a newborn piglet model to assess the impact of feeding probiotics or a combination of probiotics and lactoferrin on development of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Healthy full-term piglets were fed either probiotics alone or probiotics and a bovine lactoferrin supplement over the first weeks of life, and their microbiota profiles were compared with unsupplemented controls. We found that both probiotic and probiotic plus lactoferrin treatments impacted the microbial composition within the gastrointestinal tract, with differing impacts on various regions within the gut. In addition, the impact of probiotics was often reversed by the presence of lactoferrin and both feeding interventions altered the microbiota's genetic propensity to use ferric versus ferrous ions. These results suggest that iron availability may be a key factor to consider when designing feeding interventions that target the microbiome.",Preparing Children with Autism for Transition to Mainstream School and Perspectives on Supporting Positive School Experiences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041629,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 01,"School readiness is important to a positive start and success in school but children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are at risk of not being school-ready.

VCR was administered intraperitoneally for 10Â days in two cycles to induce neuropathic pain. Static and dynamic mechanical allodynia was evaluated using von Frey hair filaments and cotton buds, respectively. Paw thermal hyperalgesia was determined through a hot plate analgesiometer. The tail cold immersion hyperalgesia and paw cold allodynia were determined by available standard protocols. The formalin nociception was induced via subplantar injection of formalin.

We find that involuntary unemployment between the last job and retirement causes a loss in life satisfaction after retirement. People who influenced or even initiated unemployment, by contrast, show no scarring. The scarring effect goes beyond what can be explained by the income loss originating from reduced pensions. It shows up independently of whether the unemployment spell directly before retirement was the only experience of unemployment in a person's career, or whether she had also experienced unemployment at earlier times. We do not find evidence that early retirement or involuntary retirement are the reasons why formerly unemployed retirees display unemployment scarring.",Delivery mode is associated with maternal mental health following childbirth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041603,Archives of women's mental health,2019 05 01,"Childbirth is a life-transforming event often followed by a time of heightened psychological vulnerability in the mother. There is a growing recognition of the importance of obstetrics aspects in maternal well-being with the way of labor potentially influencing psychological adjustment following parturition or failure thereof. Empirical scrutiny on the association between mode of delivery and postpartum well-being remains limited. We studied 685 women who were on average 3Â months following childbirth and collected information concerning mode of delivery and pre- and postpartum mental health. Analysis of variance revealed that women who had cesarean section or vaginal instrumental delivery had higher somatization, obsessive compulsive, depression, and anxiety symptom levels than those who had natural or vaginal delivery as well as overall general distress, controlling for premorbid mental health, maternal age, education, primiparity, and medical complication in newborn. Women who underwent unplanned cesarean also had higher levels of childbirth-related PTSD symptoms excluding those with vaginal instrumental. The risk for endorsing psychiatric symptoms reflecting clinically relevant cases increased by twofold following unplanned cesarean and was threefold for probable childbirth-related PTSD. Maternal well-being following childbirth is associated with the experienced mode of delivery. Increasing awareness in routine care of the implications of operative delivery and obstetric interventions in delivery on a woman's mental health is needed. Screening at-risk women could improve the quality of care and prevent enduring symptoms. Research is warranted on the psychological and biological factors implicated in the mode of delivery and their role in postpartum adjustment."

Blommersia transmarina sp. nov. differs from its sister taxon, B. wittei, by several morphological differences including larger body size (snout-vent length up to 34.5Â mm) and by slight differences in advertisement calls. Boophis nauticus sp. nov. differs from its closest relatives, B. tephraeomystax and B. doulioti, by slight morphological differences (including larger body size), a reddish (vs. silvery or golden) iris coloration in life, and slightly different advertisement calls. The two new species differ from their closest relatives by a substantial genetic differentiation, with pairwise genetic distances >â€‰5% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, and based on the limited available data, also by distinct differences in nuclear DNA. They also are both larger than their closest relatives from Madagascar and B. transmarina sp. nov. is the largest Blommersia species, suggesting a moderate form of island gigantism. The Madagascan sister species B. wittei and B. doulioti are among the relatively few amphibian species occurring in the arid western biomes of the island, are adapted to open landscape, and reproduce in stagnant water bodies, which we hypothesizeÂ may represent important preadaptations for successful overseas colonization.","A Pilot, Randomized Study in Women of Nutrition-Related Clinical Chemistry at 6Â Weeks after Roux en Y Gastric Bypass: Comparison of Two Nutrition Support Plans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041591,Obesity surgery,2019 05 01,"The current pilot study tested a twofold hypothesis: some nutrition-related chemical measures change by 6Â weeks after Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RNYGB); one of two nutrition support plans will prevent chemical signs of nutrition problems at 6Â weeks better than the other.

Robot-assisted surgical management has been reported only twice in the available literature. We present the first report of robot-assisted reduction and repair of an USH using mesh interposition. A 68 year old female presented with left flank pain for the past three weeks. A computed topography urogram revealed an USH. She began having flank pain with nausea and vomiting during the diuresis portion of the study. She was admitted, and a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed. A left retrograde pyelogram confirmed a pathognomonic ""curlicue"" distal ureter. She underwent robot-assisted repair of the USH, during which time the left ureter was mobilized and traced down to the point of herniation. After reduction, a 4 Ã— 4cm piece of bioavailable mesh was placed over the defect, and fibrin sealant coated on the mesh. A ureteral stent was placed in retrograde fashion. Total blood loss was 25 mL, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day one. Her nephrostomy tube was removed prior to discharge, and the stent removed at 8 weeks postoperatively. This represents the first reported case of robotic repair of an ureterosciatic hernia with mesh.",Robot-assisted nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: results from three high-volume robotic surgery institutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041588,Journal of robotic surgery,2019 05 01,"Robot-Assisted NephroUreterectomy (RANU) represents a minimally invasive alternative to open NephroUreterectomy (NU) for management of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC) but its oncologic safety is still controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the peri-operative, pathologic and oncologic outcomes of RANU for UTUC. From 2008 to 2017, 78 patients diagnosed with UTUC and elected for RANU at 3 high-volume robotic surgery centres were retrospectively assessed. Surgery was performed using da Vinci SiÂ® and XiÂ® systems. RANU was done adhering to oncological principles as in open surgery. The outcomes of the study were: (1) peri-operative morbidity, namely intra- and post-operative complications, blood loss, length of hospital stay and operative time; (2) oncologic outcomes, namely overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Peri-operative overall complication rate was 24.4% and high-grade complication rate was 2.6%. Median blood loss, length of hospital stay and operative time were 124Â ml, 4 days and 167Â min. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 31 (41%) patients. Lymph-node involvement was present in 9 (29%) patients. At median follow-up of 15Â months, 2- and 4-year OS were 79% and 66%, respectively, and RFS was 63% and 53%. Peritoneal dissemination was recorded in 1 (1.3%) patient with pT4N2R1 UTUC. Our study is limited by the relatively small cohort of patients and its retrospective character. RANU as minimally invasive treatment for patients with UTUC is safe and feasible. Post-operative morbidity is low and major complications are rare. Oncologic outcomes are acceptable and no evidence of increased risk of peritoneal dissemination is recorded. Long-term data are needed. RANU should be regarded as an alternative to open surgery for UTUC that can offer good peri-operative and oncologic results.",Revisiting Bruner's Legacy from the Perspective of Historical Materialism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041587,Integrative psychological & behavioral science,2019 05 01,"The book Jerome S. Bruner beyond 100: cultivating possibilities (2015) is a celebration and a continuing development of Jerome S. Bruner's contribution in psychology. As a review of this book, this article aims to commemorate Bruner's legacy by developing it further. The main content of the book is summarized into four issues: culture and language, narrative and folk psychology, dilemmas and shared dilemmas, subjectivity and intersubjectivity. Hegel's contribution to 'social reality' and Karl Marx's historical materialism are introduced to discuss the relation between the individual and his world, which is fundamental in Bruner's psychological inquiry and also a key question underlying the four issues. In the horizon of the ontological revolution launched by historical materialism, the difference between sensuous consciousness and pure consciousness and the dynamic process of social discourse interweaving sensuous consciousness and ideology is discussed and revisited. By integrating nature and society on the dimension of historicity, historical materialism can inspire psychology to understand the historical construction of human existence.",Predictive factors of difficulty of thoracoscopic esophagectomy in the left decubitus position.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041586,Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,2019 05 01,"We have sometimes experienced technical difficulty performing thoracoscopic esophagectomy because of the position of the descending aorta or width of the mediastinal space.

Previous studies have demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs play important roles in ischemic stroke (IS). This study aimed to investigate long noncoding RNA H19 (lncRNA H19) expression in IS cases and the association between lncRNA H19 variants and IS risk and IS-related risk factors. A total of 550 IS cases and 550 controls were recruited for this study. LncRNA H19 expression was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was conducted by the Sequenom MassARRAY technology. LncRNA H19 level in peripheral blood of IS cases was significantly upregulated compared with healthy controls (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046). No significant association was observed between lncRNA H19 rs217727 and rs4929984 polymorphisms with IS risk in all genetic models, and rs217727-rs4929984 haplotypes are not associated with IS susceptibility. Further meta-analysis also implied that the rs217727 and rs4929984 polymorphisms were not associated with IS in Chinese population. However, rs4929984 is significantly associated with the diastolic blood pressure level of IS patients (additive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.007; dominant model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.013), whereas rs217727 is associated with international normalized ratio (additive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.019; recessive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.004), prothrombin time activity level (additive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.026; recessive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.004), and homocysteine level (recessive model: Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.048) in patients with IS.

Although there have been many studies on the inflammation of the nasal mucosa epithelium, the mechanism remains unclear. Our study found that H3K4me3 histone demethylase KDM2B (also known as JHDM1B) and transcriptional regulator Brg1 (also called SNF2-Î² or Smarca4) were significantly decreased in nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients, and they were positively correlated. Brg1 and KDM2B co-localize in the epithelial cells of nasal mucosa. We used poly(I:C)-treated nasal mucosal epithelial cells (HNECs) to find that the expression of KDM2B and Brg1 was also decreased, and the main expression position transferred from the nucleus to the nuclear membrane. We used small interfering RNA to knock down the expression of KDM2B and Brg1 in nasal epithelial cells. It was interesting to find that the decreased expression of KDM2B and Brg1 produced similar effects to that of poly(I:C)-treated cells, which could promote inflammatory response of nasal mucosal epithelial cells. And Brg1 appears to play a role in KDM2B regulating gene promoters of IL-6 and TNF-Î± inflammatory. This study shows that KDM2B and Brg1 may have an inhibitory effect on the development of CRSwNP nasal mucosal epithelial inflammation. This study will provide a new perspective for gene targeting therapy of CRSwNPs.",Clinical applications of fucoidan in translational medicine for adjuvant cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041568,Clinical and translational medicine,2019 05 19,"The chemical composition of fucoidan, a kind of sulfated polysaccharide mainly derived from brown seaweed, includes a substantial percentage of L-fucose.

In this review, we aim to provide a current view of different aspects of fucoidan biological activity, with a focus on the anti-cancer regulatory effects of fucoidan on growth signaling mechanisms. First, we discuss historical aspects of fucoidan and fucoidan products, as well as the anti-cancer effects of fucoidan on various cancer cells. Second, we discuss fucoidan's biological activities and induction of cell death in cancer cells, including multiple mechanisms and signal transduction pathways related to its anti-cancer effects. Next, we focus on fucoidan and fucoidan-derived products that have been marketed as dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for cancer, including anti-cancer effects of fucoidan when combined as an adjuvant with clinical drugs. Finally, case studies of fucoidan in complementary therapy and as an alternative medicine in animal and mouse models and human clinical trials to alleviate side effects of anti-cancer chemotherapy are discussed. Combining fucoidan with clinical therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer patients, dissecting the related signal transduction pathways and investigating their dynamic interactions may reveal potential molecular targets in cancer prevention, therapies and key obstacles in the current development of anti-cancer strategies.",Exploring the genetic diversity within traditional Philippine pigmented Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041567,"Rice (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 19,"The wild ancestors of domesticated rice had red seed, white rice being the result of a mutation in the rice domestication gene Rc.

Within this cohort, we identified consistent CtBP1-related phenotypes of intellectual disability, ataxia, hypotonia, and tooth enamel defects present in most patients. The R342W mutation in CtBP1 is located within a region implicated in a high affinity-binding cleft for CtBP-interacting proteins. Unbiased proteomic analysis demonstrated reduced interaction of several chromatin-modifying factors with the CtBP1 W342 mutant. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human glioblastoma cell lines expressing -CtBP1 R342 (wt) or W342 mutation revealed changes in the expression profiles of genes controlling multiple cellular processes. Patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were found to be more sensitive to apoptosis during acute glucose deprivation compared to controls. Glucose deprivation strongly activated the BH3-only pro-apoptotic gene NOXA, suggesting a link between enhanced cell death and NOXA expression in patient fibroblasts.

For instance, the hypothesis that tree traits shape patterns in ant-plant interactions lacks data, notably for tropical canopies in different successional stages. In this study, we investigated canopy traits, such as tree height, the presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), connectivity among tree crowns, and successional stage, structure ant-tree interactions in a tropical dry forest (TDF), examining whether these are the determinant factors for ant species richness. We collected ants on trees in early and late successional stages over 2Â years, in rainy and dry seasons. In the late successional stage, ant species richness was greater in the taller trees; in the early successional stage, the smallest trees had a greater ant species richness than the taller trees. The EFNs and connectivity among treetops had no effect on ant species richness. We obtained a tree-ant network of the early successional stage, involving 786 interactions among 57 ant species and 75 trees; in the late successional stage, the network had 914 interactions among 60 ant species and 75 trees. There were 27 species of trees in our study, 11 of which (40.7% of all individual trees) had EFNs. The ant-plant interactions were not randomly distributed, suggesting that various biotic factors structured the ant assemblies. This study presents new insights into ant-tree interactions, showing that both tree height and successional stage influence the occurrence of many species of ants in tree canopies of tropical dry forests.",The extent and predictors of phthalate exposure among couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041540,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 06 03,"Phthalates are chemicals used as plasticizers and solvents in many consumer products but are suspected of disrupting the endocrine system and are known for their reproductive/developmental health risks. This study examined the extent and predictors of phthalate exposure among 599 couples undergoing in vitro fertilization. A questionnaire was administered to obtain sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle data, and two spot urine samples were collected from the couples to analyze eight phthalate metabolites, cotinine (COT) as a smoking index, and creatinine to adjust for urine dilution. Seven phthalate metabolites were detected in >â€‰94% of the urine samples, and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was found in 24% of the women and 26% of their male partners. Median phthalate levels were highest for monoethyl phthalate (MEP), at 333.26Â Î¼g/l in women and 290Â Î¼g/l in male partners, and lowest for MBzP, at 1.17Â Î¼g/l in women and 1.14Â Î¼g/l in male partners. Correlation coefficients of â‰¥â€‰0.4 between the women and their male partners for the eight urinary phthalate metabolites may indicate a shared source of exposure. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the association between predictors and each urinary phthalate metabolite. Several potential predictors for the variations in specific urinary phthalate metabolites were identified, including the body mass index, age, socioeconomic status, and regional distribution for both women and their male partners but with slightly different patterns. Women with a history of breastfeeding, using bottled water for cooking and storing food in plastic bags had lower MEP (8.7%), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) (9.2%), and both mono-iso-butyl phthalate and MECPP (8.2 and 8.1%). A history of contraceptive use was associated with an increase in MECPP (8.7%), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (11.4%), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (7.6%), and the molar sum of bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (8.9%). Urinary COT levels were associated with an increase of 10-16% in all urinary metabolites in women but of only 10.5% in mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in male partners. More than 95% of the couples reported the use of cosmetics, perfumes, and personal-care products, but we were not able to find associations with urinary phthalate metabolites, perhaps due to their short half-lives. MEP levels associated with the use of household cleaning products were 11.2% higher in male partners. Our levels were generally higher than those reported elsewhere, perhaps due to different lifestyles, cultural practices, dietary habits, use of personal-care products, and governmental legislation.",Type of fixative solution in pitfall traps as a decisive factor affecting community parameters of Collembola (Hexapoda) inhabiting superficial subterranean habitats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041539,Die Naturwissenschaften,2019 05 23,"Vertical distribution of collembolan communities along a depth gradient was studied at three forested karst scree slopes in the Western Carpathians, differing in topography, microclimate, soil-chemical parameters, and forest associations. Two different fixative solutions were used in subterranean pitfall traps. The activity and species richness of Collembola in the vertical scree profiles were significantly higher in traps filled with ethylene glycol than in those filled with formaldehyde at all three sites. Using traps filled with formaldehyde, both Collembola species numbers and activity positively correlated with the soil moisture and carbon content, while for ethylene glycol traps this relation was the same only for species numbers and carbon content. Ecological groups of Collembola showed a different response, distinguished by the level of association to subterranean habitats, to environmental factors and to the fixation liquid used in the subterranean traps. Eutroglophiles, the forms relatively well-adapted to subterranean habitats, were associated with depth exclusively when using ethylene glycol traps. This implies that ethylene glycol is a more suitable preservative in terms of species richness and activity of Collembola in deeper scree layers compared to traditionally used formaldehyde. Thus, the effect of environmental factors on diversity and vertical distribution of Collembola in scree habitats may be substantially superimposed by the type of fixation used in subterranean traps."

Both of these processes require the gateway protein Vps27, which recognizes ubiquitinated cargo proteins at phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-rich membranes as part of a heterodimeric complex coined endosomal sorting complex required for transport 0. The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a nutrient-activated central regulator of cell growth, directly phosphorylates Vps27 to antagonize its function in microautophagy, but whether this also serves to restrain MVB sorting at endosomes is still an open question. Here, we show that TORC1 inhibits both the MVB pathway-driven turnover of the plasma membrane-resident high-affinity methionine permease Mup1 and the inositol transporter Itr1 and the microautophagy-dependent degradation of the vacuolar membrane-associated v-ATPase subunit Vph1. Using a Vps277D variant that mimics the TORC1-phosphorylated state of Vps27, we further show that cargo sorting of Vph1 at the vacuolar membrane, but not of Mup1 and Itr1 at endosomes, is sensitive to the TORC1-controlled modifications of Vps27. Thus, TORC1 specifically modulates microautophagy through phosphorylation of Vps27, but controls MVB sorting through alternative mechanisms.",Evaluation of corneal cross-linking as adjuvant therapy for the management of fungal keratitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041523,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2019 06 13,To evaluate the efficacy of corneal cross-linking (CXL) as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of fungal ulcerative keratitis.,Outcomes after locked plating of displaced patella fractures: a prospective case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041522,International orthopaedics,2019 05 01,"Tension band wiring remains a common treatment for patella fractures, but complication rates are high, with unsatisfactory results.

It has high repeat density in conditions of a large number of active genes. Gray bands represent a significant part of this polytene chromosome. Specific proteins including HP1a, POF, and dSETDB1 establish the epigenetic state of this unique chromatin domain. In order to compare maps of localization of genes, bands, and chromatin types of the fourth chromosome, we performed FISH analysis of 38 probes chosen according to the model of four chromatin types. It allowed clarifying the dot chromosome cytological map consisting of 16 loose gray bands, 11 dense black bands, and 26 interbands. We described the relation between chromatin states and bands. Open aquamarine chromatin mostly corresponds to interbands and it contains 5'UTRs of housekeeping genes. Their coding parts are embedded in gray bands substantially composed of lazurite chromatin of intermediate compaction. Polygenic black bands contain most of dense ruby chromatin, and also some malachite and lazurite. Having an accurate map of the fourth chromosome bands and its correspondence to physical map, we found that DNase I hypersensitivity sites, ORC2 protein, and P-elements are mainly located in open aquamarine chromatin, while element 1360, characteristic of the fourth chromosome, occupies band chromatin types.

Despite it is a very important and common construction material, concrete is very sensitive to crack formation and requires repair. A variety of chemical-based techniques and materials have been developed to repair concrete cracks. Although the use of these chemical-based repair systems are the best commercially available choices, there have also been concerns related to their use. These repair agents suffer from inefficiency and unsustainability. Most of the products are expensive and susceptible to degradation, exhibit poor bonding to the cracked concrete surfaces, and are characterized by different physical properties such as thermal expansion coefficients which are different to that of concrete. Moreover, many of these repair agents contain chemicals that pose environmental and health hazards. Thus, there has been interest in developing concrete crack repair agents that are efficient, long lasting, safe, and benign to the environment and exhibit physical properties which resemble that of the concrete. The search initiated by these desires brought the use of biomineralization processes as tools in mending concrete cracks. Among biomineralization processes, microbially initiated calcite precipitation has emerged as an interesting alternative to the existing chemical-based concrete crack repairing system. Indeed, results of several studies on the use of microbial-based concrete repair agents revealed the remarkable potential of this approach in the fight against concrete deterioration. In addition to repairing existing concrete cracks, microorganisms have also been considered to make protective surface coating (biodeposition) on concrete structures and in making self-healing concrete.Even though a wide variety of microorganisms can precipitate calcite, the nature of concrete determines their applicability. One of the important factors that determine the applicability of microbes in concrete is pH. Concrete is highly alkaline in nature, and hence the microbes envisioned for this application are alkaliphilic or alkali-tolerant. This work reviews the available information on applications of microbes in concrete: repairing existing cracks, biodeposition, and self-healing. Moreover, an effort is made to discuss biomineralization processes that are relevant to extend the durability of concrete structures. Graphical Abstract."

This failure is multi-factorial and caused in part by disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton, in particular microtubules (MT), plays a critical role in axonal transport and axon growth during development. In this regard, members of the kinesin superfamily of proteins (KIFs) regulate the extension of primary axons toward their targets and control the growth of collateral branches. KIF2A negatively regulates axon growth through MT depolymerization. Using three different injury models to induce SCI in adult rats, we examined the temporal and cellular expression of KIF2A in the injured spinal cord. We observed a progressive increase of KIF2A expression with maximal levels at 10Â days to 8Â weeks post-injury as determined by Western blot analysis. KIF2A immunoreactivity was present in axons, spinal neurons and mature oligodendrocytes adjacent to the injury site. Results from the present study suggest that KIF2A at the injured axonal tips may contribute to neurite outgrowth inhibition after injury, and that its increased expression in inhibitory spinal neurons adjacent to the injury site might contribute to an intrinsic wiring-control mechanism associated with neuropathic pain.

In this study, we found that sperm-borne small RNA can affect abnormal pronuclear-like structures, postpone the timing of first embryo cleavage and enhance developmental competence of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. In addition, the supplementation of sperm-borne small RNA can significantly increase live birth rates and decrease the birth weights of cloned offspring. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, the levels of Î±-tubulin K40 acetylation (Ac Î±-tubulin K40) and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) during early embryo development were investigated in SCNT embryos with sperm-borne small RNA supplementation (termed as T-NT), compared to those normal SCNT embryos and embryos obtained from standard IVF. The results showed that sperm-borne small RNA can significantly decrease the H3K9me3 levels at the pronuclear and two-cell stages, while significantly increase Ac Î±-tubulin K40 levels at anaphase and telophase of bovine SCNT embryos during the first cleavage. Collectively, our study for the first time demonstrates that sperm-borne small RNA plays a crucial role in the developmental competence of SCNT embryos by regulating H3K9me3 and Ac Î±-tubulin K40. Further studies will be required to determine how sperm small RNA regulate the H3K9me3 and AcÎ±-tubulin K40. Our study suggests that the supplementation of sperm-borne small RNA is a potential application to improve the cloning efficiency."

To date, a few studies have reported the use of Improvac for immunocastration in boar and one study in broiler chickens; however, there is an apparent dearth of scientific evidence regarding the application of Improvac for immunocastration in birds. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of Improvac-based immunocastration on testosterone levels and spermatogenesis in broiler chickens and the effects of Improvac on the expression of genes related to testosterone biosynthesis and metabolism as well as spermatogenesis. The birds were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 30 each): Control group (non-immunized), Early group (immunized with Improvac at week 3), Late group (immunized with Improvac at week 6), and Early + Late group (immunized with Improvac at weeks 3 and 6). Immunization with Improvac significantly improved the average daily gain compared to the Control group. Of note, following Improvac vaccination, the reproductive efficiency was significantly decreased in male broiler chickens. Furthermore, parameters such as the serum testosterone concentration, spermatogenesis, and the expression levels of genes related to testosterone metabolism (Cyp17A1, Cyp19, HSD3B1, and HSD17B3) and spermatogenesis (Cyclin A1 and Cyclin A2) were significantly reduced in the immunized groups compared to the Control group. Taken together, these findings reveal that immunization against GnRH can be achieved, at least partially, in male broiler chickens. The results of our study also support the hypothesis of using Improvac as an alternative solution to caponization, with considerably improved animal welfare.",Salmonella recovery from chicken bone marrow and cecal counts differ by pathogen challenge method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041438,Poultry science,2019 05 01,"Mechanically separated chicken (MSC) may be incorporated into other further processed foods, and has been identified as a transmission vehicle in human foodborne disease outbreaks involving the pathogen Salmonella enterica. Chickens possess pneumatic bones producing marrow, which may become infected with Salmonella and present a mechanism for Salmonella contamination of MSC. The primary objective of the current study was to ascertain whether chicken bone marrow was susceptible to Salmonella infection as a function of pathogen challenge method. Additionally, this study sought to determine the impact of Salmonella challenge site and inoculation on subsequent numbers of the microorganism in the cecum at 3, 6 and 9 d post-challenge. In this study, 30-day-old birds (Gallus domesticus) were separately challenged with S. enterica by one of the 6 experimental treatment methods: oral or endo-tracheal gavage, and transdermal scratch challenge on the breast or back muscles, with or without feathers (N = 150). Differing Salmonella recovery rates were detected in bone marrow from euthanized birds (P = 0.0015); oral and endo-tracheal gavage produced Salmonella recovery frequencies of 10% and 20%, respectively. Counts of Salmonella from chicken cecal samples statistically differed as a function of challenge method (P = 0.032); the highest numbers of Salmonella in cecal samples were obtained from orally gavaged birds (3.0 log10 cfu/g). Study results demonstrate the potential for chickens to contract short-term systemic infection following Salmonella challenge using methods of pathogen challenge simulating aerosol inhalation, ingestion, or wounding. Salmonella entry into chicken bone marrow may result in decreased likelihood of Salmonella performance standard compliance and increased pathogen transmission risk to consumers.",Anti-inflammatory effect of preserved egg with simulated gastrointestinal digestion on lps-stimulated RAW264.7 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041437,Poultry science,2019 05 01,"Preserved egg, a traditional Chinese egg product, is regarded as an anti-inflammatory food in traditional Chinese medicine. This study was aimed to examine anti-inflammatory effect of the simulated gastrointestinal digestive products of whole preserved egg (DWPE), preserved egg white (DPEW), and preserved egg yolk (DPEY) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The results demonstrated that DWPE, DPEW, or DPEY inhibited the LPS-induced secretion of Nitric oxide (NO), without marked cytotoxicity. The DWPE, DPEW, and DPEY significantly suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interleukin (IL)-6. Particularly, the inhibition rate of DPEW on NO, IL-6, and TNF-Î± could reach 25 to 27%, 31 to 42%, and 26 to 38%, respectively (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the DPEW and DPEY downregulated the gene expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, this study indicated that DWPE, DPEW, and DPEY, especially DPEW, might serve as functional food for anti-inflammatory therapy.",Pattern selection when a layer buckles on a soft substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041435,Soft matter,2019 05 09,"If a neo-Hookean elastic layer adhered to a neo-Hookean substrate grows equibiaxially, it will buckle into a topographic pattern. Here, we combine higher order perturbation theory and finite element numerics to predict the pattern formed just beyond the buckling threshold. More precisely, we construct a series of solutions corresponding to hexagonal, square and stripe patterns, and expand the elastic energy for each pattern as a Landau-like energy series in the topography amplitude. We see that, for square and stripe patterns, the elastic energy is invariant under topography inversion, making the instabilities supercritical. However, since patterns of hexagonal dents are physically different to patterns of hexagonal bumps, the hexagonal energy lacks this invariance. This lack introduces a cubic term which causes hexagonal patterns to be formed subcritically and are hence energetically favoured. Our analytic calculation of the cubic term allows us to determine that dents are favoured in incompressible systems, but bumps are favored in sufficiently compressible systems. Finally, we consider a stiff layer sandwiched between an identical substrate and superstrate pair. This system has topography inversion symmetry, so hexagons form supercritically, and square patterns are favoured. We use finite element calculations to verify our theoretical predictions for each pattern, and confirm which pattern is selected. Previous work has used a simplified elastic model (a plate & a linear elastic substrate) that possesses invariance under topography inversion, and hence incorrectly predicted square patterns. Our work demonstrates that large strain geometry is sufficient to break this symmetry and explain the hexagonal dent patterns observed in buckling experiments.",A microwell array platform to print and measure biomolecules produced by single cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041434,Lab on a chip,2019 05 16,"Here we describe a combined method to monitor the secretion of molecules produced by single cells, followed by a method to isolate the individual cells that produced these molecules. The method is based on a self-sorting microwell chip that is connected to an activated membrane that collects the produced molecules. The produced molecules are printed by diffusion in small spots onto the membrane. The location of the printed spots can be correlated to the microwell number and the cell that produced these molecules. To demonstrate the method, we used the EpCAM antibody producing hybridoma cell line VU1D9 and a genetically engineered CHO cell-line producing Her2. VU1D9 cells produced 4.6 Â± 5.6 pg (mean Â± SD) of EpCAM antibody per 24 h and CHO cells 6.5 Â± 8.2 pg per 24 h of Herceptin antibody.","Using van der Waals heterostructures based on two-dimensional blue phosphorus and XC (X = Ge, Si) for water-splitting photocatalysis: a first-principles study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041433,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 05 16,"Solar-powered production of hydrogen from water has been pursued as one of the solutions to the global energy crisis. Meanwhile, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention as photocatalysts. In this paper, the geometric structures, electronic band structures, band alignment, and optical properties of two novel van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on 2D blue phosphorus (BlueP) and 2D XC (X = Ge, Si) were systematically explored using first-principles calculations. We found that both BlueP/GeC and BlueP/SiC vdW heterostructures possess type-II band structures, which can continuously separate the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The calculated band-edge positions suggest that the BlueP/SiC and BlueP/GeC vdW heterostructures act as potential photocatalysts for water-splitting at pH 0 and pH 7, respectively. Furthermore, XC acts as an electron-donating layer in the BlueP/XC vdW heterostructure, and the potential drop across the interface can generate a large built-in electric field across the interface; this electric field plays a crucial role in preventing the recombination of photogenerated charges. Finally, the optical properties of the BlueP/XC vdW heterostructures demonstrate that they have excellent ability to capture visible light, making them promising high-performance photocatalysts for water splitting.",Probing membrane enhanced protein-protein interactions in a minimal redox complex of cytochrome-P450 and P450-reductase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041432,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 16,Investigating the interplay in a minimal redox complex of cytochrome-P450 and its reductase is crucial for understanding cytochrome-P450's enzymatic activity.

IEEE International Conference on Big Data. IEEE International Conference on Big Data,2019 05 04,"Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification method for the analysis of wide range of data including big data. Many SVM methods with feature selection have been developed under frequentist regularization or Bayesian shrinkage frameworks. On the other hand, the importance of incorporating a priori known biological knowledge, such as gene pathway information which stems from the gene regulatory network, into the statistical analysis of genomic data has been recognized in recent years. In this article, we propose a new Bayesian SVM approach that enables the feature selection to be guided by the knowledge on the graphical structure among predictors. The proposed method uses the spike-and-slab prior for feature selection, combined with the Ising prior that encourages group-wise selection of the predictors adjacent to each other on the known graph. Gibbs sampling algorithm is used for Bayesian inference. The performance of our method is evaluated and compared with existing SVM methods in terms of prediction and feature selection in extensive simulation settings. In addition, our method is illustrated in the analysis of genomic data from a cancer study, demonstrating its advantage in generating biologically meaningful results and identifying potentially important features.",Ki-67 Evaluation for Clinical Decision in Metastatic Lung Carcinoids: A Proof of Concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041430,"Clinical pathology (Thousand Oaks, Ventura County, Calif.)",2019 05 03,"Accrual of metastatic pulmonary carcinoid patients for therapy is usually relied on clinical and histologic characterization, with no role for the proliferation activity as defined by Ki-67 labelling index (LI). A total of 14 carcinoid patients with tumour primaries (TP) and 19 corresponding tumour metastases (TM) were blindly reviewed by 2 different pathologists for necrosis, mitotic count, and Ki-67 LI. Ki-67 LI outperformed histologic subtyping, mitotic count, and necrosis with good to almost excellent (0.40-0.75) inter-observer agreement. About 10% cut-off Ki-67 LI predicted survival better than histology for TP and TM for both observers. The TM patients survived differently according to diverse treatments (somatostatin analogues [SSAs], analogues plus additional treatments except for platinum; platinum-based chemotherapy) in close correlation with <10%, 10% to 20%, and >20% cut-off thresholds of Ki-67 LI, respectively. There was also a trend for an increase in Ki-67 LI in TM as compared with TP.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated genotype-phenotype associations and prevalence of MKRN3 mutations in CPP. The search was conducted in seven electronic databases (Cochrane, EMBASE, LILACS, LIVIVO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for articles published until 4 September 2018. Studies evaluating MKRN3 mutations in patients with CPP were considered eligible. A total of 22 studies, studying 880 subjects with CPP, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eighty-nine subjects (76 girls) were identified as harboring MKRN3 mutations. Girls, compared with boys, exhibited earlier age at pubertal onset (median, 6.0 years; range, 3.0 to 7.0 vs 8.5 years; range, 5.9 to 9.0; P < 0.001), and higher basal FSH levels (median, 4.3 IU/L; range, 0.7 to 13.94 IU/L vs 2.45 IU/L; range, 0.8 to 13.70 IU/L; P = 0.003), and bone age advancement (Î”BA; median, 2.3 years; range, -0.9 to 5.2 vs 1.2 years; range, 0.0 to 2.3; P = 0.01). Additional dysmorphisms were uncommon. A total of 14 studies evaluating 857 patients were included for quantitative analysis, with a pooled overall mutation prevalence of 9.0% (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.15). Subgroup analysis showed that prevalence estimates were higher in males, familial cases, and in non-Asian countries. In conclusion, MKRN3 mutations are associated with nonsyndromic CPP and manifest in a sex-dimorphic manner, with girls being affected earlier. They represent a common cause of CPP in western countries, especially in boys and familial cases."

He travelled to the Middle East in order to study the epidemiology of the plague and carried out experiments aimed at discovering a cure and a prophylaxis for rabies, succeeding in attenuating the rabies virus by inoculating a mixture of saliva from rabid dogs and gastric juice from frogs. Having travelled to Spain and then to Cuba, where he undertook the study of yellow fever, he died in Havana in September 1816, after injecting attenuated germs of the disease into his own body.

The influenza pandemic of 1918 killed more than 50 million people worldwide. In addition, its socioeconomic consequences were huge. ""Spanish flu"", as the infection was dubbed, hit different age-groups, displaying a so-called ""W-trend"", typically with two spikes in children and the elderly. However, healthy young adults were also affected. In order to avoid alarming the public, several local health authorities refused to reveal the numbers of people affected and deaths. Consequently, it was very difficult to assess the impact of the disease at the time. Although official communications issued by health authorities worldwide expressed certainty about the etiology of the infection, in laboratories it was not always possible to isolate the famous Pfeiffer's bacillus, which was, at that time, deemed to be the cause of influenza. The first official preventive actions were implemented in August 1918; these included the obligatory notification of suspected cases and the surveillance of communities such as day-schools, boarding schools and barracks. Identifying suspected cases through surveillance, and voluntary and/or mandatory quarantine or isolation, enabled the spread of Spanish flu to be curbed. At that time, these public health measures were the only effective weapons against the disease, as no vaccines or antivirals were available. Virological and bacteriological analysis of preserved samples from infected soldiers and other young people who died during the pandemic period is a major step toward a better understanding of this pandemic and of how to prepare for future pandemics.",Training to improve resilience and coping to monitor PTSD in rescue workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041412,Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2019 05 03,"Few studies focus on the role training has on rescue workers who are active as volunteers or actual workers in emergency situations such as an earthquake.

The responses of this reagent to systemic changes in labile iron disposition were revealed using iron supplementation and sequestration treatments in mice, while the potential of this approach for in vivo imaging of cancer was demonstrated using genetically and pathologically diverse mouse models, including spontaneous tumors arising in a genetically engineered model of prostate cancer driven by loss of PTEN.",Amidoxime-Functionalized Macroporous Carbon Self-Refreshed Electrode Materials for Rapid and High-Capacity Removal of Heavy Metal from Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041392,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Heavy metal pollution continues to be one of the most serious environmental problems which has attracted major global concern. Here, a rapid, high-capacity, yet economical strategy for deep cleaning of heavy metals ions in water is reported based on amidoxime-functionalized macroporous carbon electrode materials. The active sites of our material can be self-refreshed during the electrochemical removal process, which is different from traditional methods. The novel filter device in this work can purify contaminated water very rapidly (3000 L h-1 m-2), and can decrease heavy metal ion concentrations to below 5 ppb with a very short contact time (only 3 s). The original treatment efficiency of the device can be retained even after 1 week of continuous device operation. An extremely high removal capacity of over 2300 mg g-1 can be achieved with 2-3 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than that of surface adsorption-based commercial filters without any decay. Additionally, the cost of energy consumed in our method is lower than $6.67 Ã— 10-3 per ton of wastewater. We envision that this approach can be routinely applied for the rapid, efficient, and thorough removal of heavy metals from both point-of-use water and industrial wastewater.",Designing Electrostatic Interactions via Polyelectrolyte Monomer Sequence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041391,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Charged polymers are ubiquitous in biological systems because electrostatic interactions can drive complicated structure formation and respond to environmental parameters such as ionic strength and pH. In these systems, function emerges from sophisticated molecular design; for example, intrinsically disordered proteins leverage specific sequences of monomeric charges to control the formation and function of intracellular compartments known as membraneless organelles. The role of a charged monomer sequence in dictating the strength of electrostatic interactions remains poorly understood despite extensive evidence that sequence is a powerful tool biology uses to tune soft materials. In this article, we use a combination of theory, experiment, and simulation to establish the physical principles governing sequence-driven control of electrostatic interactions. We predict how arbitrary sequences of charge give rise to drastic changes in electrostatic interactions and correspondingly phase behavior. We generalize a transfer matrix formalism that describes a phase separation phenomenon known as ""complex coacervation"" and provide a theoretical framework to predict the phase behavior of charge sequences. This work thus provides insights into both how charge sequence is used in biology and how it could be used to engineer properties of synthetic polymer systems.",Rapid Prediction of Electron-Ionization Mass Spectrometry Using Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041390,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"When confronted with a substance of unknown identity, researchers often perform mass spectrometry on the sample and compare the observed spectrum to a library of previously collected spectra to identify the molecule. While popular, this approach will fail to identify molecules that are not in the existing library. In response, we propose to improve the library's coverage by augmenting it with synthetic spectra that are predicted from candidate molecules using machine learning. We contribute a lightweight neural network model that quickly predicts mass spectra for small molecules, averaging 5 ms per molecule with a recall-at-10 accuracy of 91.8%. Achieving high-accuracy predictions requires a novel neural network architecture that is designed to capture typical fragmentation patterns from electron ionization. We analyze the effects of our modeling innovations on library matching performance and compare our models to prior machine-learning-based work on spectrum prediction.",Self-Assembly of Charge-Containing Copolymers at the Liquid-Liquid Interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041389,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Quantitatively understanding the self-assembly of amphiphilic macromolecules at liquid-liquid interfaces is a fundamental scientific concern due to its relevance to a broad range of applications including bottom-up nanopatterning, protein encapsulation, oil recovery, drug delivery, and other technologies. Elucidating the mechanisms that drive assembly of amphiphilic macromolecules at liquid-liquid interfaces is challenging due to the combination of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and Coulomb interactions, which require consideration of the dielectric mismatch, solvation effects, ionic correlations, and entropic factors. Here we investigate the self-assembly of a model block copolymer with various charge fractions at the chloroform-water interface. We analyze the adsorption and conformation of poly(styrene)-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) and of the homopolymer poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) with varying charge fraction, which is controlled via a quaternization reaction and distributed randomly along the backbone. Interfacial tension measurements show that the polymer adsorption increases only marginally at low charge fractions (<5%) but increases more significantly at higher charge fractions for the copolymer, while the corresponding randomly charged P2VP homopolymer analogues display much more sensitivity to the presence of charged groups. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the experimental systems reveal that the diblock copolymer (PS-b-P2VP) interfacial activity could be mediated by the formation of a rich set of complex interfacial copolymer aggregates. Circular domains to elongated stripes are observed in the simulations at the water-chloroform interface as the charge fraction increases. These structures are shown to resemble the spherical and cylindrical helicoid structures observed in bulk chloroform as the charge fraction increases. The self-assembly of charge-containing copolymers is found to be driven by the association of the charged component in the hydrophilic block, with the hydrophobic segments extending away from the hydrophilic cores into the chloroform phase.","Unveiling a Novel, Cation-Rich Compound in a High-Pressure Pb-Te Binary System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041388,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Because of the common oxidation states of group IV elements (+2 or +4) and group VI elements (-2), 1:1 and 1:2 are two typical stoichiometries found in the IV-VI compounds. Particularly, in the Pb-Te binary system, the 1:1 stoichiometric PbTe is believed to be the only stable compound. Herein, using evolutionary algorithms, density functional theory, a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments, we discovered a novel Pb-Te compound with an unexpected stoichiometry of 3:2 above 20 GPa. This tetragonal Pb3Te2 is the one of the very few cation-rich compounds that has ever been discovered in the entire IV-VI binary system. Further analyses based on electron density distribution, electron localization function, and Bader charge have shown that this newly discovered compound has a mixed character of chemical bonding with a decreased ionicity. By further calculating the electron-phonon interaction, Pb3Te2 is predicted to exhibit a superconducting transition at low temperatures. The discovery of Pb3Te2 paves the way for further explorations of other novel cation-rich IV-VI group compounds.",Electron Transfer Control of Reductase versus Monooxygenase: Catalytic C-H Bond Hydroxylation and Alkene Epoxidation by Molecular Oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041387,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Catalytic oxidation of organic substrates, using a green oxidant like O2, has been a long-term goal of the scientific community. In nature, these oxidations are performed by metalloenzymes that generate highly oxidizing species from O2, which, in turn, can oxidize very stable organic substrates, e.g., mono-/dioxygenases. The same oxidants are produced during O2 reduction/respiration in the mitochondria but are reduced by electron transfer, i.e., reductases. Iron porphyrin mimics of the active site of cytochrome P450 (Cyt P450) are created atop a self-assembled monolayer covered electrode. The rate of electron transfer from the electrode to the iron porphyrin site is attenuated to derive monooxygenase reactivity from these constructs that otherwise show O2 reductase activity. Catalytic hydroxylation of strong C-H bonds to alcohol and epoxidation of alkenes, using molecular O2 (with 18O2 incorporation), is demonstrated with turnover numbers >104. Uniquely, one of the two iron porphyrin catalysts used shows preferential oxidation of 2Â° C-H bonds of cycloalkanes to alcohols over 3Â° C-H bonds without overoxidation to ketones. Mechanistic investigations with labeled substrates indicate that a compound I (FeIV=O bound to a porphyrin cation radical) analogue, formed during O2 reduction, is the primary oxidant. The selectivity is determined by the shape of the distal pocket of the catalyst, which, in turn, is determined by the substituents on the periphery of the porphyrin macrocycle.",A Chemical Genetic Method for Monitoring Genome-Wide Dynamics of O-GlcNAc Turnover on Chromatin-Associated Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041386,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"Advances in DNA sequencing are enabling new experimental modalities for studying chromatin. One emerging area is to use high-throughput DNA sequencing to monitor dynamic changes occurring to chromatin. O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a reversible protein modification found on many chromatin-associated proteins. The mechanisms by which O-GlcNAc regulates gene transcription are of high interest. Here we use DNA precipitation methods to enable monitoring time-dependent turnover of O-GlcNAc modified proteins associated with chromatin. Using an antibody-free chemical reporter strategy to map O-GlcNAc to the genome, we performed time course metabolic feeding experiments with wild-type Drosophila larvae alongside larvae lacking O-GlcNAc hydrolase (OGA), which are accordingly unable to remove O-GlcNAc. Analysis of resulting next-generation DNA sequencing data revealed that O-GlcNAc on chromatin-associated proteins at most genomic loci is processed with a half-life in hours. Notably, loss of OGA only increases this half-life by âˆ¼3-fold. Interestingly, a small set of genomic loci are particularly sensitive to loss of OGA. In addition to these observations and new strategies to permit monitoring turnover of O-GlcNAc on chromatin, we also detail methods for coded blinding of samples alongside new normalization strategies to enable time-resolved, genome-wide analyses using chemical genetic methods. We envision these general methods will be applicable to diverse protein and nucleic acid modifications.",Deciphering Off-Target Effects in CRISPR-Cas9 through Accelerated Molecular Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041385,ACS central science,2019 05 03,"CRISPR-Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology for editing and manipulating nucleic acids. However, the occurrence of off-target mutations can limit its applicability. Here, all-atom enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-using Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD)-are used to decipher the mechanism of off-target binding at the molecular level. GaMD reveals that base pair mismatches in the target DNA at distal sites with respect to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) can induce an extended opening of the RNA:DNA heteroduplex, which leads to newly formed interactions between the unwound DNA and the L2 loop of the catalytic HNH domain. These conserved interactions constitute a ""lock"" effectively decreasing the conformational freedom of the HNH domain and hampering its activation for cleavage. Remarkably, depending on their positions at PAM distal sites, DNA mismatches responsible for off-target cleavages are unable to ""lock"" the HNH domain, thereby leading to the unselective cleavage of DNA sequences. In consistency with the available experimental data, the ability to ""lock"" the catalytic HNH domain in an inactive ""conformational checkpoint"" is shown to be a key determinant in the onset of off-target effects. This mechanistic rationale contributes in clarifying a long lasting open issue in the CRISPR-Cas9 function and poses the foundation for designing novel and more specific Cas9 variants, which could be obtained by magnifying the ""locking"" interactions between HNH and the target DNA in the presence of any incorrect off-target sequence, thus preventing undesired cleavages."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unilateral placement of a multi-hole FCSEMS (FCSEMS-MH), which had a 2.5-mm hole in the center of the membrane on each cavity, in a swine model of hilar biliary stricture. Materials and methodsâ€‚ Six female mini pigs were included in this prospective study. The hilar biliary stricture model was prepared using an endobiliary radiofrequency ablation. FCSEMS-MHs were endoscopically inserted into the peri-hilar bile duct of all the animals. Outcomes were assessed in terms of adverse events (AEs) including cholangitis, stent patency, stent migration, and endoscopic stent removability for 1 month after stenting. Resultsâ€‚ In terms of hilar biliary stricture types, two animals were of Bismuth type I and four were of type II. Technical success rate for endoscopic metal stenting was 100â€Š% (6/6), and the functional success rate, which was evaluated 7 days after stent insertion, was also 100â€Š% (5/5).

However, prolonged absorption of air during endoscopic examinations may cause pain and abdominal distension. Carbon dioxide insufflation (CO 2 i) has been increasingly used as an alternative to ambient air insufflation (AAi) in many endoscopic procedures due to its fast diffusion properties and less abdominal distention and pain. For endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), use of CO 2 for insufflation is adequate because this procedure is complex and prolonged. Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the efficacy and safety of CO 2 as an insufflation method during ERCP but presented conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis with only RCTs evaluated the efficacy and safety of CO 2 i versus AAi during ERCP. Methods â€‚A literature search was performed using online databases with no restriction regarding idiom or year of publication. Data were extracted by two authors according to a predefined data extraction form. Outcomes evaluated were abdominal pain and distension, complications, procedure duration, and CO 2 levels. Results â€‚Eight studies (919 patients) were included. Significant results favoring CO 2 i were less abdominal distension after 1â€Šh (MD: -1.41 [-1.81; -1.0], 95â€Š% CI, IÂ²â€Š=â€Š15â€Š%, P â€Š<â€Š0.00001) and less abdominal pain after 1â€Šh (MD: -23.80 [-27.50; -20.10], 95â€Š%CI, IÂ²â€Š=â€Š9â€Š%, P â€Š<â€Š0.00001) and after 6â€Šh (MD: -7.00 [-8.66; -5.33]; 95â€Š% CI, IÂ²â€Š=â€Š0â€Š%, P â€Š<â€Š0.00001).

Pediatric femoral supracondylar fractures are difficult to reduce by either closed or open reduction. The abnormal muscle forces around the knee tend to significantly displace the distal short metaphyseal fragment. We describe a novel technique utilizing the combination of a temporarily intraoperative external fixation in order to achieve and maintain the reduction followed by internal fixation. Method. Three male patients younger than 16 years of age were operated in our department. The fractures were defined as pathological in 2 patients. In order to facilitate and maintain fracture reduction, an external fixator was temporarily used intraoperatively; once the fractures were internally fixed, the fixator was removed. Results. Anatomical reduction was achieved in all patients. In an average follow-up of 2 years, all the fractures are solidly healed and the various bone lesions are healing. All patients have returned to regular physical activity. Conclusion. Difficult supracondylar femur fractures in children are easier to manipulate and reduce with the assistance of an intraoperative external fixator. Once the fracture is internally fixed and stable, the external fixator is removed.",Inception of electronic damage of matter by photon-driven post-ionization mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041363,"Structural dynamics (Melville, N.Y.)",2019 05 03,"""Probe-before-destroy"" methodology permitted diffraction and imaging measurements of intact specimens using ultrabright but highly destructive X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. The methodology takes advantage of XFEL pulses ultrashort duration to outrun the destructive nature of the X-rays. Atomic movement, generally on the order of >50 fs, regulates the maximum pulse duration for intact specimen measurements. In this contribution, we report the electronic structure damage of a molecule with ultrashort X-ray pulses under preservation of the atoms' positions. A detailed investigation of the X-ray induced processes revealed that X-ray absorption events in the solvent produce a significant number of solvated electrons within attosecond and femtosecond timescales that are capable of coulombic interactions with the probed molecules. The presented findings show a strong influence on the experimental spectra coming from ionization of the probed atoms' surroundings leading to electronic structure modification much faster than direct absorption of photons. This work calls for consideration of this phenomenon in cases focused on samples embedded in, e.g., solutions or in matrices, which in fact concerns most of the experimental studies.",Structural and dynamical description of the enzymatic reaction of a phosphohexomutase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041362,"Structural dynamics (Melville, N.Y.)",2019 05 04,"Enzymes are known to adopt various conformations at different points along their catalytic cycles.

Key residues in ligand recognition and regions undergoing conformational change are identified and correlated with the various steps of the catalytic reaction. In addition, we use principal component analysis to examine various subsets of these structures with two goals: (1) identifying sites of conformational heterogeneity through a comparison of room temperature and cryogenic structures of the apo-enzyme and (2) a priori clustering of the enzyme-ligand complexes into functionally related groups, showing sensitivity of this method to structural features difficult to detect by traditional methods.

Using femtosecond small-angle electron diffraction, we observe the temporal evolution of the diffraction feature associated with the nearest-neighbor nanoparticle distance. The Debye-Waller decay for the octanethiol-capped nanoparticle supracrystal, in particular, is found to be unexpectedly fast, almost as fast as the stiffest solid known and observed by the same technique, i.e., graphite.

While assessments of plasma drug levels can explain pharmacokinetic variability among trial participants, these measures require phlebotomy and a cold chain, and are generally not repeated frequently enough to characterise drug exposure over time.

Since that time, it has been necessary to collate and review information on its uptake and general efficacy to inform its ongoing development and that of other emerging tracking technologies. We present here technical specifications and the surgical procedure used to implant miniaturized radio transmitters, as well as a formal testing procedure for measuring detectable transmission distances of implanted devices. Feedback from IRT practitioners (veterinarians and field managers) was gathered through questionnaires and is also presented. To date, IRT has been used in at least 250 individual animals (mainly orangutans) from four species of ape in both Asia and Africa. Median surgical and wound healing times were 30 min and 15 days, respectively, with implants needing to be removed on at least 36 separate occasions. Confirmed failures within the first year of operation were 18.1%, while longer distances were reported from positions of higher elevation relative to the focal animal. IRT has been a transformational technology in facilitating the relocation of apes after their release, resulting in much larger amounts of post-release data collection than ever before. It is crucial however, that implant casings are strengthened to prevent the requirement for recapture and removal surgeries, especially for gradually adapting apes. As with all emerging technological solutions, IRT carries with it inherent risk, especially so due to the requirement for subcutaneous implantation. These risks must, however, be balanced with the realities of releasing an animal with no means of relocation, as has historically been, and is still, the case with orangutans and gorillas.",Standardization of Human Calcific Aortic Valve Disease in vitro Modeling Reveals Passage-Dependent Calcification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041314,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 05 04,"Aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from patients undergoing valve replacement are commonly used as in vitro models of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Standardization of VIC calcification, however, has not been implemented, which impairs comparison of results from different studies. We hypothesized that different culture methods impact the calcification phenotype of human VICs. We sought to identify the key parameters impacting calcification in primary human VICs to standardize CAVD in vitro research. Here we report that in calcification media containing organic phosphate, termed osteogenic media (OM), primary human VICs exhibited a passage-dependent decrease in calcification potential, which was not observed in calcification media containing inorganic phosphate, termed pro-calcifying media (PM). We used Alizarin red staining to compare the calcification potential of VICs cultured in OM and PM between the first and fourth passages after cell isolation from human CAVD tissues. Human VICs showed consistent Alizarin red stain when cultured with PM in a passage-independent manner. VICs cultured in OM did not exhibit consistent calcification potential between donors in early passages and consistently lacked positive Alizarin red stain in late passages. We performed whole cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation proteomics to identify factors regulating VIC passage-dependent calcification in OM. Proteomics cluster analysis identified tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) as a regulator of passage-dependent calcification in OM. We verified an association of TNAP activity with calcification potential in VICs cultured in OM, but not in PM in which VICs calcified independent of TNAP activity. This study demonstrates that media culture conditions and cell passage impact the calcification potential of primary human VICs and should be taken into consideration in cell culture models of CAVD. Our results help standardize CAVD modeling as part of a greater effort to identify disease driving mechanisms and therapeutics for this unmet medical need.",Treatment of Infections Due to MDR Gram-Negative Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041313,Frontiers in medicine,2019 05 03,"The treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) infections in critically ill patients presents many challenges. Since an effective treatment should be administered as soon as possible, resistance to many antimicrobial classes almost invariably reduces the probability of adequate empirical coverage, with possible unfavorable consequences. In this light, readily available patient's medical history and updated information about the local microbiological epidemiology remain critical for defining the baseline risk of MDR-GNB infections and firmly guiding empirical treatment choices, with the aim of avoiding both undertreatment and overtreatment. Rapid diagnostics and efficient laboratory workflows are also of paramount importance both for anticipating diagnosis and for rapidly narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum, with de-escalation purposes and in line with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are being reported with increasing frequencies worldwide, although with important variability across regions, hospitals and even single wards. In the past few years, new treatment options, such as ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, plazomicin, and eravacycline have become available, and others will become soon, which have provided some much-awaited resources for effectively counteracting severe infections due to these organisms. However, their optimal use should be guaranteed in the long term, for delaying as much as possible the emergence and diffusion of resistance to novel agents. Despite important progresses, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization of dosages and treatment duration in critically ill patients has still some areas of uncertainty requiring further study, that should take into account also resistance selection as a major endpoint. Treatment of severe MDR-GNB infections in critically ill patients in the near future will require an expert and complex clinical reasoning, of course taking into account the peculiar characteristics of the target population, but also the need for adequate empirical coverage and the more and more specific enzyme-level activity of novel antimicrobials with respect to the different resistance mechanisms of MDR-GNB.",Multilayer Density Analysis of Cellulose Thin Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041311,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 05 03,"An approach for the multilayer density analysis of polysaccharide thin films at the example of cellulose is presented. In detail, a model was developed for the evaluation of the density in different layers across the thickness direction of the film. The cellulose thin film was split into a so called ""roughness layer"" present at the surface and a ""bulk layer"" attached to the substrate surface. For this approach, a combination of multi-parameter surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to detect changes in the properties, such as cellulose content and density, thickness and refractive index, of the surface near layer and the bulk layer. The surface region of the films featured a much lower density than the bulk. Further, these results correlate to X-ray reflectivity studies, indicating a similar layered structure with reduced density at the surface near regions. The proposed method provides an approach to analyse density variations in thin films which can be used to study material properties and swelling behavior in different layers of the films. Limitations and challenges of the multilayer model evaluation method of cellulose thin films were discussed. This particularly involves the selection of the starting values for iteration of the layer thickness of the top layer, which was overcome by incorporation of AFM data in this study.",Non-adiabatic Quantum Dynamics of the Dissociative Charge Transfer He++H2 â†’ He+H+H.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041310,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 05 03,"We present the non-adiabatic, conical-intersection quantum dynamics of the title collision where reactants and products are in the ground electronic states.

 and their electronic coupling, a coupled-channel time-dependent real wavepacket method, and a flux analysis. Both probabilities and cross sections present a few groups of resonances at low Ecoll, whose amplitudes decrease with the energy, due to an ion-induced dipole interaction in the entrance channel. At higher Ecoll, reaction probabilities and cross sections increase monotonically up to 3 eV, remaining however quite small. When H2 is in the v0 = 1 state, the reactivity increases by ~2 orders of magnitude at the lowest energies and by ~1 order at the highest ones. Initial-state resolved rate constants at room temperature are equal to 1.74 Ã— 10-14 and to 1.98 Ã— 10-12 cm3s-1 at v0 = 0 and 1, respectively.

Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1- and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (Î¼M concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52-expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein-and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.",A New 3D 10-Connected Cd(II) Based MOF With Mixed Ligands: A Dual Photoluminescent Sensor for Nitroaroamatics and Ferric Ion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041308,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 05 03,"The precise unification of functional groups and photoluminescence properties can give rise to MOFs that can offer diverse applications like selective detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) which are considered to be an important ingredient of explosive as well as cation and anion sensing. Hence, a new 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) [Cd2(btc)(bib)(HCOO)(H2O)Â·H2O]n (1) has been synthesized using mixed ligand strategy by solvothermal reaction of cadmium acetate with two ligands viz. 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3btc) and 1,4-bis(2-methyl-imidazol-1-yl)butane (bib). The MOF 1 possesses highly 10-connected network which is based on {Cd4(btc)2(bib)4} molecular building block. The studies showed that 1 could be taken as the fluorescent sensor for sensitive recognition of NACs, in particular 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) with notable quenching (Ksv = 5.42 Ã— 104 M-1) and LOD of 1.77 ppm. Additionally, 1 also displayed selective sensing for Fe3+ ions with Ksv = 6.05 Ã— 103 M- 1 and LOD = 1.56 ppm. Also, this dual sensor displayed excellent reusability toward the detection of TNP and Fe3+ ion. Theoretical calculations have been performed to propose the probable mechanism for the sensing luminescence intensity. Calculations indicated that because of the charge transfer and weak interaction that is operating between NACs and MOF, the weakening in the photoluminescence intensity resulted.","Nanocrystalline Electrodeposited Fe-W/Al2O3 Composites: Effect of Alumina Sub-microparticles on the Mechanical, Tribological, and Corrosion Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041307,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 05 03,"In this study, nanocrystalline Fe-W alloy and Fe-W/Al2O3 composite coatings with various contents of sub-microsized alumina particles have been obtained by electrodeposition from an environmentally friendly Fe(III)-based electrolyte with the aim to produce a novel corrosion and wear resistant material. The increase in volume fraction of Al2O3 in deposits from 2 to 12% leads to the grain refinement effect, so that the structure of the coatings change from nanocrystalline to amorphous-like with grain sizes below 20 nm. Nevertheless, the addition of particles to the Fe-W matrix does not prevent the development of a columnar structure revealed for all the types of studied coatings. The observed reduction in both hardness and elastic modulus of the Fe-W/Al2O3 composites is attributed to the apparent grain size refinement/amorphization and the nanoporosity surrounding the embedded Al2O3 particles. In the presence of 12 vol% of Al2O3 in deposits, the wear rate decreases by a factor of 10 as compared to Fe-W alloy tested under dry friction conditions due to the lowering of tribo-oxidation. The addition of alumina particles slightly increases the corrosion resistance of the coatings; however, the corrosion in neutral chloride solution occurs through the preferential dissolution of Fe from the matrix. The obtained results provide a possibility to integrate the nanocrystalline Fe-W/Al2O3 composite coatings into various systems working under dry friction conditions, for example, in high-temperature vacuum systems."

The assessment of knowledge and behavior related to sodium that is consumed in the form of salt plays an important role in the control of cardiovascular diseases. To control the intake of sodium, dietary sources of sodium need to be identified. To address this, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women aged 20 to 59 years in north India, where knowledge, attitude, and behavior questionnaire given by the World Health Organization and 24-h dietary recall were used. The mean age of the participants was 34.5 years, and the majority of them were homemakers. Approximately, 80% of the participants believed that high salt diet causes serious health problems, and only 5% of the participants were aware of the existence of a recommendation for daily salt intake. Less than 20% of the participants took measures to control their salt intake. Vegetable-based dishes were found to be the major contributors to the daily salt intake followed by pulse-based and cereal-based dishes. This is because of the high quantity in which they are consumed. Food cooked at home contributed to 90% of the daily salt intake. To control the salt intake, we should cut- down the discretionary salt use. Dietary advice should be customized to the individual, and the family physician plays an important role in this.

The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been validated in T1-2 N1 breast cancer to be prognostic of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and overall survival (OS). This study aims to evaluate the predict value of 21-gene recurrence score assay for the benefit of PMRT in T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Methods: A population-based cohort study was performed on women with T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and were evaluated using the 21-gene RS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry between 2004 and 2015. Clinical characteristics as well as OS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were compared between patients with and without PMRT in patients with a Low-, Intermediate-, and High-RS. Multivariate COX regression analysis was performed to investigate if the 21-gene RS assay could predict benefit of PMRT in this group of breast cancer patients. Results: A total of 1571 patients met the criteria of our study and were enrolled, including 970 patients in the Low-Risk group (score <18), 508 in the Intermediate-Risk group (score 18-30), and 93 patients in the High-Risk group (score >30). In the High-Risk group, there were more patients with age â‰¥50 (87.0 vs. 64.3%, P = 0.040) and received chemotherapy with a borderline significance (91.3 vs. 72.9%, P = 0.066) in the PMRT subgroup than in the no PMRT subgroup. In all three groups, OS was comparable between the PMRT subgroup and the no PMRT subgroup. Furthermore, multivariate analysis did not show any OS benefit for PMRT based on the 21-gene recurrence score. Conclusion: This study showed that the 21-gene RS assay was not able to predict the benefit of PMRT for OS in women with T1-2 N1mic ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. However, further prospective larger sample-size trials are warranted to determine if a benefit exists.",Comparison of the disinfectant effects of Nanosil D2 and Korsolex extra solutions on thermoset acrylic resin contaminated with Streptococcus mutans and Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041189,Journal of advanced pharmaceutical technology & research,2019 05 03,"This study was conducted to compare the disinfectant effects of Nanosil D2 and Korsolex extra on thermoset acrylic resin contaminated with Streptococcus mutans and Bacillus subtilis.

Antinausea remedies have long been used, but their effects and action mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, hypnotic, sedative, and anxiolytic activities of antinausea remedies were evaluated. This preclinical trial assessed the hypnotic, sedative, and anxiolytic activities of antinausea remedies. Thai traditional antinausea remedy was extracted by decoction in deionized water until exhaustion and concentrated to dryness. Anxiolytic activities were evaluated using elevated plus-maze and open-field tests for vehicle control group compared to treatment groups (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg). Hypnotic and mechanistic studies were performed using thiopental sodium-induced sleeping time with benzodiazepine receptor antagonist test. In the thiopental sodium-induced sleeping time test, vehicle control groups were compared to treatment groups (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg). In addition, GABAergic agonistic effect vehicle control groups were pretreated with 3.5-mg/kg flumazenil before sterile water and compared to the treatment group which also received flumazenil before 100 mg/kg extract. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison testing.

Various strategies have been adopted to minimize the use of tunneled catheters that are used for dialysis. Regarding this, the present study aimed to assess the success, patency, as well as early and late complications of cuffed femoral and jugular hemodialysis catheters. This case-control study was performed on 145 hemodialysis patients who were candidates for the insertion of tunneled hemodialysis catheters at Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran, during 2015-2016. The data were collected retrospectively by reviewing the patients' medical records. The participants were divided into two groups of femoral and jugular accesses, based on the type of catheter they had. To determine the procedure-related outcomes, they were assessed 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months after catheterization. According to the results, the mean times of catheter efficacy (patency) were 4.43 Â± 3.11 and 5.65 Â± 4.57 months in the femoral and jugular access groups, respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.095). Furthermore, the femoral and jugular access groups had the infection prevalence of 23.2% and 16.2%, thrombosis prevalence of 28.6% and 20.9%, and mortality rates of 3.5% and 1.4%, respectively. According to the multivariable linear regression model, the history of catheterization could predict reduced catheter patency. In addition, catheter-related infection could be predicted among females based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis. As the findings indicated, femoral and jugular hemodialysis catheter insertions showed no significant difference in terms of the mean patency, complications (e.g., infection and thrombosis), and mortality rate.","Formulation, characterization, and in vitro testing of azelaic acid ethosome-based cream against Propionibacterium acnes for the treatment of acne.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041186,Journal of advanced pharmaceutical technology & research,2019 05 03,"Azelaic acid is an antiacne drug by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase enzyme of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) that affects the inhibition of bacterial DNA synthesis which occurs in the cytoplasm.

The present study was directed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of pharmacovigilance (PV) among the physicians, nurses, and pharmacists of a teaching tertiary care hospital of India. A structured questionnaire was designed using previous studies and standardized. Questions were categorized into three groups: Group 1 tested the knowledge (K1-K8), Group 2 tested attitude (A1-A6), and Group 3 tested the level of practice of PV (P1-P5) of the participant. Such 250 questionnaires were distributed to different health-care professionals of VIMS, Ballari. The participants were graded in three categories as poor, unsatisfactory, and satisfactory depending on the mean score. The data were interpreted by calculating the frequencies, one-way ANOVA and Scheffe's test. Furthermore, factors that discourage them from taking part in the PV program were recorded. A total of 182 questionnaires were statistically analyzed. It was found that KAP of PV among doctors, nurses, and pharmacists was unsatisfactory.

The antibacterial activity of all tested compounds was determined by agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays. The checkerboard method was used to quantify the efficacy of cinnamon EO in combination with these antibiotics. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifferent, or antagonism. A synergistic interaction was shown against S. aureus with the combination cinnamon EO and ampicillin or chloramphenicol and against E. coli when cinnamon EO was combined with chloramphenicol. However, the combination of cinnamon oil and streptomycin displayed additive effects against all bacteria stains. The combinations of cinnamon EO and antibiotics can be used as an alternative therapeutic application, which can decrease the minimum effective dose of the drugs, thus reducing their possible adverse effects and the costs of treatment.",Study and modeling of the distribution process of some phenolic compounds between the solid and liquid phases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041183,Journal of advanced pharmaceutical technology & research,2019 05 03,"The article presents the results related to the study of distribution of biologically active substances from the plant raw material between solid and liquid phases. The aim of this study is to develop theoretical bases of the extraction process in the equilibrium state by the example of study and modeling of the distribution process of biologically active substances from Eucalyptus viminalis leaves. In these studies, we used ground plant raw material of E. viminalis leaves with particle fraction of 0.1-0.5 mm; and ethanol with concentration 80% Â±1% v/v was used as an extractant. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with rutin, chlorogenic acid, and euglobal standards equivalent to spissum extract of chlorophyllipt of the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. A hypothesis has been suggested that Henry's adsorption law and the law of conservation of matter play a fundamental role in this process. The experimental data are described well by the suggested equation with high value of determination coefficient R2 =0.99. At the same time, F-test and the significance of coefficients in equations satisfy the statistic condition, which means that the current hypothesis about the adsorption mechanism of distribution of biologically active substances in the extraction system is not refuted. The results of these studies demonstrate good agreement of experimental data and theoretical model based on Henry's adsorption law and mass balance.

Cervical cancer (HeLa) is one of the most dominant cancers that happen in developing country, including Indonesia. Some chemotherapeutic agents using synthetic drugs have been used to treat cancer, but they are relatively expensive and cause poisoning that limits their use. Based on literatures, M. koenigii serves the potential secondary metabolites that could be developed as anticancer agent. This study aims to evaluate the cytotoxic activity from three extracts of M. koenigii leaves against HeLa cell line, including hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Methodology used included extraction process, phytochemical screening, and cytotoxicity evaluation. The result showed that all the three extracts demonstrated a potent cytotoxic activity for HeLa cancer cells. Hexane and ethyl acetate showed a very strong cytotoxic effect with CD50 values <1 Î¼g/mL, whereas methanol extract showed cytotoxic effect with CD50 value of 2.25 Î¼g/mL.

The databases of Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information), and Scopus were searched for published studies between 2006 and March 30, 2018. We only included clinical studies in this research. Due to a lack of quantitative evidence and the vast heterogeneity of the biomaterials, implant surgery sites, implant types, follow-up periods, and various implant placement techniques (1-stage or 2-stage), we could not manage to do a meta-analysis on the 13 included studies. Several techniques can result in vertical bone augmentation. Complications can be seen in vertical bone augmentation and especially in the autogenous bone grafting; however, some biomaterials showed promising results to be practical substitutes for autogenous bone. Bio-Oss and beta-tricalcium phosphate are our second-level candidates for vertical bone augmentation due to their promising clinical results with the least infection and immunologic response risk. The gold standard, however, remains the autogenous bone graft. Further clinical studies in the future with exact report of bone measures are needed to develop new comparisons and quantitative analyses."

Strict policies of PAN enlargement that focus on wildlife conservation have failed largely due to difficulties in encouraging stakeholder participation and meeting the elephant habitat requirement. A co-management policy that promotes sustainable resource use, wildlife conservation, and stakeholder participation may have greater feasibility than the strict policies in a developing world. Here, we identified the suitable habitat of elephants using maximum entropy models and examined whether habitat suitability is indirectly associated with local economic development in human-dominated landscapes. We found that (1) the suitable habitat was mainly in areas of forest matrix (50% natural forest cover) with multiple land-use practices rather than relatively intact forest and near communities (mean distance two km) and (2) habitat suitability was negatively associated with local economic development (rP = -0.37, P = 0.04). From the standpoint of elephant habitat and its socio-economic background, our results indicate that co-management will be more effective than the currently strict approaches of enlarging PAN. Additionally, our results provide on-ground information for elephant corridor design in southern China.",Using Ipomoea aquatic as an environmental-friendly alternative to Elodea nuttallii for the aquaculture of Chinese mitten crab.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041154,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"Elodea nuttallii is widely used in Chinese mitten crab (CMC) rearing practice, but it is not a native aquatic plant and cannot endure high temperature. Thus, large E. nuttallii mortality and water deterioration events could occur during high-temperature seasons. The aim of this study was to identify the use of local macrophytes in CMC rearing practice, including Ipomoea aquatic and Oryza sativa. A completely randomized field experiment was conducted to investigate the crab yield, water quality, bacterioplankton community and functions in the three different systems (E. nuttallii, I. aquatic, and O. sativa). Average crab yields in the different macrophyte systems did not differ significantly. The I. aquatic and O. sativa systems significantly decreased the total nitrogen and nitrate-N quantities in the outflow waters during the rearing period compared to the E. nuttallii system, and the I. aquatic and O. sativa plants assimilated more nitrogen than the E. nuttallii plant. Moreover, the significant changes of bacterioplankton abundances and biodiversity in the three systems implied that cleanliness of rearing waters was concomitantly attributed to the differential microbial community and functions. In addition, principle component analysis successfully differentiated the bacterioplankton communities of the three macrophytes systems. Environmental factor fitting and the co-occurrence network analyses indicated that pH was the driver of bacterioplankton community structure. Functional predictions using PICRUSt (v.1.1.3) software based on evolutionary modeling indicated a higher potential for microbial denitrification in the I. aquatic and O. sativa systems. Notably, the O. sativa plants stopped growing in the middle of the rearing period. Thus, the I. aquatic system rather than the O. sativa system could be a feasible and environmental-friendly alternative to the E. nuttallii system in CMC rearing practice.",An affordable and automated imaging approach to acquire highly resolved individual data-an example of copepod growth in response to multiple stressors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041153,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"Individual trait variation is essential for populations to cope with multiple stressors and continuously changing environments. The immense number of possible stressor combinations and the influence of phenotypic variation makes experimental testing for effects on organisms challenging. The acquisition of such data requires many replicates and is notoriously laborious. It is further complicated when responses occur over short time periods. To overcome such challenges, we developed an automated imaging platform to acquire temporally highly resolved individual data. We tested this platform by exposing copepods to a combination of a biotic stressor (predator cues) and a toxicant (copper) and measured the growth response of individual copepods. We tested the automatically acquired data against published manually acquired data with much lower temporal resolution. We find the same general potentiating effects of predator cues on the adverse effects of copper, and the influence of an individual's clutch identity on its ability to resist stress, between the data obtained from low and high temporal resolution. However, when using the high temporal resolution, we also uncovered effects of clutch ID on the timing and duration of stage transitions, which highlights the importance of considering phenotypic variation in ecotoxicological testing. Phenotypic variation is usually not acknowledged in ecotoxicological testing. Our approach is scalable, affordable, and adjustable to accommodate both aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and a wide range of visually detectable endpoints. We discuss future extensions that would further widen its applicability.",Effect of irradiance on the emission of short-lived halocarbons from three common tropical marine microalgae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041152,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"Marine algae have been reported as important sources of biogenic volatile halocarbons that are emitted into the atmosphere. These compounds are linked to destruction of the ozone layer, thus contributing to climate change. There may be mutual interactions between the halocarbon emission and the environment. In this study, the effect of irradiance on the emission of halocarbons from selected microalgae was investigated. Using controlled laboratory experiments, three tropical marine microalgae cultures, Synechococcus sp. UMACC 371 (cyanophyte), Parachlorella sp. UMACC 245 (chlorophyte) and Amphora sp. UMACC 370 (diatom) were exposed to irradiance of 0, 40 and 120 Âµmol photons m-2s-1. Stress in the microalgal cultures was indicated by the photosynthetic performance (Fv/Fm, maximum quantum yield). An increase in halocarbon emissions was observed at 120 Âµmol photons m-2s-1, together with a decrease in Fv/Fm. This was most evident in the release of CH3I by Amphora sp. Synechococcus sp. was observed to be the most affected by irradiance as shown by the increase in emissions of most halocarbons except for CHBr3 and CHBr2Cl. High positive correlation between Fv/Fm and halocarbon emission rates was observed in Synechococcus sp. for CH2Br2. No clear trends in correlation could be observed for the other halocarbons in the other two microalgal species. This suggests that other mechanisms like mitochondria respiration may contribute to halocarbon production, in addition to photosynthetic performance.",Physiological responses of Oxyrrhis marina to a diet of virally infected Emiliania huxleyi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041150,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"The coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi forms some of the largest phytoplankton blooms in the ocean. The rapid demise of these blooms has been linked to viral infections. E. huxleyi abundance, distribution, and nutritional status make them an important food source for the heterotrophic protists which are classified as microzooplankton in marine food webs. In this study we investigated the fate of E.Â huxleyi (CCMP 374) infected with virus strain EhV-86 in a simple predator-prey interaction. The ingestion rates of Oxyrrhis marina were significantly lower (between 26.9 and 50.4%) when fed virus-infected E. huxleyi cells compared to non-infected cells. Despite the lower ingestion rates, O. marina showed significantly higher growth rates (between 30 and 91.3%) when fed infected E. huxleyi cells, suggesting higher nutritional value and/or greater assimilation of infected E. huxleyi cells. No significant differences were found in O. marina cell volumes or fatty acids profiles. These results show that virally infected E. huxleyi support higher growth rates of single celled heterotrophs and in addition to the ""viral shunt"" hypothesis, viral infections may also divert more carbon to mesozooplankton grazers.","The newly described Araguaian river dolphins, Inia araguaiaensis (Cetartiodactyla, Iniidae), produce a diverse repertoire of acoustic signals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041149,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"The recent discovery of the Araguaian river dolphin (Inia araguaiaensis) highlights how little we know about the diversity and biology of river dolphins. In this study, we described the acoustic repertoire of this newly discovered species in concert with their behaviour. We analysed frequency contours of 727 signals (sampled at 10Â ms temporal resolution). These contours were analyzed using an adaptive resonance theory neural network combined with dynamic time-warping (ARTwarp). Using a critical similarity value of 96%, frequency contours were categorized into 237 sound-types. The most common types were emitted when calves were present suggesting a key role in mother-calf communication. Our findings show that the acoustic repertoire of river dolphins is far from simple. Furthermore, the calls described here are similar in acoustic structure to those produced by social delphinids, such as orcas and pilot whales. Uncovering the context in which these signals are produced may help understand the social structure of this species and contribute to our understanding of the evolution of acoustic communication in whales.","Ability emotional intelligence in young people and older adults with and without depressive symptoms, considering gender and educational level.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041148,PeerJ,2019 05 03,"There is little research on differences in Emotional Intelligence (EI) ability at different stages of adult development.

Study â€ƒPubMed, Google Scholar, and 2015 Cochrane Review were searched. Analysis of variance was used to determine if significant GWG differences exist between strategies, with additional subanalyses on overweight (OV) or obese women based on 2009 IOM guidelines. Results â€ƒOf 66 identified studies, 31 contributed data ( n â€‰=â€‰8,558). Compared with routine prenatal care, nutrition-only interventions were significantly associated with reduced GWG and are most likely to produce weight gain within IOM recommendations ( p â€‰=â€‰0.013). Exercise-only ( p â€‰=â€‰0.069) and nutrition-plus-exercise ( p â€‰=â€‰0.056) interventions trended toward GWG within IOM guidelines, but did not reach statistical significance. Supervised ( p â€‰=â€‰0.61) and unsupervised ( p â€‰=â€‰0.494) exercise programs had similar effectiveness.

Conclusion â€ƒPreventing excessive GWG is crucial, especially for OV or obese women. In the current study, nutrition-based intervention is the health system strategy that showed significant impact on preventing excessive GWG compared with routine prenatal care. Among women who are OV or have obesity, nutrition-only interventions hold the most promise compared with routine prenatal care.",Medicolegal Review: Perinatal Effexor Lawsuits and Legal Strategies Adverse to Prescribing Obstetric Providers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041117,AJP reports,2019 05 03,"Objectives â€ƒThis study was aimed to familiarize obstetricians with the legal environment surrounding Effexor lawsuits and emphasize the importance of documenting informed consent in the medical records when prescribing a medication that is being targeted for litigation.

No longer figured (merely) as passive recipients of healthcare services or as beneficiaries of top-down biomedical information, individuals are increasingly seen as active contributors in healthcare and research. They are positioned into multiple roles that are experienced simultaneously by those who access and co-produce digital content that can easily be transformed into data. This is contextualised by 'big data' technologies that have altered biomedicine, enabling collation and analysis of myriad data from digitised records to personal mobile data. Social media facilitate new formations of communities and knowledge enacted online, while novel kinds of commercial value emerge from digital networks that enable health data commodification. In this paper, we draw from exemplary digital era shifts towards participatory medicine to cast light on the rapprochements between patienthood, participation and consumption, and we explore how these rapprochements are mediated by, and materialise through, the use of participatory digital technologies and big data. We argue that there is a need to use new conceptual tools that account for the multiple roles and experiences of patient-participant-consumers that co-emerge through digital technologies. We must also ethically re-assess the rights and responsibilities of individuals in the digital era, and the implications of digital era changes for the future of biomedicine and healthcare."

Chondrogenesis is regulated by transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), a short-lived cytokine whose effect is prolonged by storage in the extracellular matrix. Tissue engineering applications aim to maximise the yield of differentiated MSCs. Recent experiments involve seeding a hydrogel construct with a layer of MSCs lying below a layer of chondrocytes, stimulating the seeded cells in the construct from above with exogenous TGF-Î² and then culturing it in vitro. To investigate the efficacy of this strategy, we develop a mathematical model to describe the interactions between MSCs, chondrocytes and TGF-Î². Using this model, we investigate the effect of varying the initial concentration of TGF-Î², the initial densities of the MSCs and chondrocytes, and the relative depths of the two layers on the long-time composition of the tissue construct.",The role of pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040936,Therapeutic advances in hematology,2019 05 03,"Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). PMBCL comprises approximately 10% of DLBCLs, thus making it a rare variant of DLBCL. Cure rates for PMBCL with upfront regimens like DA-REPOCH exceed 90%. However, if there is a poor response to this first-line therapy, relapsed/refractory PMBCL (rrPMBCL) has limited treatment options. The historic trend is to treat rrPMBCL with salvage regimens commonly used for DLBCL followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT-ASCT); however, response rates to salvage therapy remain low and few patients are able to proceed to transplant. An interesting feature of PMBCL is that even though it is classified as a subtype of DLBCL, PMBCL actually shares many clinical, pathologic, and genetic features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). For example, both frequently express program death ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), which is not seen in other mature B-cell lymphomas. The expression of PD-L1/2 in PMBCL makes PDL1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, an attractive therapeutic target. Pembrolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated therapy now approved for a number of cancer types from advanced melanoma to relapsed/refractory cHL. There are now multi-institutional trials underway assessing the role of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL.","Comparative cytogenetics among Leporinusfriderici and Leporellusvittatus populations (Characiformes, Anostomidae): focus on repetitive DNA elements.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040935,Comparative cytogenetics,2019 05 03,"Anostomidae are a neotropical fish family rich in number of species.

We used conventional cytogenetic techniques allied to fluorescence in situ hybridization, using 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 5S rDNA, a general telomere sequence for vertebrates (TTAGGG)n and retrotransposon (RTE) Rex1 probes. The anostomids in all studied populations presented 2n = 54 chromosomes, with a chromosome formula of 32m + 22sm for L.friderici and 28m + 26sm for L.vittatus. Variations in the number and location of the 5S and 18S rDNA chromosomal sites were observed between L.friderici and L.vittatus populations and species. Accumulation of Rex1 was observed in the terminal region of most chromosomes in all populations, and telomere sequences were located just on all ends of the 54 chromosomes in all populations.

To improve the prognosis, the issues of chemoresistance and tumor size should be addressed. Glioma stem cell (GSC) populations, a heterogeneous power-law coded population in glioblastoma, are believed to be responsible for the recurrence and progressive expansion of tumors. Thus, we propose a therapeutic strategy of reducing the initial size and controlling the regrowth of GSC populations which directly facilitates initial and long-term control of glioblastoma recurrence. In this study, we administered an anti-glioma/GSC drug temozolomide (TMZ) and OTS964, an inhibitor for T-Lak cell originated protein kinase, in combination (T&O), investigating whether together they efficiently and substantially shrink the initial size of power-law coded GSC populations and slow the long-term re-growth of drug-resistant GSC populations. We employed a detailed quantitative approach using clonal glioma sphere (GS) cultures, measuring sphere survivability and changes to growth during the self-renewal. T&O eliminated self-renewing GS clones and suppressed their growth. We also addressed whether T&O reduced the size of self-renewed GS populations. T&O quickly reduced the size of GS populations via efficient elimination of GS clones. The growth of the surviving T&O-resistant GS populations was continuously disturbed, leading to substantial long-term shrinkage of the self-renewed GS populations. Thus, T&O reduced the initial size of GS populations and suppressed their later regrowth. A combination therapy of TMZ and OTS964 would represent a novel therapeutic paradigm with the potential for long-term control of glioblastoma recurrence via immediate and sustained shrinkage of power-law coded heterogeneous GSC populations.",Clinical validation of the tempus xT next-generation targeted oncology sequencing assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040929,Oncotarget,2019 05 03,"We developed and clinically validated a hybrid capture next generation sequencing assay to detect somatic alterations and microsatellite instability in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

Chimeric antigen receptor targeting T cells B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on malignant plasma cells have led to impressive clinical responses in recent trials. However, BCMA-negative relapses have been observed, supporting the need for complementary treatment strategies. Here, we explored the feasibility of targeting CD138 (syndecan-1), a surface marker expressed on both normal and malignant plasma cells. We showed that T cells from both healthy donors and from multiple myeloma patients, when transduced with a CD138-specific chimeric antigen receptor, can eliminate tumor cell lines and primary myeloma cells both in vitro and in vivo. CD138 is also expressed by putative myeloma stem cells identified by Hoechst staining, and these cells can be eliminated by CD138-specific chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Preclinical analyses did not identify any on target off tumor cytotoxicity against normal epithelial or endothelial cells, further supporting the rationale for the use of adoptively transferred CD138-specific chimeric antigen receptor T cells for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.","Novel N,N-dialkyl cyanocinnamic acids as monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040927,Oncotarget,2019 05 03,Potent and dual monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and 4 inhibitors have been developed for the first time as potential anticancer agents based on Î±-cyanocinnamic acid structural template. Candidate inhibitors 1-9 have been evaluated for in vitro cell proliferation against MCT1 and MCT4 expressing cancer cell lines. Potential MCT1 and MCT4 binding interactions of the lead compound 9 have been studied through homology modeling and molecular docking prediction. In vitro effects on extracellular flux via glycolysis and mitochondrial stress tests suggest that candidate compounds 3 and 9 disrupt glycolysis and OxPhos efficiently in MCT1 expressing colorectal adenocarcinoma WiDr and MCT4 expressing triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Fluorescence microscopy analyses in these cells also indicate that compound 9 is internalized and concentrated near mitochondria. In vivo tumor growth inhibition studies in WiDr and MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor models in mice indicate that the candidate compound 9 exhibits a significant single agent activity.
