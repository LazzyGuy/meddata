Our partner consultations concluded that IKT success should be measured in a different way. That is, it should not be about informing an immediate gap in the translation of food allergy findings but about building relationships between our partners, greater awareness, understanding and knowledge about the nature of science and IKT, and ultimately helping to create better policy and science down the road. It is the recognition that it behooves us as scientists to be able to answer those ""why"" questions. We call for other researchers to consider the success of IKT beyond the short term timelines of any one research project but instead as an avenue to build partnerships, innovate thinking about research questions and to maximize choice and minimize risk for individuals in Canada and beyond affected by food allergy."

When they were banned, their modes of action and metabolism were not known. This article aims at providing a picture of the metabolism of γ-BHC and the modes of action of γ -BHC and dieldrin. γ-BHC is metabolized via two independent metabolic pathways. One is a glutathione conjugation pathway resulting in the formation of dichlorophenyl mercapturic acid and the other is an oxidative metabolism catalyzed by microsomes to mainly 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and (36/45)-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohex-1-ene (HCCHE). Other metabolites of this pathway are 2,4,5-TCP, 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), (36/45)- and (346/5)-1,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohex-1-enes (PCCHE). Nowadays, γ-BHC and dieldrin are very important reagents which are used to study the GABA receptor in insects and mammals. They were found to be noncompetitive GABA antagonists blocking the chloride ion selective pores in the GABA-gated chloride channels and leading to inhibition of chloride ion conductance. [3H]EBOB binding data showed that γ-BHC, its analogs, dieldrin, and other cyclodiene insecticides interact with the same site on GABA receptor as picrotoxinin. Only γ-BHC, among other BHC isomers, exhibits this binding characteristic. Milbemycin, currently widely used as an insecticide, acaricide and nematicide, has been found to open the GABA-gated chloride channel."

Although the scientific criteria of classification for pruritic diseases are not clear, it can be divided as acute or chronic by duration of symptoms. In this study, we investigated whether skin injury caused by chemical (contact hypersensitivity, CHS) or physical (skin-scratching stimulation, SSS) stimuli causes initial pruritus and analyzed gene expression profiles systemically to determine how changes in skin gene expression in the affected area are related to itching. In both CHS and SSS, we ranked the Gene Ontology Biological Process terms that are generally associated with changes. The factors associated with upregulation were keratinization, inflammatory response and neutrophil chemotaxis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway shows the difference of immune system, cell growth and death, signaling molecules and interactions, and signal transduction pathways. Il1a , Il1b and Il22 were upregulated in the CHS, and Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Il1b, Il1r1 and Il6 were upregulated in the SSS.

To observe the effects of FIR radiation, FIR-radiated materials-coated fabric was put on experimental rats or applied to L6 cells, and microarray analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and wound healing assays were performed. Microarray analysis revealed that messenger RNA expressions of rat muscle were stimulated by FIR radiation in a dose-dependent manner in amount of 10% and 30% materials-coated. In 30% group, 1,473 differentially expressed genes were identified (fold change [FC] > 1.5), and 218 genes were significantly regulated (FC > 1.5 and p < 0.05). Microarray analysis showed that extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and cell migration-related pathways were significantly stimulated in rat muscle. ECM and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated cell migration-related genes were increased. And, results showed that the relative gene expression of actin beta was increased. FIR radiation also stimulated actin subunit and actin-related genes. We observed that wound healing was certainly promoted by FIR radiation over 48 h in L6 cells. Therefore, we suggest that FIR radiation can penetrate the body and stimulate PDGF-mediated cell migration through ECM-integrin signaling in rats.",Dual deep neural network-based classifiers to detect experimental seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820157,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,2019 03 03,"Manually reviewing electroencephalograms (EEGs) is labor-intensive and demands automated seizure detection systems. To construct an efficient and robust event detector for experimental seizures from continuous EEG monitoring, we combined spectral analysis and deep neural networks. A deep neural network was trained to discriminate periodograms of 5-sec EEG segments from annotated convulsive seizures and the pre- and post-EEG segments. To use the entire EEG for training, a second network was trained with non-seizure EEGs that were misclassified as seizures by the first network. By sequentially applying the dual deep neural networks and simple pre- and post-processing, our autodetector identified all seizure events in 4,272 h of test EEG traces, with only 6 false positive events, corresponding to 100% sensitivity and 98% positive predictive value. Moreover, with pre-processing to reduce the computational burden, scanning and classifying 8,977 h of training and test EEG datasets took only 2.28 h with a personal computer. These results demonstrate that combining a basic feature extractor with dual deep neural networks and rule-based pre- and post-processing can detect convulsive seizures with great accuracy and low computational burden, highlighting the feasibility of our automated seizure detection algorithm.",Neuroprotective mechanisms of dieckol against glutamate toxicity through reactive oxygen species scavenging and nuclear factor-like 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820156,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,2019 03 03,"Glutamate toxicity-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death are involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases as well as acute brain ischemia/stroke. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of dieckol (DEK), one of the phlorotannins isolated from the marine brown alga Ecklonia cava, against glutamate toxicity. Primary cortical neurons (100 µM, 24 h) and HT22 neurons (5 mM, 12 h) were stimulated with glutamate to induce glutamate toxic condition. The results demonstrated that DEK treatment significantly increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (1-50 µM) and recovered morphological deterioration in glutamate-stimulated neurons. In addition, DEK strongly attenuated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial overload of Ca2+ and ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) disruption, adenine triphosphate depletion. DEK showed free radical scavenging activity in the cell-free system. Furthermore, DEK enhanced protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an important anti-oxidant enzyme, via the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). Taken together, we conclude that DEK exerts neuroprotective activities against glutamate toxicity through its direct free radical scavenging property and the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway activation.",Mannosylerythritol lipids ameliorate ultraviolet A-induced aquaporin-3 downregulation by suppressing c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in cultured human keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820155,The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology,2019 03 03,"Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) are glycolipids and have several pharmacological efficacies. MELs also show skin-moisturizing efficacy through a yet-unknown underlying mechanism. Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is a membrane protein that contributes to the water homeostasis of the epidermis, and decreased AQP3 expression following ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation of the skin is associated with reduced skin moisture. No previous study has examined whether the skin-moisturizing effect of MELs might act through the modulation of AQP3 expression. Here, we report for the first time that MELs ameliorate the UVA-induced downregulation of AQP3 in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT keratinocytes). Our results revealed that UVA irradiation decreases AQP3 expression at the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, but that MEL treatment significantly ameliorated these effects. Our mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor analysis revealed that phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38, mediates UVA-induced AQP3 downregulation, and that MEL treatment significantly suppressed the UVA-induced phosphorylation of JNK. To explore a possible mechanism, we tested whether MELs could regulate the expression of peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which acts as a potent transcription factor for AQP3 expression. Interestingly, UVA irradiation significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of PPAR-γ in HaCaT keratinocytes, whereas a JNK inhibitor and MELs significantly rescued this effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that MELs ameliorate UVA-induced AQP3 downregulation in HaCaT keratinocytes by suppressing JNK activation to block the decrease of PPAR-γ. Collectively, our findings suggest that MELs can be used as a potential ingredient that modulates AQP3 expression to improve skin moisturization following UVA irradiation-induced damage."

In mammals key metabolic responses to nutritional deprivation are mediated by the transcription factor PPAR-alpha, which is activated by free fatty acids and promotes lipid metabolism while inhibiting glucose metabolism. The C. elegans gene nhr-49 appears to function similarly in C. elegans. Here we report that protective effects of dietary restriction and inhibition of glucose metabolism to increase lifespan wild-type C. elegans and reduce toxicity in a polyQ model of Huntington's disease in C. elegans are dependent on NHR-49 and its co-activator CREB-Binding Protein (CBP). We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of cbp blocks protective effects of dietary restriction and blocks the molecular switch from glucose metabolism to alternative substrates. Conversely, increased glucose concentration and inhibition of cbp reduce lifespan and increase proteotoxicity. Lactate and inhibition of ETC complex II mimicked toxic effects of glucose on proteotoxicity whereas pyruvate and inhibition of ETC complex I protected against glucose-enhanced proteotoxicity. These results support that PPAR-alpha-like activity mediates protective effects of dietary restriction by reducing glucose metabolism via reducing production of NADH, and corroborate and extend recent studies demonstrating that PPPAR-alpha agonists increase lifespan in C. elegans dependent on NHR-49.",Serum Interleukin-15 is a Marker of Alopecia Areata Severity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820130,International journal of trichology,2019 03 03,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a cytokine that is involved in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

The rat blood/CSF model revealed a time course similar to that of the human CSF samples in the non-spasm group. HRG thus appears to have the potential to become an early predictor of CVS. In addition, the interaction of HRG with IL-6, FpA, and 8OHdG may form the pathology of CVS."

However, after animals have chronically consumed alcohol, the above gene therapy did not inhibit alcohol intake, indicating that in the chronic ethanol intake condition brain acetaldehyde is no longer the compound that generates the continued alcohol reinforcement. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation generated by chronic ethanol intake are strongly associated with the perpetuation of alcohol consumption and alcohol relapse ""binge drinking"". Mesenchymal stem cells, referred to as guardians of inflammation, release anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant products. The intravenous delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells or the intranasal administration of mesenchymal stem cell-generated exosomes reverses both (i) alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation and (ii) oxidative stress, and greatly (iii) inhibits (80-90%) chronic alcohol intake and relapse binge-drinking. The therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells is mediated by increased levels of the brain GLT-1 glutamate transporter, indicating that glutamate signaling is pivotal for alcohol relapse.

This study aimed to explore whether television viewing behaviours in adults aged 50 or over are associated with a decline in cognition. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging involving 3,662 adults aged 50+, we used multivariate linear regression models to explore longitudinal associations between baseline television watching (2008/2009) and cognition 6 years later (2014/2015) while controlling for demographic factors, socio-economic status, depression, physical health, health behaviours and a range of other sedentary behaviours. Watching television for more than 3.5 hours per day is associated with a dose-response decline in verbal memory over the following six years, independent of confounding variables. These results are found in particular amongst those with better cognition at baseline and are robust to a range of sensitivity analyses exploring reverse causality, differential non-response and stability of television viewing. Watching television is not longitudinally associated with changes in semantic fluency. Overall our results provide preliminary data to suggest that television viewing for more than 3.5 hours per day is related to cognitive decline.",SCREEN III: working towards a condensed screening tool to detect nutrition risk in community-dwelling older adults using CLSA data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820028,European journal of clinical nutrition,2019 03 01,"Screening for nutrition risk in community-dwelling older adults increases the likelihood of early intervention to improve nutritional status, with short screening tools preferred.

To characterize the key regulators involved in the development of RA, we obtained multilayer epigenomics data including DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, miRNA profiles, genetic variations by whole-exome sequencing, and mRNA profiles from synoviocytes of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The overall DNA methylation patterns were not much different between RA and OA, but 523 low-methylated regions (LMRs) were specific to RA. The LMRs were preferentially localized at the 5' introns and overlapped with transcription factor binding motifs for GLI1, RUNX2, and TFAP2A/C. Single base-scale differentially methylated CpGs were linked with several networks related to wound response, tissue development, collagen fibril organization, and the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway. Further, the DNA methylation of 201 CpGs was significantly correlated with 27 expressed miRNA genes. Our interpretation of epigenomic data of the synoviocytes from RA and OA patients is an informative resource to further investigate regulatory elements and biomarkers responsible for the pathophysiology of RA and OA.",Leveraging brain cortex-derived molecular data to elucidate epigenetic and transcriptomic drivers of complex traits and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820025,Translational psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Integrative approaches that harness large-scale molecular datasets can help develop mechanistic insight into findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We have performed extensive analyses to uncover transcriptional and epigenetic processes which may play a role in complex trait variation. This was undertaken by applying Bayesian multiple-trait colocalization systematically across the genome to identify genetic variants responsible for influencing intermediate molecular phenotypes as well as complex traits. In this analysis, we leveraged high-dimensional quantitative trait loci data derived from the prefrontal cortex tissue (concerning gene expression, DNA methylation and histone acetylation) and GWAS findings for five complex traits (Neuroticism, Schizophrenia, Educational Attainment, Insomnia and Alzheimer's disease). There was evidence of colocalization for 118 associations, suggesting that the same underlying genetic variant influenced both nearby gene expression as well as complex trait variation. Of these, 73 associations provided evidence that the genetic variant also influenced proximal DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation. These findings support previous evidence at loci where epigenetic mechanisms may putatively mediate effects of genetic variants on traits, such as KLC1 and schizophrenia. We also uncovered evidence implicating novel loci in disease susceptibility, including genes expressed predominantly in the brain tissue, such as MDGA1, KIRREL3 and SLC12A5. An inverse relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression was observed more than can be accounted for by chance, supporting previous findings implicating DNA methylation as a transcriptional repressor. Our study should prove valuable in helping future studies prioritize candidate genes and epigenetic mechanisms for in-depth functional follow-up analyses.",Renal-Protective Effects of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Agonist Pioglitazone in ob/ob Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820023,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND This study investigated the therapeutic effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist pioglitazone in ob/ob mice with obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 24 mice were divided into 3 groups: wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n=8), ob/ob mice (n=8), and ob/ob mice receiving pioglitazone treatment (n=8). Body mass, blood glucose, serum adiponectin (ADP), and urine microalbumin (mALB) levels were determined. Renal histology was examined using light and electron microscopy. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX-4) expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS Serum ADP did not alter between weeks 0 and 12 in the control group, while the ob/ob mice showed a time-dependent decrease that was prevented by pioglitazone. Urinary mALB did not alter between week 0 and 12 in the control group, but was higher in week 0 and week 12 in the ob/ob group. Pioglitazone prevented the rise in urinary mALB in week 12. Histology revealed glomerulomegaly, mesangial proliferation, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and foot processes fusion in the ob/ob group, which were ameliorated by pioglitazone treatment. Compared to the control group, ob/ob mice had a higher kidney index and glomerular diameter, which were reduced by pioglitazone treatment. Immunohistochemical and Western blot experiments revealed lower expression levels of WT1, ZO-1, and AMPK and higher NOX-4 expression level in the ob/ob group, which was prevented by pioglitazone treatment. CONCLUSIONS Pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, can prevent ORG, probably by reducing oxidative stress.",Multidrug-Resistant Bovine Salmonellosis Predisposing for Severe Human Clostridial Myonecrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820022,The American journal of case reports,2019 04 09,"BACKGROUND The overuse of antibiotics in animals promotes the development of multidrug-resistance predisposing for severe polymicrobial human infections.

Serotyping of the colonic Salmonella isolate in the index case and the bovine farm outbreak isolates from where the patient worked indicated they were both serotype I 4,[5],12: i: -, which is linked with a multitude of large reported disease outbreaks. Further analysis revealed that they are highly genetically related and antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that they are phenotypically identical. CONCLUSIONS Enteritis due to human acquisition of multidrug-resistant Salmonella from cattle led to the invasion and dissemination of Clostridium septicum resulting in devastating myonecrotic disease.

Previously, we modified the postnatal day 7 (P7) rat procedure for use in mice, and later demonstrated that genetic strain strongly influences the degree of brain injury in the P7 mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Recently, the P9 or P10 mouse brain was recognized as the developmental equivalent of a term neonatal human brain, rather than P7. Consequently, the Vannucci procedure has again been modified, and a commonly used protocol employs 10% oxygen for 50 min in C57Bl/6 mice. Strain differences have yet to be described for the P9/P10 mouse model. In order to determine if the strain differences we previously reported in the P7 mouse model are present in the P9 model, we compared 2 commonly used strains, CD1 and C57Bl/6J, in both the P7 (carotid ligation [in this case, right] followed by exposure to 8% oxygen for 30 min) and P9 (carotid ligation [in this case left] followed by exposure to 10% oxygen) models of HI. Experiments using the P7 model were performed in 2001-2012 and those using the P9 model were performed in 2012-2016. Five to seven days after the HI procedure, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, their brains were sectioned on a Vibratome (50 µm) and alternate sections were stained with Perl's iron stain or cresyl violet. Brain sections were examined microscopically and scored for the degree of injury. Since brains in the P7 group had been scored previously with a slightly different system, they were reanalyzed using our current scoring system which scores injury in 11 regions: the anterior, middle, and posterior cortex; the anterior, middle, and posterior striatum; CA1, CA2, CA3, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and thalamus, on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (cystic infarct) for a total score of 0-33. Brains in the P9 group were scored with the same system. Given the same insult, the P7 CD1 mice had greater injury than the C57Bl/6J mice, which agrees with our previous findings. The P9 CD1 mice also had greater injury than the C57Bl/6J mice. This study confirms that CD1 mice are more susceptible to injury than C57Bl/6J mice and that strain selection is important when using mouse models of HI.",Genotype-Clinical Correlations in Polycystic Kidney Disease with No Apparent Family History.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820006,American journal of nephrology,2019 03 28,"Genetic characteristics of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients without apparent family history were reported to be different from those with a positive family history.

IgA is induced by both T cell-dependent and -independent (TI) pathways. However, little is known about TI regulation. We report that IEC endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces a polyreactive IgA response, which is protective against enteric inflammation. IEC ER stress causes TI and microbiota-independent expansion and activation of peritoneal B1b cells, which culminates in increased lamina propria and luminal IgA. Increased numbers of IgA-producing plasma cells were observed in healthy humans with defective autophagy, who are known to exhibit IEC ER stress.

Adipose tissue from lean mice released ~1% of its lipid content per day via exosomes ex vivo, a rate that more than doubles in obese animals. AdExos and associated factors were sufficient to induce in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursors into adipose tissue macrophage-like cells. Thus, AdExos are both an alternative pathway of local lipid release and a mechanism by which parenchymal cells can modulate tissue macrophage differentiation and function.",Motor cortical control of vocal interaction in neotropical singing mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819963,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 03 01,"Like many adaptive behaviors, acoustic communication often requires rapid modification of motor output in response to sensory cues.

We find that males modify singing behavior during social interactions on a subsecond time course that resembles both traditional sensorimotor tasks and conversational speech. We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing behavior on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions.

We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.",Carfilzomib or bortezomib with melphalan-prednisone for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819926,Blood,2019 05 03,"The phase 3 CLARION study compared carfilzomib-melphalan-prednisone (KMP) with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP) in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. Patients were randomized 1:1 to KMP or VMP for nine 42-day cycles (C). Patients received carfilzomib on days (D) 1, 2, 8, 9, 22, 23, 29, 30 (20 mg/m2: C1D1, C1D2; 36 mg/m2 thereafter) or bortezomib on D1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 (1.3 mg/m2; D4, 11, 25, 32 omitted for C5-9). Melphalan (9 mg/m2) and prednisone (60 mg/m2) were administered on D1-4. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Nine hundred fifty-five patients were randomized (intention-to-treat population: KMP, n = 478; VMP, n = 477). Median PFS was 22.3 months with KMP vs 22.1 months with VMP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.906; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.746-1.101; P = .159). Median overall survival was similar and not reached in either group (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.82-1.43). Overall response rate was 84.3% for KMP and 78.8% for VMP. Complete response rate was 25.9% for KMP and 23.1% for VMP. Minimal residual disease-negative rates were 15.7% (KMP) and 15.5% (VMP). Adverse events (AEs) of interest (any grade) occurring with a ≥5% higher patient incidence in the KMP arm were acute renal failure (13.9% [KMP] vs 6.2% [VMP]) and cardiac failure (10.8% vs 4.3%). Grade ≥3 AE rates were 74.7% (KMP) and 76.2% (VMP). Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was lower for KMP vs VMP (2.5% vs 35.1%). Treatment with KMP in CLARION did not yield a statistically significant difference in PFS vs VMP.

It causes asparagine deficit, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition and subsequent leukemic cell death and ALL remission. However, patients often relapse because of the development of resistance, but the underlying mechanism of ALL cell resistance to l-asparaginase remains unknown. Through unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screening, we identified huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) as an ALL biomarker for l-asparaginase resistance. Knocking down HAP1 induces l-asparaginase resistance. HAP1 interacts with huntingtin and the intracellular Ca2+ channel, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor to form a ternary complex that mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release upon stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate3 Loss of HAP1 prevents the formation of the ternary complex and thus l-asparaginase-mediated ER Ca2+ release. HAP1 loss also inhibits external Ca2+ entry, blocking an excessive rise in [Ca2+]i, and reduces activation of the Ca2+-dependent calpain-1, Bid, and caspase-3 and caspase-12, leading to reduced number of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that HAP1 loss prevents l-asparaginase-induced apoptosis through downregulation of the Ca2+-mediated calpain-1-Bid-caspase-3/12 apoptotic pathway. Treatment with BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)] reverses the l-asparaginase apoptotic effect in control cells, supporting a link between l-asparaginase-induced [Ca2+]i increase and apoptotic cell death. Consistent with these findings, ALL patient leukemic cells with lower HAP1 levels showed resistance to l-asparaginase, indicating the clinical relevance of HAP1 loss in the development of l-asparaginase resistance, and pointing to HAP1 as a functional l-asparaginase resistance biomarker that may be used for the design of effective treatment of l-asparaginase-resistant ALL.",Cocreating guide dog partnerships: dog training and interdependence in 1930s America.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819924,Medical humanities,2019 03 01,"This article scrutinises issues around disability and dependent (interdependent) agency, extending these to non-human animals and service dogs, with a sustained reference to the training of guide dogs. It does this through a detailed engagement with the training methodology and philosophy of The Seeing Eye guide dog school in the 1930s, exploring the physical, bodily and instrumental means through which the guide dog partnership, and the identity of the instructor, the guide dog and the guide dog owner, jointly came into being. The novelty of the article lies in how it reconsiders what interdependence meant and means from the perspectives drawing from historical and sociological literature on dog training. In doing so it opens up new ways of thinking about service animals that recognise their historical contingency and the complex processes at work in the creation and development of interdependent agency.","When pigs fly: emotional support animals, service dogs and the politics of legitimacy across species boundaries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819923,Medical humanities,2019 03 01,"This paper probes the distinction between the so-called emotional support animals (ESAs), a term that is specific to the USA and that has recently been the subject of significant media attention, and service animals. The attention devoted to ESAs has largely taken on the form of jokes and critical comments related to the absurdity of the 'political correctness' that makes it possible for pigs to fly in the passenger cabin of airplanes and llamas to accompany their owners on trips to the supermarket. Much criticism is meted out, also from within the disability community, against animal guardians who try to 'pass their animals off' as service dogs and ESAs, with a call for the establishment of clear-cut criteria for the definition of ESAs and service animals. The paper's methodology is an analysis of the media accounts of legitimate and illegitimate service animals; an analysis that reveals how the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate is constructed through the building blocks of these stories. ESAs are something of a limit case that points to the cultural paradoxes that govern Americans' relationships with companion animals and with concepts of disability. The paper also argues that the insistence on establishing firm boundaries between 'legitimate' service animals and ESAs actually fosters a politics of suspicion, which can easily slip into suspicion directed at the human handlers of the animals.",Being well together? Promoting health and well-being through more than human collaboration and companionship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819922,Medical humanities,2019 03 01,"Being well together, an inaugural Research Forum, will critically examine the myriad ways humans have formed partnerships with non-human species to improve health across time and place. Across the humanities and social sciences, a growing body of scholarship has begun to rethink the prominence of the 'human' in our accounts of the world by exploring the category less as an individualised essence and more as a temporal process of becoming. From this perspective, being human becomes a process of 'becoming with', performed through interactions with non-human others. This paper introduces a diverse collection of studies, originally presented at a workshop held at the University of Manchester in 2018, which explored how emergent approaches within animal studies might productively and playfully engage with the medical humanities. In each case, human health and well-being is shown to rest on the cultivation of relationships with other species. Being well is rethought and remapped as a more than human process of being well together. Collectively, this research forum invites reflection on what the medical humanities might look like from a more than human perspective.",De novo adult acute myeloid leukemia patients display at diagnosis functional deregulation of redox balance correlated with molecular subtypes and overall survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819920,Haematologica,2019 03 01,,A high definition picture of key genes and pathways mutated in pediatric follicular lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819919,Haematologica,2019 03 01,

Additionally, p66Shc controls the expression and function of chemokine receptors that regulate lymphocyte traffic. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have a p66Shc expression defect which contributes to their extended survival and correlates with poor prognosis. We have analyzed the impact of p66Shc ablation on disease severity and progression in the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia Eμ-TCL1. We show that Eμ-TCL1/p66Shc-/- mice develop an aggressive disease that has an earlier onset, a higher incidence and leads to earlier death compared to Eμ-TCL1 mice. Eμ-TCL1/p66Shc-/- mice display substantial leukemic cell accumulation in both nodal and extranodal sites. The target organ selectivity correlates with an upregulation of chemokine receptors whose ligands are expressed therein. This also applies to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, where chemokine receptor expression and extent of organ infiltration were found to inversely correlate with their p66Shc expression levels. p66Shc expression declined with disease progression in Eμ-TCL1 mice and could be restored by treatment with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ibrutinib. Our results highlight p66Shc deficiency as an important factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression and severity and underscore p66Shc expression as a relevant therapeutic target.","Red cell autoimmunization and alloimmunization in myelodysplastic syndromes: prevalence, characteristic and significance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819906,Haematologica,2019 03 01,,Complications of whole-exome sequencing for causal gene discovery in primary platelet secretion defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819905,Haematologica,2019 03 01,"Primary platelet secretion defects are heterogeneous group of functional defects characterized by reduced platelet granule secretion upon stimulation by different agonists. The clinical and laboratory heterogeneity of primary platelet secretion defects warrants a tailored approach. We performed a pilot study in order to develop DNA sequence analysis pipelines for gene discovery and to create a list of candidate causal genes for platelet secretion defects. Whole-exome sequencing analysis of 14 unrelated Italian patients with primary secretion defects and 16 controls was performed on Illumina HiSeq. Variant prioritization was carried out using two filtering approaches: identification of rare, potentially damaging variants in platelet candidate genes or by selecting singletons. To corroborate the results, exome sequencing was applied in a family, in which platelet secretion defects and bleeding diathesis were present. Platelet candidate gene analysis revealed gene defects in 10/14 patients, which included ADRA2A, ARHGAP1, DIAPH1, EXOC1, FCGR2A, ITPR1, LTBP1, PTPN7, PTPN12, PRKACG, PRKCD, RAP1GAP, STXBP5L, and VWF. The analysis of singletons identified additional gene defects in PLG and PHACTR2 in two other patients. The familial analysis confirmed a missense variant p.D1144N in the STXBP5L gene and p.P83H in the KCNMB3 gene as potentially causal. In summary, exome sequencing revealed potential causal variants in 12 of 14 patients with primary platelet secretion defects, highlighting the limitations of the genomic approaches for causal gene identification in this heterogeneous clinical and laboratory phenotype.",Arrayed molecular barcoding identifies TNFSF13 as a positive regulator of acute myeloid leukemia-initiating cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819903,Haematologica,2019 03 01,"Dysregulation of cytokines in the bone marrow microenvironment promotes acute myeloid leukemia cell growth. Due to the complexity and low throughput of in vivo stem-cell based assays, studying the role of cytokines in the bone marrow niche in a screening setting is challenging. Herein, we developed an ex vivo cytokine screen using 11 arrayed molecular barcodes, allowing for a competitive in vivo readout of leukemia-initiating capacity. With this approach, we assessed the effect of 114 murine cytokines on MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia mouse cells and identified the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13 (TNFSF13) as a positive regulator of leukemia-initiating cells. By using Tnfsf13-/- recipient mice, we confirmed that TNFSF13 supports leukemia-initiation also under physiological conditions. TNFSF13 was secreted by normal myeloid cells but not by leukemia mouse cells, suggesting that mature myeloid bone marrow cells support leukemia cells by secreting TNFSF13. TNFSF13 supported leukemia cell proliferation in an NF-κB-dependent manner by binding TNFRSF17 and suppressed apoptosis. Moreover, TNFSF13 supported the growth and survival of several human myeloid leukemia cell lines, demonstrating that our findings translate to human disease. Taken together, using arrayed molecular barcoding, we identified a previously unrecognized role of TNFSF13 as a positive regulator of acute myeloid leukemia-initiating cells. The arrayed barcoded screening methodology is not limited to cytokines and leukemia, but can be extended to other types of ex vivo screens, where a multiplexed in vivo read-out of stem cell functionality is needed.",Interleukin-37 monomer is the active form for reducing innate immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819901,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 28,"Interleukin-37 (IL-37), a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, is a fundamental suppressor of innate and acquired immunities. Here, we used an integrative approach that combines biophysical, biochemical, and biological studies to elucidate the unique characteristics of IL-37. Our studies reveal that single amino acid mutations at the IL-37 dimer interface that result in the stable formation of IL-37 monomers also remain monomeric at high micromolar concentrations and that these monomeric IL-37 forms comprise higher antiinflammatory activities than native IL-37 on multiple cell types. We find that, because native IL-37 forms dimers with nanomolar affinity, higher IL-37 only weakly suppresses downstream markers of inflammation whereas lower concentrations are more effective. We further show that IL-37 is a heparin binding protein that modulates this self-association and that the IL-37 dimers must block the activity of the IL-37 monomer. Specifically, native IL-37 at 2.5 nM reduces lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) protein levels by ∼50%, whereas the monomeric D73K mutant reduced VCAM by 90% at the same concentration. Compared with other members of the IL-1 family, both the N and the C termini of IL-37 are extended, and we show they are disordered in the context of the free protein. Furthermore, the presence of, at least, one of these extended termini is required for IL-37 suppressive activity. Based on these structural and biological studies, we present a model of IL-37 interactions that accounts for its mechanism in suppressing innate inflammation.",Encoding biological recognition in a bicomponent cell-membrane mimic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819900,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Self-assembling dendrimers have facilitated the discovery of periodic and quasiperiodic arrays of supramolecular architectures and the diverse functions derived from them. Examples are liquid quasicrystals and their approximants plus helical columns and spheres, including some that disregard chirality. The same periodic and quasiperiodic arrays were subsequently found in block copolymers, surfactants, lipids, glycolipids, and other complex molecules. Here we report the discovery of lamellar and hexagonal periodic arrays on the surface of vesicles generated from sequence-defined bicomponent monodisperse oligomers containing lipid and glycolipid mimics. These vesicles, known as glycodendrimersomes, act as cell-membrane mimics with hierarchical morphologies resembling bicomponent rafts. These nanosegregated morphologies diminish sugar-sugar interactions enabling stronger binding to sugar-binding proteins than densely packed arrangements of sugars. Importantly, this provides a mechanism to encode the reactivity of sugars via their interaction with sugar-binding proteins. The observed sugar phase-separated hierarchical arrays with lamellar and hexagonal morphologies that encode biological recognition are among the most complex architectures yet discovered in soft matter. The enhanced reactivity of the sugar displays likely has applications in material science and nanomedicine, with potential to evolve into related technologies.",Statistics of noisy growth with mechanical feedback in elastic tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819899,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Tissue growth is a fundamental aspect of development and is intrinsically noisy. Stochasticity has important implications for morphogenesis, precise control of organ size, and regulation of tissue composition and heterogeneity. However, the basic statistical properties of growing tissues, particularly when growth induces mechanical stresses that can in turn affect growth rates, have received little attention. Here, we study the noisy growth of elastic sheets subject to mechanical feedback. Considering both isotropic and anisotropic growth, we find that the density-density correlation function shows power law scaling. We also consider the dynamics of marked, neutral clones of cells. We find that the areas (but not the shapes) of two clones are always statistically independent, even when they are adjacent. For anisotropic growth, we show that clone size variance scales like the average area squared and that the mode amplitudes characterizing clone shape show a slow [Formula: see text] decay, where n is the mode index. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic case, where relative variations in clone size and shape vanish at long times. The high variability in clone statistics observed in anisotropic growth is due to the presence of two soft modes-growth modes that generate no stress. Our results lay the groundwork for more in-depth explorations of the properties of noisy tissue growth in specific biological contexts.",Synergy with TGFβ ligands switches WNT pathway dynamics from transient to sustained during human pluripotent cell differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819898,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"WNT/β-catenin signaling is crucial to all stages of life. It controls early morphogenetic events in embryos, maintains stem cell niches in adults, and is dysregulated in many types of cancer. Despite its ubiquity, little is known about the dynamics of signal transduction or whether it varies across contexts. Here we probe the dynamics of signaling by monitoring nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, the primary transducer of canonical WNT signals, using quantitative live cell imaging. We show that β-catenin signaling responds adaptively to constant WNT signaling in pluripotent stem cells, and that these dynamics become sustained on differentiation. Varying dynamics were also observed in the response to WNT in commonly used mammalian cell lines. Signal attenuation in pluripotent cells is observed even at saturating doses, where ligand stability does not affect the dynamics. TGFβ superfamily ligands Activin and BMP, which coordinate with WNT signaling to pattern the gastrula, increase the β-catenin response in a manner independent of their ability to induce new WNT ligand production. Our results reveal how variables external to the pathway, including differentiation status and cross-talk with other pathways, dramatically alter WNT/β-catenin dynamics.",HDAC11 regulates type I interferon signaling through defatty-acylation of SHMT2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819897,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 06,"The smallest histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the only class IV HDAC member, HDAC11, is reported to regulate immune activation and tumorigenesis, yet its biochemical function is largely unknown. Here we identify HDAC11 as an efficient lysine defatty-acylase that is >10,000-fold more efficient than its deacetylase activity. Through proteomics studies, we hypothesized and later biochemically validated SHMT2 as a defatty-acylation substrate of HDAC11. HDAC11-catalyzed defatty-acylation did not affect the enzymatic activity of SHMT2. Instead, it affects the ability of SHMT2 to regulate type I IFN receptor ubiquitination and cell surface level. Correspondingly, HDAC11 depletion increased type I IFN signaling in both cell culture and mice. This study not only demonstrates that HDAC11 has an activity that is much more efficient than the corresponding deacetylase activity, but also expands the physiological functions of HDAC11 and protein lysine fatty acylation, which opens up opportunities to develop HDAC11-specific inhibitors as therapeutics to modulate immune responses.",COX-2 mediates tumor-stromal prolactin signaling to initiate tumorigenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819896,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single-cell RNA sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find up-regulation of prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lungs expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A (Nur77), with prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib abrogates prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, prolactin, and prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine cross-talk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression."

Recent findings indicate that a rare type of gut epithelial cell, tuft cells, can detect the helminth, triggering type 2 immune responses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Here we show that both excretory-secretory products (E-S) and extract of T. spiralis can stimulate the release of the cytokine interleukin 25 (IL-25) from the mouse small intestinal villi and evoke calcium responses from tuft cells in the intestinal organoids, which can be blocked by a bitter-taste receptor inhibitor, allyl isothiocyanate. Heterologously expressed mouse Tas2r bitter-taste receptors, the expression of which is augmented during tuft-cell hyperplasia, can respond to the E-S and extract as well as to the bitter compound salicin whereas salicin in turn can induce IL-25 release from tuft cells. Furthermore, abolishment of the G-protein γ13 subunit, application of the inhibitors for G-protein αo/i, Gβγ subunits, and phospholipase Cβ2 dramatically reduces the IL-25 release. Finally, tuft cells are found to utilize the inositol triphosphate receptor type 2 (Ip3r2) to regulate cytosolic calcium and thus Trpm5 activity, while potentiation of Trpm5 by a sweet-tasting compound, stevioside, enhances tuft cell IL-25 release and hyperplasia in vivo. Taken together, T. spiralis infection activates a signaling pathway in intestinal tuft cells similar to that of taste-bud cells, but with some key differences, to initiate type 2 immunity.",Theory of mechanochemical patterning in biphasic biological tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819884,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"The formation of self-organized patterns is key to the morphogenesis of multicellular organisms, although a comprehensive theory of biological pattern formation is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model combining tissue mechanics with morphogen turnover and transport to explore routes to patterning. Our active description couples morphogen reaction and diffusion, which impact cell differentiation and tissue mechanics, to a two-phase poroelastic rheology, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic cell network and the other one of a permeating extracellular fluid, which provides a feedback by actively transporting morphogens. While this model encompasses previous theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turing's reaction-diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics due to mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we describe a qualitatively different advection-driven Keller-Segel instability which allows for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen and whose fundamental mode pattern robustly scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.",Motional dynamics of single Patched1 molecules in cilia are controlled by Hedgehog and cholesterol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819883,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 28,"The Hedgehog-signaling pathway is an important target in cancer research and regenerative medicine; yet, on the cellular level, many steps are still poorly understood. Extensive studies of the bulk behavior of the key proteins in the pathway established that during signal transduction they dynamically localize in primary cilia, antenna-like solitary organelles present on most cells. The secreted Hedgehog ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) binds to its receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) in primary cilia, causing its inactivation and delocalization from cilia. At the same time, the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) is released of its inhibition by PTCH1 and accumulates in cilia. We used advanced, single molecule-based microscopy to investigate these processes in live cells. As previously observed for SMO, PTCH1 molecules in cilia predominantly move by diffusion and less frequently by directional transport, and spend a fraction of time confined. After treatment with SHH we observed two major changes in the motional dynamics of PTCH1 in cilia. First, PTCH1 molecules spend more time as confined, and less time freely diffusing. This result could be mimicked by a depletion of cholesterol from cells. Second, after treatment with SHH, but not after cholesterol depletion, the molecules that remain in the diffusive state showed a significant increase in the diffusion coefficient. Therefore, PTCH1 inactivation by SHH changes the diffusive motion of PTCH1, possibly by modifying the membrane microenvironment in which PTCH1 resides.",Lipid transporter TMEM24/C2CD2L is a Ca2+-regulated component of ER-plasma membrane contacts in mammalian neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819882,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 31,"Close appositions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM) are a general feature of all cells and are abundant in neurons. A function of these appositions is lipid transport between the two adjacent bilayers via tethering proteins that also contain lipid transport modules. However, little is known about the properties and dynamics of these proteins in neurons. Here we focused on TMEM24/C2CD2L, an ER-localized SMP domain containing phospholipid transporter expressed at high levels in the brain, previously shown to be a component of ER-PM contacts in pancreatic β-cells. TMEM24 is enriched in neurons versus glial cells and its levels increase in parallel with neuronal differentiation. It populates ER-PM contacts in resting neurons, but elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by experimental manipulations or spontaneous activity induce its transient redistribution throughout the entire ER. Dissociation of TMEM24 from the plasma membrane is mediated by phosphorylation of an array of sites in the C-terminal region of the protein. These sites are only partially conserved in C2CD2, the paralogue of TMEM24 primarily expressed in nonneuronal tissues, which correspondingly display a much lower sensitivity to Ca2+ elevations. ER-PM contacts in neurons are also sites where Kv2 (the major delayed rectifier K+ channels in brain) and other PM and ER ion channels are concentrated, raising the possibility of a regulatory feedback mechanism between neuronal excitability and lipid exchange between the ER and the PM.","It would be wrong to say everything's gone smoothly, but I love what I do now.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819880,The Veterinary record,2019 03 01,"Vet nurse Jane Davidson teaches clinical skills - it's a job she loves.

The purpose of this study was to assess prenatal health care professionals' levels of knowledge regarding oral health and its effect on pregnancy outcomes, examine their current practices in evaluating oral health, and determine their attitudes towards a multidisciplinary approach to providing comprehensive prenatal care.Methods: Data was collected from a web-based survey administered to a convenience sample of prenatal health professionals in a healthcare organization located in the Midwestern United States. Responses were summarized with descriptive statistics. A knowledge score was utilized to compare midwives and nurse practitioners to physicians and residents.Results: Seventy-six prenatal health care professionals (n=76) agreed to participate for a response rate of 37%, with the majority (80%) of respondents considering oral health to be an important component of prenatal care. In regards to the inclusion of oral health in current practice, only 6% of the respondents ""always"" include an oral health history interview and only 7% ""always"" include a dental screening as part of prenatal care. A moderate correlation was found between the knowledge score and the frequency of including oral health history interviews during prenatal visits (correlation = 0.36, p=0.002).Conclusion: The majority of prenatal health care professionals surveyed were knowledgeable about oral health as it relates to prenatal care; however, a deficit was identified in current practice in regards to oral health history interviewing and conducting dental screenings. There is a need to implement best practice guidelines that include routine dental screenings and to engage pregnant women in oral health prevention practices. Optimal oral health requires a multidisciplinary approach in which dental hygienists can play a significant role by educating women's healthcare providers and raising awareness of the connection between oral health and pregnancy outcomes.",Magnification and Coaxial Illumination in Dental Hygiene Education: Experience and attitudes of clinical educators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819841,Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,2019 03 01,"Purpose: Static postural demands and precise movements involved with instrumentation, place dental professionals at high occupational risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Using magnification loupes and coaxial illumination may lower the risk of developing a future MSD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experiences and attitudes among clinical dental hygiene educators in Ohio regarding requiring the use of magnification loupes and coaxial illumination in academic settings.Methods: Clinical dental hygiene faculty members from the 12 dental hygiene programs in Ohio were invited to participate in a cross-sectional, electronic survey consisting of 28 items. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the educators' experiences with magnification loupes and coaxial illumination in academic settings.Results: Responses from 54 participants from the non-probability sample were analyzed. A majority (86%) of the respondents used magnification in their role as clinical faculty members; 94% felt that clinical faculty members and 92% felt students should be required to use magnification in academic settings. Of the 54% using coaxial illumination while caring for patients, 94% used illumination in their role as clinical faculty members. A majority of these respondents (94%) felt clinical faculty members, and students (82%) should be required to use coaxial illumination in academic settings. Improved ergonomics, increased accuracy, and efficiency were cited as the perceived rationale for mandating the use of magnification and illumination.Conclusion: Dental hygiene faculty using magnification loupes and coaxial illumination in clinical practice and in academic settings supported requiring faculty and students to use magnification and illumination.",Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819831,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 03 01,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children with 1 in 200 episodes of adrenal crisis resulting in death. The goal of this working group of the Pediatric Endocrine Society Drug and Therapeutics Committee was to raise awareness on the importance of early recognition of AI, to advocate for the availability of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS) on emergency medical service (EMS) ambulances or allow EMS personnel to administer patient's HSS home supply to avoid delay in administration of life-saving stress dosing, and to provide guidance on the emergency management of children in adrenal crisis. Currently, hydrocortisone, or an equivalent synthetic glucocorticoid, is not available on most ambulances for emergency stress dose administration by EMS personnel to a child in adrenal crisis. At the same time, many States have regulations preventing the use of patient's home HSS supply to be used to treat acute adrenal crisis. In children with known AI, parents and care providers must be made familiar with the administration of maintenance and stress dose glucocorticoid therapy to prevent adrenal crises. Patients with known AI and their families should be provided an Adrenal Insufficiency Action Plan, including stress hydrocortisone dose (both oral and intramuscular/intravenous) to be provided immediately to EMS providers and triage personnel in urgent care and emergency departments. Advocacy efforts to increase the availability of stress dose HSS during EMS transport care and add HSS to weight-based dosing tapes are highly encouraged.",The Role of Radiation Oncology in Immuno-Oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819830,The oncologist,2019 03 07,"Despite the promising efficacy of immunotherapy in some patients, many other patients are resistant. The synergistic effect of radiotherapy (RT) in combination with immunotherapy reported in case reports and clinical trials has piqued the interest of radiologists in investigating the underlying mechanisms and efficacy of the combination in preclinical and clinical trials. To date, the reported data are limited to small-sized samples, trials lacking a comparison arm, and trials using diverse immunotherapies, various radiation doses, and fractionations. There are just a few studies comparing the efficacy of immunotherapy and radiotherapy to that of conventional therapies or different combinations. Radiologists should design and conduct clinical trials wisely to confirm the efficacy of the combination, particularly the abscopal effect, identify the best combination of various immunotherapeutic drugs and different radiation models for patients, identify the best sequence of the combination, determine the optimal timing of the combination, select the target site and volume, lower adverse effects, and explore predictive models to identify patients who may benefit from the combination therapy. We expect that these clinical trials performed by radiologists will offer definitive evidence for the wide use of the combination of RT and immunotherapy in clinical practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review will provide an update on the use of a combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy, a cautious interpretation of preliminary results, and future directions for radiologists to perform well-designed clinical trials.",PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Therapy in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Current Status and Future Directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819829,The oncologist,2019 03 07,"The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide, as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies, and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.",Ongoing Phase I Studies of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819827,The oncologist,2019 03 07,"Cancer immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been shown to be a promising strategy in the treatment of various malignancies.

As of June 1, 2018, not a single ICI has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration.",Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Opportunities and Challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819826,The oncologist,2019 03 07,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy worldwide, and is especially common in China. A total of 70%-80% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage and can receive only palliative care. Sorafenib has been the standard of care for a decade, and promising results for regorafenib as a second-line and lenvatinib as a first-line treatment were reported only 1 or 2 years ago. FOLFOX4 was recently recommended as a clinical practice guideline by the China Food and Drug Administration. All approved systemic therapies remain unsatisfactory, with limited objective response rates and poor overall survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) offer great promise in the treatment of a rapidly expanding spectrum of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint molecules are involved in almost the whole process of viral-related hepatitis with cirrhosis and HCC and in the most important resistance mechanism of sorafenib. The approval of nivolumab by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 23, 2017, for the treatment of patients with HCC, based only on a phase I/II clinical trial, is a strong hint that immunotherapy will introduce a new era of HCC therapy. CPI-based strategies will soon be a main approach in anticancer treatment for HCC, and we will observe the rapid advances in the therapeutic use of CPIs, even in an adjuvant setting, with great interest. How shall we face the opportunities and challenges? Can we dramatically improve the prognosis of patients with HCC? This review may provide some informed guidance. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint molecules are involved in almost the whole process of viral-related hepatitis with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in the most important resistance mechanism of sorafenib. As all approved systemic therapies in HCC remain unsatisfactory, checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)-based strategies will soon be a main approach in anticancer treatment for advanced stage of HCC, even in an adjuvant setting. In virus-related HCC, especially hepatitis B virus-related HCC, whether CPIs can control virus relapse should be further investigated. Combination strategies involving conventional therapies and immunotherapies are needed to increase clinical benefit and minimize adverse toxicities with regard to the underlying liver disease.",Genetic obesity increases pancreatic expression of mitochondrial proteins which regulate cholesterol efflux in BRIN-BD11 insulinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819824,Bioscience reports,2019 04 02,"Pancreatic β-cells are sensitive to fluctuations in cholesterol content, which can damage the insulin secretion pathway, contributing to the aetiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoproteins, via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1 (ABCA1), can prevent intracellular cholesterol accumulation; in some peripheral cells, ABCA1-dependent efflux is enhanced by promotion of cholesterol trafficking to, and generation of Liver X receptor (LXR) ligands by, mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27A1 (cytochrome P450 27 A1/sterol 27-hydroxylase)) and its redox partners, adrenodoxin (ADX) and ADX reductase (ADXR). Despite this, the roles of mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein [StAR] and 18-kDa translocator protein [TSPO]) and metabolising proteins in insulin-secreting cells remain wholly uncharacterised. Here, we demonstrate an increase in pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRα, but not ADX or StAR, in obese (fa/fa) rodents compared with lean (Fa/?) controls. Overexpression of Cyp27A1 alone in BRIN-BD11 cells increased INS2 expression, without affecting lipid metabolism; however, after exposure to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein acceptors was enhanced in Cyp27A1-overexpressing cells. Co-transfection of Cyp27A1, ADX and ADXR, at a ratio approximating that in pancreatic tissue, stimulated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in both basal and cholesterol-loaded cells; insulin release was stimulated equally by all acceptors in cholesterol-loaded cells. Thus, genetic obesity increases pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRα, while modulation of Cyp27A1 and its redox partners promotes cholesterol efflux from insulin-secreting cells to acceptor (apo)lipoproteins; this response may help guard against loss of insulin secretion caused by accumulation of excess intracellular cholesterol.",Usefulness Criterion and Post-selection Parental Contributions in Multi-parental Crosses: Application to Polygenic Trait Introgression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819823,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 22,"Predicting the usefulness of crosses in terms of expected genetic gain and genetic diversity is of interest to secure performance in the progeny and to maintain long-term genetic gain in plant breeding. A wide range of crossing schemes are possible including large biparental crosses, backcrosses, four-way crosses, and synthetic populations. In silico progeny simulations together with genome-based prediction of quantitative traits can be used to guide mating decisions. However, the large number of multi-parental combinations can hinder the use of simulations in practice. Analytical solutions have been proposed recently to predict the distribution of a quantitative trait in the progeny of biparental crosses using information of recombination frequency and linkage disequilibrium between loci. Here, we extend this approach to obtain the progeny distribution of more complex crosses including two to four parents. Considering agronomic traits and parental genome contribution as jointly multivariate normally distributed traits, the usefulness criterion parental contribution (UCPC) enables to (i) evaluate the expected genetic gain for agronomic traits, and at the same time (ii) evaluate parental genome contributions to the selected fraction of progeny. We validate and illustrate UCPC in the context of multiple allele introgression from a donor into one or several elite recipients in maize (Zea mays L.). Recommendations regarding the interest of two-way, three-way, and backcrosses were derived depending on the donor performance. We believe that the computationally efficient UCPC approach can be useful for mate selection and allocation in many plant and animal breeding contexts.",An R Package for Bayesian Analysis of Multi-environment and Multi-trait Multi-environment Data for Genome-Based Prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819822,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 05 22,"Evidence that genomic selection (GS) is a technology that is revolutionizing plant breeding continues to grow. However, it is very well documented that its success strongly depends on statistical models, which are used by GS to perform predictions of candidate genotypes that were not phenotyped. Because there is no universally better model for prediction and models for each type of response variable are needed (continuous, binary, ordinal, count, etc.), an active area of research aims to develop statistical models for the prediction of univariate and multivariate traits in GS. However, most of the models developed so far are for univariate and continuous (Gaussian) traits. Therefore, to overcome the lack of multivariate statistical models for genome-based prediction by improving the original version of the BMTME, we propose an improved Bayesian multi-trait and multi-environment (BMTME) R package for analyzing breeding data with multiple traits and multiple environments. We also introduce Bayesian multi-output regressor stacking (BMORS) functions that are considerably efficient in terms of computational resources. The package allows parameter estimation and evaluates the prediction performance of multi-trait and multi-environment data in a reliable, efficient and user-friendly way. We illustrate the use of the BMTME with real toy datasets to show all the facilities that the software offers the user. However, for large datasets, the BME() and BMTME() functions of the BMTME R package are very intense in terms of computing time; on the other hand, less intensive computing is required with BMORS functions BMORS() and BMORS_Env() that are also included in the BMTME package."

Here, using in silico (BLAST) genome analyses, we show that the myomaker gene from trout includes 14 minisatellites, indicating that it has an unusual structure compared with those of other animal species. We found that the trout myomaker gene encodes a 434-amino acid (aa) protein, in accordance with its apparent molecular mass (∼40 kDa) observed by immunoblotting. The first half of the trout myomaker protein (1-220 aa) is similar to the 221-aa mouse myomaker protein, whereas the second half (222-234 aa) does not correspond to any known motifs and arises from two protein extensions. The first extension (∼70 aa) apparently appeared with the radiation of the bony fish clade Euteleostei, whereas the second extension (up to 236 aa) is restricted to the superorder Protacanthopterygii (containing salmonids and pike) and corresponds to the insertion of minisatellites having a length of 30 nucleotides. According to gene expression analyses, trout myomaker expression is consistently associated with the formation of new myofibers during embryonic development, postlarval growth, and muscle regeneration. Using cell-mixing experiments, we observed that trout myomaker has retained the ability to drive the fusion of mouse fibroblasts with C2C12 myoblasts. Our work reveals that trout myomaker has fusogenic function despite containing two protein extensions.","Unraveling the subtleties of β-(1→3)-glucan phosphorylase specificity in the GH94, GH149, and GH161 glycoside hydrolase families.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819804,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 01,"Glycoside phosphorylases (GPs) catalyze the phosphorolysis of glycans into the corresponding sugar 1-phosphates and shortened glycan chains. Given the diversity of natural β-(1→3)-glucans and their wide range of biotechnological applications, the identification of enzymatic tools that can act on β-(1→3)-glucooligosaccharides is an attractive area of research. GP activities acting on β-(1→3)-glucooligosaccharides have been described in bacteria, the photosynthetic excavate Euglena gracilis, and the heterokont Ochromonas spp. Previously, we characterized β-(1→3)-glucan GPs from bacteria and E. gracilis, leading to their classification in glycoside hydrolase family GH149. Here, we characterized GPs from Gram-positive bacteria and heterokont algae acting on β-(1→3)-glucooligosaccharides. We identified a phosphorylase sequence from Ochromonas spp. (OcP1) together with its orthologs from other species, leading us to propose the establishment of a new GH family, designated GH161. To establish the activity of GH161 members, we recombinantly expressed a bacterial GH161 gene sequence (PapP) from the Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa ATCC 842 in Escherichia coli We found that PapP acts on β-(1→3)-glucooligosaccharide acceptors with a degree of polymerization (DP) ≥ 2. This activity was distinct from that of characterized GH149 β-(1→3)-glucan phosphorylases, which operate on acceptors with DP ≥ 1. We also found that bacterial GH161 genes co-localize with genes encoding β-glucosidases and ATP-binding cassette transporters, highlighting a probable involvement of GH161 enzymes in carbohydrate degradation. Importantly, in some species, GH161 and GH94 genes were present in tandem, providing evidence that GPs from different CAZy families may work sequentially to degrade oligosaccharides.",The RING domain in the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP stabilizes c-Myc protein and preserves anchorage-independent growth of bladder cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819803,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 18,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) suppresses apoptosis and plays key roles in the development, growth, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Therefore, XIAP has recently attracted much attention as a potential antineoplastic therapeutic target, requiring elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its biological activities. Here, using shRNA-mediated gene silencing, immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR, anchorage-independent growth assay, and invasive assay, we found that XIAP's RING domain, but not its BIR domain, is crucial for XIAP-mediated up-regulation of c-Myc protein expression in human bladder cancer (BC) cells. Mechanistically, we observed that the RING domain stabilizes c-Myc by inhibiting its phosphorylation at Thr-58 and that this inhibition is due to activated ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at Ser-9. Functional studies further revealed that c-Myc protein promotes anchorage-independent growth and invasion stimulated by the XIAP RING domain in human BC cells. Collectively, the findings in our study uncover that the RING domain of XIAP supports c-Myc protein stability, providing insight into the molecular mechanism and role of c-Myc overexpression in cancer progression. Our observations support the notion of targeting XIAP's RING domain and c-Myc in cancer therapy.",The disordered plant dehydrin Lti30 protects the membrane during water-related stress by cross-linking lipids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819802,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 01,"Dehydrins are intrinsically disordered proteins, generally expressed in plants as a response to embryogenesis and water-related stress. Their suggested functions are in membrane stabilization and cell protection. All dehydrins contain at least one copy of the highly conserved K-segment, proposed to be a membrane-binding motif. The dehydrin Lti30 (Arabidopsis thaliana) is up-regulated during cold and drought stress conditions and comprises six K-segments, each with two adjacent histidines. Lti30 interacts with the membrane electrostatically via pH-dependent protonation of the histidines. In this work, we seek a molecular understanding of the membrane interaction mechanism of Lti30 by determining the diffusion and molecular organization of Lti30 on model membrane systems by imaging total internal reflection- fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ITIR-FCS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The dependence of the diffusion coefficient explored by ITIR-FCS together with MD simulations yields insights into Lti30 binding, domain partitioning, and aggregation. The effect of Lti30 on membrane lipid diffusion was studied on fluorescently labeled supported lipid bilayers of different lipid compositions at mechanistically important pH conditions. In parallel, we compared the mode of diffusion for short individual K-segment peptides. The results indicate that Lti30 binds the lipid bilayer via electrostatics, which restricts the mobility of lipids and bound protein molecules. At low pH, Lti30 binding induced lipid microdomain formation as well as protein aggregation, which could be correlated with one another. Moreover, at physiological pH, Lti30 forms nanoscale aggregates when proximal to the membrane suggesting that Lti30 may protect the cell by ""cross-linking"" the membrane lipids.",2D gel electrophoresis reveals dynamics of t-loop formation during the cell cycle and t-loop in maintenance regulated by heterochromatin state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819801,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 01,"Linear chromosome ends are capped by telomeres that have been previously reported to adopt a t-loop structure. The lack of simple methods for detecting t-loops has hindered progress in understanding the dynamics of t-loop formation and its function in protecting chromosome ends. Here, we employed a classical two-dimensional agarose gel method (2D gel method) to innovatively apply to t-loop detection. Briefly, restriction fragments of genomic DNA were separated in a 2D gel, and the telomere sequence was detected by in-gel hybridization with telomeric probe. Using this method, we found that t-loops are present throughout the cell cycle, and t-loop formation tightly couples to telomere replication. We also observed that t-loop abundance positively correlates with chromatin condensation, i.e. cells with less compact telomeric chromatin (ALT cells and trichostatin A (TSA)-treated HeLa cells) exhibited fewer t-loops. Moreover, we observed that telomere dysfunction-induced foci, ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies, and telomere sister chromatid exchanges are activated upon TSA-induced loss of t-loops. These findings confirm the importance of the t-loop in protecting linear chromosomes from damage or illegitimate recombination.",A Subpopulation of Amygdala Neurons Mediates the Affective Component of Itch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819800,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 25,"Itch consists of both sensory and affective components. For chronic itch patients, the affective component of itch affects both quality of life (leading to psychological comorbidities) and disease prognosis (by promoting scratching of itchy skin). We found that acute itch stimuli, such as histamine, induced anxiety-like behavior and increased activity (c-Fos expression) in the amygdala in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Itch stimuli also increased activity in projection areas to the amygdala, suggesting that these regions form a circuit for affective itch processing. Electrophysiological characterization of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons showed that this population was active on a behaviorally relevant timescale and partially overlapped with pain signaling. Selective optogenetic activation of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons in adult male and female Fos:CreERT2;R26Ai14 mice using the Targeted Recombination in Active Populations system enhanced both scratching and anxiety-like behavior. These results highlight the importance of itch-responsive amygdala neurons in modulating itch-related affect and behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The sensation of itch includes an affective component that leads to stress and anxiety in chronic itch patients. We investigated the neuronal basis of affective itch in mice, with a focus on the amygdala, the key brain region for the generation of anxiety. A subpopulation of amygdala neurons responded to itch stimuli such as histamine. Optogenetic activation of histamine-responsive amygdala neurons affected both scratching and anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, this population appears to be important for mediating the affective component of itch.",AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Regulates Circadian Rhythm by Affecting CLOCK in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819799,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 17,"The circadian clock organizes the physiology and behavior of organisms to their daily environmental rhythms. The central circadian timekeeping mechanism in eukaryotic cells is the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL). In the Drosophila TTFL, the transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) play crucial roles in activating expression of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes. Many signaling pathways converge on the CLK/CYC complex and regulate its activity to fine-tune the cellular oscillator to environmental time cues. We aimed to identify factors that regulate CLK by performing tandem affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry using Drosophila S2 cells that stably express HA/FLAG-tagged CLK and V5-tagged CYC. We identified SNF4Aγ, a homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase γ (AMPKγ), as a factor that copurified with HA/FLAG-tagged CLK. The AMPK holoenzyme composed of a catalytic subunit AMPKα and two regulatory subunits, AMPKβ and AMPKγ, directly phosphorylated purified CLK in vitro Locomotor behavior analysis in Drosophila revealed that knockdown of each AMPK subunit in pacemaker neurons induced arrhythmicity and long periods. Knockdown of AMPKβ reduced CLK levels in pacemaker neurons, and thereby reduced pre-mRNA and protein levels of CLK downstream core clock genes, such as period and vrille Finally, overexpression of CLK reversed the long-period phenotype that resulted from AMPKβ knockdown. Thus, we conclude that AMPK, a central regulator of cellular energy metabolism, regulates the Drosophila circadian clock by stabilizing CLK and activating CLK/CYC-dependent transcription.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Regulation of the circadian transcription factors CLK and CYC is fundamental to synchronize the core clock with environmental changes. Here, we show that the AMPKγ subunit of AMPK, a central regulator of cellular metabolism, copurifies with the CLK/CYC complex in Drosophila S2 cells. Furthermore, the AMPK holoenzyme directly phosphorylates CLK in vitro This study demonstrates that AMPK activity regulates the core clock in Drosophila by activating CLK, which enhances circadian transcription. In mammals, AMPK affects the core clock by downregulating circadian repressor proteins. It is intriguing to note that AMPK activity is required for core clock regulation through circadian transcription enhancement, whereas the target of AMPK action is different in Drosophila and mammals (positive vs negative element, respectively).",The Late Endosomal Pathway Regulates the Ciliary Targeting of Tetraspanin Protein Peripherin 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819798,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 18,"Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) is a tetraspanin protein concentrated in the light-sensing cilium (called the outer segment) of the vertebrate photoreceptor. The mechanism underlying the ciliary targeting of PRPH2 and the etiology of cone dystrophy caused by PRPH2 mutations remain elusive. Here we show that the late endosome (LE) is the main waystation that critically sorts newly synthesized PRPH2 to the cilium. PRPH2 is expressed in the luminal membrane of the LE. We delineate multiple C-terminal motifs of PRPH2 that distinctively regulate its LE and ciliary targeting through ubiquitination and binding to ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) component Hrs. Using the newly developed TetOn-inducible system in transfected male and female mouse cones in vivo, we show that the entry of nascent PRPH2 into the cone outer segment can be blocked by either cone dystrophy-causing C-terminal mutations of PRPH2, or by short-term perturbation of the LE or recycling endosomal traffic. These findings open new avenues of research to explore the biological role of the LE in the biosynthetic pathway and the etiology of cone dystrophy caused by PRPH2 mutations and/or malfunctions of the LE.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) is a tetraspanin protein abundantly expressed in the light-sensing cilium, the outer segment, of the vertebrate photoreceptor. The mechanism underlying the ciliary transport of PRPH2 is unclear. The present study reveals a novel ciliary targeting pathway, in which the newly synthesized PRPH2 is first targeted to the lumen of the late endosome (LE) en route to the cilia. We deciphered the protein motifs and the machinery that regulates the LE trafficking of PRPH2. Using a novel TetOn-inducible system in transfected mouse cones, we showed that the LE pathway of PRPH2 is critical for its outer segment expression. A cone dystrophy-causing mutation impairs the LE and ciliary targeting of PRPH2, implicating the relevance of LE to cone/macular degenerative diseases.","Single Synapse Indicators of Impaired Glutamate Clearance Derived from Fast iGlu

 Imaging of Cortical Afferents in the Striatum of Normal and Huntington (Q175) Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819797,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 19,"Changes in the balance between glutamate (Glu) release and uptake may stimulate synaptic reorganization and even synapse loss. In the case of neurodegeneration, a mismatch between astroglial Glu uptake and presynaptic Glu release could be detected if both parameters were assessed independently and at a single-synapse level. This has now become possible due to a new imaging assay with the genetically encoded ultrafast Glu sensor iGlu

 We report findings from individual corticostriatal synapses in acute slices prepared from mice of either sex that were >1 year of age. Contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity and a size criterion identified two classes of terminals, presumably corresponding to the previously defined IT (intratelencephalic) and PT (pyramidal tract) synapses. The latter exhibited a higher degree of frequency potentiation/residual Glu accumulation and were selected for our first iGlu

 single-synapse study in Q175 mice, a model of Huntington's disease (HD). In HD mice, the decay time constant of the perisynaptic Glu concentration (TauD), as an indicator of uptake, and the peak iGlu 
u
 amplitude, as an indicator of release, were prolonged and reduced, respectively. Treatment of WT preparations with the astrocytic Glu uptake blocker TFB-TBOA (100 nm) mimicked the TauD changes in homozygotes. Considering the largest TauD values encountered in WT, ∼40% of PT synapses tested in Q175 heterozygotes can be classified as dysfunctional. Moreover, HD but not WT synapses exhibited a positive correlation between TauD and the peak amplitude of iGlu 
u
 Finally, EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transport protein 2) immunoreactivity was reduced next to corticostriatal terminals. Thus, astrocytic Glu transport remains a promising target for therapeutic intervention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alterations in astrocytic Glu uptake can play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Until now, the sensitivity of synaptic responses to pharmacological transport block and the resulting activation of NMDA receptors were regarded as reliable evidence for a mismatch between synaptic uptake and release. But the latter parameters are interdependent. Using a new genetically encoded sensor to monitor extracellular glutamate concentration ([Glu]) at individual corticostriatal synapses, we can now quantify the time constant of perisynaptic [Glu] decay (as an indicator of uptake) and the maximal [Glu] elevation next to the active zone (as an indicator of Glu release). The results provide a positive answer to the hitherto unresolved question of whether neurodegeneration (e.g., Huntington's disease) associates with a glutamate uptake deficit at tripartite excitatory synapses.",Factors Affecting Interindividual Variability of Hepatic UGT2B17 Protein Expression Examined Using a Novel Specific Monoclonal Antibody.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819787,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 29,"Accurate quantification of the metabolic enzyme uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) UGT2B17 has been hampered by the high sequence identity with other UGT2B enzymes (as high as 94%) and by the lack of a specific antibody. Knowing the significance of the UGT2B17 pathway in drug and hormone metabolism and cancer, we developed a specific monoclonal antibody (EL-2B17mAb), initially validated by the lack of detection in liver microsomes of an individual carrying no UGT2B17 gene copy and in supersomes expressing UGT2B enzymes. Immunohistochemical detection in livers revealed strong labeling of bile ducts and variable labeling of hepatocytes. Expression levels assessed by immunoblotting were highly correlated to mass spectrometry-based quantification (r = 0.93), and three major expression patterns (absent, low, or high) were evidenced. Livers with very low expression were carriers of the functional rs59678213 G variant, located in the binding site for the transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) of the UGT2B17 promoter. The highest level of expression was observed for individuals carrying at least one rs59678213 A allele. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the number of gene copies explained only 8% of UGT2B17 protein expression, 49% when adding rs59678213, reaching 54% when including sex. The novel EL-2B17mAb antibody allowed specific UGT2B17 quantification and exposed different patterns of hepatic expression. It further suggests that FOXA1 is a key driver of UGT2B17 expression in the liver. The availability of this molecular tool will help characterize the UGT2B17 level in various disease states and establish more precisely the contribution of the UGT2B17 enzyme to drug and hormone metabolism."

However, the clinical use of β2-AR agonists for skeletal muscle wasting conditions has been limited by their undesired cardiovascular effects. Here, we describe the preclinical pharmacological profile of a novel 5-hydroxybenzothiazolone (5-HOB) derived β2-AR agonist in comparison with formoterol as a representative β2-AR agonist that have been well characterized. In vitro, 5-HOB has nanomolar affinity for the human β2-AR and selectivity over the β1-AR and β3-AR. 5-HOB also shows potent agonistic activity at the β2-AR in primary skeletal muscle myotubes and induces hypertrophy of skeletal muscle myotubes. Compared with formoterol, 5-HOB demonstrates comparable full-agonist activity on cAMP production in skeletal muscle cells and skeletal muscle tissue-derived membranes. In contrast, a greatly reduced intrinsic activity was determined in cardiomyocytes and cell membranes prepared from the rat heart. In addition, 5-HOB shows weak effects on chronotropy, inotropy, and vascular relaxation compared with formoterol. In vivo, 5-HOB significantly increases hind limb muscle weight in rats with attenuated effects on heart weight and ejection fraction, unlike formoterol. Furthermore, changes in cardiovascular parameters after bolus subcutaneous treatment in rats and rhesus monkeys are significantly lower with 5-HOB compared with formoterol. In conclusion, the pharmacological profile of 5-HOB indicates superior tissue selectivity compared with the conventional β2-AR agonist formoterol in preclinical studies and supports the notion that such tissue-selective agonists should be investigated for the safe treatment of muscle-wasting conditions without cardiovascular limiting effects.",High kinesin family member 11 expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819726,Journal of clinical pathology,2019 05 01,"Kinesin family member 11 (Kif11) is a member of the kinesin family motor proteins, which is associated with spindle formation and tumour genesis.

LOX-1 promotes endothelial activation and dysfunction by mediating uptake of oxidized LDL and inducing pro-atherogenic signaling. However, little is known about modulators of LOX-1-mediated responses. Here, we show that the function of LOX-1 is controlled proteolytically. Ectodomain shedding by the metalloprotease ADAM10 and lysosomal degradation generate membrane-bound N-terminal fragments (NTFs), which we identified as novel substrates of the intramembrane proteases signal peptide peptidase-like 2a and b (SPPL2a/b). SPPL2a/b control cellular LOX-1 NTF levels which, following self-association via their transmembrane domain, can activate MAP kinases in a ligand-independent manner. This leads to an up-regulation of several pro-atherogenic and pro-fibrotic targets including ICAM-1 and the connective tissue growth factor CTGF. Consequently, SPPL2a/b-deficient mice, which accumulate LOX-1 NTFs, develop larger and more advanced atherosclerotic plaques than controls. This identifies intramembrane proteolysis by SPPL2a/b as a novel atheroprotective mechanism via negative regulation of LOX-1 signaling.",Adult diet does not compensate for impact of a poor larval diet on stress resistance in a tephritid fruit fly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819722,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 28,"Adult holometabolous insects may derive metabolic resources from either larval or adult feeding, but little is known of whether adult diets can compensate for deficiencies in the larval diet in terms of stress resistance. We investigated how stress resistance is affected and compensated for by diet across life stages in the marula fruit fly Ceratitis cosyra (Diptera: Tephritidae). Larvae were fed diets containing either 8% torula yeast, the standard diet used to rear this species, or 1% yeast (low protein content similar to known host fruit). At emergence, adults from each larval diet were tested for initial mass, water content, body composition, and desiccation and starvation resistance or they were allocated to one of two adult diet treatments: sucrose only, or sucrose and yeast hydrolysate. The same assays were then repeated after 10 days of adult feeding. Development on a low protein larval diet led to lower body mass and improved desiccation and starvation resistance in newly emerged adults, even though adults from the high protein larval diet had the highest water content. Adult feeding decreased desiccation or starvation resistance, regardless of the diet provided. Irrespective of larval diet history, newly emerged, unfed adults had significantly higher dehydration tolerance than those that were fed. Lipid reserves played a role in starvation resistance. There was no evidence for metabolic water from stored nutrients extending desiccation resistance.

HIF-1 pathway is one of the survival pathways activated in tumor in response to hypoxia. In hypoxic condition, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is stabilized and translocated into nucleus where it forms heterodimer with HIF-1β and regulates the expression of a plethora of genes involved in different processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, vascularization/angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis. Recruitment of co-activator p300 or CBP to HIF-1α is critical to the transactivation activity of HIF-1 dimer, therefore, small molecules which can block the dimerization of HIF-1α and HIF-1β or inhibit the interaction between HIF-1α and p300 can function as inhibitors of HIF-1 and have the potential to be developed as novel therapies for the treatment of human cancers. In this review, recent progress of small molecular inhibitors of protein-protein interactions targeting HIF-1 is summarized, the mechanism of functions of these compounds and their potential usage as anti-cancer agents have also been discussed.",Discovery of (S)-6-methoxy-chroman-3-carboxylic acid (4-pyridin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide as potent and isoform selective ROCK2 inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819619,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 03 17,"ROCK1 and ROCK2 are highly homologous isoforms.

The PTX-SAHA co-prodrugs were conjugated by glycine (1a) and succinic acid (1b) respectively and the former has shown better activity in cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest and western-blot experiments. Therefore, 1a was further prepared to nanomicelles with mPEG2000-PLA1750 as the carrier by using thin film method. PTX-SAHA co-prodrug nanomicelles were spherical with a particle size of 20-100 nm. In vitro drug release test showed 1a nanomicelles had sustained release effect, which could reduce the resistance of PTX. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by SRB assay in HCT-116 cells, MCF-7 cells and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. The results showed 1a nanomicelles had comparable or even better cytotoxicity than PTX especially in the MCF-7/ADR cells.

In this study, upon the reaction of hemoglobin with 2-octenal, we unexpectedly detected a product corresponding to the reduced form of the 2-octenal-histidine Michael adduct plus 14 mass unit. Based on the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of synthetic adduct candidates, the adduct was identified to be Nτ-(1-carboxyheptan-2-yl)-histidine (CHH), a novel alkanoic acid-type histidine adduct. The alkanoic acid-histidine adducts were detected in the 2-alkenal-treated hemoglobin and myoglobin, but not in the 2-alkenal-treated cytochrome c and transferrin. The addition of hemin to the reaction mixture, containing a non-heme protein and 2-alkenals, resulted in the formation of the alkanoic acid-histidine adducts, suggesting that a heme iron may play a role in the oxidation of covalently modified proteins. Moreover, using the stable isotope dilution method, we showed evidence for the endogenous formation of CHH in red blood cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Thus, this study establishes a novel mechanism for covalent modification of proteins by 2-alkenals, in which heme iron is involved in the formation of the alkanoic acid-histidine adducts. The potential implications of this novel adduct are discussed."

Schizophrenia is also associated with structural cortical abnormalities including lower gray matter (GM) concentration, GM volume, and cortical thickness relative to healthy control individuals. However, the association between GM measures and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia is still not well understood. Here, we applied parallel independent component analysis (pICA), a higher-order statistical approach that identifies covarying patterns within two (or more) data modalities simultaneously, to link covarying brain networks of GM concentration with covarying linear combinations of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). In a large sample of patients with schizophrenia (n = 337) the association between these two data modalities was investigated. The pICA revealed a distinct PANSS profile characterized by increased delusional symptoms, suspiciousness, hallucinations, and anxiety, that was associated with a pattern of lower GM concentration in inferior temporal gyri and fusiform gyri and higher GM concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. GM alterations replicate previous findings; additionally, applying a multivariate technique, we were able to map a very specific symptom profile onto these GM alterations extending our understanding of cortical abnormalities associated with schizophrenia.

The effects of SBI on metabolism, antioxidant capacity, hormonal balance and reproductive performance of male rabbits were investigated. Adult male rabbits (n = 21) fed an isoflavone-free diet were orally treated with 0 (control; CON), 5 (small; LSBI) or 20 (large; HSBI) mg of SBI/kg body weight/day for 12 weeks. Both SBI doses resulted in lesser blood plasma total protein concentrations, while there were no effects on glucose and cholesterol concentrations compared to CON. The HSBI-treated males had the greatest (P <  0.05) blood plasma total antioxidant capacity and least malondialdehyde. Treatment with both SBI doses induced a 43% increase in triiodothyronine concentrations (P < 0.05) and 82% in reaction times (P <  0.001), while decreased sperm concentrations (P =  0.01) and blood plasma testosterone concentrations (P =  0.017) 26% and 19%, respectively.

In conclusion, only the HSBI treatment improved antioxidant status; whereas, treatment with both LSBI and HSBI doses induced a hormonal imbalance which led to an impaired testis function indicating the sensitivity of the adult male reproductive system to SBI actions.",Influenza A M2 Channel Clustering at High Protein/Lipid Ratios: Viral Budding Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819568,Biophysical journal,2019 04 06,"Protein dynamics in crowded environments is important for understanding protein functions in vivo and is especially relevant for membrane proteins because of the roles of protein-protein interactions in membrane protein functions and their regulation. Here, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy in combination with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we report that the rotational correlation time for the transmembrane domain of the influenza A M2 proton channel in lipid bilayers increases dramatically at an elevated protein/lipid ratio. This increase is attributable to persistent protein-protein interactions, thus revealing for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, extensive cluster formation of the M2 tetrameric channel. Such clustering appears to have direct biological relevance during budding of the nascent influenza virus, which does not use the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport machinery. Indeed, initial coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the longer M2 construct known as the conductance domain suggest clustering-induced membrane curvature formation.",Solvatochromic Modeling of Laurdan for Multiple Polarity Analysis of Dihydrosphingomyelin Bilayer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819567,Biophysical journal,2019 03 29,"The hydration properties of the interface between lipid bilayers and bulk water are important for determining membrane characteristics. Here, the emission properties of a solvent-sensitive fluorescence probe, 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylamino naphthalene (Laurdan), were evaluated in lipid bilayer systems composed of the sphingolipids D-erythro-N-palmitoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine (PSM) and D-erythro-N-palmitoyl-dihydrosphingomyelin (DHPSM). The glycerophospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-oleoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were used as controls. The fluorescence properties of Laurdan in sphingolipid bilayers indicated multiple excited states according to the results obtained from the emission spectra, fluorescence anisotropy, and the center-of-mass spectra during the decay time. Deconvolution of the Laurdan emission spectra into four components based on the solvent model enabled us to identify the varieties of hydration and the configurational states derived from intermolecular hydrogen bonding in sphingolipids. Sphingolipids showed specific, interfacial hydration properties stemming from their intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Particularly, the Laurdan in DHPSM revealed more hydrated properties compared to PSM, even though DHPSM has a higher Tm than PSM. Because DHPSM forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules (in 2NH configurational functional groups), the interfacial region of the DHPSM bilayer was expected to be in a highly polar environment. The careful analysis of Laurdan emission spectra through the four-component deconvolution in this study provides important insights for understanding the multiple polarity in the lipid membrane.",Measuring Mobility in Chromatin by Intensity-Sorted FCS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819566,Biophysical journal,2019 04 06,"The architectural organization of chromatin can play an important role in genome regulation by affecting the mobility of molecules within its surroundings via binding interactions and molecular crowding. The diffusion of molecules at specific locations in the nucleus can be studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a well-established technique based on the analysis of fluorescence intensity fluctuations detected in a confocal observation volume. However, detecting subtle variations of mobility between different chromatin regions remains challenging with currently available FCS methods. Here, we introduce a method that samples multiple positions by slowly scanning the FCS observation volume across the nucleus. Analyzing the data in short time segments, we preserve the high temporal resolution of single-point FCS while probing different nuclear regions in the same cell. Using the intensity level of the probe (or a DNA marker) as a reference, we efficiently sort the FCS segments into different populations and obtain average correlation functions that are associated to different chromatin regions. This sorting and averaging strategy renders the method statistically robust while preserving the observation of intranuclear variations of mobility. Using this approach, we quantified diffusion of monomeric GFP in high versus low chromatin density regions. We found that GFP mobility was reduced in heterochromatin, especially within perinucleolar heterochromatin. Moreover, we found that modulation of chromatin compaction by ATP depletion, or treatment with solutions of different osmolarity, differentially affected the ratio of diffusion in both regions. Then, we used the approach to probe the mobility of estrogen receptor-α in the vicinity of an integrated multicopy prolactin gene array. Finally, we discussed the coupling of this method with stimulated emission depletion FCS for performing FCS at subdiffraction spatial scales.",Kindlin Is Mechanosensitive: Force-Induced Conformational Switch Mediates Cross-Talk among Integrins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819565,Biophysical journal,2019 04 06,"Mechanical stresses directly regulate the function of several proteins of the integrin-mediated focal adhesion complex as they experience intra- and extracellular forces. Kindlin is a largely overlooked member of the focal adhesion complex whose roles in cellular mechanotransduction are only recently being identified. Recent crystallographic experiments have revealed that kindlins can form dimers that bind simultaneously to two integrins, providing a mechanistic explanation of how kindlins may promote integrin activation and clustering. In this study, using the newly identified molecular structure, we modeled the response of the kindlin2 dimer in complex with integrin β1 to mechanical cytoskeletal forces on integrins. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that forces on integrins are directly transmitted to the kindlin2 dimerization site, resulting in a shift in an R577-S550/E553 interaction network at this site. Under force, R577 on one protomer switches from interacting with S550 to forming new hydrogen bonds with E553 on the neighboring protomer, resulting in the strengthening of the kindlin2 dimer in complex with integrin β1. This force-induced strengthening is similar to the catch-bond mechanisms that have previously been observed in other adhesion molecules. Based on our results, we propose that the kindlin2 dimer is mechanosensitive and can strengthen integrin-mediated focal adhesions under force by shifting the interactions at its dimerization sites.",Analysis for the Association Between Corpus Callosum Thickness and Corpus Callosotomy Outcomes for Patients With Epileptic Spasms or Tonic Spasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819564,Pediatric neurology,2019 05 21,This retrospective study is designed to determine whether the thickness of the corpus callosum can predict corpus callosotomy outcome in pediatric patients with epileptic or tonic spasms.,Intraoperative optical pachymetry in photorefractive keratectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819562,Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,2019 04 05,To study the effect of variables on the accuracy and reliability of the optical pachymeter built into the WaveLight EX500 excimer laser during photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).,More eyes with 20/10 distance visual acuity at 12 months versus 3 months in a topography-guided excimer laser trial: Possible contributing factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819561,Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,2019 04 29,"To study eyes with 20/10 uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) 3 months and 12 months after topography-guided LASIK for myopia and myopic astigmatism, and to identify factors predictive of this excellent level of visual acuity.",Triple procedure for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy in complicated cataract surgery: Glued IOL with single-pass four-throw pupilloplasty with pre-Descemet's endothelial keratoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819560,Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,2019 04 05,"Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy is a major deterrent to visual recovery after a complicated cataract surgery.

Reef fish offer a unique opportunity to address such questions because they are ecologically and phylogenetically diverse and have the largest variety of pigment cell types known in vertebrates. In addition to recent development of their genetic resources, reef fish also constitute experimental models that allow the discrimination of ecological, developmental, and evolutionary processes at work. Here, we emphasize how the study of color patterns in reef fish can be integrated in an Eco/Evo/Devo (ecological evolutionary developmental) perspective and we illustrate that such an approach can bring new insights on the evolution of complex phenotypes.","Sleep ultradian cycling: Statistical distribution and links with other sleep variables, depression, insomnia and sleepiness-A retrospective study on 2,312 polysomnograms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819535,Psychiatry research,2019 03 01,"The number of alternations between Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in humans is usually considered to consist of 4-5 cycles of about 90 minutes duration per night. Previous studies by our group showed a normal distribution on 26 healthy human subjects. The present study retrospectively analyzes the polysomnograms of 2,312 unmedicated patients who were admitted for medical and/or psychiatric reasons in the Erasme University Hospital between 2003 and 2014. The normal distribution of the Number of Cycles and Mean Cycle Duration was confirmed. Q-Q plots were very close to linearity. This distribution allows the use of these variables in parametric comparisons. The Number of Cycles per night and the Mean Cycle Duration showed predominant links with REM sleep-related variables, such as the REM Latency, REM sleep duration, the REM/NREM sleep ratio. None of these variables was associated with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, nor the intensity of Depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (short version).

These two constructs are considered subcomponents of cognitive (CE) and affective empathy (AE), respectively. However, the IRI does not enable for valid investigation of overall levels of these empathy types. Surprisingly, although some findings from the general population suggest that empathy types may be positively related to altruism, neither this link nor general altruism have been examined in BPD. Additionally, these constructs have not been sufficiently studied in this group in the context of alexithymia or potential clinical confounders. Hence, women with BPD (N = 30) and healthy women (N = 38) completed, i.a., the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy, Self-Report Altruism Scale, TAS-20, STAI, and CESD-R. Patients with BPD reported significantly decreased overall CE (including worse online simulation abilities - conceptually similar to perspective taking from the IRI), but a similar level of overall AE. They also demonstrated lower altruism. Taken together, these results suggest that BPD patients have difficulties with imagining what emotions others are feeling and with altruistic responding to their needs.",Ci-hox12 tail gradient precedes and participates in the control of the apoptotic-dependent tail regression during Ciona larva metamorphosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819533,Developmental biology,2019 04 28,"At the onset of the Ciona intestinalis metamorphosis, the first event is tail regression characterized, by a contraction, an apoptotic wave and Primordial Germ Cells (PGC) movement. All these cell behaviors originate from the posterior tail tip and progress to the anterior. Interestingly, earlier in Ciona development, the antero-posterior (A/P) patterning of the tailbud epidermis depends on two antagonist gradients, respectively FGF/MAPK at the posterior and retinoic acid (RA) at the anterior part of the tail. Fundamental genes such as Ci-hox1, Ci-hox12 and Ci-wnt5, classically involved in chordates A/P polarity and patterning, are controlled by these gradients and exhibit specific expression profiles in the tail epidermis. In this study, we first confirmed by video-microscopy that tail regression depends on a postero-anterior wave of a caspase-dependent apoptosis coupled with a contraction event. Concomitantly an apoptotic-dependent postero-anterior movement of PGC was observed for the first time. Unexpectedly, we observed that expression of the posterior hox gene, Ci-hox12, was extended from a posterior localization to the entire tail epidermis as the larvae progress from the swimming period to the settlement stage. In addition, when we disturbed FGF/MAPK or RA gradients we observed strong effects on Ci-hox12 expression pattern coupled with modulation on the subsequent tail regression dynamics. These results support the idea that Ci-hox12 expression in larval tail precedes and participates in the regulation of the postero-anterior cell behavior during the subsequent tail regression."

This may suggest that other etiological factors are involved. We suggest that the immune response may play a role, since the immune response has to adapt during pregnancy in order to facilitate implantation, placental and fetal development, and aberrant immunological adaptations to pregnancy are involved in various pregnancy complications. Since T1D is an autoimmune disorder, the question rises whether the immune response of women with T1D is able to adapt properly during pregnancy.

The process was modified regarding substrate concentration, duration of pre-cultivation period, duration of biotransformation, light regime and glucose addition to the culture media. Obtained results clearly showed that cyanobacteria were active towards acetophenone what resulted in the substrate reduction to (S)-1-phenylethanol with high enantiomeric excess. The reaction efficiency increased with the biotransformation time, but the higher concentration of substrate limited the process yield.

The role of stereotactic surgery has recently changed the diagnosis and treatment of focal cortical dysplasias (FCD), hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) and periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH). In HH, radiosurgery using Gammaknife® leads to 60 % of seizure control and is associated with excellent neuropsychological results without significant endocrine function impairment. The seizure control rate is even higher (more than 80 %) with monopolar multiple stereotactic thermocoagulations and Laser interstitial Thermal Therapy (LiTT). While the first technique is associated with a 2 % complications rate (but with excellent neuropsychological outcomes), the latest has up to 22 % side effects in some series. All three of these techniques have encouraging results, but controlled studies are still lacking to provide evidence-based new therapeutic algorithms. With regard to the PNH, surgical management has long been limited by the depth of the lesions and their close anatomical relations with the functional brain connectome. Stereotactic approaches required to perform a SEEG, to locate the part of the PNH responsible for the seizure onset, are later followed by a stereotactic lesioning procedure, therefore doubling the bleeding risk. That is why SEEG-guided radiofrequency-thermocoagulation (SEEG guided-RF-TC), which makes it possible to perform these two steps in a single procedure, was considered as a promising option. A recent meta-analysis confirmed this intuition and reported 38 % of seizure-free patients and 81 % of responders with only 0.3 % of complications, making this approach the first treatment line, followed by LiTT. Among the multiple advances in the FCD identification by non-invasive investigations, a new modality of per-operative diagnostic procedure, the three-dimensional electrocorticography may lead to simplify the preoperative investigation and enhance the accuracy of FCD delineation. Evidence is nevertheless still insufficient to validate this promising concept. Conventional surgical resection has also been concerned by significant conceptual advances during the past few years, in particular with the development of the hodotopic approach, initially in oncologic surgery. Associated with a better understanding of neuroplasticity in epilepsy and the setting up of functional mapping during SEEG or during awake surgery, the possibility of surgical resections grew up.

Although only 5% of patients with breast cancer develop leptomeningeal involvement, it remains the most common etiology of LC. It can occur as a late-stage complication of systemic progression or present as the first sign of metastatic disease, with or without parenchymal brain metastases. Lobular carcinomas have a higher propensity to metastasize into the meninges when compared to ductal carcinoma, especially the triple-negative subtype, which usually is associated with a shorter interval between metastatic breast cancer diagnosis and the development of LC. Prognosis remains poor, with median survival of 4 months for patients receiving state-of-the-art treatment. The main factors associated with survival are performance status at diagnosis, CSF protein level and triple-negative subtype. Headache is commonly the first clinical presentation of LC, and the diagnostic workup usually requires CSF-cytological analysis and or/MRI. The current management of LC consists of a combination of intra-CSF chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiotherapy and/or best-supportive care. The standard intra-CSF chemotherapy regimen is methotrexate. Radiotherapy is used for relieving obstruction points on CSF-outflow channels due to ependymal nodules, tumor deposits or bulky disease. Objective responses have been reported with intrathecal administration of trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease, yet this strategy is still under investigation.

Bladder SCCs are subdivided into Schistosoma-related or non-Schistosoma-related tumors, with the latter being the most frequent subtype in the western world. Typically, these patients have been excluded or under-represented in clinical trials and thus little is known about treatment efficacy in bladder SCC. To address this paucity of data, extrapolation from urothelial carcinoma (UC) trials can be performed but this approach has inherent limitations. In the era of precision medicine, efforts to characterize the genomic and molecular profiles of bladder tumors may yield evidence to support new targets for effective therapies.

Women with gBRCA-associated tumors, particularly with triple negative BC, receiving neoadjuvant platinum containing regimens achieved higher pCR rates as compared to wild-type BC. However in two large randomized trials the addition of carboplatin significantly increased pCR rate only in wild-type tumors. On the contrary, the randomized TNT trial showed a significant benefit for carboplatin vs docetaxel in terms of response rate and PFS specifically in patients with advanced gBRCA -associated tumors.

In this review, we analyzed the available data about these drugs in glioblastoma. Although data are not yet mature and preliminary studies do not show a clear-cut benefit, we are far from excluding the concrete possibility of using ICI as potential treatment in patients with glioblastoma. Moreover, many molecular and immunological aspects of this approach have yet to be clarified. For this reason, it is essential to identify potential predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who will benefit most from treatment with ICI. Additional effort is needed to better understand the mechanisms that will allow us to establish whether ICI have a place in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma."

This study aimed to measuring the constitutive expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, FMO1 and FMO3, thought to be involved in the metabolism of those compounds, by using an absolute quantitative real time (RT)-PCR approach in bovine precision-cut liver slices (PCLS). It also aimed to characterize the effects of FBZ and TCBZ (alone and in combination) on the expression and activity of the aforementioned isozymes. Both FMO1 and FMO3 were equally represented in control PCLS, whereas CYP1A2 was expressed more than CYP1A1 (P<0.05). PCLS cultured in the presence of beta naphthoflavone (β-NF; CYP1A inducer) had higher mRNA levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, FMO1 and FMO3 (P<0.05). No clear-cut evidence of transcriptional effects of the anthelmintics were recorded. After incubation of PCLS with FBZ, there was a significant increase (P<0.05) vs. controls and TBCZ was observed for CYP1A1. PCLS treated with FBZ showed a higher (P<0.05) expression of CYP1A2 compared to controls, TCBZ alone, and the combination FBZ+TCBZ. The gene expression profiles of FMO1 and FMO3 were not affected by the presence of the anthelmintics; the only exception was an upregulation of FMO3 by TCBZ alone. The observed transcriptional effects of the xenobiotics were not mirrored by increased enzyme activities using prototypical substrates of the isozymes under study. Although further confirmatory studies are needed, these results suggest that PCLS represent an alternative in vitro tool for studies on the expression, regulation and function of relevant xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in cattle.",Efficacy of a voluntary BVDV control programme: Experiences from the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819426,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"The outcomes of a voluntary bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) control programme that has been in place in the Netherlands since 1997 were analysed. This 'BVDV-free' programme was studied in dairy herds in the period 1 August 2007 to 1 August 2013. The programme was based on a test and cull approach at the herd level, after which the BVDV status was monitored by testing young stock for antibodies against BVDV or by antigen testing of newborn calves. One of the challenges of the programme was that, without any legislation or subsidies, farmers had to be motivated to pay all costs involved, with eradication of BVDV from their farm as the only incentive. During the study period, the percentage of dairy farms with a 'BVDV-free' status in the Netherlands increased from 13% to 24%, while the prevalence of active BVDV infections in Dutch dairy herds decreased. This may be related to the increasing number of participants in the 'BVDV-free' programme.",Genome-wide association study of equine herpesvirus type 1-induced myeloencephalopathy identifies a significant single nucleotide polymorphism in a platelet-related gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819425,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)-induced myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is a neurologic disease of horses that represents one outcome of infection. The neurologic form of disease occurs in a subset of infected horses when virus-induced endothelial cell damage triggers vasculitis and subsequent ischemic insult to the central nervous system. EHM causes considerable animal suffering and economic loss for the horse industry. Virus polymorphisms have been previously associated with disease outcome but cannot fully explain why only some horses develop EHM. This study investigated the role of host genetics in EHM. DNA samples were collected from 129 horses infected with EHV-1 (61 that developed EHM and 68 in which disease resolved without the development of neurologic signs) during natural outbreaks or experimental infections. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to investigate host genetic variations associated with EHM. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina SNP50 and SNP70 arrays and a custom Sequenom array. Mixed linear model (MLM) analysis using a recessive model identified one marker that surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (P<0.001) after Bonferroni correction. The marker (BIEC2_946397) is in an intron of the tetraspanin 9 (TSPAN9) gene, which is expressed in endothelial cells and platelets. The GWAS identified a region in the horse genome that is associated with EHM in the sample population and thus warrants further exploration. Understanding the contribution of host genetic variation to the development of EHM will enhance our knowledge of disease pathophysiology, and lead to improved strategies for treating individual cases and managing outbreaks.",Immunohistochemical expression of selected phosphoproteins of the mTOR signalling pathway in canine cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819424,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) represents one of the most common malignant skin tumors in dogs. Research aimed at clarifying how the deregulated activity of signalling pathways contributes to cSCC progression can help to identify molecular suitable targets for the development of novel therapies. The present study describes the immunohistochemical expression pattern of two proteins (pAktSer473 and pS6Ser235/236, the latter combined with Ki-67) involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signalling pathway in canine specimens of normal epidermis, pre-neoplastic epidermis, and cSCC using tissue microarrays. The results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway has a low expression in the normal canine epidermis, and that selected molecules involved in this signalling pathway are dysregulated during the canine epidermal carcinogenesis process. These findings provide important evidence that the persistent activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway represents one of the key events during cSCC progression in canine patients, pointing to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",Meta-analysis of risk factors for racehorse catastrophic musculoskeletal injury in flat racing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819423,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"Studies of racehorse injury or fatality in various countries have identified common, and in some cases conflicting, risk factors. We conducted a systematic search of the relevant literature published from 1990 to 2017. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported the incidence of fatal or catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (CMI) in Thoroughbred flat races (n=21) or risk factors for CMI (n=65). Pooled effect sizes were estimated using the random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model. The pooled incidence of CMI was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.90, 1.44) per 1000 race starts. Almost 300 factors have been investigated in epidemiological studies for potential associations with CMI. Factors found to have consistent evidence of increasing risk of CMI are: (1) Horse-level factors such as older horse age and age at first start, male sex, and higher race class or lower claiming price; (2) Race-level factors such as firmer track conditions on turf and wetter conditions on dirt, longer race distance, and a greater number of starters; and (3) Management-related factors including more time since previous start, greater number of starts, longer career length, issues identified at pre-race examination, previous injury, and recent administration of medication or injections. Studies investigating recent cumulative distance of high-speed exercise were conflicting and suggestive of at least two mechanisms of injury related to the accumulation of bone damage: (1) In well adapted bone following a period of intense training; and (2) In poorly adapted bone at relatively low levels of training intensity.

There was a significantly higher reduction in serum Ft in Group G than in Group M from day 0 to day 30 (P=0.0085), and also from day 0 to day 90 (P=0.0214). There was a higher increase in serum PON-1 in Group G than in than Group M from day 0 to day 30 (P=0.0039), and also from day 0 to day 90 (P=0.0404). This is the first report of APPs in dogs with natural clinical leishmaniosis treated with miltefosine. There was faster resolution of serum APP concentrations in dogs treated with antimonials (P<0.05).","Dilated cardiomyopathy in 151 Irish Wolfhounds: Characteristic clinical findings, life expectancy and causes of death.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819421,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of morbidity in Irish Wolfhounds (IW), a breed also predisposed to neoplastic and orthopedic diseases that shorten life expectancy. The objective of this study was to investigate survival and causes of death in IW with DCM and to characterise the clinical findings of DCM over time. Data from cardiovascular examinations performed in 1591 IW, including echocardiography and electrocardiography, were retrospectively evaluated. IW with DCM on medical therapy with long term longitudinal follow-up were included in this study (n=151; 95 males, 56 females). Based on their clinical status at initial diagnosis, IW were classified into one of three groups: preclinical DCM with sinus rhythm (PC-DCM-SR, n=35), preclinical DCM with atrial fibrillation (PC-DCM-AF, n=87), and congestive heart failure with DCM and AF (CHF-DCM-AF, n=29). Survival data were analyzed using cumulative incidence functions, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. CHF was predominantly characterized by chylous pleural and mild pericardial effusions. Causes of death were cardiac (CD) in 73/151 and non-cardiac (non-CD) in 62/151; 16 dogs remained alive at study end. The majority of deaths in both preclinical DCM groups were non-CD (PC-DCM-AF=51.9% non-CD, 48.1% CD; PC-DCM-SR, 65.5% non-CD, 34.5% CD). In the CHF-DCM-AF group most dogs (89.6%) experienced a CD. Median survival of the CHF-DCM-AF group (7.3 months) was significantly shorter than in the PC-DCM-AF group (21.9 months) or PC-DCM-SR group (29.1 months, P=0.001). CHF-DCM-AF in IW was associated with reduced life expectancy and CD, while most IW with preclinical DCM died from non-cardiac causes.",Disposition of ceftizoxime in Staphylococcal mastitis in Indian crossbred cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819420,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 04 23,"Disposition of ceftizoxime was studied in Indian crossbred cows following a single IV dosing in field conditions.

Group 1 (n=11) included dogs with previously diagnosed and controlled AFR; group 2 (n=15) comprised dogs with allergic dermatitis at the beginning of their ED; and group 3 (n=16) was composed of clinically healthy research dogs. Saliva samples were collected from all groups and blood samples from group 1 and group 3. The results of clinical re-challenges with individual food components were compared with the test results. Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios were determined. Forty-one dogs completed the study; one dog was lost to follow up. There was a total of 163 re-challenges. Sensitivity, positive predictive value and likelihood ratio, specificity, negative predictive value and likelihood ratios were unsatisfactory for both tests in most instances, except for IgM testing in group 2, which had moderate specificity. There was no clear difference in the number of positive reactions between the allergic dogs and healthy dogs from a research population. Based on these results, the saliva test for food specific IgA and IgM and the ELISA serum test for food specific IgE were not reliable to diagnose adverse food reactions in dogs.

However, its expression pattern and function in osteosarcoma have not been investigated. In this study, we showed that ILF3-AS1 expression was significantly up-regulated in both osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. We first reported that ILF3-AS1 upregulation was induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1. Clinical assays revealed that higher expression of ILF3-AS1 was associated with advanced clinical stage, distant metastasis and shorter overall survival. in multivariate analysis, ILF3-AS1 expression level was found to be an independent prognostic factor for osteosarcoma patients. Functional investigations showed that knockdown of ILF3-AS1 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, and promoted apoptosis. Bioinformatic software predicted that miR-212 both targeted the 3'-UTR of ILF3-AS1 and SOX5, which was confirmed using luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and Western blot. Taken together, ILF3-AS1 displayed its tumor-promotive roles in the progression of osteosarcoma through miR-212/SOX5 axis.

This transformation is now more or less complete. While initially these CT images were relatively small, comprised of only about 6400 pixels per slice, the steady move toward higher spatial resolution, multislice imaging, digital radiography, and fluoroscopy rapidly increased the size of images and the amount of data required to be stored, processed, displayed, and moved about in a medical imaging department. The more recent introduction of digital pathology with submicron-sized pixels and the need for color further increases these demands. Rising work volumes in hospital, a push for cost containment, and a move toward greater precision in diagnosis and treatment of disease all work together to motivate the development of automated image analysis algorithms and techniques to improve efficiencies in in vivo imaging and pathology. This may require bringing together information from different imaging and nonimaging sources within the institution. While technological development has provided practical means for storage of the burgeoning data load and the use of multiple processors and high-speed networks has enabled more sophisticated analysis locally or in the cloud, challenges remain in terms of the ability to integrate data from different systems, the development of appropriately annotated image bases for training and testing of algorithms, and issues around privacy and ownership in obtaining access to patient-related data.",Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819399,Seminars in nuclear medicine,2019 04 08,"The medical community often assumes that the tests we use to diagnose various diseases are accurate, safe, and effective.

They offer enhanced rigor and validity relative to traditional narrative review articles by reducing bias and increasing objectivity. In answering focused research questions, systematic reviews are directly applicable to clinical practice as well as the development of clinical guidelines and the identification of knowledge gaps, which may drive future primary research directions. Typically, such a rigorous process necessarily requires substantive time to carefully and systematically identify, screen, and synthesize all relevant available primary research on a topic. Further, other knowledge synthesis methods have emerged to address the varying needs of decision makers with respect to condensed timelines and more diverse research questions, as well as to allow incorporation of already synthesized evidence into reviews. These alternative methods include rapid reviews, scoping reviews, and overviews of systematic reviews, which are being used with increasing frequency by clinicians, decision-makers, and researchers.

Thus, PCI and CABG mechanisms may differ. Viability and/or ischemia detection to guide revascularization have been unable to accurately predict treatment effects of CABG or PCI, questioning a revascularization mechanism for improving survival. By contrast, preventing myocardial infarction may save lives. However, the majority of infarcts are generated by non-flow-limiting stenoses, but PCI is solely focused on treating flow-limiting lesions. Thus, PCI cannot be expected to significantly limit new infarcts, but CABG may do so through providing flow distal to vessel occlusions. All comparisons of CABG to PCI or medical therapy that demonstrate survival effects with CABG also demonstrate infarct reduction.

Of 2017 papers reviewed, 25 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed. Sixteen studies used web-based platforms to deliver their intervention. A large proportion of studies (11/25) specifically focused on HIV prevention. Seven studies found a statistically significant effect of the intervention on knowledge levels regarding the prevention HIV and other STI, as well as general sexual health knowledge, but only one-fifth of interventions evaluating intentions to use condoms reported significant effects due to the intervention. Nine studies focused on individuals from an African American background. Although new media has the capacity to expand efficiencies and coverage, the technology itself does not guarantee success. It is essential that interventions using new digital media have high-quality, evidence-based content that engages with individual participants.","City of love: group sex is associated with risks for HIV and other sexually transmissible infections among gay and bisexual men in Paris, France.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819325,Sexual health,2019 05 01,Background This study explored the relationships between participation in group sex and risk for HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs).,Codesigned framework for organisational culture reform in South Australian older persons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819324,Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,2019 03 01,"The Oakden Report documented failures in governance, clinical practice and organisational culture occurring at the Oakden Older Persons' Mental Health Service and drew national attention to the care of older people with complex clinical needs. Responding to the recommendations of the Report, a working group brought together stakeholders to engage in a codesign process involving literature review, gallery walks and focus groups, under the governance of the Oakden Response Oversight Committee. The working group developed a framework as a blueprint for organisational culture reform built around a central philosophy of compassionate relationship-centred care, supported by four priorities: developing a values-based workforce, cultivating psychological safety, facilitating excellence in care and providing transparent accountability. The purpose of the framework was to provide a way forward for South Australian older persons' mental health services after The Oakden Report, and it may provide insight into similar processes of codesign and culture change in other service contexts.What is known about the topic?Changes to healthcare systems, requiring improved efficiencies and lower costs, are contributing to increasing challenges with staff satisfaction and wellbeing, and consistent delivery of dignified, meaningful care to people and their families. The need to nurture and lead healthcare organisations characterised by compassionate cultures is an increasingly prominent theme in global healthcare literature. The engagement of people with lived experience at all levels of system design supports effective and ethical service development.What does this paper add?This paper illustrates an approach to positive, compassion-focused organisational culture change, developed through codesign, occurring as a reform process following a crisis in service delivery. The paper applies key concepts in a framework that may be applied in a range of services to achieve positive organisational transformation.What are the implications for practitioners?Committed action to develop positive organisational culture characterised by compassionate relationship-centred care will have benefit for healthcare providers and the people who receive care. Keeping people with lived experience at the centre of design and development will support optimal outcomes for all stakeholders.",The Primary Care Practice Improvement Tool (PC-PIT) process for organisational improvement in primary care: application by Australian Primary Health Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819323,Australian journal of primary health,2019 05 01,"The Primary Care Practice Improvement Tool (PC-PIT) is an organisational performance improvement tool recently implemented by two Primary Health Networks (PHNs). This study explored barriers and facilitators to implementing the PC-PIT process at scale, from the initial introduction of the tool to completion of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles with general practices. Using a qualitative design, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 PHN staff to seek feedback on the delivery of the PC-PIT to general practices. Interview results were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The identification of barriers such as difficulty engaging practices and lack of report sharing with the PHNs will help streamline future implementation. The PC-PIT was highly compatible with existing quality improvement programs and offers enhanced opportunity to support capacity building and implementation of the Health Care Home model.",Baicalin improves IVM of pig oocytes and subsequent preimplantation embryo development by inhibiting apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819322,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",2019 05 01,"Baicalin, a monomer of flavonoids extracted from dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, is used to treat female infertility. However, the effect of baicalin on oocyte maturation is unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of baicalin on the IVM of pig oocytes and subsequent embryo development following parthenogenetic activation (PA). We found that 0.1µgmL-1 baicalin significantly (P<0.05) increased the IVM rate of oocytes compared with the non-treatment (control) group by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the mRNA expression of genes related to nuclear maturation and cumulus cell expansion, mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content was significantly (P<0.05) higher in baicalin-treated than control oocytes. To determine whether baicalin treatment during IVM of pig oocytes improves subsequent development of PA embryos, we measured the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates, as well as the number of cells per blastocyst. All these parameters were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the baicalin-treated than control group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that baicalin improves pig oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development invitro by inhibiting production of ROS and reducing apoptosis in oocytes.",Operative Considerations for the General Surgeon in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819306,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Chronic liver disease remains a prevalent and challenging comorbidity in the American population at large. Scarring and fibrosis cause physical and physiological changes that may prove challenging in both medical and surgical management. However, because there has been relevant improvements in preoperative diagnostic, perioperative hepatologic, and intensive care management, as well as in surgical techniques, patients with cirrhosis can safely be operated on but patient selection remains vital. Patients with chronic liver disease may present to a general surgeon for evaluation of a number of elective or emergent surgical conditions. Here, we review current literature on the perioperative management and operative strategies of seemingly routine general surgery issues and provide a review of the pathophysiology associated with chronic liver disease."

This study aims to compare postoperative outcomes and survival between converted and successful laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer. Records of patients who underwent laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer between 2005 and 2015 were retrieved from the CLermontFerrand Ircad Mondor Hopital European Tours (CLIMHET) database. Perioperative, postoperative, and survival outcomes were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for conversion. Overall, 445 patients underwent a successfully completed laparoscopic right colectomy and 28 (5.9%) were converted to open surgery. A higher rate of minor complications was found in the conversion group, whereas patient recovery outcomes were similar. Previous open and laparoscopic surgeries were significant predictors of conversion. No significant difference was found in overall and disease-free survival rates between converted and nonconverted procedures. In the setting of laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer, the conversion rate is low and does not have an impact on patient survival. Conversion is associated with higher rates of minor postoperative complications but recovery and survival outcomes are comparable with successful laparoscopic colectomies. The present results support the use of laparoscopy for right colon resection even in patients at risk of conversion.",Meta-Analysis of Post-Intubation Hypotension: A Plea to Consider Circulation First in Hypovolemic Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819293,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Hypovolemic patients can develop postintubation hypotension (PIH). Our objective is to review the literature regarding PIH and the association with mortality. We searched MEDLINE from inception to February 2018. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effect of PIH on mortality. The results of the meta-analysis were reported in forest plots of the estimated effects of the included studies with a 95 per cent confidence interval. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I² test, which corresponded to low (I² < 25%), medium (I² = 25-75%), and high (I² > 75%) heterogeneity. We identified 243 records. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis. The studies reported 2044 patients with 36.8 per cent (n = 753) developing PIH. Data indirectly reflecting the hemodynamic status were available in three studies (n = 1117 patients). Overall mortality was 24.6 per cent (n = 503) and was significantly higher in patients that developed PIH [mortality, n (%): PIH = 250/753 (33.2%) vs 253/1291 (19.6%), P < 0.001]. Patients that develop PIH have an increased mortality. Considering a targeted resuscitation in hypovolemic patients is pivotal to minimize PIH.",Cosmesis in Patients after Multiport Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery: Does the Extraction Incision Matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819292,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"The ideal incision for specimen extraction during laparoscopic colorectal surgery is controversial. The objective of this study was to compare incision types (Pfannenstiel, periumbilical, lower midline, and right upper quadrant transverse) with regard to postoperative scar appearance, symptoms, preference, and satisfaction. This study is a retrospective survey review performed in an urban teaching hospital. The study participants were patients undergoing multiport laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Two web-based questionnaires, the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire and Photo-Series Questionnaire, were used to assess study parameters. The main outcome measures were incision symptoms and cosmetic satisfaction. The 112 study patients included 54 patients with a Pfannenstiel incision (Group P) and 58 patients with an alternate incision (Group A). Of the 58 patients in Group A, 19 (33%) had a periumbilical incision, 10 (17%) a lower midline incision, and 29 (50%) a right upper quadrant transverse incision. Although Groups P and A were comparable in all five subscales of the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire, more Group P participants (n = 12; 22%) said their incision felt ""fairly numb"" than Group A participants (n = 2; 3%) (P = 0.008). There was no significant difference between study groups in all Photo-Series Questionnaire domains; however, after comparing patients' own incisions with photographs of various alternative incisions, 36 (62%) Group A patients would choose an alternative incision compared with only 11 (19%) Group P patients (P = 0.001). Selection bias, recall bias, external validity, and variability of scar lengths were the limitations of the study. It was concluded that although a Pfannenstiel incision seems to be the optimal cosmetic choice, it is associated with a higher incidence of wound numbness than alternate extraction incisions.",Caution: Increased Acute Kidney Injury in Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) Protocols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819291,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Minimizing perioperative fluid administration is a key component of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols (ERAS). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Our aim was to assess the association of ERAS with the incidence and severity of AKI in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. In this single-study retrospective review, patients undergoing colorectal surgery from 2013 to 2017 were included. Primary endpoint was postoperative AKI. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission. Baseline demographics and procedure types were similar between both groups. AKI was higher in the ERAS versus non-ERAS group (23 vs 9%; P = 0.002). Factors associated with increased risk of AKI on univariate regression included presence of preoperative cardiovascular risk factors (hazard ratio (HR) 3.5; 95% CI 1.3-9.7; P < 0.01), more complex colorectal operations (HR 5.1; 95% CI 1.6-16.1; P < 0.01), and management with an ERAS pathway (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.8; P < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, ERAS remained a significant risk factor for developing AKI (HR 3.44; 95% CI 1.5-7.7; P < 0.01). ERAS patients had a shorter hospital LOS (3.9 vs 5.9 days, P < 00.1) compared with non-ERAS patients, with no difference in 30-day readmission rates (11.5 vs 10.7%; P = 0.98). Although the incidence of AKI is higher in patients treated with ERAS protocols, the majority represent minor elevations in baseline serum creatinine and did not affect the reduction in hospital LOS associated with ERAS. Given the potential association of AKI, however, with increased long-term morbidity and mortality, ERAS protocols should be optimized to prevent postoperative AKI.",Efficacy of Radiofrequency Ablation versus Transarterial Chemoembolization for Patients with Solitary Hepatocellular Carcinoma ≤3 cm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819290,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Optimal treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 3 cm remains controversial. Ablation and chemoembolization are considered for nonoperative candidates. This study compares survival among patients with solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Patients diagnosed with HCC ≤ 3 cm between 2005 and 2014 were included. Kaplan-Meier survival functions with log-rank tests were used to estimate recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS) survival. Among 161 patients with solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm, 145 patients with mean age of 65.2 years (±9.2) and 95 per cent prevalence of cirrhosis had operative treatment or TACE, and/or RFA. From this cohort, 27 (19%) patients had TACE, 27 (19%) patients had RFA, and 15 (10%) patients had TACE/RFA. The patients treated with definitive TACE, RFA, or TACE/RFA had a similar 1-year recurrence-free survival (23% vs 27% vs 36%, respectively, P = 0.445) and similar 5-year OS (21% vs 24% vs 33%, respectively, P = 0.287). Thirty-five (24%) patients were bridged to transplantation with TACE and/or RFA. The 5-year OS was significantly improved in patients bridged to transplantation (P < 0.001). Survival does not differ between patients with solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm treated with TACE or RFA. Patients who were bridged to transplantation had significantly greater OS compared with patients who were not transplanted.",The Cost of Surgical Site Infections after Colorectal Surgery in the United States from 2001 to 2012: A Longitudinal Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819289,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common types of postoperative complications in the United States and are associated with significant prevalence of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgical interventions, especially in colorectal surgery (CRS) where SSI rates are significantly higher than those of similar operative sites. SSIs were identified from the National Inpatient Sample-Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database from 2001 to 2012 based on the specification of an ICD-9 code. Propensity score matching was used to compare costs associated with SSI cases with those of non-SSI controls among elective and nonelective admissions. Results were projected nationally using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project sampling methodology to evaluate the incidence of SSIs and ascertain the national cost burden retrospectively. Among 4,851,359 sample-weighted hospitalizations, 4.2 per cent (203,597) experienced SSI. Elective admissions associated with SSI-stayed hospitalized for an average of 7.8 days longer and cost $18,410 more than their counterparts who did not experience an SSI. Nonelective admissions that experienced an SSI had an 8.5-day longer hospital stay and cost $20,890 more than counterparts without perioperative infections. This represents a 3 per cent annual growth in costs for SSIs and seems to be largely driven by cost increases in treatment of SSIs for elective surgeries. Current efforts of SSI management after CRS focused on compliance with guidelines and tracking of infection rates would benefit from some improvements. Considering the growing costs and increase in resource utilization associated with SSIs from 2001 to 2012, further research on costs associated with management of SSIs specific to CRS is necessary.",Longer Operative Time and Intraoperative Blood Transfusion Are Associated with Postoperative Anastomotic Leak after Lower Gastrointestinal Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819288,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Anastomotic leak after lower gastrointestinal surgery is a complication with potential for high morbidity, mortality, and increased costs. A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent lower gastrointestinal surgery between June 2009 and June 2013. Fifty-seven variables were included in our analysis and their association with postoperative anastomotic leak was examined. Nine hundred fifty-two patients underwent 983 lower gastrointestinal anastomoses with an overall leak rate in this series of 6 per cent. Type of intestinal anastomosis created (P < 0.00005), operative indication (P < 0.015), operation performed (P < 0.014), intraoperative blood transfusion (P < 0.017), and intraoperative surgical drain placement (P < 0.022) were all predictive of anastomotic leak. Anastomotic leak rate increased by 1.3 times for every additional hour in the operating room after three hours. Both increasing operation time and intraoperative blood transfusions were associated with an increased rate of anastomotic leak. When operative time extends beyond three hours or in those cases were blood transfusions are given, surgeons should consider taking steps to minimize the risks of a potential anastomotic leak.",The Crossroads of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Physician Burnout: A National Review of United States Trauma and Nontrauma Surgeons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819287,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among trauma surgeons is three times that of the general population, and physician burnout (PBO) among surgeons is rising. Given that PTSD and PBO are both stress-based syndromes, we aim to identify the prevalence and risk factors for PTSD among trauma and nontrauma surgeons, and determine if a relationship exists. A cross-sectional survey of surgeons was conducted between September 2016 and May 2017. Respondents were screened for PTSD and PBO. Traumatic stressors were identified, and 20 potential risk factors were assessed. The respondents (n = 1026) were grouped into trauma (n = 350) and nontrauma (n = 676). Between the cohorts, there was no significant difference in prevalence of screening positive for PTSD (17% vs 15%) or PBO (30% vs 25%). A relationship was found between PTSD and PBO (P < 0.001). The most common traumatic stressor was overwhelming work responsibilities. Potential risk factors for PTSD differed, but overlapping risk factors included hospital culture, hospital support, and salary (P < 0.05). Our findings of an association between PTSD and PBO is concerning. Interventions to reduce rates of PTSD should target changing the existing culture of surgery, improving hospital support, and ensuring equitable pay.",The Ochsner Legacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819286,The American surgeon,2019 03 11,"One of the iconic families in American surgery is the Ochsners. The youngest son of Swiss immigrants, Henry Ochsner (1877-1902) was the first to enter the medical profession. His promising internship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital ended when he died of cholera, a tragedy deeply felt by his mentor William Osler. On another branch of the family tree, Albert Ochsner (1858-1925) wrote authoritative textbooks on surgery and became president of the ACS and the American Surgical Association. His most significant achievement may have been his mentorship of his cousin's son Alton (1896-1981), guiding his medical education and training in surgery. The younger Ochsner succeeded Rudolph Matas as chair of surgery at Tulane University at the age of only 31 years. Under his leadership, Charity Hospital in New Orleans became a leading program for surgical training and Tulane earned a reputation for clinical excellence. Ochsner and four partners from the Tulane faculty created a multidisciplinary clinic to attract patients from a wider area, a facility that would become today's Ochsner Clinic. His son John (1927-2018) followed him in the profession and received specialty training in cardiovascular surgery under Michael DeBakey in Houston, a Tulane graduate and an Ochsner trainee. John Ochsner returned to the Ochsner Clinic to establish a major cardiothoracic and vascular surgery program. Further generations of the Ochsner family continued the family legacy in surgery and medicine, exemplified by M.

Results: A case of a woman with CVID with autoimmunity and gastrointestinal complications is presented with a discussion of the recognition and treatment of infectious and noninfectious complications. Conclusion: Patients with CVID must be monitored for noninfectious complications, e.g., inflammatory disease of the lung and gastrointestinal tract, because these are associated with decreased survival."

Integrating research on job-stress recovery with research on leadership and employee mental health and well-being, this study examines how a leader's psychological detachment from work during nonwork time directly relates to subordinate psychological detachment from work and indirectly to employee exhaustion and need for recovery. Based on self-report data from 137 employees and their supervisors, this study revealed that leader psychological detachment was related to subordinate psychological detachment and that leader psychological detachment was indirectly related to low subordinate exhaustion and low subordinate need for recovery, also when controlling for negative affectivity and leader-member-exchange. Overall, this study demonstrates that leaders might have an impact on subordinate strain symptoms not only via leadership behavior at work but also via detachment processes during leisure time. These findings suggest that employee recovery processes might not only be regarded as an individual phenomenon, but could be seen as embedded in the larger organizational context.",Three Issues in Multilevel Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819268,The Spanish journal of psychology,2019 04 24,"In this article, three important issues in organizational multilevel research are discussed and clarified, namely: (a) The interpretation of ""cross-level direct effects"" in theoretical and research multilevel models, (b) the specification of the emergence processes involved in higher-level constructs, and (c) the sample size recommendations for using multilevel statistical methods.

Specifically, we propose that employees who engage in surface acting at work drain their energetic resources, and undermine their own relationship satisfaction. Drawing upon conservation of resources (COR) theory, we predicted that work-related exhaustion would mediate the relationship between surface acting at work and at home. In addition, we hypothesized that employees' emotional energy in the evening would mediate the relationship between surface acting at home and (actor and partner) satisfaction with the relationship. Participants filled in a survey and a diary booklet during five consecutive working days (N = 80 couples, N = 160 participants x 5 days, N = 800 occasions). The hypotheses were tested with multilevel analyses, using the actor-partner interdependence model. Results showed that daily work-related exhaustion partially mediated the relationship between daily surface acting at work and at home. As hypothesized, daily surface acting at home influenced own and partner's daily relationship satisfaction through reduced daily emotional energy. These findings offer support for COR theory, and have important implications for organizations that encourage emotion regulation.","A comparative study of four rumen buffering agents on productive performance, rumen fermentation and meat quality in growing lambs fed a total mixed ration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819265,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 03 01,"Controlling rumen fermentation using buffering agents could contribute to enhancing ruminant productivity and performance. This study was realized to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of AcidBuf, sodium bicarbonate, calseapowder and WMC seaweed (Utva Lactuca extra) on the animal performance, volatile fatty acids, rumen pH, rumen histology and carcass characteristics of growing male Awassi lambs. A total of 60 lambs was divided into five groups. One group served as a control and fed only on a concentrate diet without any buffering, whereas the other four groups were fed the concentrate diet supplemented with 0.4% AcidBuf (Buf1), 0.4% AcidBuf plus sodium bicarbonate, 50 : 50 (Buf2), 0.4% calseapowder (Buf3) or 0.4% WMC Seaweed (Buf4) for 98 days.

Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well-known tumor suppressor and also a negative regulator of insulin signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We investigated the hypothesis that PTEN may affect the insulin pathway-mediated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in dairy cows. Adenovirus vectors that over-express and silence PTEN were constructed, and then transfected into hepatocytes isolated from calves to investigate the effect of PTEN on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN silencing increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of PI3K but decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1, which increased the phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Increased GSK-3β phosphorylation further up-regulated expression of the key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6-Pase) involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of SREBP-1c target gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) also increased significantly. We further showed that PTEN over-expression could reverse the above results. PTEN negatively regulates the enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, which suggests that PTEN may be a therapeutic target for ketosis and fatty liver in dairy cows.",Vitamin D3 supplementation for 8 weeks leads to improved haematological status following the consumption of an iron-fortified breakfast cereal: a double-blind randomised controlled trial in iron-deficient women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819262,The British journal of nutrition,2019 05 29,"The effect of 38 µg (1500 IU) daily vitamin D3 supplementation, consumed with an Fe-fortified breakfast cereal for 8 weeks, on haematological indicators in Fe-deficient female subjects was investigated.

Significant increases were observed in two main haematological indices: Hb concentration and haematocrit level from baseline to post-intervention in the vitamin D group but not in the placebo group. The increase from baseline to post-intervention in Hb concentration in the vitamin D group (135 (sd 11) to 138 (sd 10) g/l) was significantly higher compared with the placebo group (131 (sd 15) to 128 (sd 13) g/l) (P=0·037). The increase in haematocrit level from baseline to post-intervention was also significantly higher in the vitamin D group (42·0 (sd 3·0) to 43·8 (sd 3·4) %) compared with the placebo group (41·2 (sd 4·3) to 40·7 (sd 3·6) %) (P=0·032). Despite the non-significant changes in plasma ferritin concentration, this study demonstrates that 38 µg supplemental vitamin D, consumed daily, with Fe-fortified breakfast cereal led to improvement in Hb concentration and haematocrit levels in women with low Fe stores. These findings may have therapeutic implications in the recovery of Fe status in Fe-deficient populations at a healthcare level.",Exploring the Relationship of a Gamified Assessment with Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819261,The Spanish journal of psychology,2019 04 24,"Our study explores the validity of a game-based assessment method assessing candidates' soft skills. Using self-reported measures of performance, (job performance, Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs), and Great Point Average (GPA), we examined the criterion-related and incremental validity of a game-based assessment, above and beyond the effect of cognitive ability and personality. Our findings indicate that a game-based assessment measuring soft skills (adaptability, flexibility, resilience and decision making) can predict self-reported job and academic performance.

As serum lipids serve as more specific physiological markers than body weight, the objective of this study was to review studies that examined the association between changes in serum lipids and changes in symptoms during antipsychotic treatment in individuals with schizophrenia. A Medline® literature search was performed. Fourteen studies were included and analyzed. Evidence suggests that increases in serum lipids may be associated with decreases in symptoms during antipsychotic treatment. This inverse association may be independent of confounding variables, such as weight gain, and may be most evident during treatment with clozapine. Also, according to recent randomized controlled trials, lipid-lowering agents do not appear to worsen symptoms although this needs to be further investigated in clozapine-treated patients. Future studies should investigate the association in question in a larger population and identify underlying mechanisms."

If municipal solid waste is not managed well, it can be a source of numerous contaminants to water, air, and soil. Although landfill is at the bottom in terms of priorities of municipal solid waste management techniques, its applicability cannot be neglected in developing economies. Landfill site selection is a hard puzzle comprised of political, social, economic, and environmental factors. Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030, putting the city in a difficult circumstance: More pilgrims, more municipal solid waste. The current dump site, Kakia, is expected to be full by 2020; thus, there is a need to locate a new landfill site. In 20 years, Makkah is expected to produce 44 million tonnes of municipal solid waste, which requires approximately a 7.5 m × 5,874,000 square meter landfill capacity. In this study, a geographic information system, analytical hierarchy process, vertical electrical sounding, and ground-penetrating radar are applied to select the best new landfill site for Makkah. By combining these techniques, there are three suitable site locations: (39°36 ́38.45 ́ ́E: 21°18 ́26.46 ́ ́N), (39°37 ́54.07 ́ ́E: 21°19 ́35.25 ́ ́N), and (39°44 ́04.45 ́ ́E: 21°13 ́08.93 ́ ́N). These sites have a considerable depth to water table of 12 m. Therefore, the city of Makkah should use these findings to establish a sanitary landfill.","""Don't Drink Too Much!"" Reactance Among Young Men Following Health-Related Social Control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819071,American journal of men's health,2019 04 04,"This study investigated conditions under which young men responded with reactance to the suggestion to reduce their alcohol consumption. In an experimental study, 84 young men (university students, mean age: 24 years) listened to a recorded telephone call and were asked to imagine that they themselves were the recipients of this call. In this call, either a girlfriend or a male friend suggested that the recipient of the call should reduce his alcohol intake that evening. In one condition, the suggestion was highly restrictive; in the other condition, the suggestion was framed in a nonrestrictive way. Perceived threat, negative thoughts, and feelings of anger after listening to the call were assessed. Further outcome variables were intention and perceived probability of complying with the suggestion. Participants felt more anger after hearing the highly restrictive suggestion and more threatened by the suggestion made by the girlfriend. Interaction effects emerged. Participants reported more negative thoughts and lower intention and perceived probability to comply when a highly restrictive suggestion was made by the girlfriend. The male friend's highly restrictive suggestion resulted in a perceived probability of complying (54%) that was similar to the probability of the girlfriend's nonrestrictive suggestion (55%). Women's efforts to reduce their male partners' alcohol consumption can result in boomerang effects. Male peers might be more effective in motivating other men to behave in a healthier way. These results support recent findings with regard to the potential of peer positive social control.",Peak Rate of Force Development and Isometric Maximum Strength of Back Muscles Are Associated With Power Performance During Load-Lifting Tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819070,American journal of men's health,2019 03 01,"This study investigates the relationship between peak force and rate of force development (RFD) obtained from maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) of the back muscles and the power produced during a loaded lifting task. A group of 27 resistance-trained and 41 recreationally physically active men performed a maximal isometric strength test of the back muscles and a deadlift to high pull while lifting progressively increasing weights. Peak RFD correlated significantly with the peak and mean power produced during a deadlift to high pull with lower weights (from 20 to 40 kg), with r values ranging from .941 to .673 and from .922 to .633. The r2 values ranged from .89 to .45 and from .85 to .40, explaining 89%-45% and 85%-40% of total variance. There were also significant relationships between MVC peak force and peak and mean values of power produced during a deadlift to high pull with weights ≥60 kg ( r in range from .764 to .888 and from .735 to .896). Based on r2, a moderate-to-high proportion of variance was explained (58%-79% and 54%-80%). These findings indicate that peak RFD obtained from MVC of the back muscles may be predictive of power performance during a lifting task at light loads. In addition to MVC peak force produced by back muscles, the ability of subjects to develop a high force in a short time should be evaluated in order to gain deeper insight into a loaded lifting performance, namely, in those prone to low back pain.",Intradermal Growing Hair: Two Case Reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819069,American journal of men's health,2019 04 04,"Hair growing inside the skin and burrowing in the uppermost dermis, previously termed as ""ingrowing hair,"" is a rarely reported cutaneous disorder.

Consequently, men of Mexican origin have some of the highest prevalence rates of obesity-related comorbidities. Physical activity (PA) may be an important strategy for Hispanic men of Mexican origin in reducing incidence and risk factors of lifestyle diseases. The current study engaged Spanish-speaking, Hispanic men of Mexican origin aged 24-64 years with overweight/obesity to examine perspectives of health behaviors related to PA. A total of 14 in-depth semistructured individual interviews were completed between September and November of 2015 and data analyzed using an iterative deductive-inductive thematic assessment strategy. The men suggested that their PA was hindered by (a) work-related energy and time constraints, (b) socioeconomic status (SES) and the need to prioritize work, (c) adaptations to majority population lifestyle norms, and (d) perceived lack of suitable access to PA-promoting spaces. The men provided valuable insight for strategies to improve PA interventions such as (a) accurately accounting for current PA levels of participants, including occupational and transportation PA, (b) considerations of family dynamics that influence PA-based behavior change, and (c) considerations of economic and geographical constraints that can be remediated. To improve effectiveness, future PA-related intervention research with Hispanic men of Mexican origin should consider methods that (a) account for transportation and occupational PA to better tailor PA to individual needs, (b) consider sociocultural and socioeconomic influences, (c) account for social support and accountability, and (d) consider economic and geographical constraints.",Sleep Mediates the Relationship Between Depression and Cognitive Impairment in Older Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819067,American journal of men's health,2019 04 04,"Sleep and depression are strongly associated with cognitive impairment. The role of sleep disturbances in the adverse effect of depression on cognitive dysfunction in older adults remains unclear. This study explored the mediating effect of self-reported sleep disturbances on the relationship between depression and cognitive impairment in older adults according to sex differences. This study derived data from the 2009 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey and included 2,175 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older (men = 991; women = 1,184). Sleep disturbances were measured using self-reported survey questions. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale was used to assess depression. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to evaluate cognitive impairment. A higher proportion of female older persons had cognitive impairment and depression than male older persons (cognition: 24.4% vs. 11.5%; depression: 17.0% vs. 10.8%). The meditating effect of sleep was detected in only men. Difficulty in initiating sleep was a complete mediator of the adverse effect of depression on cognitive impairment (Sobel test: p = .03). In summary, difficultly in initiating sleep may be a crucial, treatable mediator of the adverse effect of depression on cognitive impairment in older men.","Behavioral Intention to Initiate Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Among Chinese HIV-Infected Men Who Have Sex With Men Having High CD4 Count in the Era of ""Treatment for All"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819066,American journal of men's health,2019 03 01,"China has updated its national guideline recommending antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all people living with HIV (PLWH) since 2016. This study was to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) with CD4 levels >350 cells/mm3, who had just become eligible to receive free ART in China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 262 eligible HIV-infected MSM who had never received ART. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used to guide the variable selection. The prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART was 69.9%. After adjusting for significant background variables, all five constructs of TPB were significantly associated with behavioral intention to initiate ART. These significant constructs were: positive attitudes (adjusted odds ratios, AOR: 1.14; 95% CI [1.06, 1.24]) and negative attitudes (AOR: 0.89; 95% CI [0.82, 0.97]) toward immediate ART initiation; perceived their significant others would support them to initiate ART immediately (perceived subjective norm; AOR: 1.14; 95% CI [1.03, 1.25]); perceived high proportion of PLWH having similar CD4 cell levels were on ART (perceived descriptive norm; AOR: 2.22, 95% CI [1.16, 4.24]); and being confident in initiating ART immediately (perceived behavioral control; AOR: 1.21; 95% CI [1.04, 1.39]). Prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART was high among this group of MSM. Effective health promotion is needed to translate behavioral intention into related action.

This study aimed to compare the metabolic profiles of ENSs' and AHNSs' groups. Males aged 25-45 years and free from a known history of metabolic and/or cardiovascular diseases were included. According to the smoking status, two groups of ENSs and AHNSs were identified. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), waist circumference (WC, cm), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP, mmHg), fasting blood data in mmol/L (blood glycemia [FBG], triglycerides [TG], total cholesterol [TC], high- and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C, LDL-C]) and obesity status were evaluated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the 2006 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommendations. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD) or percentages. Compared to the AHNSs' group ( n = 29), the ENSs' one ( n = 29) had (a) higher values of BMI (26.5 ± 2.3 vs. 28.2 ± 3.6), WC (95 ± 7 vs. 100 ± 10), and TG (1.22 ± 0.40 vs. 1.87 ± 0.85); and (b) included a lower percentage of males having low HDL-C (82.7% vs. 62.0%), and higher percentages of males having obesity (6.9% vs. 37.9%) or hypertriglyceridemia (10.7% vs. 51.7%).

A sample of 255 males completed the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) (a) at the baseline, before their initial fertility evaluation (T1); (b) before their second andrological appointment 2-3 months after diagnostic disclosure (T2); and (c) before subsequent treatment-related/follow-up appointments (T3, T4) to be screened for clinically significant distress and risk for psychiatric morbidity. Then they were dichotomized as non-cases and cases. The timing of psychological testing was strictly related to andrological appointments and medical procedures. The research demonstrated that the baseline prevalence of clinical distress and psychiatric morbidity in all the subgroups was similar to reference values, but then significantly surged after the diagnostic disclosure, particularly in male and mixed factor respondents. However, the percentage of clinically distressed mixed or idiopathic factor of infertility respondents remained stable after diagnostic disclosure and during the entire follow-up. The prevalence of clinically significant distress and risk for psychiatric morbidity in the male factor of infertility, female factor of infertility, and mixed factor subgroups decreased during the follow-up but remained higher than at the baseline. The study identifies that the course of distress and risk of psychiatric morbidity of males is significantly affected by their factor of infertility and changes across the pathway of treatment-related/follow-up appointments.",A Qualitative Assessment to Understand the Barriers and Enablers Affecting Contraceptive Use Among Adolescent Male Emergency Department Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819063,American journal of men's health,2019 04 06,"Early fatherhood is common in the United States (U.S.). The emergency department (ED) plays a disproportionate role in serving patients with unmet reproductive and sexual health needs. With 8 million adolescent males visiting U.S. EDs annually, the ED is a potential site to implement interventions to minimize early fatherhood and unintended teenage pregnancy. Little is known about how adolescent male ED patients perceive and behave in sexual relationships and how they influence contraceptive decision making. The objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers affecting contraceptive and condom use among adolescent male ED patients. Semistructured interviews were conducted with males aged 14-19 in one urban ED. Enrollment continued until saturation of key themes. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded based on thematic analysis using NVivo 10. The Social Ecological Model was used to organize and understand themes. Participants ( n = 24) were predominantly 18-19 years (63%) and Hispanic (92%). Most (71%) had sex ≤3 months prior but infrequently used a condom at last intercourse (42%). The primary barrier influencing contraceptive use was lack of knowledge of effective contraceptives. Other barriers consisted of perceived gender roles, poor partner communication, and little relationship with a primary provider. Enablers included intention not to get a partner pregnant, school-based sexual health education, normalcy to use condoms, and a trustworthy confidante. The identified barriers and enablers influencing adolescent males' perspectives toward contraceptives should be addressed if designing future ED-based pregnancy prevention interventions targeting teen males."

In an effort to obtain an endometriosis ex vivo model, we established the spontaneously growing TH-EM1 cell line from endometriotic implants in lung parenchyma from a woman with TE. Maintained in long-term culture, the cells grew as large mesenchymal-like cells with a doubling time between 5 and 6 days. Treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (10-7 mol/L) inhibited the TH-EM1 cells growth and induced morphological changes to an epithelial-like cells. Strong expression of the nuclear estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and erytropoietin receptors were found in both the pulmonary implant and the TH-EM1 cells by immunohistochemical analysis. Consistent immunoreactivity of TH-EM1 cells for CD9, CD13, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD157 was revealed by flow cytometry. Likewise, the embryonic markers, SRY-box 2 (SOX-2) and the Nanog molecules, were detected in 76% and 52% of the cells, while fetal hemoglobin and α-globin were detected in 76% and 65% of TH-EM1 cells, respectively.

Using the feature observations and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classifications from radiologists examining diagnostic and screening mammograms, we modeled their decisions to understand their judgments. Our model could help improve the decisions made by radiologists using their own feature observations and classifications while maintaining their observed sensitivities. Based on 112,433 mammographic cases from 36,111 patients and 13 radiologists at 2 separate institutions with a 1.1% prevalence of malignancy, we trained a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN) to estimate the malignancy probabilities of lesions. For each radiologist, we learned an observed probabilistic threshold within the model. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of each radiologist against the BN model using either their observed threshold or the standard 2% threshold recommended by BI-RADS. We found significant variability among the radiologists' observed thresholds. By applying the observed thresholds, the BN model showed a 0.01% (1 case) increase in false negatives and a 28.9% (3612 cases) reduction in false positives. When using the standard 2% BI-RADS-recommended threshold, there was a 26.7% (47 cases) increase in false negatives and a 47.3% (5911 cases) reduction in false positives. Our results show that we can significantly reduce screening mammography false positives with a minimal increase in false negatives. We find that learning radiologists' observed thresholds provides valuable information regarding the conservativeness of clinical practice and allows us to quantify the variability in sensitivity across and within institutions. Our model could provide support to radiologists to improve their performance and consistency within mammography practice.",Determinants of Intimate Partner Violence Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men: The P18 Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819047,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 03 01,"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is an understudied health problem among young gay, bisexual, and other non-identified young men who have sex with men (YMSM). According to cross-sectional studies, IPV is associated with psychosocial and mental health problems, such as stigma and depression, among YMSM. IPV is also associated with health-risk behaviors, such as substance use, among this population. Yet, to date, no studies have used longitudinal data to examine determinants of IPV among YMSM. This gap in the extant literature is problematic, as it limits our understanding of how to intervene to interrupt cycles of violence. The aim of the present study was to examine longitudinal determinants of IPV among a sample of (N = 526) YMSM living in the New York City area. Longitudinal analyses using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to examine individual, relationship, mental health, psychosocial, and substance use factors in relation to IPV victimization and perpetration. Most notably, early experiences of IPV were a robust predictor of later experiences of IPV victimization and perpetration. Relationship status, depression, public gay-related stigma, and illicit substance use were associated with IPV victimization over time. Similarly, relationship status, depression, public gay-related stigma, marijuana, and other illicit substance were associated with IPV perpetration. These findings suggest that prevention programs and awareness campaigns should aim to reach YMSM before their first experiences of relationship violence, as these early experiences of violence are strongly linked to later experiences of violence. Also, IPV interventions should be tailored to the needs of YMSM and should target depressive symptoms, gay-related stigma, and substance use behaviors. Additionally, substance use interventions may be improved by addressing IPV. Finally, policymakers should support policies that improve the social climate for LGBTQ people, thereby reducing gay-related stigma, and potentially stemming violence against and among YMSM.",Thromboprophylaxis for inpatients with advanced cancer in palliative care settings: A systematic review and narrative synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819046,Palliative medicine,2019 05 07,"Patients with advanced cancer have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism.

Despite advances in the clinical utility and reliability of the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders, clinical tools inadequately predict which patients will develop chronic TMJ pain and degeneration, limiting clinical management. The challenges of managing and treating TMJ OA are due, in part, to a limited understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of TMJ pain. OA is initiated by multiple factors, including injury, aging, abnormal joint mechanics, and atypical joint shape, which can produce microtrauma, remodeling of joint tissues, and synovial inflammation. TMJ microtrauma and remodeling can increase expression of cytokines, chemokines, and catabolic factors that damage synovial tissues and can activate free nerve endings in the joint. Although studies have separately investigated inflammation-driven orofacial pain, acute activity of the trigeminal nerve, or TMJ tissue degeneration and/or damage, the temporal mechanistic factors leading to chronic TMJ pain are undefined. Limited understanding of the interaction between degeneration, intra-articular chemical factors, and pain has further restricted the development of targeted, disease-modifying drugs to help patients avoid long-term pain and invasive procedures, like TMJ replacement. A range of animal models captures features of intra-articular inflammation, joint overloading, and tissue damage. Although those models traditionally measure peripheral sensitivity as a surrogate for pain, recent studies recognize the brain's role in integrating, modulating, and interpreting nociceptive inputs in the TMJ, particularly in light of psychosocial influences on TMJ pain. The articular and neural contributors to TMJ pain, imaging modalities with clinical potential to identify TMJ OA early, and future directions for clinical management of TMJ OA are reviewed in the context of evidence in the field.",Perfusion strategy and mid-term results of 58 consecutive pulmonary endarterectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819040,Perfusion,2019 03 01,The aim of this retrospective study was to review and report short-term and mid-term outcomes of pulmonary endarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension at our institute in the recent 2 years and to describe perfusion strategy.,Connectedness and ICT: Opening the door to possibilities for people with intellectual disabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819039,Journal of intellectual disabilities : JOID,2019 03 01,"This study aimed to investigate the experiences of people with intellectual disability (ID) using information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the ways these technologies foster social connectedness.

We report the case of a 14-year-old patient with Panton-Valentine leucocidin producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and Influenza B pneumonia requiring veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenator for refractory shock. In the absence of response to conventional therapy, we have inserted a Cytosorb® cartridge within the extra-corporeal membrane oxygenator circuit. A spectacular decrease in vasopressor requirements followed. Since clindamycin, a key component of Panton-Valentine leucocidin producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment, might be removed by Cytosorb® hemoadsorption, we have performed serial plasma concentrations measurements of the drug. Based on these measurements, we were able to develop a pharmacokinetic model incorporating variable plasma clearance. Patient's exposure was estimated before, during and after Cytosorb® hemoadsorption. According to this model, Cytosorb® hemoadsorption did not seem to result in significant clindamycin removal. Cytosorb® hemoadsorption during Panton-Valentine leucocidin producing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection appears safe and feasible and no adaptation of clindamycin dosage seems necessary.",Na+/K+-ATPase α isoform deficiency results in distinct spreading depolarization phenotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819023,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 03 01,"Compromised Na+/K+-ATPase function is associated with the occurrence of spreading depolarization (SD). Mutations in ATP1A2, the gene encoding the α2 isoform of the Na+/K+-ATPase, were identified in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 (FHM2), a Mendelian model disease for SD. This suggests a distinct role for the α2 isoform in modulating SD susceptibility and raises questions about underlying mechanisms including the roles of other Na+/K+-ATPase α isoforms. Here, we investigated the effects of genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of α1, α2, and α3 on SD using heterozygous knock-out mice. We found that only α2 heterozygous mice displayed higher SD susceptibility when challenged with prolonged extracellular high potassium concentration ([K+]o), a pronounced post SD oligemia and higher SD speed in-vivo. By contrast, under physiological [K+]o, α2 heterozygous mice showed similar SD susceptibility compared to wild-type littermates. Deficiency of α3 resulted in increased resistance against electrically induced SD in-vivo, whereas α1 deficiency did not affect SD. The results support important roles of the α2 isoform in SD. Moreover, they suggest that specific experimental conditions can be necessary to reveal an inherent SD phenotype by driving a (meta-) stable system into decompensation, reminiscent of the episodic nature of SDs in various diseases.","Risk Factors for Developing Comorbid Sleeping Problems: Results of a Survey of 1,925 Women Over 50 With a Chronic Health Condition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819022,Journal of aging and health,2019 03 01,To test the association between sleeping problems and multiple epidemiological factors among women over 50 with a chronic condition.,Native Coronary Collateral Microcirculation Reserve in Rat Hearts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819021,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 04 26,"Background We occasionally noticed that native collateral blood flow showed a recessive trend in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction in rats, which greatly interferes with the accurate assessment of native collateral circulation levels. Here, we sought to recognize the coronary collateral circulation system in depth, especially the microcirculation part, on this basis. Methods and Results In this study, we detected native collateral flow with positron emission tomography perfusion imaging in rats and found that the native flow is relatively abundant when it is initially recruited. However, this flow is extremely unstable in the early stage of acute myocardial infarction and quickly fails. We used tracers to mark the collateral in an ischemic area and a massive preformed collateral network was labeled. The ultrastructures of these collateral microvessels are flawed, which contributes to extensive leakage and consequent interstitial edema in the ischemic region. Conclusions An unrecognized short-lived native coronary collateral microcirculation reserve is widely distributed in rat hearts. Recession of collateral blood flow transported by coronary collateral microcirculation reserve contributes to instability of native collateral blood flow in the early stage of acute myocardial infarction. The immature structure determines that these microvessels are short-lived and provide conditions for the development of early interstitial edema in acute myocardial infarction.",Propofol-based sedation does not negatively influence oxygenator running time compared to midazolam in patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30819020,The International journal of artificial organs,2019 04 16,Patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are frequently in need for sedation.

In addition, the comparison to other conditions of known placental and vascular/inflammatory involvement strengthens such findings. Our results suggest that the clinical association between SCA and PE can be supported by common pathophysiological mechanisms, but that pathways involving response to copper and triglyceride metabolism may be important drivers of the pathophysiology of PE.

Autoimmune disease are important and predisposing factors for the pathogenesis of the bone disease; however, the pathological mechanism is unclear. We have demonstrated that systemic autoimmune disease in BXSB/MpJ- Yaa is closely associated with the morpho-functional abnormalities of bones including bone marrow and has complicated pathology. The abnormalities are characterized by altered regulations of serum calcium, anemia tendency, and hematopoiesis with increased WBCs and decreased PLs, short length and low mass of long bones, imbalance in the populations of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and increased expression of candidate genes for causing and/or exacerbating their phenotypes.

Sixty-five of one-hundred three (63%) young people participated; 37/65 male; age range 13.9-18.9 (median 17.4 years). Risk behaviour included 6 intravenous drug, 58 cannabis, and 61 had sexual partners, of whom 52 (85%) engaged in unprotected sex. Sixty-five participants were negative for BBV infection: 9 were HBV immune. HB vaccination was not available at the centre (for <18 year), and all refused referral to their general practitioner for vaccination due to fear of disclosure.

However, the validity of comparisons of Autism Spectrum Quotient scores between groups may be threatened by differential item functioning. Differential item functioning entails a bias in items, where participants with equal values of the latent trait give different answers because of their group membership. In this article, items of the Autism Spectrum Quotient were studied for differential item functioning between different groups within a single sample ( N = 408). Three analyses were conducted. First, using a Rasch mixture model, two latent groups were detected that show differential item functioning. Second, using a Rasch regression tree model, four groups were found that show differential item functioning: men without autism, women without autism, people 50 years and younger with autism, and people older than 50 years with autism. Third, using traditional methods, differential item functioning was detected between groups with and without autism. Therefore, group comparisons with the Autism Spectrum Quotient are at risk of being affected by bias. Eight items emerged that consistently show differences in response tendencies between groups across analyses, and these items were generally negatively phrased. Two often-used short forms of the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the AQ-28 and AQ-10, may be more suitable for group comparisons.",Animal-assisted activity improves social behaviors in psychiatrically hospitalized youth with autism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818971,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,2019 03 01,"There is preliminary research suggesting that animal-assisted activities can improve social interactions of children with autism spectrum disorder. This pilot study sought to investigate the benefits of animal-assisted activities with dogs and psychiatrically hospitalized youth with autism spectrum disorder. Participants were recruited from a specialized inpatient psychiatric hospital unit for youth with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Utilizing a crossover design, participants served as their own control by engaging in two 10-min conditions: an experimental dog and handler interaction (animal-assisted activities) and a novel toy and handler control (control). Of the 142 youth aged 6--8 years screened for participation, 47 completed both conditions. Participants' behavioral data were captured via video and coded using the Observation of Human-Animal Interaction for Research, a tool specifically developed to capture human behavioral interactions in the presence of animals. Overall, social-communication behaviors significantly improved in the animal-assisted activities experimental condition compared to the control condition ( p = 0.0001). Specifically, participants in the animal-assisted activities experimental condition displayed more positive emotional facial expressions ( p ⩽ 0.0001), talking ( p = 0.0408), use of gestures ( p = 0.032), and looking at both adults and peers ( p ⩽ 0.0001). In addition, a higher frequency of constant motion ( p = 0.003) was observed in the animal-assisted activities experimental condition. Results suggest that animal-assisted activities with a dog may promote social-communication behaviors in psychiatrically hospitalized youth with autism spectrum disorder. Given the fact that social and communication behaviors can facilitate treatment engagement for this population, we recommend future studies examine how such improvements can positively affect the psychiatric treatment of this population.",'People should be allowed to do what they like': Autistic adults' views and experiences of stimming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818970,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,2019 03 01,"'Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements' are characterised as core features in the diagnosis of autism, yet many autistic adults (and the neurodiversity movement) have reclaimed them as 'stimming'. Supported by a growing body of scientific research, autistic adults argue that these behaviours may serve as useful coping mechanisms, yet little research has examined stimming from the perspective of autistic adults. Through interviews and focus groups, we asked 32 autistic adults to share their perceptions and experiences of stimming, including the reasons they stim, any value doing so may hold for them and their perceptions of others' reactions to stimming. Using thematic analysis, we identified two themes: stimming as (1) a self-regulatory mechanism and (2) lacking in social acceptance, but can become accepted through understanding. Autistic adults highlighted the importance of stimming as an adaptive mechanism that helps them to soothe or communicate intense emotions or thoughts and thus objected to treatment that aims to eliminate the behaviour.","Review of services to inform clinical frameworks for adolescents and young adults with severe, persistent and complex mental illness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818969,Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,2019 03 01,"Severe, persistent and complex mental illness (SPCMI) affects a small proportion of young people but is associated with severe disability and a large burden on families and health services.

Stem cell transplantation after insult to the central nervous system has been regarded as the most promising approach for repair; however, engrafting cells alone might not be sufficient for effective regeneration. In this study, we have compared neural progenitors (NPs) from the fetal ventricular zone (VZ), the postnatal subventricular zone, and an immortalized radial glia (RG) cell line engineered to conditionally secrete the trophic factor insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Upon differentiation in vitro, the VZ cells were able to generate a greater number of neurons than subventricular zone cells. Furthermore, differentiated VZ cells generated pyramidal neurons . In vitro, doxycycline-driven secretion of IGF-1 strongly promoted neuronal differentiation of cells with hippocampal, interneuron and cortical specificity. Accordingly, VZ and engineered RG-IGF-1-hemagglutinin (HA) cells were selected for subsequent in vivo experiments. To increase cell survival, we delivered the NPs attached to a multifunctional chitosan-based scaffold. The microspheres containing adherent NPs were injected subacutely into the lesion cavity of adult rat brains that had sustained controlled cortical impact injury. At 2 weeks posttransplantation, the exogenously introduced cells showed a reduction in stem cell or progenitor markers and acquired mature neuronal and glial markers. In beam walking tests assessing sensorimotor recovery, transplanted RG cells secreting IGF-1 contributed significantly to functional improvement while native VZ or RG cells did not promote significant recovery. Altogether, these results support the therapeutic potential of chitosan-based multifunctional microsphere scaffolds seeded with genetically modified NPs expressing IGF-1 to promote repair and functional recovery after traumatic brain injuries.",Sleep and Pathological Wakefulness at the Time of Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation (SLEEWE). A Prospective Multicenter Physiological Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818966,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2019 05 01,"Rationale: Abnormal patterns of sleep and wakefulness exist in mechanically ventilated patients. Objectives: In this study (SLEEWE [Effect of Sleep Disruption on the Outcome of Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation]), we aimed to investigate polysomnographic indexes as well as a continuous index for evaluating sleep depth, the odds ratio product (ORP), to determine whether abnormal sleep or wakefulness is associated with the outcome of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). Methods: Mechanically ventilated patients from three sites were enrolled if an SBT was planned the following day. EEG was recorded using a portable sleep diagnostic device 15 hours before the SBT. The ORP was calculated from the power of four EEG frequency bands relative to each other, ranging from full wakefulness (2.5) to deep sleep (0). The correlation between the right and left hemispheres' ORP (R/L ORP) was calculated. Measurements and Main Results: Among 44 patients enrolled, 37 had technically adequate signals: 11 (30%) passed the SBT and were extubated, 8 (21%) passed the SBT but were not deemed to be clinically ready for extubation, and 18 (49%) failed the SBT. Pathological wakefulness or atypical sleep were highly prevalent, but the distribution of classical sleep stages was similar between groups. The mean ORP and the proportion of time in which the ORP was >2.2 were higher in extubated patients compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). R/L ORP was significantly lower in patients who failed the SBT, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of R/L ORP to predict failure was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.98). Conclusions: Patients who pass an SBT and are extubated reach higher levels of wakefulness as indicated by the ORP, suggesting abnormal wakefulness in others. The hemispheric ORP correlation is much poorer in patients who fail an SBT.",Child and parent outcomes following parent interventions for child emotional and behavioral problems in autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818965,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,2019 03 29,"There is growing interest in the development of behavioral parent interventions targeting emotional and behavioral problems in children with autism spectrum disorders. Such interventions have potential to improve a number of child and parental well-being outcomes beyond disruptive child behavior. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses evidence for the efficacy of behavioral parent interventions for disruptive and hyperactive child behavior in autism spectrum disorders, as well as parenting efficacy and stress. A total of 11 articles from nine randomized controlled trials were included. Sufficient data were available to calculate standardized mean difference and show favorable effects of behavioral parent interventions on parent-reported measures of child disruptive behavior (standardized mean difference = 0.67), hyperactivity (standardized mean difference = 0.31) and parent stress (standardized mean difference = 0.37); effects on parent efficacy are less clear (standardized mean difference = 0.39, p = 0.17). There were insufficient data to explore intervention effects on internalizing behavior in autism spectrum disorders, parenting behaviors, or observational and teacher-reported outcomes, providing important avenues for future research.

The study included 289 patients. The age was 10.0 (6.0, 35.4) months,and there were 198 male and 91 female patients. The patients were followed up at outpatient clinic. Survival rates were calculated with Kaplan-Meier. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was made to determine the risk factors of postoperative death. Results: Seventy-nine patients required the first stage palliation surgery, 232 patients received the Glenn shunt surgery, and 162 patients completed the Fontan procedure. Overall, postoperative death occurred in 39 patients including 21 after the first stage palliation surgery (early stage 13 cases, late stage 8 cases) , 10 after the Glenn shunt surgery (early stage 5 cases, late stage 5 cases) , and 8 following the Fontan procedure (early stage 6 cases, late stage 2 cases) . Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that survival rate of the entire cohort was 90.2% (95%CI 86.7%-93.7%) , 85.9% (95%CI 81.8%-90.0%) ,and 84.6% (95%CI 79.7%-89.5%) at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years post operation. Survival rate was 74.4% (95%CI 64.8%-84.0%) , 73.0% (95%CI 63.2%-82.8%) , and 73.0% (95%CI 63.2%-82.8%) at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post the first stage palliation surgery, 97.8% (95%CI 95.8%-99.7%) , 95.2% (95%CI 92.3%-98.1%) , and 95.2% (95%CI 92.3%-98.1%) at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post Glenn shunt surgery, 95.6% (95%CI 92.5%-98.7%) and 93.7% (95%CI 88.8%-98.6%) at 1 year and 5 years post Fontan surgery. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (HR=5.47, 95%CI 2.71-11.04, P<0.001), atrioventricular valve regurgitation more than moderate (HR=2.52, 95%CI 1.32-4.79, P=0.005), systemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction (HR=3.47, 95%CI 1.30-9.29, P=0.013), and required the first palliation surgery (HR=3.12, 95%CI 1.59-6.15, P=0.001) were risk factors of postoperative death. Conclusions: The multistage surgery can effectively improve the survival of patientswith functional single ventricle and is associated with satisfactory long-term prognosis. Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, atrioventricular valve regurgitation more than moderate, systemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and required the first palliation surgery are risk factors of postoperative death in these patients.",[Meta-analysis on safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy combining with proton pump inhibitors for patients after percutaneous coronary intervention].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818941,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,2019 04 08,"Objective: To analyze the impact of dual antiplatelet (DAPT) therapy combining with or without proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the main outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literature and the references obtained from these sources were retrieved manually from inception till September 2017. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established follow the Cochrane review standard. A total of 977 literatures were included, 193 duplicates were excluded, 74 reviews, case reports, letters and systematic reviews were excluded, 667 literatures were excluded after reading the title and abstract, 34 literatures were excluded due to non-randomized control studies and unrelated outcome indicators, and 9 literatures were finally included with a total of 16 589 patients. RevMan 5.3 software was used to compare the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiogenic death, recurrent myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, all-cause death, stent thrombosis, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and gastrointestinal events in patients with DAPT combining with or without PPI after PCI. Results: MACE was observed in 8 out of the 9 included literatures, and the results showed that MACE occurred in 561 out of 6 282 patients receiving DAPT combining with PPI therapy and in 951 out of 9 632 patients using DAPT alone (OR=1.15, 95%CI 0.88-1.51, P>0.05).

Gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 6 out of the 9 included literatures. The results showed that gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 26 out of 3 517 patients receiving DAPT combined with PPI therapy, and in 93 out of the 3 506 patients treated with DAPT, gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly lower in the DAPT combining with PPI group than DAPT alone group (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.17-0.41, P<0.01). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 6 out of the 9 included articles. Similarly, gastrointestinal events were observed in 51 out of 3 517 patients receiving DAPT combined with PPI therapy, and in 190 out of the 3 506 patients treated with DAPT alone, the incidence of gastrointestinal events in the DAPT combined with PPI group was significantly lower than DAPT alone group (OR=0.24, 95%CI 0.14-0.42, P<0.01). Conclusions: The incidence of MACE, cardiogenic death, recurrent myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, all-cause death, stent thrombosis and stroke are not affected by DAPT combined with PPI therapy after PCI, while the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding and gastrointestinal events could be reduced by adding PPI to DAPT in patients undergoing PCI.",[Value of fibrinogen to albumin ratio on predicting spontaneous recanalization of infarct-related artery in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818940,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,2019 04 08,"Objective: To investigate the value of fibrinogen to albumin ratio (FAR) at admission on predicting spontaneous recanalization of infarct-related artery (IRA) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: Clinical data from 255 acute STEMI patients ((61.1±11.2) years old, 189 males) who underwent emergency coronary angiography within 12 hours in our hospital from December 2015 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The acute STEMI patients were divided into non-spontaneous recanalization group (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0-1, 203 cases) and spontaneous recanalization group (TIMI flow grade 2-3, 52 cases). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate related factors of IRA spontaneous recanalization. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the value of FAR in predicting spontaneous coronary recanalization. Results: There was no significant difference in age,gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking,systolic blood pressure,diastolic blood pressure,heart rate, duration of chest pain, type of infarction, infarct-related artery, door-to-balloon time, and drug used before admission between non-spontaneous recanalization group and spontaneous recanalization group (all P>0.05). The FAR and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the spontaneous recanalization group than in the non-spontaneous recanalization group (8.20±1.85 vs. 11.02±2.75, P<0.001; (6.87±3.36) g/L vs. (8.51±3.72) g/L, P=0.004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that FAR (OR=0.492, 95%CI 0.354-0.686, P<0.001), serum uric acid (OR=0.994, 95%CI 0.989-0.999, P=0.018) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR=0.774, 95%CI 0.614-0.975, P=0.030) were independent negative correlation with spontaneous recanalization of infarct-related artery in patients with acute STEMI. The ROC curve showed that the area under the curve of FAR predicting spontaneous recanalization of infarct-related artery in patients with acute STEMI was 0.807 (95%CI 0.630-0.758, P<0.001), and the diagnostic threshold was 9.26, the sensitivity was 76.9%, the specificity was 75.9%.

Methods: Data of 2 972 consecutive hospitalized patients with UA in Beijing Friendship Hospital from January 2013 to September 2017 were retrospective analyzed. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the level of NT-proBNP on admission: 733 cases with NT-proBNP lower than 61 ng/L, 749 cases with NT-proBNP between 61 and 133 ng/L, 747 cases with NT-proBNP between 133 and 326 ng/L, and 743 cases with NT-proBNP higher than 326 ng/L. LVEF and in-hospital MACCE were compared among 4 groups and the predictive value of NT-proBNP on admission on LVEF and in-hospital MACCE was determined by multiple logistical regression analysis. Results: LVEF value became lower with increasing on admission NT-proBNP value ((68.4±4.8)%, (68.2±5.2)%, (67.2±6.7)% and (62.6±10.4)%, F=77.98, P<0.01), while in-hospital MACCE was higher with increasing on admission NT-proBNP value (3.4% (25/733), 3.5% (26/749), 5.5% (41/747) and 7.3% (54/743), χ(2)=16.23, P<0.01) in NT-proBNP lower than 61 ng/L, NT-proBNP between 61 and 133 ng/L, NT-proBNP between 133 and 326 ng/L, and NT-proBNP higher than 326 ng/L group. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that on admission NT-proBNP was an independent predictor for LVEF<50% (Exp(β)=5.875, 95%CI 3.382-10.207, P<0.001), but not predictor for in-hospital MACCE (Exp(β)=0.783, 95%CI 0.400-1.996, P=0.783).

Methods: From January 2013 to December 2013, 9 769 consecutive patients underwent selective PCI in Fuwai Hospital were retrospectively included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups, including non-post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group and low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group (enoxaparin 0.4 ml/12 h or fondaparinux 2.5 mg/day by subcutaneous injection for 2-3 days after PCI). All patients were evaluated at 30 days, 180 days and 12 months for major adverse coronary and cerebral events (MACCE) including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, revascularization and stroke as well as in-stent thrombosis and bleeding events. Data from 1 755 pairs of patients were analysis after propensity score matching. The clinical outcomes were compared between groups by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis before and after propensity score matching. Multivariable Cox analysis was used to define the impact and determinants of post-PCI anticoagulation on clinical outcomes. Results: one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five (18.0%) patients didn't receive post-PCI anticoagulation and 8 014 (82.0%) patients received post-PCI anticoagulation, 5 666 (58.0%) patients received enoxaparin and 2 348 (24.0%) patients received fondaparinux. Patients were younger and incidence of female patients was less, incidence of renal dysfunction and acute coronary syndrome were higher in low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group than in non-post-PCI anticoagulation group (all P<0.05). Similarly, patients with post-PCI anticoagulation were associated with more left main coronary artery lesion and branch lesion (P<0.05). Post-PCI anticoagulation patients were associated with less trans-femoral process, more drug-eluting stents implantation and less simple balloon dilatation (all P<0.05). Nine thousand seven hundred and seventeen (99.5%) patients completed 2 years follow up. Post-PCI anticoagulation patients had significantly lower 30-day all-cause death (0.05% (4 cases) vs. 0.46% (8 cases), P<0.001) and stroke (0 vs. 0.11% (2 cases), P=0.003), lower 180-day all-cause death (0.17% (14 cases) vs. 0.57% (10 cases), P=0.002), revascularization (2.07% (166 cases) vs. 3.71% (65 cases), P<0.001) and MACCE (3.49% (280 cases) vs. 5.47% (96 cases), P<0.001), lower 2-year revascularization (7.61% (610 cases) vs. 12.84% (225 cases), P<0.001) and MACCE (10.92 (875 cases) vs. 16.01% (281 cases), P<0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that post-PCI anticoagulant therapy was an independent protective factor of 30-day (HR=0.17, 95%CI 0.05-0.62, P=0.007), 180-day all-cause death (HR=0.37, 95%CI 0.16-0.87, P=0.023) and MACCE (HR=0.74, 95%CI 0.58-0.94, P=0.013), 2-year MACCE (HR=0.71, 95%CI 0.62-0.81, P<0.001). After propensity score matching, post-PCI anticoagulation therapy remained as an independent protective factor of 30-day all-cause death (HR=0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.92, P=0.042) and 2-year MACCE (HR=0.81, 95%CI 0.68-0.96, P=0.015). Conclusions: Low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy may decrease 30-day all-cause death, 180-day all-cause death and MACCE and 2-year MACCE, and meanwhile this option does not increase bleeding risk in patients underwent selective PCI.",[Chinese expert consensus statement on clinical diagnosis and treatment of syncope 2018].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818937,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,2019 05 10,

Rational treatment in early stage of HCC can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. Detection of early-stage liver lesions through diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, incoherent motion within voxels, magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, or other functional imaging can accurately evaluate grade of malignancy and guide towards the curative effect of different treatment schemes. Volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) with three techniques, namely, CAIPIRINHA, Dixon, and TWIST, i.e., CDT-VIBE sequence can provide multiple sets of arterial phase images in a short time, and detect small foci transient enhancement that cannot be detected by other examinations, and the differences in initial enhancement phase of apparent lesions are of great significance for suggesting hemodynamic characteristics.

Methods: Eighty Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group (8 rats) and model group (72 rats). After 10 days of intragastric administration of isoniazid, the model group rats were randomly divided into treatment group (A), natural recovery group (B), etiological persistence group (C) and etiological persistence plus treatment group (D). Sixteen rats from each group were sacrificed after 1 and 2 weeks of intervention with different methods. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected. Liver pathological morphology was observed. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay. ERS protein expression was detected by Western blot. A t-test or randomized block analysis of variance, K-S test and Levene's test were used to analyze the normality and homogeneity of variance. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for data that did not suit the conditions of t-test and variance analysis. Results: ALT and AST were elevated in the model group, and liver pathological examination showed liver tissue damage. Apoptotic index was higher than control group (7.13% ± 1.55% vs. 0.75% ± 0.71%, Z = -3.411, P < 0.01), and the expression value of ERS protein in model group was significantly higher than control group (GRP78: 1.16 ± 0.30 vs. 0.23 ± 0.05, t = -6.008, P < 0.01; CHOP: 0.98±0.23 vs. 0.20 ± 0.10, t = -6.378, P < 0.01). Serum enzymes, apoptotic index and ERS protein expressions of rats were decreased after treatment with bicyclol, and the pathological damage was eased. Rats in natural recovery group recovered less than the treatment group. Conclusion: Isoniazid-induced liver injury is associated to ERS-related excessive apoptosis and the therapeutic effect of bicyclol on drug-induced liver injury may minimize ERS-induced apoptosis.",[Application of multi-slice spiral CT to assess vascular volume for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric varices].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818918,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 05 28,"Objective: To differentiate the inflow and outflow channels of gastric varices in cirrhotic portal hypertension patients using multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT), and to assess the relationship between calculable CT volume of gastric varices and the amount of tissue adhesive. Methods: 97 cases with cirrhotic gastric varices who were admitted from November 2013 to August 2017 were selected. The type and shape of gastric varices were observed before tissue glue injection treatment by MSCT. The correlation between CT volume of gastric varices and the amount of tissue adhesive was evaluated by Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Univariate linear regression analysis. Results: MSCT showed that Le, g type had the highest proportion (54.6%), followed by Le, g, Lg (20.6%). Le, Lg and Lgf type accounted for 17.5%, and 5.2%, respectively, while Lgf+b accounted for 2.1%. On MSCT, varices of the gastric fundus were in the direction from bottom to top, and 75% of the fundus had a large curved side varices combined with gastric and renal shunt. Under the gastroscopy, varices in the small curved side of the gastric fundus from near to far were formless. In addition, varices in the large curved side of the gastric fundus when observed from different angles to the direction of blood flow (reverse gastroscope) were 72.7% (near and far) or 20.5 % (far and near). There was a positive correlation between CT volume (R = 0.97, P < 0.001) and the amount of tissue adhesive (Y(1) = 0.35 + 0.65X1, Univariate linear regression equation; ρ = 0.89, P < 0.001, Spearman correlation analysis). Conclusion: MSCT can recognize the vascular shape and inflow and outflow channels of gastric varices. A positive correlation between CT volume and the amount of tissue adhesive, suggested that the CT volume measurement before treatment could be used as one of the method to predict the amount of tissue adhesive.",[Real-world study of paritaprevir/ritonavir-ombitasvir combined with dasabuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 1b genotype infection in China].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818917,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 05 28,"Objective: To evaluate the real-world safety and curative effect of ombitasvir combined with dasabuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 1b genotype infection in non-cirrhotic or compensated cirrhotic patients.

Of these 88.8% (71/80) were newly diagnosed, 12.5% (10/80) were compensated cirrhotic, 97.5% (78/80) received 12 weeks treatment, and 2.5% (2/80) received 8 weeks treatment. The rate of HCV RNA negative at EOT (end of treatment) was 100% (64/64). A total of 67 patients completed the treatment within 12 weeks, and 43 patients returned to the hospital for further consultations, and SVR12 was 100%(43/43). No patient discontinued the drugs because of an adverse event during treatment. Conclusion: In the real world, Ombitasvir combined with dasabuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 1b genotype infection in China has 100% rates of EOT and SVR12 with well- tolerability and safety.",[Clinical significance of CTP combined with ABIC score in predicting the short-term prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818916,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 05 28,"Objective: To investigate the risk factors affecting the short-term prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF), and establish a new scoring model to predict the short-term prognosis of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 222 patients with HBV-ACLF. According to their clinical outcomes during hospitalization and 90 days after discharge, they were divided into survival and death group. Clinical data were collected to calculate the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), albumin-bilirubin (ALBI), and age-bilirubin-international normalized ratio-creatinine (ABIC) scores for prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the independent risk factors affecting 90-day mortality in HBV-ACLF patients. Cox regression model was used to establish a new prediction model. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to calculate short-term prognostic value of the models. K-M survival curve was used to predict the prognosis of patients. Results: CTP and ABIC scores were independent risk factors for 90-day mortality in HBV-ACLF patients, and the risk of death from liver failure had increased with increase of score. Cox regression model established a new predictive model CTP-ABIC = 0.551 × CTP + 0.297 × ABIC. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of all three scoring models (CTP, ABIC and CTP-ABIC) were 0.878, 0.829, 0.927, respectively. CTP-ABIC score was superior to the CTP and ABIC score (P value < 0.001). Patients with CTP-ABIC score ≥9.08 had higher mortality rate than patients with CTP-ABIC score < 9.08, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: All three scoring systems can predict short-term prognosis in patients with HBV-ACLF, but the accuracy of CTP-ABIC is superior.",[Impact of cessation of antiviral therapy at delivery on postpartum liver function in mothers with chronic hepatitis B virus infection].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818915,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 05 28,"Objective: To investigate the impact of immediate cessation of antiviral therapy on postpartum liver function and the factors influencing postpartum abnormality in mothers with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. One hundred eighty-eight pregnant women with HBV DNA level > 2×106 IU/ml were enrolled from June 2014 to June 2018. Demographic information and clinical data of liver function and HBV DNA load during gravidity, intrapartum and postpartum period were collected. According to the antiviral treatment recommendations during pregnancy, the women were divided into three groups, namely, tenofovir (TDF), telbivudine (LdT) and control group. Liver function abnormalities among the three groups were compared within 6 months after delivery, and the factors influencing abnormal liver function were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression. Results: Of the 188 cases, 72 cases were in the TDF group, 80 cases in the LdT group, and 36 cases in the control group. Pregnant women in the TDF and LdT groups received oral TDF (300 mg/d) and LdT (600 mg/d) from 28 ± 4 weeks of gestation till delivery. Among the 188 patients, 30 (16.0%) had abnormal postpartum liver function abnormality. The incidence of postpartum liver function abnormality [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN)] in the TDF, LdT, and control groups was 19.4%, 12.5%, and 16.7%, respectively. The postpartum peak levels of ALT (median, range) in the three groups were 34.5 (12.0-946.0) U/L, 37.5 (12.0-733.8) U/L, and 39.0 (7.0-513.0) U/L, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two indexes among the three groups (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the degree of postpartum liver function abnormalities between the three groups (P = 0.944). Most of the liver function abnormalities were mild to moderate (2 × ULN≤ALT < 10 × ULN), and usually resolved spontaneously or by treatment. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that baseline ALT level during pregnancy was an independent factor associated with postpartum liver function abnormality (OR = 1.031, CI 95%: 1.005-1.058; χ(2) = 5.340, P = 0.021), whereas age, antiviral therapy, HBeAg-positivity, baseline HBV DNA levels, gravidity, parity, preterm delivery and delivery mode were not significantly associated with postpartum liver function abnormality. Conclusion: Cessation of antiviral therapy after delivery did not significantly increase the risk of postpartum liver function abnormality in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection. The ALT level during pregnancy is a factor influencing postpartum liver function abnormality."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 4 patients from 3 families with LIG4 syndrome who were admitted to Children's Hospital of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics from June 2017 to May 2018, and reviewed related articles, the clinical, immunological and genetic characteristics of LIG4 syndrome were summarized and analyzed. Results: Those 4 cases (P1 to P4), including 2 males and 2 females, had an average age of 1.5 years. All of them presented with special facial features, such as microcephaly, beak-like-nose, and receding forehead. Three of them presented with delayed physical development. P3 suffered from mental retardation and P4 had feeding difficulty. BCG scars were repeatedly ruptured in 3 cases, 4 cases had pneumonia, 1 case had EB virus infection, 2 cases had cytomegalovirus infection, 1 case had fungal infection, and 1 case had chronic diarrhea. Blood routine tests showed decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Immunoassay showed decreased absolute count of CD4(+)T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte, with normal CD8(+)T cells. P1, P2 presented with decreased immunoglobulin. All of those patients had LIG4 gene complex heterozygous mutations, of whom one had missense mutation had mild clinical phenotype and another three cases had frameshift mutation presented with severe clinical phenotype. One patient underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and has established normal immune function. He did not have recurrent infection during one year follow-up period. The other 3 patients had preventive anti-infection treatment and received regular human immunoglobulin infusion, but they still had recurrent infection. In literature review, 67 articles were retrieved, totally 37 case were reported, showing special faces and recurrent infection as characteristic presentation of this disease. Conclusions: The typical manifestations of LIG4 syndrome are microcephaly, special facial features and repeated infection. The average age at diagnosis of LIG4 syndrome was more than one year old. If a patient presented with microcephaly, BCG scar infection and leukopenia, LIG4 syndrome should be considered. Immunoglobulin is decreased at different degrees, and CD4(+) and CD19(+) lymphocyte counts always decrease, Naive T and B cells decrease more prominently, and CD8(+)T cells were normal in patients with typical LIG4 syndrome. It is effective to reconstruction of immune system with bone marrow transplantation in LIG4 syndrome patients.",[Phenotype and genotype of twelve Chinese children with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818899,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 03 01,"Objective: To explore the phenotype and genotype of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDS) in Chinese children. Methods: The clinical and genetic data of 12 MDS patients (8 were boys and 4 were girls) diagnosed in the Department of Neurology in Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2010 to April 2018 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: The developmental milestones were normal or mildly retardated before disease onset. The age of onset ranged from 0 to 2.9-year-old. Most cases developed postnatal or after infection. The most common initial symptoms were feeding difficulty, seizure, muscle weakness, psychomotor regression and hepatic dysfunction. At the last evaluation, all the patients had developmental retardation, failure to thrive, muscle weakness, and dysphagia. Other clinical features were weight loss (9 cases), hearing impairment (7 cases), ptosis (6 cases), seizure (5 cases), dyspnea (4 cases), visual impairment (1 case), hirsutism (1 case), lactic acidosis (7 cases), elevated hepatic enzymes (4 cases) and creatine kinase (2 cases), elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid (3 cases), abnormalities on screening for inborn error of metabolism (10 cases) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (10 cases), abnormal electromyogram (including neurogenic or myogenic injury) (5 cases). Five patients died of infection or multiple organ failure. A total of 18 novel mutations presented below were detected in these patients. Among the 6 cases of encephalomyopathy, there were 3 with SUCLG1 mutation (c. 916G>T, c. 619T>C, c. 980dupT were novel), 2 with SUCLA2 mutation (c. 851G>A, c.971G>A were novel), and one with RRM2B mutation (c.456-2A>G, c.212T>C were novel).

Methods: Clinical data of a child with GEFS+ and his family members who visited Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center in August 2017 were collected. DNA samples of the proband and his parents, his grandparents were analyzed by the next-generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A literature search with ""STX1B"" as the key word was conducted at PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang databases to include recently published studies (up to May 2018). Results: The proband was a 2-year-old boy who was admitted to our hospital because of frequent epileptic seizures in a month, with focal seizures evolving into the generalized bilateral tonic-clonic epileptic attacks after febrile seizure. His seizures were well controlled by levetiracetam. His father presented febrile seizure in early childhood stage and epilepsy in adult stage, which were under control with lamotrigine. The proband's grandmother had a history of febrile seizure. Other family members had no history of convulsion. Ictal electroencephalogram showed low voltage fast activities (8-10 Hz) originating from the central region of the brain. Heterozygous mutation of STX1B gene (c.705C>G, p. Asn235Lys) was detected in the proband, his father and grandmother. The mutation has not been reported previously. Furthermore, no other family members carried the mutation at c. 705 locus of STX1B gene. No article in Chinese was found, and 4 articles in a language other than Chinese provided the complete case data of 9 mutation loci in 33 patients (4 families and 4 sporadic cases). With this research data (3 cases in 1 family) included, there were 36 cases and 10 mutation sites in STX1B gene. Of these mutations, there were 5 missense mutations, 3 nonsense mutations, 1 insert mutation and 1 deletion mutation; and according to the mutation distribution, there were 4 mutation sites in exon 3, 2 in exon 8, 2 in exon 9, and 1 in exon 1.There was incomplete penetrance in the family, so different types of epileptic attacks occurred among different family members. Conclusions: In this study, a de novo mutation of STX1B gene in a family with GEFS+ was defined, which would expand the gene mutation spectrum and provide basis for family genetic counseling. Clinical heterogeneity was found in this family. Seizures caused by STX1B gene mutation were sensitive to antiepileptic drugs.",[Predictive value of cytokines and procalcitonin on infection in children with hematological malignancies].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818897,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 03 01,"Objective: To explore the value of cytokines and procalcitonin (PCT) in predicting the potential pathogen and the severity of infection in children with hematological malignancies. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. A total of 1 543 children (3 912 episodes) with hematological malignancies admitted to the Department of Hematology/Oncology in Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from November 2010 to June 2018 were prospectively enrolled in this study. According to the pathogen, the patients were divided into sepsis group with positive blood culture (380 patients/608 episodes), sepsis group with negative blood culture (539/1 484), non-septic infection group (549/1 709), viral infection group (18/21) and fungal infection group (57/90). The patients were also divided into two groups in either shock group (171/187) or non-shock group (1 372/3 725). Meanwhile, 89 children (112 episodes) with matched hematological malignancies without fever were enrolled as the control group. The levels of PCT and cytokines were measured for detecting the potential relationship between these markers and infection severity. Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the differences between groups. The Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analysis was used to explore the predictive value. Results: (1) There were significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL) 6 (H=210.002, P<0.01), IL-10 (H=223.045, P<0.01), and PCT (H=76.799, P<0.01) in the infection group, with area under curre (AUC) of 0.67 (95%CI 0.64-0.69), 0.69 (95%CI 0.66-0.71) and 0.59 (95%CI 0.56-0.61), respectively. (2) Among the patients in the shock group, IL-6 (Z=11.460, P<0.01), IL-10 (Z=14.242, P<0.01) and PCT (Z=10.813, P<0.01) were significantly higher than those in the non-shock group, with the AUC of 0.75 (95%CI 0.70-0.79), 0.81 (95%CI 0.77-0.84) and 0.73 (95%CI 0.69-0.77), respectively. (3) In patients with septic shock, the incidence of Gram negative bacteria (GNB) infection (60 episodes) was significantly higher than Gram positive bacteria (GPB) infection (22 episodes) (χ(2)=29.665, P<0.01). The AUC of IL-6, IL-10 and PCT for predicting GNB infection were 0.75 (95%CI 0.72-0.78), 0.82 (95%CI 0.79-0.85) and 0.67 (95%CI 0.63-0.70), respectively. (4) The predictive power of IL-6, IL-10 and PCT combination (AUC=0.994) was superior to IL-10 alone (AUC=0.810) in predicting septic shock (Z=10.211, P<0.01). Conclusions: IL-6 and IL-10 are better predictors of GNB infection than PCT in hematology-oncology children. Furthermore, the combination of these two cytokines and PCT is more valuable in predicting the severity of infection.",[Impact of iron deficiency in early life stages on children's motor development: a longitudinal follow-up].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818896,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 03 01,"Objective: To clarify the impact of pre- and postnatal iron deficiency on children's motor development. Methods: This was a longitudinal follow-up study. A total of 114 infants (58 boys, 56 girls) born from April 2010 to December 2011 in Fuyang district of Hangzhou were enrolled. Based on cord blood and 9-month iron status, subjects were divided into prenatal iron deficiency (34 children), postnatal iron deficiency (37 children) and non-iron deficiency group (43 children). Peabody Developmental Motor Scale and BOT2-simplified version were used to evaluate the motor capacity in infants and preschoolers at 9 months, 18 months and 5 years, respectively. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to investigate the trajectory of motor development with age, the influence of different timing of early iron deficiency on children's motor development, and the differences (adjusted for possible confounding factors) in motor development in children with pre- or postnatal iron deficiency or non-iron deficiency in different family educational environment. Results: At the age of 9 months, 18 months and 5 years, 107, 109, and 114 children were evaluated respectively. After controlling for a variety of confounding factors, it was found that children with prenatal iron deficiency had significantly lower scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children (52.04 vs. 54.05 scores, β=-2.01, P=0.007), and that children with postnatal iron deficiency had similar scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children, showing no significant difference (53.07 vs. 54.05 scores, β=-0.98, P=0.180). Regardless of the maternal education status, prenatal iron deficiency children always had lower motor scores than non-iron deficiency children (49.86 vs. 52.15 and 49.58 vs. 51.58 scores, β=-2.29, -2.00; P=0.031, 0.049). Among the non-iron deficiency children, those whose mothers had a higher education level had higher motor scores compared with those whose mothers had a lower education level (52.45 vs. 50.46 scores, β=1.99, P=0.035). Conclusions: The motor development of children with prenatal iron deficiency did not catch up with their counterparts without iron deficiency by 5 years of age. The results indicate the importance of preventing iron deficiency in the fetus.",[Effect of books and toys on early childhood development in poor rural areas of China].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818895,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 03 01,"Objective: To explore the effect of books and toys on early childhood development in poor rural areas of China. Methods: The baseline survey data of the Integrated Early Childhood Development (IECD) conducted in 2013, which was supported by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) China Office, were analyzed retrospectively in this study. The survey was conducted in 6 counties in 2 provinces of China (Shanxi and Guizhou), and all 6 neighboring counties were located in extremely poor areas. The socio-demographic characteristics and caring behaviors of the caregivers (the lack of children's books and toys) were assessed by UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys-5 and caregivers' depression was assessed by the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. A total of 2 701 children were enrolled, of these, 1 151(42.62%) were girls, the age (18±10) months and 1 263 (46.76%) children were from Shanxi Province, the remaining 1 438 (53.24%) children were from Guizhou Province. The early childhood developmental status was evaluated by Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ). Log-binomial model was used to analyze the association between early childhood development and the lack of children's books and toys. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses (data stratification) were made to explore the effect of books and toys on early childhood development under different caregiving conditions with different caregivers who were depressive or non-depressive. Results: Among the 2 701 participants, 1 537 (56.90%) children lacked of books, 1 148 (42.50%) children lacked of toys, the suspected development delay (SDD) prevalences of overall ASQ, communication (CM), gross motor (GM), fine motor (FM), cognitivity (CG) and personal-social (PS) domains were 33.02% (892/2 701), 15.51% (419/2 701), 13.25% (358/2 701), 15.66% (423/2 701), 14.96% (404/2 701) and 11.81% (319/2 701). Under adjustment of the potential confounders, the Log-binomial regression showed that children who lacked books had significantly higher risk of SDD in overall ASQ (prevalence ratio (PR)=1.27, 95%CI: 1.11-1.45) and CM (PR=1.64, 95%CI: 1.31-2.07) than those who had sufficient books. Compared with children who had sufficient toys, those who lacked the toys also had the increased risk of SDD in overall ASQ (PR=1.34, 95%CI: 1.19-1.50), CM (PR=1.44, 95%CI: 1.18-1.76), GM (PR=1.54, 95%CI: 1.24-1.91), FM (PR=1.86, 95%CI: 1.52-2.27), CG (PR=1.80, 95%CI: 1.47-2.20) and PS (PR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.49-2.39). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the lack of books increased the risk of SDD in overall ASQ of the caregivers' non-depression group (PR=1.35, 95%CI: 1.08-1.71) and depression group (PR=1.17, 95%CI: 1.01-1.38), and the lack of toys increased the risk of SDD in overall ASQ of the caregivers' depression group (PR=1.54, 95%CI: 1.32-1.79). Conclusion: Lack of childrens' books and shortage of toys were independent risk factors for early childhood development in poor rural areas of China and both of them increased the risk of SDD significantly.","[Interpretation of pediatric gastroesophageal reflux clinical practice guidelines from North American Society/European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818894,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 05 06,

The effect of the purified tamarind seed trypsin inhibitor (TTIp) on metabolic alterations in Wistar rats with obesity and dyslipidemia was evaluated. Three groups of animals with obesity and dyslipidemia were formed, consuming a high glycemic index and glycemic load (HGLI) diet, for 10 days: Obese/HGLI diet; Obese/standard diet; Obese/HGLI diet + TTIp (730 μg/kg); and one eutrophic group of animals was fed a standard diet. Rats were evaluated daily for food intake and weight gain. On the 11th day, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed for blood and visceral adipose tissue collection. TTIp treated animals presented significantly lower food intake than the untreated group (p = 0.0065), TG (76.20 ± 18.73 mg/dL) and VLDL-C (15.24 ± 3.75 mg/dL). Plasma concentrations and TNF-α mRNA expression in visceral adipose tissue also decreased in obese animals treated with TTIp (p < 0.05 and p = 0.025, respectively) with a negative immunostaining. We conclude that TTIp presented anti-TNF-α activity and an improved lipid profile of Wistar rats with dyslipidemia and obesity induced by a high glycemic index and load diet regardless of PPAR-γ induction.",Exploring Secondary Metabolite Profiles of Stachybotrys spp. by LC-MS/MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818881,Toxins,2019 04 23,"The genus Stachybotrys produces a broad diversity of secondary metabolites, including macrocyclic trichothecenes, atranones, and phenylspirodrimanes. Although the class of the phenylspirodrimanes is the major one and consists of a multitude of metabolites bearing various structural modifications, few investigations have been carried out. Thus, the presented study deals with the quantitative determination of several secondary metabolites produced by distinct Stachybotrys species for comparison of their metabolite profiles. For that purpose, 15 of the primarily produced secondary metabolites were isolated from fungal cultures and structurally characterized in order to be used as analytical standards for the development of an LC-MS/MS multimethod. The developed method was applied to the analysis of micro-scale extracts from 5 different Stachybotrys strains, which were cultured on different media. In that process, spontaneous dialdehyde/lactone isomerization was observed for some of the isolated secondary metabolites, and novel stachybotrychromenes were quantitatively investigated for the first time. The metabolite profiles of Stachybotrys species are considerably influenced by time of growth and substrate availability, as well as the individual biosynthetic potential of the respective species. Regarding the reported adverse effects associated with Stachybotrys growth in building environments, combinatory effects of the investigated secondary metabolites should be addressed and the role of the phenylspirodrimanes re-evaluated in future research.","The Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) Microwave Interferometric Reflectometer: Hardware, Calibration, and Validation Experiments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818880,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"This manuscript describes the Microwave Interferometric Reflectometer (MIR) instrument, a multi-beam dual-band GNSS-Reflectometer with beam-steering capabilities built to assess the performance of a PAssive Reflectrometry and Interferometry System-In Orbit Demonstrator (PARIS-IoD) like instrument and to compare the performance of different GNSS-R techniques and signals. The instrument is capable of tracking up to 4 different GNSS satellites, two at L1/E1 band, and two at L5/E5 band. The calibration procedure of the up- and down-looking arrays is presented, the calibration performance is evaluated, and the results of the validation experiments carried out before the field experiments are shown in this paper.",2D Triangulation of Signals Source by Pole-Polar Geometric Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818879,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"The 2D point location problem has applications in several areas, such as geographic information systems, navigation systems, motion planning, mapping, military strategy, location and tracking moves. We aim to present a new approach that expands upon current techniques and methods to locate the 2D position of a signal source sent by an emitter device. This new approach is based only on the geometric relationship between an emitter device and a system composed of m≥2 signal receiving devices. Current approaches applied to locate an emitter can be deterministic, statistical or machine-learning methods. We propose to perform this triangulation by geometric models that exploit elements of pole-polar geometry. For this purpose, we are presenting five geometric models to solve the point location problem: (1) based on centroid of points of pole-polar geometry, PPC; (2) based on convex hull region among pole-points, CHC; (3) based on centroid of points obtained by polar-lines intersections, PLI; (4) based on centroid of points obtained by tangent lines intersections, TLI; (5) based on centroid of points obtained by tangent lines intersections with minimal angles, MAI.

The identification of miRSNPs that are associated with NHL susceptibility may provide biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis for patients who may not respond well to current treatment options, including the immunochemotherapy drug combination that includes rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisome (R-CHOP). We developed a panel of miRSNPs for genotyping while using multiplex PCR and chip-based mass spectrometry analysis in an Australian NHL case-control population (300 cases, 140 controls). Statistical association with NHL susceptibility was performed while using Chi-square (χ²) and logistic regression analysis. We identified three SNPs in MIR143 that are to be significantly associated with reduced risk of NHL: rs3733846 (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.54 [0.33 ⁻ 0.86], p = 0.010), rs41291957 (OR [95% CI] = 0.61 [0.39 ⁻ 0.94], p = 0.024), and rs17723799 (OR [95% CI] = 0.43 [0.26 ⁻ 0.71], p = 0.0009). One SNP, rs17723799, remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.015). Subsequently, we investigated an association between the rs17723799 genotype and phenotype by measuring target gene Hexokinase 2 (HKII) expression in cancer cell lines and controls. Our study is the first to report a correlation between miRSNPs in MIR143 and a reduced risk of NHL in Caucasians, and it is supported by significant SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a large European NHL genome wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis.","The Distribution of Trace Metals in Roadside Agricultural Soils, Thailand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818876,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"Vehicle emissions have been known to cause trace metal contamination in soils. The extent of such contaminations in soils, and of the effects of traffic density and distance from highways on the concentration of trace metals in roadside agricultural soils is largely unknown. This study examined the total concentrations of common trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) in roadside agricultural soils from Thailand with diverse traffic densities (approximately 30⁻200 million vehicles/kilometer/year), roadside distances (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 m from the road edge), and crops (rice, maize, and sugarcane). Cadmium, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations significantly decreased with increasing distance away from the roads (p < 0.05). However, the concentrations of these metals were not correlated with traffic density, probably due to extensive road maintenance and expansion. The contamination factor demonstrated that the road edge soils were moderately- to highly-polluted with Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The safest distance to minimize metal pollution for agricultural production is proposed to be greater than 10 m away from the road edge.","Gliosarcoma Is Driven by Alterations in PI3K/Akt, RAS/MAPK Pathways and Characterized by Collagen Gene Expression Signature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818875,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Gliosarcoma is a very rare brain tumor reported to be a variant of glioblastoma (GBM), IDH-wildtype. While differences in molecular and histological features between gliosarcoma and GBM were reported, detailed information on the genetic background of this tumor is lacking. We intend to fill in this knowledge gap by the complex analysis of somatic mutations, indels, copy number variations, translocations and gene expression patterns in gliosarcomas. Using next generation sequencing, we determined somatic mutations, copy number variations (CNVs) and translocations in 10 gliosarcomas. Six tumors have been further subjected to RNA sequencing analysis and gene expression patterns have been compared to those of GBMs. We demonstrate that gliosarcoma bears somatic alterations in gene coding for PI3K/Akt (PTEN, PI3K) and RAS/MAPK (NF1, BRAF) signaling pathways that are crucial for tumor growth. Interestingly, the frequency of PTEN alterations in gliosarcomas was much higher than in GBMs. Aberrations of PTEN were the most frequent and occurred in 70% of samples. We identified genes differentially expressed in gliosarcoma compared to GBM (including collagen signature) and confirmed a difference in the protein level by immunohistochemistry. We found several novel translocations (including translocations in the RABGEF1 gene) creating potentially unfavorable combinations. Collected results on genetic alterations and transcriptomic profiles offer new insights into gliosarcoma pathobiology, highlight differences in gliosarcoma and GBM genetic backgrounds and point out to distinct molecular cues for targeted treatment.",iNOS Gene Ablation Prevents Liver Fibrosis in Leptin-Deficient ob/ob Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818874,Genes,2019 04 28,"iNOS deficiency in ob/ob mice improved liver inflammation and ECM remodeling-related genes, decreasing fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction.

Moreover, the list of treatment alternatives, including combination therapies, is rapidly evolving. The molecular profiling and specific tumor-associated immune contexture may be predictive of response or resistance to these therapeutic strategies. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry is an effective and proficient approach to simultaneously identify specific proteins or molecular abnormalities, to determine the spatial distribution and activation state of immune cells, as well as the presence of immunoactive molecular expression. This method is highly advantageous for investigating immune evasion mechanisms and discovering potential biomarkers to assess mechanisms of action and to predict response to a given treatment.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in a sample of university students, as well as their quality of life, and to examine the most common methods used for alleviating symptoms. (2) Methods: The participants comprised 305 female university students with a mean age of 20.32 ± 3.19 years who completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic, gynecological and lifestyle questions. EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) was used to measure quality of life. (3) Results: In total, 76% of the sample suffered from dysmenorrhea. Among the students who did not suffer from dysmenorrhea, a significantly greater proportion participated in activities such as jogging or Pilates on a regular basis (several times per week). Concerning quality of life, patients with dysmenorrhea showed significant differences on the pain/discomfort scale and on the total score for perceived quality of life. However, this perception showed no correlation with the VAS (visual analogue scale) pain scale. Additionally, 90.5% of students with dysmenorrhea used pharmacological treatment, and 80% self-medicated. (4) Conclusions: Dysmenorrhea represents a major problem among youth today and the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of patients is evident. Physical activity may alleviate symptoms of dysmenorrhea and this and other complementary treatments should be promoted within health services.",Nicotine Induces Resistance to Erlotinib Therapy in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells Treated with Serum from Human Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818860,Cancers,2019 04 24,"Previously, we reported that nicotine reduces erlotinib sensitivity in a xenograft model of PC9, an epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-sensitive non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. The present study examined whether smoking induces erlotinib resistance in vitro. We assessed resistance to EGFR-TKIs by treating cancer cell lines with erlotinib, afatinib, or osimertinib, and serum collected from smokers within 30 min of smoking and that from a non-smoker as a control. We also assessed erlotinib resistance by treating PC9 cells exposed to serum from a smoker or a non-smoker, or serum from an erlotinib user. Treatment of the cancer cell lines with serum from smokers induced significant erlotinib resistance, compared with the control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, serum samples with a high concentration of cotinine (a nicotine exposure indicator) demonstrated stronger erlotinib resistance than those with low concentrations. Similar to the observations with erlotinib treatment of cell lines, the analysis of serum from erlotinib users revealed that smokers demonstrated significantly reduced sensitivity to erlotinib (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our present results support the hypothesis that smoking contributes to resistance to erlotinib therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.",Clustering of Multiple Energy Balance-Related Behaviors in School Children and its Association with Overweight and Obesity-WHO European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI 2015⁻2017).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818859,Nutrients,2019 05 23,"It is unclear how dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviors co-occur in school-aged children. We investigated the clustering of energy balance-related behaviors and whether the identified clusters were associated with weight status. Participants were 6- to 9-year-old children (n = 63,215, 49.9% girls) from 19 countries participating in the fourth round (2015/2017) of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative. Energy balance-related behaviors were parentally reported. Weight and height were objectively measured. We performed cluster analysis separately per group of countries (North Europe, East Europe, South Europe/Mediterranean countries and West-Central Asia). Seven clusters were identified in each group. Healthier clusters were common across groups. The pattern of distribution of healthy and unhealthy behaviors within each cluster was group specific. Associations between the clustering of energy balance-related behaviors and weight status varied per group. In South Europe/Mediterranean countries and East Europe, all or most of the cluster solutions were associated with higher risk of overweight/obesity when compared with the cluster 'Physically active and healthy diet'. Few or no associations were observed in North Europe and West-Central Asia, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that unfavorable weight status is associated with a particular combination of energy balance-related behavior patterns, but only in some groups of countries.",Antioxidant Activities of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.

In this work, the radical scavenging, reducing, chelating activities, and phenolic composition of ten lingonberry leaves cultivars, one subspecies, and one variety were investigated. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of individual phenolic compounds, that can be found in lingonberry leaves, were analyzed, and structure-activity relationship was determined. Wide diversity for phenolic profile and antioxidant properties of lingonberry leaves has been observed in the present material. Cultivars 'Kostromskaja rozovaja', 'Rubin', and Vaccinium vitis-idaea var. leucocarpum surpassed all others tested cultivars and lower taxa by contents of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Leaves of lingonberry cultivars and lower taxa are rich in arbutin, flavonol glycosides, proanthocyanidins, and the latter were considered to be the major contributor to antioxidant properties of lingonberry leaves.",Green Ultrasound Assisted Extraction of trans Rosmarinic Acid from Plectranthus scutellarioides (L.) R.Br. Leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818857,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Painted nettle (Plectranthus scutellarioides (L.) R.Br.) is an ornamental plant belonging to Lamiaceae family, native of Asia. Its leaves constitute one of the richest sources of trans-rosmarinic acid, a well-known antioxidant and antimicrobial phenolic compound. These biological activities attract interest from the cosmetic industry and the demand for the development of green sustainable extraction processes. Here, we report on the optimization and validation of an ultrasound-assisted extraction (USAE) method using ethanol as solvent. Following preliminary single factor experiments, the identified limiting extraction parameters (i.e., ultrasound frequency, extraction duration, and ethanol concentration) were further optimized using a full factorial design approach. The method was then validated following the recommendations of the association of analytical communities (AOAC) to ensure the precision and accuracy of the method used to quantify trans-rosmarinic acid. Highest trans-rosmarinic acid content was obtained using pure ethanol as extraction solvent following a 45-minute extraction in an ultrasound bath operating at an ultrasound frequency of 30 kHz. The antioxidant (in vitro radical scavenging activity) and antimicrobial (directed toward Staphylococcus aureus ACTT6538) activities were significantly correlated with the trans-rosmarinic acid concentration of the extract evidencing that these key biological activities were retained following the extraction using this validated method. Under these conditions, 110.8 mg/g DW of trans-rosmarinic acid were extracted from lyophilized P. scutellarioides leaves as starting material evidencing the great potential of this renewable material for cosmetic applications. Comparison to other classical extraction methods evidenced a clear benefit of the present USAE method both in terms of yield and extraction duration.","Understanding System-Level Intervention Points to Support School Food and Nutrition Policy Implementation in Nova Scotia, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818856,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"Supporting the implementation of school food and nutrition policies (SFNPs) is an international priority to encourage healthier eating among children and youth. Such policies can improve equitable access, resources, and supports for healthy eating. However, despite the potential impact of SFNPs, several implementation barriers have been reported. This study sought to examine the system-level intervention points within a school food system using a complex systems framework. We conducted semi-structured interviews with various stakeholders working to influence the school food system in Nova Scotia, Canada. We sought to understand their roles and experiences with the SFNP by applying the Intervention Level Framework (ILF), a novel, solutions-oriented approach to better understand how complex systems function. Participants (n = 33) included teachers, parents, cafeteria workers, public health staff and non-profit organizations. Interview transcripts were first coded, then themed and finally analyzed using the ILF, resulting in three intervention points within the school food system. These were defined as: (1) Actors and Elements, (2) System Regulation and Interconnections and (3) Purpose and Values. We concluded that understanding the interactions between these system levels and stakeholder roles can help to inform the development of relevant policy strategies that better support healthier school food environments in this jurisdiction.",Scoping Pharmacy Students' Learning Outcomes: Where Do We Stand?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818854,"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Background: The professional abilities of graduate pharmacists have been associated with pharmacy undergraduates' educational settings and features.

However, these campaigns show mixed results and while research often describes outcomes of approaches and interventions, it does not extensively describe implementation processes and best practices for nutrition education for Indigenous youth. To enhance knowledge and understanding of best processes in nutritional education approaches with Indigenous youth, we conducted a search using multiple databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, the Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet and Australian government research databases to identify relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as educational resources, such as websites and handbooks for teachers, parents, and students. We list and describe common features of successful nutritional interventions in Indigenous settings, steps for nutrition education targeting youth, school-based nutrition education for different ages, and general guidelines for teaching Indigenous students.

A Model of Old Drugs for New Horizons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818852,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 21,"Diabetic kidney disease is one of the most relevant complications in diabetes mellitus patients, which constitutes the main cause of end-stage renal disease in the western world. Delaying the progression of this pathology requires new strategies that, in addition to the control of traditional risk factors (glycemia and blood pressure), specifically target the primary pathogenic mechanisms. Nowadays, inflammation is recognized as a critical novel pathogenic factor in the development and progression of renal injury in diabetes mellitus. Pentoxifylline is a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor with rheologic properties clinically used for more than 30 years in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. In addition, this compound also exerts anti-inflammatory actions. In the context of diabetic kidney disease, pentoxifylline has shown significant antiproteinuric effects and a delay in the loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate, although at the present time there is no definitive evidence regarding renal outcomes. Moreover, recent studies have reported that this drug can be associated with a positive impact on new factors related to kidney health, such as Klotho. The use of pentoxifylline as renoprotective therapy for patients with diabetic kidney disease represents a new example of drug repositioning.",Cathepsin B Is Upregulated and Mediates ECM Degradation in Colon Adenocarcinoma HT29 Cells Overexpressing Snail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818851,Cells,2019 04 24,"During tumor development and ongoing metastasis the acquisition of mesenchymal cell traits by epithelial carcinoma cells is achieved through a programmed phenotypic shift called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, EMT. EMT contributes to increased cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through invadosomes, the adhesion structures that accompany the mesenchymal migration. The invadosomes and their associated proteases restrict protease activity to areas of the cell in direct contact with the ECM, thus precisely controlling cell invasion. Our data prove that Snail-overexpressing HT-29 cells that imitate the phenotype of colon cancer cells in the early stage of the EMT showed an increase in the expression and pericellular activity of cathepsin B. It appears that the pericellular localization of cathepsin B, also observed in colon and rectum adenocarcinoma tissue samples, plays a key role in its function."

Because of their structural similarity with HS, sulfated polysaccharides are considered a promising source of molecules to control these activities. In this study, we used a depolymerisation method for producing λ-carrageenan oligosaccharides (λ-CO), with progressive desulfation over time. These were then used to investigate the influence of polymeric chain length and degree of sulfation (DS) on their anti-HPSE activity. The effects of these two features on λ-CO anticoagulant properties were also investigated to eliminate a potential limitation on the use of a candidate λ-CO as a chemotherapeutic agent. HPSE inhibition was mainly related to the DS of λ-CO, however this correlation was not complete. On the other hand, both chain length and DS modulated λ-CO activity for factor Xa and thrombin IIa inhibition, two enzymes that are involved in the coagulation cascade, and different mechanisms of inhibition were observed. A λ-carrageenan oligosaccharide of 5.9 KDa was identified as a suitable anticancer candidate because it displayed one of the lowest anticoagulant properties among the λ-CO produced, while showing a remarkable inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration.",Nutrition Risk is Associated with Leukocyte Telomere Length in Middle-Aged Men and Women with at Least One Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818839,Nutrients,2019 05 23,"Poor diet quality has been associated with several age-related chronic conditions, but its relationship to telomere length, a biological marker of cellular aging, is unclear. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether overall diet quality was associated with relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) in a sample (n = 96) of nonsmoking middle-aged adults in Appalachia with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015), the alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMed), and the Dietary Screening Tool (DST). Peripheral rLTL was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The associations between potentially confounding sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors and the first and fourth rLTL quartile groups were examined using Chi-square or Fisher's Exact tests or logistic regression. The relationships between diet quality index scores and rLTL as a continuous variable were analyzed using simple linear regression and multivariate linear models, analogous to linear covariance analyses. The rLTL ranged from 0.46 to 1.49 (mean ± SEM was 1.02 ± 0.18). Smoking history, income level, and cardiovascular health (Life's Simple 7) were associated with the lowest and highest quartiles of rLTL and were used as covariates. In adjusted and unadjusted models, participants considered ""at nutrition risk"" by the DST were more likely to have shorter rLTL than those ""not at risk or at potential risk"" (p = 0.004). However, there was no evidence that adherence to the 2015⁻2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans or to a Mediterranean diet was associated with rLTL in this sample. Intervention studies are needed to determine if improving the diet quality of those at nutrition risk results in reduced telomere attrition over time.",Intimate Partner Violence in Relation to Husband Characteristics and Women Empowerment: Evidence from Nepal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818838,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"The purpose of this study is to assess the magnitude of intimate partner violence (IPV) and associated factors among women in Nepal.

The association between experience of IPV 'ever' and 'in the past year' with selected factors were examined by using Chi-square test, followed by multivariate logistic regression. Complex sample analysis procedure was adopted to adjust for multi-stage sampling design, cluster weight, and sample weight. The result revealed that 26.3% of ever-married women experienced any form of IPV at some point in their lives, while only 13.7% has experienced any form of IPV in the past year. The factors associated with both 'lifetime' and 'past year' experience of IPV includes women witnessing parental violence during their childhood, the husband being drunk frequently, women being afraid of their husband most of the times, and women whose husbands shows marital control behavior. Women's experiencing IPV was associated more with husband related factors than with women's empowerment indicators. Reducing IPV requires a commitment to changing the norms that promote the husband's behavior of controlling his wives and beating her.",Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Young Taiwanese Female Nursing Students with Irritable Bowel Syndrome-A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818837,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is prevalent within the general population. Studies have shown that stress and anxiety co-exist with IBS. Young Taiwanese women commonly exhibit physical and psychological health problems caused by academic stress. The purpose of our current study was to evaluate the efficacy of short-term Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) on female nursing students in practicum. We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial comprised of 160 participants who met the inclusion criteria, which were divided into three groups: (1) ICBT, (2) expressive writing (EW), and (3) wait-list control. Treatment interventions lasted for 6 weeks. Levels of anxiety, depression, and IBS symptoms were assessed at four time points, baseline assessment at T0, 2 weeks after T0 (T1), at the end of practicum (T2), and at 3-month follow-up (T3). The results showed that ICBT and EW groups exhibited a significant, yet small, reduction in anxiety and depression at T2 and T3 compared to the wait-list control group. The EW group exhibited significantly greater reduction in anxiety and depression compared to the ICBT group at T2. However, the ICBT group demonstrated greater improvements in alleviating anxiety and depression at T3 compared to the EW group. These data indicate that ICBT and EW groups exhibited small effects on anxiety and depression reduction at T2 and T3 compared to the wait-list control group, with no effects on IBS symptoms in young Taiwanese female nursing students.","Chemical Diversity of Codium bursa (Olivi) C. Agardh Headspace Compounds, Volatiles, Fatty Acids and Insight into Its Antifungal Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818836,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"The focus of present study is on Codium bursa collected from the Adriatic Sea. C. bursa volatiles were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-FID; GC-MS) after headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), hydrodistillation (HD), and supercritical CO₂ extraction (SC-CO₂). The headspace composition of dried (HS-D) and fresh (HS-F) C. bursa was remarkably different. Dimethyl sulfide, the major HS-F compound was present in HS-D only as a minor constituent and heptadecane percentage was raised in HS-D. The distillate of fresh C. bursa contained heptadecane and docosane among the major compounds. After air-drying, a significantly different composition of the volatile oil was obtained with (E)-phytol as the predominant compound. It was also found in SC-CO₂ extract of freeze-dried C. bursa (FD-CB) as the major constituent. Loliolide (3.51%) was only identified in SC-CO₂ extract. Fatty acids were determined from FD-CB after derivatisation as methyl esters by GC-FID. The most dominant acids were palmitic (25.4%), oleic (36.5%), linoleic (11.6%), and stearic (9.0%). FD-CB H₂O extract exhibited better antifungal effects against Fusarium spp., while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) extract was better for the inhibition of Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus flavus, and Rhizophus spp. The extracts showed relatively good antifungal activity, especially against P. expansum (for DMSO extract MIC50 was at 50 µg/mL).",Identification of Compounds That Inhibit Estrogen-Related Receptor Alpha Signaling Using High-Throughput Screening Assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818834,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"The nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα; NR3B1), plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis. Its expression fluctuates with the demands of energy production in various tissues. When paired with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), the PGC/ERR pathway regulates a host of genes that participate in metabolic signaling networks and in mitochondrial oxidative respiration. Unregulated overexpression of ERRα is found in many cancer cells, implicating a role in cancer progression and other metabolism-related diseases. Using high throughput screening assays, we screened the Tox21 10K compound library in stably transfected HEK293 cells containing either the ERRα-reporter or the reporter plus PGC-1α expression plasmid. We identified two groups of antagonists that were potent inhibitors of ERRα activity and/or the PGC/ERR pathway: nine antineoplastic agents and thirteen pesticides. Results were confirmed using gene expression studies. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of action on bioenergetics for five of the nine antineoplastic drugs. Nine of the thirteen pesticides, which have not been investigated previously for ERRα disrupting activity, were classified as such. In conclusion, we demonstrated that high-throughput screening assays can be used to reveal new biological properties of therapeutic and environmental chemicals, broadening our understanding of their modes of action.",Identifying Genome-Wide Sequence Variations and Candidate Genes Implicated in Self-Incompatibility by Resequencing Fragaria viridis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818833,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"It is clear that the incompatibility system in Fragaria is gametophytic, however, the genetic mechanism behind this remains elusive. Eleven second-generation lines of Fragaria viridis with different compatibility were obtained by manual self-pollination, which can be displayed directly by the level of fruit-set rate. We sequenced two second-generation selfing lines with large differences in fruit-set rate: Ls-S₂-53 as a self-incompatible sequencing sample, and Ls-S₂-76 as a strong self-compatible sequencing sample. Fragaria vesca was used as a completely self-compatible reference sample, and the genome-wide variations were identified and subsequently annotated. The distribution of polymorphisms is similar on each chromosome between the two sequencing samples, however, the distribution regions and the number of homozygous variations are inconsistent. Expression pattern analysis showed that six candidate genes were significantly associated with self-incompatibility. Using F. vesca as a reference, we focused our attention on the gene FIP2-like (FH protein interacting protein), associated with actin cytoskeleton formation, as the resulting proteins in Ls-S₂-53 and Ls-S₂-76 have each lost a number of different amino acids. Suppression of FIP2-like to some extent inhibits germination of pollen grains and growth of pollen tubes by reducing F-actin of the pollen tube tips. Our results suggest that the differential distribution of homozygous variations affects F. viridis fruit-set rate and that the fully encoded FIP2-like can function normally to promote F-actin formation, while the new FIP2-like proteins with shortened amino acid sequences have influenced the (in)compatibility of two selfing lines of F. viridis.",Controlled Coprecipitation of Amorphous Cerium-Based Carbonates with Suitable Morphology as Precursors of Ceramic Electrolytes for IT-SOFCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818832,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"To be suitable as electrolytes in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC), ceramic precursors have to be characterized by high sintering aptitude for producing fully densified products which are needed for this kind of application. Therefore, synthesis processes able to prepare highly reactive powders with low costs are noteworthy to be highlighted. It has been shown that amorphous coprecipitates based on cerium doped (and codoped) hydrated hydroxycarbonates can lead to synthesized ceramics with such desired characteristics. These materials can be prepared by adopting a simple coprecipitation technique using ammonium carbonate as precipitating agent. As a function of both the molar ratio between carbonate anions and total metallic cations, and the adopted mixing speed, the coprecipitate can be either amorphous, owning a very good morphology, or crystalline, owning worse morphology, packing aptitude, and sinterability. The amorphous powders, upon a mild calcination step, gave rise to the formation of stable solid solutions of fluorite-structured ceria maintaining the same morphology of the starting powders. Such calcined powders are excellent precursors for sintering ceramic electrolytes at low temperatures and with very high electrical conductivity in the intermediate temperature range (i.e., 500⁻700 °C). Therefore, irrespective of the actual composition of ceria-based systems, by providing an accurate control of both chemical conditions and physical parameters, the coprecipitation in the presence of ammonium carbonate can be considered as one of the most promising synthesis route in terms of cost/effectiveness to prepare excellent ceramic precursors for the next generation of IT-SOFC solid electrolytes.",Molecular Cloning and Bioinformatics Analysis of DQA Gene from Mink (Neovison vison).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818831,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"In the present study, we cloned, sequenced, and explored the structural and functional characteristics of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-DQA gene from mink (Neovison vison) for the first time. The full-length sequence of DQA gene was 1147-bp-long, contained a coding region of 768-bp, which was predicted to encoding 255 amino acid residues. The comparison between DQA from mink (Neovison vison) and other MHC-DQA molecules from different animal species showed that nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences of the mink DQA gene exhibited high similarity with the ferret (Mustela pulourius furo). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that mink (Neovison vison) DQA is grouped with that of ferret (Mustela pulourius furo). The cloned sequence contained a 23-amino acid NH₂-terminal signal sequence with the signal peptide cutting site located in amino acids 23⁻24, and had three Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons. Three cysteine residues were also identified (Cys-85, Cys-121, and Cys-138). The 218 to 240 amino acids were predicted to be the transmembrane domains. The prediction of the secondary structure revealed three α-helixes and fourteen β-sheets in Neovison vison DQA protein, while random coil was a major pattern. In this study, the whole CDS sequence of Neovison vison DQA gene was successfully cloned, which was valuable for exploring the function and antiviral molecular mechanisms underlying the molecule.

Fiber optic cables as components of biological sensors make them especially effective in biological systems that may require ultra-sensitive detection of low-frequency signals in hard to reach areas. This systematic review focuses on the differentiating factors of fiber-optic biosensors, which are tailored to apply the sensor to specific health needs. The main components of FOBS (fiber optic biosensors) such as biosensing elements, fiber optic cables, optical element enhancements, transducers, sensing strategies, photodetectors, and signal processing are covered in detail by showcasing the recent developments in modifications to these components. This paper pays particular attention to the alterations made in biosensing elements including pH elements, enzymatic elements, as well as those sensors utilizing antibodies and whole-cell bacteria. This paper reviews and discusses several published examples in the research stage of development or to give the reader an overall scope of the field. The need for research on biosensing equipment is increasing, as the number of individuals with chronic diseases and the geriatric population require more effective, accurate, and mobile sensing ability and redcued invasiveness. FOBS offer a sensing solution that is accurate, tailorable to almost any clinical need, has abundant and relatively cheap material requirements, and a well-established technological base in fiber optic technology. This small price tag and large market potential make FOBS a desirable research area."

Micro-computed tomography analysis revealed the recovery of bone mineral density and bone separation in OVX rats treated with vitamin C. Histomorphometrical analysis revealed improvements in the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes; the osteoblast and osteoclast surface per bone surface; and bone volume in vitamin C-treated OVX rats. The vitamin C-treated group additionally displayed an increase in the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes, including bone morphogenetic protein-2, small mothers against decapentaplegic 1/5/8, runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, and type I collagen. Vitamin C reduced the expression of osteoclast differentiation genes, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and cathepsin K. This study is the first to show that vitamin C can inhibit osteoporosis by promoting osteoblast formation and blocking osteoclastogenesis through the activation of wingless-type MMTV integration site family/β-catenin/activating transcription factor 4 signaling, which is achieved through the serine/threonine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.

This is particularly true in densely populated volcanic areas, like the Campi Flegrei caldera, which includes part of the large city of Naples (Italy). Borehole monitoring of volcanoes is the most promising way to improve classical methods of surface monitoring, although not commonly applied yet. Fiber optics technology is the most practical and suitable way to operate in such high temperature and aggressive environmental conditions. In this paper, we describe a fiber optics Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) sensor, which has been designed to continuously measure temperature all along a 500 m. deep well drilled in the west side of Naples (Bagnoli area), lying in the Campi Flegrei volcanic area. It has then been installed as part of the international 'Campi Flegrei Deep Drilling Project', and is continuously operating, giving insight on the time variation of temperature along the whole borehole depth. Such continuous monitoring of temperature can in turn indicate volcanic processes linked to magma dynamics and/or to changes in the hydrothermal system. The developed monitoring system, working at bottom temperatures higher than 100 °C, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using DTS for borehole volcanic monitoring.","Does Dietary-Induced Obesity in Old Age Impair the Contractile Performance of Isolated Mouse Soleus, Extensor Digitorum Longus and Diaphragm Skeletal Muscles?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818814,Nutrients,2019 05 23,"Ageing and obesity independently have been shown to significantly impair isolated muscle contractile properties, though their synergistic effects are poorly understood. We uniquely examined the effects of 9 weeks of a high-fat diet (HFD) on isometric force, work loop power output (PO) across a range of contractile velocities, and fatigability of 79-week-old soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and diaphragm compared with age-matched lean controls. The dietary intervention resulted in a significant increase in body mass and gonadal fat pad mass compared to the control group. Despite increased muscle mass for HFD soleus and EDL, absolute isometric force, isometric stress (force/CSA), PO normalised to muscle mass and fatigability was unchanged, although absolute PO was significantly greater. Obesity did not cause an alteration in the contractile velocity that elicited maximal PO. In the obese group, normalised diaphragm PO was significantly reduced, with a tendency for reduced isometric stress and fatigability was unchanged. HFD soleus isolated from larger animals produced lower maximal PO which may relate to impaired balance in older, larger adults. The increase in absolute PO is smaller than the magnitude of weight gain, meaning in vivo locomotor function is likely to be impaired in old obese adults, with an association between greater body mass and poorer normalised power output for the soleus. An obesity-induced reduction in diaphragm contractility will likely impair in vivo respiratory function and consequently contribute further to the negative cycle of obesity.",Cytoplasmic and Mitochondrial NADPH-Coupled Redox Systems in the Regulation of Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818813,Nutrients,2019 05 23,"The reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) protects against redox stress by providing reducing equivalents to antioxidants such as glutathione and thioredoxin. NADPH levels decline with aging in several tissues, but whether this is a major driving force for the aging process has not been well established. Global or neural overexpression of several cytoplasmic enzymes that synthesize NADPH have been shown to extend lifespan in model organisms such as Drosophila suggesting a positive relationship between cytoplasmic NADPH levels and longevity. Mitochondrial NADPH plays an important role in the protection against redox stress and cell death and mitochondrial NADPH-utilizing thioredoxin reductase 2 levels correlate with species longevity in cells from rodents and primates. Mitochondrial NADPH shuttles allow for some NADPH flux between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Since a decline of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is linked with aging and because NADP⁺ is exclusively synthesized from NAD⁺ by cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD⁺ kinases, a decline in the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial NADPH pool may also contribute to the aging process. Therefore pro-longevity therapies should aim to maintain the levels of both NAD⁺ and NADPH in aging tissues.",In Vitro Digested Nut Oils Attenuate the Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammatory Response in Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818812,Nutrients,2019 05 23,"Nut consumption is known for its health benefits, in particular in inflammatory diseases. A possible mechanism for these effects could be their beneficial fatty acid composition. Nuts mainly contain mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. However, studies investigating the effects of nut extracts on inflammatory processes on the molecular level are rare. We therefore prepared oily nut extracts after in vitro digestion and saponification of the fat-soluble constituents. Besides chromatographic analysis, cell culture experiments were performed using murine macrophages (RAW264.7) to study the capacity of different nut extracts (hazelnut, almond, walnut, macadamia, and pistachio) to modulate inflammatory processes. Oleic acid was the main fatty acid in hazelnut, almond, macadamia, and pistachio extracts. Both oily nut extracts and pure oleic acid significantly reduced the LPS-induced expression of iNos, Cox2, Tnfα, Il1β, and Il6 mRNAs. iNos protein expression was down-regulated followed by reduced nitric oxide formation. Thus, nut extracts at concentrations achievable in the digestive tract inhibit the expression and formation of inflammatory mediators in macrophages. Hence, a beneficial contribution of nut consumption to inflammatory diseases can be assumed. We are convinced that these results provide new insights on the molecular mechanisms involved in the health-beneficial effects of nuts.","Production of Valuable Compounds and Bioactive Metabolites from By-Products of Fish Discards Using Chemical Processing, Enzymatic Hydrolysis, and Bacterial Fermentation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818811,Marine drugs,2019 04 28,"The objective of this report was to investigate the isolation and recovery of different biocompounds and bioproducts from wastes (skins and heads) that were obtained from five species discarded by fishing fleets (megrim, hake, boarfish, grenadier, and Atlantic horse mackerel).

Since its first detection, PCV3 has already been found in America, Asia, and Europe. Although PCV3 has already been described in Brazil, knowledge of its detection and sequence variation before 2016 is limited, as well as its distribution in the main swine producing regions of Brazil. In this study, 67 porcine clinical samples collected from nine states in Brazil between 2006 and 2007 were analyzed for PCV3 infection by PCR. Results showed that 47.8% of the samples were PCV3 positive, across all nine states. Of the PCV3-positive samples, 37.5% were also positive for PCV2. Interestingly, no clinical signs were associated with samples that were detected singularly with PCV3 infection. Moreover, the positive PCV3 rate in healthy pigs was higher (29.8%) than that found in unhealthy pigs (17.9%), suggesting that most pigs could live with PCV3 infection without any clinical sign in the analyzed samples. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that PCV3 strains obtained in this study shared 94.44% to 99.83% sequence identity at the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) gene level with available strains from different countries. PCV3 Brazilian sequences collected in 2006 and 2007 shared 97.94% to 99.62% identity with the strains obtained in 2016. The results of neutrality and selective pressure tests indicated that the PCV3 Cap protein seems unable to tolerate high levels of variation on its sequence. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the Brazilian strains in PCV3a and PCV3b genotypes clusters, both including strains collected in America, Asia, and Europe. Taking the results together, multiple events of introduction of PCV3 may have occurred in Brazil, and Brazilian PCV3 strains may show genetic stability over the past 10 years."

In total, 1165 evaluations were performed for 60 photos of portion sizes in Brazil. Each participant (n = 58) attended two sessions in the study center, with an interval of at least one week. In each session, twelve food portions were prepared and randomly evaluated by each participant in its printed and digital forms.

Furthermore, the use of the tablet was more prone to underestimation when compared to printed and computer-screen photos (p < 0.001). Overall, participants did not present major difficulties in perceiving the portion sizes using the printed and digital photos, but the use of tablets led to less accurate results, indicating that this needs to be further evaluated.",Poisson's Ratio of the f.c.c. Hard Sphere Crystals with Periodically Stacked (001)-Nanolayers of Hard Spheres of Another Diameter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818797,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"The results of studies on the influence of periodically stacked nanolayer inclusions, introduced into the face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) hard sphere crystal, on Poisson's ratio of the obtained nanocomposite system are presented. The monolayers are orthogonal to the [ 001 ] -direction. They are formed by hard spheres with diameter different from the spheres forming the matrix of the system. The Monte Carlo computer simulations show that in such a case the symmetry of the system changes from the cubic to tetragonal one. When the diameter of the inclusion spheres increases at certain range, a decrease of the negative Poisson's ratio in the [ 101 ] [ 1 ¯ 01 ] -directions is observed, i.e., the system enhances its partial auxeticity. The dependence of the maximal, average, and negative parts of the minimal Poisson's ratio on the direction of the applied load are shown in a form of surfaces in spherical coordinates, plotted for selected values of nanolayer particle diameters. The most negative value of the Poisson's ratio found among all studied systems was - 0.11 (at pressure p * = 100 , which is about ten times higher than the melting pressure) what is almost twice more negative than in the f.c.c. crystal of identical hard spheres. The observed effect weakens along with the decrease of pressure and becomes hardly noticeable near melting. This study indicates that modifying only the size of the inclusion particles one can change Poisson's ratio of nanocomposites at high pressures.",Will Attention by Vaccine Developers to the Host's Nuclear Hormone Levels and Immunocompetence Improve Vaccine Success?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818795,Vaccines,2019 04 20,"Despite extraordinary advances in fields of immunology and infectious diseases, vaccine development remains a challenge. The development of a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, for example, has spanned more than 50 years of research with studies of more than 100 vaccine candidates. Dozens of attractive vaccine products have entered clinical trials, but none have completed the path to licensing. Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine development has proven equally difficult, as there is no licensed product after more than 30 years of pre-clinical and clinical research. Here, we examine vaccine development with attention to the host. We discuss how nuclear hormones, including vitamins and sex hormones, can influence responses to vaccines. We show how nuclear hormones interact with regulatory elements of immunoglobulin gene loci and how the deletion of estrogen response elements from gene enhancers will alter patterns of antibody isotype expression. Based on these findings, and findings that nuclear hormone levels are often insufficient or deficient among individuals in both developed and developing countries, we suggest that failed vaccine studies may in some cases reflect weaknesses of the host rather than the product. We encourage analyses of nuclear hormone levels and immunocompetence among study participants in clinical trials to ensure the success of future vaccine programs.",Thermal Behavior of Sweet Potato Starch by Non-Isothermal Thermogravimetric Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818794,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"In this study, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods were used to study the structure, the thermal degradation kinetics, and the thermogram of sweet potato starch, respectively. The thermal decomposition kinetics of sweet potato starch was examined within different heating rates in a nitrogen atmosphere. Different models of kinetic analysis were used to calculate the activation energies using the thermogravimetric data of the thermal degradation process. The activation energies got from Kissinger, Flynn⁻Wall⁻Ozawa, and Šatava⁻Šesták models were 173.85, 174.87, and 174.34 kJ·mol-1, respectively. Thermogravimetry⁻Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) analysis showed that the main pyrolysis products included water, carbon dioxide, and methane.",Sowing the Seeds of a Pandemic? Mammalian Pathogenicity and Transmissibility of H1 Variant Influenza Viruses from the Swine Reservoir.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818793,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 30,"Emergence of genetically and antigenically diverse strains of influenza to which the human population has no or limited immunity necessitates continuous risk assessments to determine the likelihood of these viruses acquiring adaptations that facilitate sustained human-to-human transmission. As the North American swine H1 virus population has diversified over the last century by means of both antigenic drift and shift, in vivo assessments to study multifactorial traits like mammalian pathogenicity and transmissibility of these emerging influenza viruses are critical. In this review, we examine genetic, molecular, and pathogenicity and transmissibility data from a panel of contemporary North American H1 subtype swine-origin viruses isolated from humans, as compared to H1N1 seasonal and pandemic viruses, including the reconstructed 1918 virus. We present side-by-side analyses of experiments performed in the mouse and ferret models using consistent experimental protocols to facilitate enhanced interpretation of in vivo data. Contextualizing these analyses in a broader context permits a greater appreciation of the role that in vivo risk assessment experiments play in pandemic preparedness. Collectively, we find that despite strain-specific heterogeneity among swine-origin H1 viruses, contemporary swine viruses isolated from humans possess many attributes shared by prior pandemic strains, warranting heightened surveillance and evaluation of these zoonotic viruses.","Rhodoptilometrin, a Crinoid-Derived Anthraquinone, Induces Cell Regeneration by Promoting Wound Healing and Oxidative Phosphorylation in Human Gingival Fibroblast Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818790,Marine drugs,2019 04 28,"Gingival recession (GR) potentially leads to the exposure of tooth root to the oral cavity microenvironment and increases susceptibility to dental caries, dentin hypersensitivity, and other dental diseases. Even though many etiological factors were reported, the specific mechanism of GR is yet to be elucidated. Given the species richness concerning marine biodiversity, it could be a treasure trove for drug discovery. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of a marine compound, (+)-rhodoptilometrin from crinoid, on gingival cell migration, wound healing, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Experimental results showed that (+)-rhodoptilometrin can significantly increase wound healing, migration, and proliferation of human gingival fibroblast cells, and it does not have effects on oral mucosa fibroblast cells. In addition, (+)-rhodoptilometrin increases the gene and protein expression levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), fibronectin, and type I collagen, changes the intracellular distribution of FAK and F-actin, and increases OXPHOS and the expression levels of complexes I~V in the mitochondria. Based on our results, we believe that (+)-rhodoptilometrin might increase FAK expression and promote mitochondrial function to affect cell migration and promote gingival regeneration. Therefore, (+)-rhodoptilometrin may be a promising therapeutic agent for GR.",Synthesis and Characterization of TiO₂-ZnO-MgO Mixed Oxide and Their Antibacterial Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818789,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"TiO₂-ZnO-MgO mixed oxide nanomaterials (MONs) were synthetized via the sol-gel method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen physisorption analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and color (Luminosity (L), a, b, Chrome, hue) parameters. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of the MONs was tested against Escherichia coli (EC), Salmonella paratyphi (SP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Listeria monocytogenes (LM). The MONs presented a semi globular-ovoid shape of ≤100 nm. Samples were classified as mesoporous materials and preserved in the TiO₂ anatase phase, with slight changes in the color parameters of the MONs in comparison with pure TiO₂. The MONs exhibited antimicrobial activity, and their effect on the tested bacteria was in the following order: EC > SP > SA > LM. Therefore, MONs could be used as antimicrobial agents for industrial applications.",Fabriction of ZnO Nanorods with Strong UV Absorption and Different Hydrophobicity on Foamed Nickel under Different Hydrothermal Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818788,Micromachines,2019 04 28,"ZnO nanorods have been grown on the surface of foamed nickel by a two-step method. Firstly, a layer of ZnO seed is sputtered on the surface of the foamed nickel by magnetron sputtering, and then the hydrothermal method is used to grow ZnO nanorods at different conditions (solution concentration, reaction time and reaction temperature). The results show that the morphology of ZnO nanorods is closely related to the solution concentration, reaction time, and reaction temperature. The energy band structure formed by the foamed nickel and ZnO seed layers and the growth mechanism of ZnO nanorods are discussed. The samples are characterized by Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The absorption characteristics of samples to light are characterized by ultraviolet-to-visible (UV⁻VIS) absorption. The hydrophilicity of the samples is characterized by the static contact angle. By analyzing the performance characteristics of the samples at different conditions, we finally obtained the optimal growth parameters. At the optimal parameters, the morphology of the grown nanorods is regular, the ultraviolet band has strong absorption, and the surface of the samples forms a superhydrophobic surface.",Comprehensive Comparative Analysis of Cholesterol Catabolic Genes/Proteins in Mycobacterial Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818787,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"In dealing with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the deadliest human disease-tuberculosis (TB)-utilization of cholesterol as a carbon source indicates the possibility of using cholesterol catabolic genes/proteins as novel drug targets. However, studies on cholesterol catabolism in mycobacterial species are scarce, and the number of mycobacterial species utilizing cholesterol as a carbon source is unknown. The availability of a large number of mycobacterial species' genomic data affords an opportunity to explore and predict mycobacterial species' ability to utilize cholesterol employing in silico methods. In this study, comprehensive comparative analysis of cholesterol catabolic genes/proteins in 93 mycobacterial species was achieved by deducing a comprehensive cholesterol catabolic pathway, developing a software tool for extracting homologous protein data and using protein structure and functional data. Based on the presence of cholesterol catabolic homologous proteins proven or predicted to be either essential or specifically required for the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv on cholesterol, we predict that among 93 mycobacterial species, 51 species will be able to utilize cholesterol as a carbon source. This study's predictions need further experimental validation and the results should be taken as a source of information on cholesterol catabolism and genes/proteins involved in this process among mycobacterial species.",A Review of Curcumin and Its Derivatives as Anticancer Agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818786,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world and one of the major public health problems.

Curcumin, the active ingredient of the Curcuma longa plant, has received great attention over the past two decades as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent. In this review, a summary of the medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of curcumin and its derivatives in regard to anticancer activity, their main mechanisms of action, and cellular targets has been provided based on the literature data from the experimental and clinical evaluation of curcumin in cancer cell lines, animal models, and human subjects. In addition, the recent advances in the drug delivery systems for curcumin delivery to cancer cells have been highlighted."

The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are still not fully understood. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) appears to be one of the most probable candidates involved in the pathophysiology of GDM. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether umbilical cord serum FABP4 concentrations are altered in term neonates born to GDM mothers. Two groups of subjects were selected-28 healthy controls and 26 patients with GDM. FABP4, leptin, and ghrelin concentrations in the umbilical cord serum, maternal serum, and maternal urine were determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The umbilical cord serum FABP4 levels were higher in the GDM offspring and were directly associated with the maternal serum FABP4 and leptin levels, as well as the prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the BMI at and after delivery; however, they correlated negatively with birth weight and lipid parameters. In the multiple linear regression models, the umbilical cord serum FABP4 concentrations depended positively on the maternal serum FABP4 and negatively on the umbilical cord serum ghrelin levels and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There are many maternal variables that can affect the level of FABP4 in the umbilical cord serum, thus, their evaluation requires further investigation.",Fish Protein and Lipid Interactions on the Digestibility and Bioavailability of Starch and Protein from Durum Wheat Pasta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818770,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"This research focussed on the utilisation of salmon protein and lipid to manipulate pasta's glycaemic index and protein digestibility. Salmon fish (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) powder (SFP) supplemented pasta flour in amounts from 5% to 20% (w/w). Inclusion of SFP lead to a significant reduction in starch digestibility and hence the potential glycaemic values of pasta (experimental pasta being up to 143% lower than control values). SFP addition to pasta increased the release of phenolic compounds from pasta during both gastric digestion (179%) and pancreatic digestion (133%) in comparison to the control sample. At the same time, the antioxidant activity of the digested pasta was increased by up to 263% (gastric) and 190% (pancreatic) in comparison to durum wheat pasta alone. Interestingly, although protein levels increased with incorporation of SFP, the digestibility values of the protein decreased from 86.41% for the control pasta to 81.95% for 20% SFP pasta. This may indicate that there are interactions between phenols and protein in the pasta samples which affect overall protein digestibility levels.",Development of the VIGS System in the Dioecious Plant Silene latifolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818769,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"(1) Background: Silene latifolia is a dioecious plant, whose sex is determined by XY-type sex chromosomes. Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae is a smut fungus that infects S. latifolia plants and causes masculinization in female flowers, as if Microbotryum were acting as a sex-determining gene. Recent large-scale sequencing efforts have promised to provide candidate genes that are involved in the sex determination machinery in plants. These candidate genes are to be analyzed for functional characterization. A virus vector can be a tool for functional gene analyses; (2) Methods: To develop a viral vector system in S. latifolia plants, we selected Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) as an appropriate virus vector that has a wide host range; (3) Results: Following the optimization of the ALSV inoculation method, S. latifolia plants were infected with ALSV at high rates in the upper leaves. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that ALSV can migrate into the flower meristems in S. latifolia plants. Successful VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) in S. latifolia plants was demonstrated with knockdown of the phytoene desaturase gene. Finally, the developed method was applied to floral organ genes to evaluate its usability in flowers; (4) Conclusion: The developed system enables functional gene analyses in S. latifolia plants, which can unveil gene functions and networks of S. latifolia plants, such as the mechanisms of sex determination and fungal-induced masculinization.",The Reactive Plasticity of Hippocampal Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors in Animal Epilepsies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818767,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the synaptic and metabolic actions of glutamate. These iGluRs are classified within the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type, kainate-type, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type functional receptor families. The iGluR assemblies are regulated by transcription, alternative splicing, and cytoplasmic post-translational modifications. The iGluR subunit proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum, inserted into the synaptic membranes, and anchored at their action site by different scaffolding and interacting proteins. The functional properties of iGluRs depend on their subunit composition, the amino acid sequence of the protein domains, and the scaffolding proteins in the synaptic membranes. The iGluRs are removed from the membranes by enzymatic action and endocytosis. Hippocampal iGluRs are rearranged through the upregulation and downregulation of the subunits following deafferentation and epileptic seizures. The rearrangement of iGluRs and the alteration of their subunit composition transform neurons into ""pathological"" cells, determining the further plasticity or pathology of the hippocampal formation. In the present review, we summarize the expression of AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptor subunits following deafferentation, repeated mild seizures, and status epilepticus. We compare our results to literature descriptions, and draw conclusions as to the reactive plasticity of iGluRs in the hippocampus.",Programmable Spectral Filter in C-Band Based on Digital Micromirror Device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818766,Micromachines,2019 04 28,"Optical filters have been adopted in many applications such as reconfigurable telecommunication switches, tunable lasers and spectral imaging. However, most of commercialized filters based on a micro-electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) only provide a minimum bandwidth of 25 GHz in telecom so far. In this work, the programmable filter based on a digital micromirror device (DMD) experimentally demonstrated a minimum bandwidth of 12.5 GHz in C-band that matched the grid width of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) G.694.1 standard. It was capable of filtering multiple wavebands simultaneously and flexibly by remotely uploading binary holograms onto the DMD. The number of channels and the center wavelength could be adjusted independently, as well as the channel bandwidth and the output power. The center wavelength tuning resolution of this filter achieved 0.033 nm and the insertion loss was about 10 dB across the entire C-band. Since the DMD had a high power handling capability (25 KW/cm²) of around 200 times that of the liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) chip, the DMD-based filters are expected to be applied in high power situations.","Isomers of β,β-Dinitro-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphy-rin Derivatives: Valuable Starting Materials for Further Transformations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818765,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"The synthesis, chromatographic isolation, and structure elucidation of β,β-substituted isomers of dinitro-5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin complexes are described. meso-Tetraphenyl-porphyrin chelates (CuII, NiII, CoII) upon reaction wit e.g., itric acid (yellow HNO₃, d = 1.52, diluted to 25⁻50%) in CHCl₃ formed a mixture of nitro-derivatives with combined yields of ca 80%.

To get a better understanding of the evolution of wines' flavor profile, the flavor compounds (phenolic and volatile compounds), dissolved oxygen (DO), and flavor characters (OAVs and chromatic parameters) of rosé and dry white wines bottled with different closures were determined after 18 months' bottle aging. The results showed the main phenolic change trends of rosé wines were decreasing while the trends of white wines were increasing, which could be the reason for their unique DO changing behaviors. Volatile compounds could be clustered into fluctuating, increasing, and decreasing groups using k-means algorithm. Most volatile compounds, especially some long-chain aliphatic acid esters (octanoates and decanoates), exhibited a lower decrease rate in rosé wines sealed with natural corks and white wines with screw caps. After 18 months of bottle aging, wines treated with natural corks and their alternatives could be distinguished into two groups based on flavor compounds via PLS-DA. As for flavor characters, the total intensity of aroma declined obviously compared with their initial counterparts. Rosé wines exhibit visual difference in color, whereas such a phenomenon was not observed in white wines.","Roles of SETD2 in Leukemia-Transcription, DNA-Damage, and Beyond.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818762,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"The non-redundant histone methyltransferase SETD2 (SET domain containing 2; KMT3A) is responsible for tri-methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3). Presence of the H3K36me3 histone mark across the genome has been correlated with transcriptional activation and elongation, but also with the regulation of DNA mismatch repair, homologous recombination and alternative splicing. The role of SETD2 and the H3K36me3 histone mark in cancer is controversial. SETD2 is lost or mutated in various cancers, supporting a tumor suppressive role of the protein. Alterations in the SETD2 gene are also present in leukemia patients, where they are associated with aggressive disease and relapse. In line, heterozygous SETD2 loss caused chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cell lines and mouse models. In contrast, other studies indicate that SETD2 is critically required for the proliferation of leukemia cells. Thus, although studies of SETD2-dependent processes in cancer have contributed to a better understanding of the SETD2⁻H3K36me3 axis, many open questions remain regarding its specific role in leukemia. Here, we review the current literature about critical functions of SETD2 in the context of hematopoietic malignancies."

The cultivation and maturation of the biological filter layer are key for biological iron and manganese removal processes. The time needed for maturation varies significantly with the water quality, filter and filter media conditions and operation parameters; sometimes it takes only one or two months, sometime more than half a year. In this paper, the feasibility of adopting an intermittent operation for the cultivation of biofilter was investigated with productive filters in a groundwater treatment plant, and the comparative test of the filter column was conducted. The results showed that the intermittent operation had little effect on the cultivation of the biofilter because dissolved oxygen would be gradually exhausted during the filter-suspension process, making the filter layer anaerobic, thus possibly inhibiting the growth and reproduction of IMOB (Iron and Manganese Oxidizing Bacteria). At the same time, the test shows that when the mature biological filter needs the suspension operation, the emptying method should be considered to avoid the destruction of the biological layer.",Determinants of Overall Satisfaction with Public Clinics in Rural China: Interpersonal Care Quality and Treatment Outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818750,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"The primary health care quality factors determining patient satisfaction will shape patient-centered health reform in China. While rural public clinics performed better than hospitals and private clinics in terms of patient perceived quality of primary care in China, there is little information about which quality care aspects drove patients' satisfaction. Using a World Health Organization database on 1014 rural public clinic users from eight provinces in China, our multiple linear regression model estimated the association between patient perceived quality aspects, one treatment outcome, and overall primary health care satisfaction. Our results show that treatment outcome was the strongest predictor of overall satisfaction (β = 0.338 (95% CI: 0.284 to 0.392); p < 0.001), followed by two interpersonal care quality aspects, Dignity (being treated respectfully) (β = 0.219 (95% CI: 0.117 to 0.320); p < 0.001) and Communication (clear explanation by the physician) (β = 0.103 (95% CI: 0.003 to 0.203); p = 0.043). Prompt attention (waiting time before seeing the doctor) and Confidentiality (talking privately to the provider) were not correlated with overall satisfaction. The treatment outcome focus, and weak interpersonal primary care aspects, in overall patient satisfaction, pose barriers towards a patient-centered transformation of China's primary care rural clinics, but support the focus of improving the clinical competency of rural primary care workers.","Immune Activation, Inflammation, and Non-AIDS Co-Morbidities in HIV-Infected Patients under Long-Term ART.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818749,Viruses,2019 04 19,"Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) still present persistent chronic immune activation and inflammation. This condition is the result of several factors including thymic dysfunction, persistent antigen stimulation due to low residual viremia, microbial translocation and dysbiosis, caused by the disruption of the gut mucosa, co-infections, and cumulative ART toxicity. All of these factors can create a vicious cycle that does not allow the full control of immune activation and inflammation, leading to an increased risk of developing non-AIDS co-morbidities such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to provide an overview of the most recent data about HIV-associated inflammation and chronic immune exhaustion in PLWH under effective ART.

EMs exhibited lower intramuscular fat content, higher collagen content with higher solubility, a higher level of protein carbonyl groups (indicating higher protein oxidation), lower water holding capacity, and tougher meat than SCs. Proteomic analysis revealed differences in heat shock proteins expression, while a greater abundance of several other identified proteins (malate dehydrogenase, Na/K-transporting adenosintriphosphatase (ATP-ase) subunit alpha-1, and blood plasma proteins) indicates that EMs have a more oxidative metabolic profile than that of SCs. More abundant protein fragments (mainly actin and myosin heavy chain) suggest a higher degree of proteolysis in EMs, which was not followed by lower meat toughness.",Microstructure and Corrosion Behavior of (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ High-Entropy Alloy Coating Fabricated by Plasma Spraying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818746,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 16,"In this paper, the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ high-entropy alloy (HEA) coating with a thickness of 500 μm on Q235 steel substrate was fabricated by plasma spraying.

The phase composition change and elemental segregation behavior were mainly due to the faster cooling rate of the plasma spraying technique. At the junction of the coating and the substrate, the HEA coating bonded well to the substrate; in addition, the width of transition zone was merely 2 μm. The microhardness of the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ HEA coating was 321 HV0.5, which is significantly higher than that of the substrate. In terms of corrosion resistance, the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ HEA coating has good corrosion resistance in NaCl solution. Although the corrosion form was pitting corrosion, the pitting potential of the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ HEA coating was significantly higher than that of other coatings, which was mainly because of the dense passivation film formed by Cr and Nb on the surface of the coating. Once the passivation film was destroyed by Cl-, the selective corrosion occurred on the surface of the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ HEA coating. In summary, the (CoCrFeNi)95Nb₅ HEA coating prepared by plasma spraying technology can significantly improve the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the Q235 steel substrate.",Facile Fabrication of 3D Graphene⁻Silica Hydrogel Composite for Enhanced Removal of Mercury Ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818745,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 05,"Adsorption is a highly promising and widely used approach to remove Hg(II) ions from contaminated water. The key to this technology is exploring the effective adsorbent. The three-dimensional (3D) graphene as reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGH)-encapsulated silica gel (SG-PEI/rGH) was prepared by a moderate chemical reduction strategy using ascorbic acid. This composite structure was characterized by FTIR, XRD, and SEM analysis and used as adsorbents for Hg(II) ions. Its adsorption capacity toward Hg(II) ions was 266 mg/g and increased about 32% compared with the silica gel because of reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGH). Mechanism study showed that the high adsorption ability was due to the formation of an N⁻Hg complex with multi-amino groups on the surface of polyethyleneimine-modified silica gel (SG-PEI) and the rapid diffusion of adsorbed ions attributed to the rGH network structure. This composite SG-PEI/rGH would be a promising material for the removal of Hg(II) ions.",Traditional Diet and Environmental Contaminants in Coastal Chukotka II: Legacy POPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818744,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 02,"The article is the second in the series of four that present the results of a study on environmental contaminants in coastal Chukotka, conducted in the context of a multi-disciplinary investigation of indigenous foodways in the region. The article presents the results of the analysis of legacy Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) found in the samples of locally harvested food and indoor matters, collected in 2016 in coastal Chukotka. Temporal trends and circumpolar comparisons of POPs in food have been carried out. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of POPs by local food consumption were calculated based on the food intake frequencies (questionnaire data). Concentrations of the studied legacy POPs in marine mammal blubber were relatively high (up to 100⁻200 µg/kg ww) but not exceeding the allowable limits. Gray whale blubber and whale mantak were the most contaminated foods, followed by the ringed, spotted and bearded seal blubber, then by walrus blubber and fermented walrus (deboned walrus parts aged in subterranean pits, typically over a period of 6 months). At the backdrop of general decrease or invariability (compared to the previous coastal Chukotka study 15 years ago) of the majority of POPs, an increasing tendency of HCB, mainly in marine mammals, were noted. Legacy POPs in marine mammals sampled in Chukotka were generally much lower than in those sampled in Alaska and northern Canada. We suggest that the Alaska Coastal Current from the Bering Sea plays a major role in this phenomenon. Analyses of the additional sources of in-home food contamination (home-brewed alcohol, domestic insecticides) have revealed relatively high levels of HCHs, DDTs and PCBs, which still represent a share of dietary exposure of local people to POPs.",Aquaporins Respond to Chilling in the Phloem by Altering Protein and mRNA Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818743,Cells,2019 04 24,"Previous experiments using heat exchangers (liquid cooled blocks) to chill a portion of plant stem have shown a transient stoppage in phloem translocation and an increase in measured phloem pressure. Although a chilled-induced stoppage of phloem transport has been known for over 100 years, the mechanism of this phenomenon is still poorly understood. Recently, work has highlighted that aquaporins occur within the plasma membrane of the sieve tubes along the entire source-to-sink pathway, and that isoforms of these water channel proteins may change dynamically. Aquaporins show regulatory roles in controlling tissue and cellular water status in response to environmental hardships. Thus, we tested if protein localization and mRNA transcript abundance changes occur in response to chilling in balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) using immunohistochemistry and qrtPCR. The results of the immunolocalization experiments show that the labeling intensity of the sieve elements treated for only 2 min of chill time significantly increased for PIP2. After 10 min of chilling, this signal declined significantly to lower than that of the pre-chilled sieve elements. Overall, the abundance of mRNA transcript increased for the tested PIP2s following cold application. We discuss the implication that aquaporins are responsible for the alleviation of sieve tube pressure and the resumption of flow following a cold-induced blockage event.",Age and Sex-Dependent Differences in the Neurochemical Characterization of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide-Like Immunoreactive (CGRP-LI) Nervous Structures in the Porcine Descending Colon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818742,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) may undergo changes during maturation and aging, but knowledge of physiological stimuli-dependent changes in the ENS is still fragmentary. On the other hand, the frequency of many ENS-related intestinal illnesses depends on age and/or sex. The double immunofluorescence technique was used to study the influence of both of these factors on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive enteric nervous structures-in the descending colon in young and adult female and castrated male pigs. The influence of age and gender on the number and neurochemical characterization (i.e., co-localization of CGRP with substance P, nitric oxide synthase, galanin, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide and vesicular acetylcholine transporter) of CGRP-positive nerve structures in the colonic wall has been shown. These observations strongly suggest the participation of CGRP in adaptive processes in the ENS during GI tract maturation. Moreover, although the castration of males may mask some aspects of sex-dependent influences on the ENS, the sex-specific differences in CGRP-positive nervous structures were mainly visible in adult animals. This may suggest that the distribution and exact role of this substance in the ENS depend on the sex hormones.",Extensive Reliability Evaluation of Docking-Based Target-Fishing Strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818741,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"The development of target-fishing approaches, aimed at identifying the possible protein targets of a small molecule, represents a hot topic in medicinal chemistry. A successful target-fishing approach would allow for the elucidation of the mechanism of action of all therapeutically interesting compounds for which the actual target is still unknown. Moreover, target-fishing would be essential for preventing adverse effects of drug candidates, by predicting their potential off-targets, and it would speed up drug repurposing campaigns. However, due to the huge number of possible protein targets that a small-molecule might interact with, experimental target-fishing approaches are out of reach. In silico target-fishing represents a valuable alternative, and examples of receptor-based approaches, exploiting the large number of crystallographic protein structures determined to date, have been reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no proper evaluation of such approaches is, however, reported yet. In the present work, we extensively assessed the reliability of docking-based target-fishing strategies. For this purpose, a set of X-ray structures belonging to different targets was selected, and a dataset of compounds, including 10 experimentally active ligands for each target, was created. A target-fishing benchmark database was then obtained, and used to assess the performance of 13 different docking procedures, in identifying the correct target of the dataset ligands. Moreover, a consensus docking-based target-fishing strategy was developed and evaluated. The analysis highlighted that specific features of the target proteins could affect the reliability of the protocol, which however, proved to represent a valuable tool in the proper applicability domain. Our study represents the first extensive performance assessment of docking-based target-fishing approaches, paving the way for the development of novel efficient receptor-based target fishing strategies."

Evidence that DA pharmacotherapy causes abnormal valve morphology and dysfunction at doses used in the management of hyperprolactinaemia is extremely limited. Evidence of clinically significant valve pathology is absent, except for isolated case reports around which questions remain. Attributing change in degree of valvar regurgitation, especially in mild and moderate tricuspid regurgitation, to adverse effects of DA in hyperprolactinaemia should be avoided if there are no associated pathological changes in leaflet thickness, restriction or retraction. Note must be taken that even where morphological change in leaflet structure and function may be suspected, grading is semi-quantitative on echocardiography and may vary between different machines, ultrasound settings and operators. Decisions regarding discontinuation of medication should only be made after review of serial imaging by an echocardiographer experienced in analysing drug-induced valvulopathy or carcinoid heart disease. A standard transthoracic echocardiogram should be performed before a patient starts DA therapy for hyperprolactinaemia. Repeat transthoracic echocardiography should then be performed at 5 years after starting cabergoline in patients taking a total weekly dose less than or equal to 2 mg.

While conventional KUB X-rays and intravenous pyelography were standard imaging procedures in the past, computed tomography is the first choice today. Conservative treatments such as medical expulsive therapy were established to facilitate ureteral stone passage, but have come into discussion in the past few years. Fifty years ago, open stone surgery was the standard procedure to access renal stones. This has been superseded by minimally-invasive procedures ranging from percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy (URS), which is today's standard for most upper urinary tract stones.

However, simple and efficient methods to modify RNA such as at the 3' terminus with specific nucleobases or nucleotide analogs conjugated to various chemical moieties are lacking. Here, we develop and characterize a one-step enzymatic method to modify RNA 3' termini using recombinant human polymerase theta (Polθ). We demonstrate that Polθ efficiently adds 30-50 2'-deoxyribonucleotides to the 3' terminus of RNA molecules of various lengths and sequences, and extends RNA 3' termini with an assortment of 2'-deoxy and 2',3'-dideoxy ribonucleotide analogs containing functional chemistries, such as high affinity attachment moieties and fluorophores. In contrast to Polθ, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is unable to use RNA as a substrate altogether. Overall, Polθ shows a strong preference for adding deoxyribonucleotides to RNA, but can also add ribonucleotides with relatively high efficiency in particular sequence contexts. We anticipate that this unique activity of Polθ will become invaluable for applications requiring 3' terminal modification of RNA and potentially enzymatic synthesis of RNA.",Manipulated taking the agent versus the recipient perspective seems not to affect the relationship between agency-communion and self-esteem: A small-scale meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818395,PloS one,2019 03 10,"There is a growing debate about the relationship between self-perceived agency-communion and self-esteem.

However, the meta-analysis of six experiments (N = 659, 68% females) showed no interaction of the perspectives and self-ascribed agency and communion in predicting self-esteem.

Firearms are often used to accomplish these practical management objectives, and there is increased concern that the methods used may compromise animal welfare. We document the accuracy and humaneness of gunshot placement to the brain and cervical vertebrae of Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) on Guam during depopulation activities as a model for meeting AVMA standards of euthanasia under field conditions (e.g., animal is not in hand). Deer were shot with a .223 caliber rifle from 10-125 m and approached immediately (<20 s) for assessment. A subset of adult deer was further evaluated for physiological responses including cessation of heart rate, respiration, ocular reflexes, and post-mortem spasms. All deer shot in the brain (n = 132) and upper cervical spine (C1-C3; n = 18) died immediately due to the destruction of the brain or spinal tissue. Shot placements were all within 1.9 cm of the point of aim (i.e., the center of the target region). The accuracy and immediate insensibility resulting from targeting of C1-C3 demonstrates that this is an alternative target site when animal positioning is not optimal for targeting the brain, or there is a need to preserve brain tissue (e.g., Chronic Wasting Disease testing). While targeting of C4 -C7 vertebrae (n = 6) was accurate and resulted in immediate incapacitation, the failure to produce immediate insensibility does not support the use of this shot placement when upper cervical or brain shot placement is an option. It is reasonable to achieve sufficient accuracy to target the brain or upper cervical vertebrae of deer under field conditions and meet standards of euthanasia while accomplishing management objectives.",Childhood theory of mind does not predict psychotic experiences and social functioning in a general population sample of adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818390,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Theory of Mind (ToM) is often impaired in early and chronic phases of psychosis and it is often suggested that poor ToM is a trait vulnerability for psychosis.

The present study aimed to assess the whole-brain functional networks underlying a) the process of focusing attention on a single speech stream vs. dividing attention between two streams and 2) speech processing on different time-scales and depth. Two spoken narratives were presented simultaneously while listeners were instructed to a) track and memorize the contents of a speech stream and b) detect the presence of numerals or syntactic violations in the same (""focused attended condition"") or in the parallel stream (""divided attended condition""). Speech content tracking was found to be associated with stronger connectivity in lower frequency bands (delta band- 0,5-4 Hz), whereas the detection tasks were linked with networks operating in the faster alpha (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. These results suggest that the oscillation frequencies of the dominant brain networks during speech processing may be related to the duration of the time window within which information is integrated. We also found that focusing attention on a single speaker compared to dividing attention between two concurrent speakers was predominantly associated with connections involving the frontal cortices in the delta (0.5-4 Hz), alpha (8-10 Hz), and beta bands (13-30 Hz), whereas dividing attention between two parallel speech streams was linked with stronger connectivity involving the parietal cortices in the delta and beta frequency bands. Overall, connections strengthened by focused attention may reflect control over information selection, whereas connections strengthened by divided attention may reflect the need for maintaining two streams in parallel and the related control processes necessary for performing the tasks.",The HERV-K accessory protein Np9 controls viability and migration of teratocarcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818388,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Human endogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient germline infections that make up approximately 8% of the modern human genome. The HERV-K (HML-2) family is one of the most recent entrants into the human germline, these viruses appear to be transcriptionally active, and HERV-K viral like particles (VLPs) are found in cell lines from a number of human malignancies. HERV-K VLPs were first found to be produced in teratocarcinoma cell lines, and since then teratocarcinoma has been thought of as the classical model for HERV-Ks, with the NCCIT teratocarcinoma cell line particularly known to produce VLPs. Treatment for teratocarcinoma has progressed since its discovery, with improved prognosis for patients. Since the introduction of platinum based therapy, first year survival has greatly improved even with disseminated disease; however, it is estimated that 20% to 30% of patients present with metastatic germ cell tumor relapse following initial treatments. Also, the toxicity associated with the use of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat germ cell tumors is still a major concern. In this study, we show that the depletion of the HERV-K accessory protein Np9 increases the sensitivity of NCCIT teratocarcinoma cells to bleomycin and cisplatin. While decreasing the expression of Np9 had only a modest effect on the baseline viability of the cells, the reduced expression of Np9 increased the sensitivity of the teratocarcinoma cells to environmental (serum starvation) and chemical (chemotherapeutic) stresses. Np9 is also essential to the migration of NCCIT teratocarcinoma cells: in a wound closure assay, reduced expression of Np9 resulted in cells migrating into the wound at a slower rate, whereas reintroduction of Np9 resulted in NCCIT cells migrating back into the wound in a manner similar to the control. These findings support the implication that the HERV-K accessory protein Np9 has oncogenic potential.",A novel polymorphism in the fatty acid desaturase 2 gene (Fads2): A possible role in the basal metabolic rate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818386,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Fatty acyl composition of cell membrane lipids, particularly the abundance of highly unsaturated docosahexaenoic fatty acid (22:6n-3, DHA), is likely to be an important predictor of basal metabolic rate (BMR). Our study was performed using two lines of laboratory mice divergently selected for either high or low BMR. We describe a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the Fads2 gene encoding Δ6-desaturase, a key enzyme in the metabolic pathways of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The allele frequencies of Fads2 were significantly different in both lines of mice. The analysis of genetic distances revealed that the genetic differentiation between the two studied lines developed significantly faster at the Fads2 locus than it did at neutral loci. Such a pattern suggests that the Fads2 polymorphism is related to the variation in BMR, i.e. the direct target of selection. The Fads2 polymorphism significantly affected abundance of several PUFAs; however, the differences in PUFA composition between lines were compatible with the difference in frequency of Fads2 alleles only for DHA. We hypothesize that the polymorphism in the Fads2 gene affects the BMR through modification of DHA abundance in cell membranes. This may be the first example of a significant link between a polymorphism in a gene responsible for fatty acyl composition and variation in BMR.",Multisensory correlations-Not tactile expectations-Determine the sense of body ownership.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818385,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Can the mere expectation of a sensory event being about to occur on an artificial limb be sufficient to elicit an illusory sense of ownership over said limb? This issue is currently under debate and studies using two different paradigms have presented conflicting results. Here, we employed the two relevant paradigms, namely, the magnetic touch illusion and the ""tactile expectation"" version of the rubber hand illusion, to clarify the role of tactile expectations in the process of attributing ownership to limbs. The illusory senses of ownership and 'magnetic touch' were quantified using questionnaires, threat-evoked skin conductance responses and a combination of motion tracking synchronized with real-time subjective ratings and skin conductance. The results showed that the magnetic touch illusion was dependent on concurrent visual and tactile stimulation and that visually induced tactile expectations alone were insufficient. Moreover, in this study, tactile expectations were not associated with the rubber hand illusion, neither in terms of subjective ratings nor skin conductance changes. Together, these findings contradict the notion that the brain uses predictions of upcoming sensory events to determine whether or not a limb belongs to the self, and, instead, emphasize the importance of correlated multisensory information."

This study was designed to determine knowledge; attitudes and practices toward antibiotics use in an urban community, and evaluate the factors that are associated with antibiotic use. Between January and March 2015, a cross sectional and prospective study was conducted in all pharmacies within the Douala IV health district, Cameroon. Anonymous interviews including both open and closed ended questions were conducted in participants selected by convenience sampling Descriptive and logistic regression analysis were performed using StataSE11 software (version 11 SE) and R software (version 3.1.1) in data analysis. Overall 402 (33.7%) of 1,192 customers purchased antibiotics and of these, 47% bought antibiotics without a prescription. 60.7% of purchased antibiotics was for adult 'patients and around 60% of parents carried out self-medication on their children. The vast majority reported that all microbes can be treated with antibiotics (88.3%). The belief that antibiotics are appropriate for bacterial infections was more common among those with a higher level education (OR = 4.03, 95%CI:1.89-8.57, p<0.0001) and among public/private servants (OR = 2.47, 95%CI:1.21-5.08, p = 0.013). Physicians provide less explanations about antibiotics are and their potential side effects than the pharmacy auxiliaries (OR = 0.205, 95%CI = 0.09-0.46, p<0.0001), but more than pharmacists (OR = 3.692, 95%CI:1.44-9.25, p = 0.005). Indications on antibiotics use were 7 times more given to customers with a prescription compared to those without a prescription (OR = 7.37, 95% CI = 2.13-25.43, p = 0.002). Adult male (OR = 2.32, 95%CI:1.24-4.34, p = 0.009) and higher education (OR = 2.05, 95%CI:1.08-3.89, p = 0.027) were significantly associated with self-medication. Misuse, little ""practical knowledge"" and high self-medication confirm the unsatisfactory prescription and dispensing practices of the antibiotics in our country. These results highlight the important of the development and implementation appropriate guidelines for the responsible use of antibiotics for health care providers and health education targeting community members themselves.",Information sharing between intensive care and primary care after an episode of critical illness; A mixed methods analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818372,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Poor quality communication between hospital doctors and GPs at the time of hospital discharge is associated with adverse patient outcomes. This may be more marked after an episode of critical illness, the complications of which can persist long after hospital discharge.",Sensing of cell-associated HTLV by plasmacytoid dendritic cells is regulated by dense β-galactoside glycosylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818370,PLoS pathogens,2019 04 10,"Human T Lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection can persist in individuals resulting, at least in part, from viral escape of the innate immunity, including inhibition of type I interferon response in infected T-cells. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are known to bypass viral escape by their robust type I interferon production. Here, we demonstrated that pDCs produce type I interferons upon physical cell contact with HTLV-infected cells, yet pDC activation inversely correlates with the ability of the HTLV-producing cells to transmit infection. We show that pDCs sense surface associated-HTLV present with glycan-rich structure referred to as biofilm-like structure, which thus represents a newly described viral structure triggering the antiviral response by pDCs. Consistently, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and especially the cell surface pattern of terminal β-galactoside glycosylation, modulate the transmission of the immunostimulatory RNA to pDCs. Altogether, our results uncover a function of virus-containing cell surface-associated glycosylated structures in the activation of innate immunity.",High-risk human papillomavirus oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and de-ubiquitination of FancD2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818369,PLoS pathogens,2019 06 13,"Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes is necessary for the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Here, we show that E6/E7 expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL). Importantly, we elucidate how E6/E7 attenuate the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA crosslink repair pathway. Though E6/E7 activated the pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, they inhibited the completion of the repair by multiple mechanisms. E6/E7 impaired FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSB), which subsequently hindered the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSB in E6 cells. Further, E6 expression caused delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, an important process for effective ICL repair. Delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination was associated with the increased chromatin retention of FancD2 hindering USP1 de-ubiquitinating activity, and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. E6 mediated p53 degradation did not hamper the cell cycle specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogated repair by disrupting FancD2 de-ubiquitination. Further, E6 reduced the expression and foci formation of Palb2, which is a repair protein downstream of FancD2. These findings uncover unique mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.",Enterococcus faecalis EF-2001 protects DNBS-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818368,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Recent studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of heat-killed lactic acid bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis EF-2001 (EF-2001) on a model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A total of 28 female NC/Nga mice were divided into 4 treatment groups. Controls were fed a normal commercial diet. In the experimental groups, colitis was induced by rectal administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Two groups were orally administered 2 and 17 mg/kg EF-2001, respectively. EF-2001 treatment decreased the expression of several cytokines, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in inflamed colon compared to the DNBS alone group. In addition, EF-2001 suppressed DNBS-induced colonic tissue destruction. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that EF-2001 could alleviate the inflammation associated with mouse IBD.",The German version of the Quality of Marriage Index: Psychometric properties in a representative sample and population-based norms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818367,PloS one,2019 03 10,The Quality of Marriage Index (QMI) is a 6-item internationally widely-used instrument assessing relationship satisfaction. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the psychometric properties of the German version in a representative sample of the German general population (N = 1431) as well as (2) effects of gender and age on relationship satisfaction. All participants were in a relationship. The German QMI demonstrates good item characteristics and excellent reliability (α = .94). The proposed one-factor solution was replicated. Differences in scoring on the QMI showed that males scored higher than females and differences between younger and older participants were found. The findings suggest that the German version of the QMI is suitable to reliably measure relationship satisfaction and may therefore be used as a brief screening instrument in a variety of settings and research questions. A cross validation in a sample of couples seeking help for relationship difficulties should be considered in future research. The limited number of items and the one-factor-solution do not suggest this instrument as a fine-tuned assessment tool for different dimensions of relationship satisfaction.,Role of the high-affinity leukotriene B4 receptor signaling in fibrosis after unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818366,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator that acts as a potent chemoattractant for inflammatory leukocytes. Kidney fibrosis is caused by migrating inflammatory cells and kidney-resident cells. Here, we examined the role of the high-affinity LTB4 receptor BLT1 during development of kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in wild-type (WT) mice and BLT1 knockout (BLT1-/-) mice. We found elevated expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), which generates LTB4, in the renal tubules of UUO kidneys from WT mice and BLT1-/- mice. Accumulation of immunoreactive type I collagen in WT UUO kidneys increased over time; however, the increase was less prominent in BLT1-/- UUO kidneys. Accumulation of S100A4-positive fibroblasts increased temporally in WT UUO kidneys, but was again less pronounced in-BLT1-/- UUO kidneys. The same was true of mRNA encoding transforming growth factor-β (TGF)-β and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Finally, accumulation of F4/80-positive macrophages, which secrete TGF-β, increased temporally in WT UUO and BLT1-/- UUO kidneys, but to a lesser extent in the latter. Following LTB4 stimulation in vitro, macrophages showed increased expression of mRNA encoding TGF-β/FGF-2 and Col1a1, whereas L929 fibroblasts showed increased expression of mRNA encoding α smooth muscle actin (SMA). Bone marrow (BM) transplantation studies revealed that the area positive for type I collagen was significantly smaller in BLT1-/-BM→WT than in WT-BM→WT. Thus, LTB4-BLT1 signaling plays a critical role in fibrosis in UUO kidneys by increasing accumulation of macrophages and fibroblasts. Therefore, blocking BLT1 may prevent renal fibrosis.",HIV-1 coreceptor tropism: A syllogistic connection with The Veterans Aging Cohort Study Index and the CD4/CD8 ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818365,PloS one,2019 03 10,"The association between X4 virus and an increased risk of non-AIDS-events has been reported.

A total of 538 eyes of 477 patients diagnosed with CSC, with 3 months or more of follow-up between April 2013 and June 2017 at 8 institutions. Patients with CSC with more than 3 months of follow-up were identified by OCT and fluorescein angiography at 8 institutions. Data collected included patient demographics, history of corticosteroid medication and smoking, spherical errors, findings of angiography, subfoveal choroidal thickness, and changes through the follow-up period. Differences in these findings were analyzed in cases with and without corticosteroid treatment. Among the 477 patients (344 men,133 women), 74 (15.5%) (39 men, 35 women) underwent current or prior steroid treatment. Cases with steroids were higher age (p = 0.0403) and showed no male prevalence, more bilateral involvement (p < 0.0001), and the affected eyes had multiple pigment epithelial detachment (p <0.0001), more fluorescein leakage sites (p < 0.0001), greater choroidal thickness (p = 0.0287) and a higher recurrence rate (p = 0.0412). Steroids can cause severer CSC through an effect on choroidal vessels and an impairment of retinal pigment epithelium.",Transcription-dependent spreading of the Dal80 yeast GATA factor across the body of highly expressed genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818362,PLoS genetics,2019 04 02,"GATA transcription factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes and play roles in transcription of genes implicated in cancer progression and hematopoiesis. However, although their consensus binding sites have been well defined in vitro, the in vivo selectivity for recognition by GATA factors remains poorly characterized. Using ChIP-Seq, we identified the Dal80 GATA factor targets in yeast. Our data reveal Dal80 binding to a large set of promoters, sometimes independently of GATA sites, correlating with nitrogen- and/or Dal80-sensitive gene expression. Strikingly, Dal80 was also detected across the body of promoter-bound genes, correlating with high expression. Mechanistic single-gene experiments showed that Dal80 spreading across gene bodies requires active transcription. Consistently, Dal80 co-immunoprecipitated with the initiating and post-initiation forms of RNA Polymerase II. Our work suggests that GATA factors could play dual, synergistic roles during transcription initiation and post-initiation steps, promoting efficient remodeling of the gene expression program in response to environmental changes."
