Equally well-acknowledged is the fact that existing guidelines essentially set out the principles of best practice in an idealised setting, concentrating on information gathering and not providing any personalisable decision support for the general practitioner aiming to share decision making with a person with multiple morbidities in the reality of routine practice. Existing decision aids have been developed largely within the single condition context and can draw on a body of robust research largely absent in the multimorbidity context. The need for a more flexible and generic approach which draws more on the clinician's expertise-based judgments has been called for, and we introduce a Decision Support Tool, GREST CLIN, in response to this call. Based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis it reflects the quantitative calculation approach to decision support rather than the deliberative reasoning of mainstream decision aids. It is emphasised that any evaluation should use the current decision making process as empirical comparator, rather than idealised normative standards, and that the primary outcome measure should be decision quality at the point of care, not downstream outcomes. A demonstration version of the tool is available online as proof of method.",Optimization of Clinical Decision Support Based on Pearson Correlation of Attributes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156116,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"Clinical decision support is very important especially in such a wide-spread disease as a coronary artery disease. A large variety of prediction methods can potentially solve the classification problem to support clinical decisions. However, not all of them provide similar efficiency for the classification of patients with coronary artery disease. We have analyzed prediction the efficiency of classifiers (Ridge Classifier, XGB Classifier and Logistic Regression) depending on the number and combination of features. We have tested 24 sets of features on 4 classifiers to proof the hypothesis that using optimized features sets with a higher Pearson ratio results in more efficient classifiers than using all available data.",Translating the Results of Discrete Choice Experiments into p-/e-/m-Health Decision Support Tools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156115,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"The rapidly growing number of health-related Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) has not been matched by studies of their impact on decision or policymaking. However, it is widely assumed that this impact has been very limited, despite the potential relevance of the resulting average preferences to group policy development. The main, but at the moment essentially speculative, explanation offered, focuses on the methodological quality of the DCEs and their reporting. An alternative explanation, equally speculative, lies in the research-practice gap created by the conceptualisation of the DCE as a purely research exercise, not supplemented by any attempt to translate the findings into analytic decision support form. This also applies in the clinical decision context, where there are frequent claims that DCE results can assist in an individual's decision making. In the absence of suggestions as to how group results can analytically facilitate preference-sensitive care (and legally informed consent), we propose a generic add-on for DCEs with 'real' options, attributes, and attribute levels. This takes the form of a multi-criteria analysis-based decision support tool. Exemplars, showing how preference-sensitive individualised opinions can be derived from published DCEs for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding and Prostate Cancer Screening, may be consulted online.",NASA RTLX as a Novel Assessment for Determining Cognitive Load and User Acceptance of Expert and User-Based Evaluation Methods Exemplified Through a mHealth Diabetes Self-Management Application Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156113,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"Many diabetes patients utilize mobile health applications for their personalized self-management needs, but a majority of these systems have deficient usability. To assess the usability, different evaluation methods can be used. Two such methods are the expert-based cognitive walkthrough (CW) and user-based think aloud (TA) which have different advantages and disadvantages and can lead to the detection of many types of usability problems. There is, however, a lack of research on how the evaluators experience performing these different methods; an important aspect to include due to its possible implications for the evaluation overall. In this paper the focus was on assessing the evaluators' cognitive load and method acceptance through an instrument novel for this particular purpose, the NASA RTLX, and through in-depth interviews. Six usability experts and 6 diabetes patients performed the evaluations where 18 usability problems were found with the CW and 20 with the TA and with system usability (SUS) scores of 23.75 and 59.58. Both methods had similarly high cognitive loads: the CW with a RTLX score of 56.11, and the TA of 53.47 and both were experienced as cognitively demanding. The results indicate the potential importance of these dimensions for decision-making purposes between different evaluation methods.",Dynamic Features Impact on the Quality of Chronic Heart Failure Predictive Modelling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156112,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"We study the way dynamics affects modelling in chronic heart failure (CHF) tasks. By dynamics we understand the patient history and the appearance of new events, states and variables changing in time. The goal is to understand what impact past data has on prediction quality. Three different experiments have been conducted: CHF episode results prediction (better, worse, no change), CHF stage classification and heart rate value prediction. For modelling we use clinical data of CHF patients. For each task the groups of static and dynamic features are selected and analyzed. For each task 3 machine learning algorithms were trained: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for multi classification and Linear Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoost for the regression task. Different combinations of features were examined from both groups applying forward feature selection algorithm. The results confirm that the highest predictions quality is reached with combination of static and dynamic features.",Using Machine Learning for Personalized Patient Adherence Level Determination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156111,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"The paper deals with using a machine-learning algorithm for patient adherence level determination.

However, results of clustering are not often clear for physicians as well as different clustering methods can produce different results. We have examined a well-known dataset and implemented 3 clustering methods (k-means, Agglomerative and Spectral). We have compared and evaluated clusters and their correlation with data attributes. In contrast to original dataset's target value, the clusters correlated with only a few attributes. Finally, we train 2 predictive models based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Models evaluation demonstrates that using the results of clustering algorithms as predictive attribute give a higher F-score than the original target attribute.",Permutation Entropy Applied to Fitbit Data: Long-Term Sleep Analysis on One Healthy Subject.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156108,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"In this work we exploited an algorithm, already present in the literature, and based on the notion of signal permutation entropy, to analyze a very long time series of sleep data from a single subject. The aim of the work is to explore methods for personalizing alerts related to sleep anomalies, and recommendations for improving sleep quality. As a matter of fact, sleep duration and sleep quality may differently affect daily performance of different people, as well as daily activities may differently affect sleeping during the night. Data have been collected from a Fitbit Alta HR activity tracker worn by the subject for about three years. Results show that personalized inferences may be very different from the generic (population-based) ones, and that correlations found may suggest subject-specific life-style modifications useful to improve sleep quality.",Graph-Based Predictive Modelling of Chronic Disease Development: Type 2 DM Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156107,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"This study proposes a graph-based method for representing the dynamics of chronic diabetes as a complex process with different characteristics. The study was based on the case histories of 6864 patients with diabetes mellitus, 90% of whom suffer from type 2 diabetes. Our method allows to predict the sequence of events during the development of type 2 diabetes for each patient. Typical developmental trajectories of the disease were investigated, their clustering was carried out, the trajectory patterns were identified and studied. Based on the constructed directed graph reflecting transitions between different conditions of the patients, the clustering of diabetic statuses was carried out using the Modularity Class method; 8 clusters were selected, each of them was interpreted and studied. The method of the disease developmental trajectories creation by means of machine learning methods was described. Unlike static models of a disease course, this method considers complete past information on the patient and his or her previous events, using each event of the course of disease to predict the next event."

In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study to identify the characteristics and constraints that are relevant to evaluate PX in PREGs. The study included semi-structured interviews conducted during two sessions with three physiotherapists from a local hospital. The collected data was analysed using the thematic content analysis method. The findings indicate that the PX evaluation constraints are related to (a) the rehabilitation context in which PREGs are employed; (b) the pursued rehabilitation goal (i.e., the capability of a PREG to assist the achievement of a rehabilitation goal); and (c) the characteristics of target patients, which may affect their experience and willingness to play. The findings of the study contribute to a comprehensive understanding of PX in PREGs. We concluded that the three groups of constraints may impact the three constructs of PX; i.e., context (rehabilitation context), player (patient) and game system (PREG system).

Traditional pHealth is changing to Digital pHealth. This development brings new ethical, privacy and trust problems which have to solve to make Digital pHealth successful. In this paper ethical, privacy and trust problems in Digital pHealth are studied at conceptual level. Concerns caused by the use novel ICT-technology and regulatory environment are also discussed. The starting point is that the Digital pHealth as a system and its applications and algorithms should be ethically acceptable, trustworthy and enable the service user to set own context-aware privacy policies. Mutual trust is needed between application and all stakeholders. Solution proposed for trustworthy Digital pHealth include ethical design, policy based privacy management and on-line calculation of privacy and trust levels using proven mathematical methods. In the future, novel solutions such as algorithm based access control and data sharing, and algorithm based privacy prediction together with cryptography based blockchain seems to have potential to change the way privacy is managed in Digital pHealth. Technology alone cannot solve current privacy and trust problems. New regulations which not only give users of the Digital pHealth right to set personal privacy polies but also force pHealth service providers and platform owners to prove regulatory compliance of their services are needed.",Suitable Data Representation for Abnormal Pattern Detection in Smart Home Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156087,Studies in health technology and informatics,2019 06 03,"Development in the area of sensor technologies and subsequently applications within the Internet of Things allows the implementation of systems for continuous monitoring of human's vital parameters and daily activities.

The most abundant milk proteins are α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, αs-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein. Besides their nutritional value, milk proteins play a crucial role in the processing properties of milk, such as solubility, water bonding, heat stability, renneting and foaming, among others. In addition, and most importantly for this review, these proteins are the main source of bioactive components in milk. Due to the wide range of proposed beneficial effects on human health, milk proteins are considered as potential ingredients for the production of health-promoting functional foods. However, most of the evidence for bioactive effects comes from in vitro studies, and there is a need for further research to fully evaluate the true potential of milk-derived bioactive factors. Animal genetics and animal nutrition play an important role in the relative proportions of milk proteins and could be used to manipulate the concentration of specific bioactive peptides in milk from ruminants. Unfortunately, only a few studies in the literature have focused on changes in milk bioactive peptides associated to animal genetics and animal nutrition. The knowledge described in the present review may set the basis for further research and for the development of new dairy products with healthy and beneficial properties for humans.",The intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment: Nonspecificity of maltreatment type and associations with borderline personality pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156081,Development and psychopathology,2019 06 03,"One generation's experience of childhood maltreatment is associated with that of the next. However, whether this intergenerational transmission is specific to distinct forms of maltreatment and what factors may contribute to its continuity remains unclear. Borderline personality pathology is predicted by childhood maltreatment and characterized by features (e.g., dysregulated emotion, relationship instability, impulsivity, and inconsistent appraisals of others) that may contribute to its propagation. Among 364 older adults and 573 of their adult children (total n = 937), self-reported exposure to distinct forms of childhood maltreatment (i.e., emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect as assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) showed homotypic and heterotypic associations across generations with little evidence that latent factors unique to specific forms of maltreatment show generational continuity. General nonspecific indices of childhood maltreatment showed evidence of intergenerational transmission after accounting for demographic factors and parent socioeconomic status (b = 0.126, p = 9.21 × 10-4). This continuity was partially mediated by parental borderline personality pathology (assessed longitudinally through a variety of measures and sources, indirect effect: b = 0.031, 95% confidence interval [0.003, 0.060]). The intergenerational continuity of childhood maltreatment may largely represent general risk for nonspecific maltreatment that may, in part, be propagated by borderline personality pathology and/or shared risk factors."

The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers for cell proliferation and chondrogenesis in the primary stage of synovial chondromatosis in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Clinical Presentation: A 67-year-old female was referred for right side TMJ pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggested an intra-joint space lesion, but no free bodies were observed intraoperatively. Pathological examination led to diagnosis of Milgram stage 1 synovial chondromatosis. Biomarkers related to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cell proliferation, and chondrogenesis were observed in immunohistopathological examination of specimens. Clinical Relevance: The findings suggest that MSCs with chondrogenic potential and growth activity are present at the start of cartilage formation in the synovial membrane. These cells may be the origin of disease.

After characterization studies for P(HEMA) cryogels, effects of the parameters including medium pH, CNBr concentration, heparin concentration and contact time on heparin immobilization were investigated. Blood compatibility and cell adhesion tests were also performed, and platelet and leucocyte loss for P(HEMA)-Hp cryogels were found to be 2.95% and 4.91%, respectively. Maximum adsorption capacity for LDL-C from hypercholesterolemic human plasma was found to be 26.7 mg/g for P(HEMA)-Hp cryogel while it was only 1.67 mg/g for bare P(HEMA) cryogel. The P(HEMA)-Hp cryogels exhibit high desorption ratios up to 96% after 10 adsorption-desorption cycles with no significant decrease in the adsorption capacity. The findings indicated that these reusable P(HEMA)-based cryogels proposed good alternative adsorbents for removal of LDL-C.","Childhood leukemia survivors exhibit deficiencies in sensory and cognitive processes, as reflected by event-related brain potentials after completion of curative chemotherapy: A preliminary investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156064,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,2019 06 03,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize post-chemotherapy sensory, memory, and attention abilities in childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to better understand how treatment affects cognitive functioning. Methods: Eight ALL survivors and eight age-matched, healthy children between the ages of 5-11 years participated in the study. Among the ALL survivors, a median of 63 days (range 22-267 days) elapsed between completion of chemotherapy and this assessment. Sounds were presented in an oddball paradigm while recording the electroencephalogram in separate conditions of passive listening and active task performance. To assess different domains of cognition, we measured event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reflecting sensory processing (P1 component), working memory (mismatch negativity [MMN] component), attentional orienting (P3a), and target detection (P3b component) in response to the sounds. We also measured sound discrimination and response speed performance. Results: Relative to control subjects, ALL survivors had poorer performance on auditory tasks, as well as decreased amplitude of the P1, MMN, P3a, and P3b components. ALL survivors also did not exhibit the amplitude gain typically observed in the sensory P1 component when attending to the sound input compared to when passively listening. Conclusions: Atypical responses were observed in brain processes associated with sensory discrimination, auditory working memory, and attentional control in pediatric ALL survivors indicating deficiencies in all cognitive domains compared to age-matched controls. Significance: ERPs differentiated aspects of cognitive functioning, which may provide a useful tool for assessing recovery and risk of post-chemotherapy cognitive deficiencies in young children. The decreased MMN amplitude in ALL survivors may indicate (N-methyl D-aspartate) NMDA dysfunction induced by methotrexate, and thus provides a potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairments.","Epidemiology of invasive bacterial infections in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-vaccinated and -unvaccinated children under 5 years of age in Soweto, South Africa: a cohort study from a high-HIV burden setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156062,Paediatrics and international child health,2019 06 03,"Background: There are limited data on paediatric invasive bacterial infections (IBI) and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on the spectrum of IBI pathogens, specifically in African countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection. Aim: To describe the epidemiology of IBI in a cohort of children <5 years of age in Soweto, South Africa. Methods: A cohort of children enrolled into a PCV9 efficacy trial conducted from 1998 until 2005 was used for secondary data analysis. Surveillance data were collected from admission wards at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. The incidence of IBI was calculated using person-time, stratified by age group, gender, PCV9 vaccination status and HIV infection status. Risk factors for IBI were investigated using binomial logistic regression. Results: A total of 395 cases of laboratory-confirmed IBI were identified. HIV infection and not receiving PCV9 vaccination were risk factors for IBI hospitalisation. PCV9 vaccination was associated with reductions in IBI hospitalisation (IRR 0.76, p = 0.006) solely owing to reductions in the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (IRR 0.56, p < 0.001). PCV9 vaccination had no effect on the incidence of Haemophilus influenza type b or Salmonella species IBI. There was an increase in Klebsiella species IBI (IRR 3.50, p = 0.019) and a trend towards a higher incidence of Staphylococcus aureus IBI (IRR 1.90, p = 0.099) in PCV9-vaccinated children. Conclusions: PCV9 vaccination was effective in reducing the incidence of IBI hospitalisation in children through reductions in the incidence of S. pneumoniae. The results show that trends in other IBI causative pathogens (specifically S. aureus and Klebsiella species) should be monitored in the era of PCV vaccination.

However, it is not clear whether specific dietary factors may provide neuroprotective effects among individuals with overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choline intake on neurophysiological markers of attentional control among young and middle-aged adults with overweight or obesity. Methods: 146 adults with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (34.0 ± 5.9 years, 57 males) participated in the study. Behavioral performance (accuracy and reaction time) and neuroelectric indices (event-related brain potentials [ERPs]) of attentional inhibition were assessed during a Flanker task. Specifically, the amplitude and latency of the P3 waveform in a central-parietal region of interest (ROI) were used to index attentional resource allocation and information processing speed, respectively. Choline intake and overall diet quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI-2015]) were assessed using 7-day diet records. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using the Kaufman-Brief Intelligence Test. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between habitual dietary choline intake and cognitive outcomes following adjustment of demographic factors, IQ, HEI-2015, and BMI. Results: Choline intake was selectively associated with a lower peak amplitude of the P300 waveform during incongruent trials (β = -0.25, p = <0.01). No significant relationships were observed for accuracy or reaction time. Discussion: Higher choline intake is associated with more efficient neural processing among adults with overweight and obesity. Intervention are necessary to determine whether choline consumption provides neuroprotective effects for executive function among individuals with elevated weight status.",Co-enhance bioactive of polymer scaffold with mesoporous silica and nano-hydroxyapatite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156060,Journal of biomaterials science. Polymer edition,2019 06 03,"Mesoporous silica Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA15) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) were introduced in poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold fabricated by selective laser sintering to co-enhance the bioactivity. On the one hand, the active elements silicon and calcium released respectively by the degradation of SBA15 and nHA were favorable for stimulating cell response. On the other hand, the hydrated silica gel layer derived from SBA15 could adsorb calcium ions released from nHA, thereby co-promoting apatite nucleation and growth. The experimental results showed that the formation of bone-like apatite on the scaffold was accelerated under simulated body fluid, indicating a good biomineralization capacity. Moreover, the scaffold demonstrated a good cell response in promoting the attachment of cell and the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity. Besides, SBA15 and nHA not only improved the hydrophilicity of the scaffold (the water contact angle changed from 107.4° to 57.8°), but also retarded the pH reduction by neutralizing the acidic hydrolysate of PLLA. These results indicated that the PLLA-SBA15-nHA scaffold may be potential candidates for bone repair.",Changes of Self-reported PTSD and Depression Symptoms During Alcohol Detoxification Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156059,Journal of dual diagnosis,2019 06 03,"Objective: There is a lack of empirical knowledge on how different comorbid disorders and symptoms change in the course of initial abstinence and withdrawal. The aim of this study is to replicate previous findings on the symptom course using a larger sample and up-to-date psychometric instruments. Methods: During inpatient alcohol detoxification, we measured comorbid depression (Beck Depression Inventory second revision; BDI-II) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5) symptoms twice among 87 participants within a 10-day interval. Results: Significant decreases occurred for symptoms of reexperiencing (p < .001, d = .27), avoidance (p < .001, d = .41), negative cognitions (p = .03, d = .22), alteration in arousal (p < .001, d = .37), and the PCL-5 total score (p < .001, d = .35). Depression scores also significantly declined with a greater effect size (p < .001, d = .53). Depression screening was not stable, while posttraumatic stress disorder screening was revealed to be stable through alcohol detoxification. Interaction effects were detected, indicating the higher symptom decrease for patients who initially had positive posttraumatic stress disorder and depression screenings, F(1, 84) = 23.01, p < .001 and F(1, 84) = 10.01, p < .01, respectively. Conclusions: Patients in the first stage of alcohol treatment show high levels of comorbid psychopathology. These symptoms change during detoxification, especially for patients having a higher initial symptomatic burden. More research is needed to guide practitioners to make reliable comorbid diagnoses in this early treatment phase as this can motivate patients to pursue subsequent treatments.",Signaling trustworthiness: The effect of leader humor on feedback-seeking behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156058,The Journal of social psychology,2019 06 03,"Given its capacity to cultivate a range of positive outcomes in the workplace, humor has been recognized as a valuable tool for leadership purposes. However, the theoretical understanding of leader humor remains relatively limited and the mechanism through which it influences follower outcomes has not been clearly identified. Drawing on signaling theory, we developed and empirically tested a model which delineates the relationship between leader humor and a specific follower behavior - proactive feedback seeking. We collected data from 304 employees and their respective leaders working in a large Canadian retail organization. Results of our analyses indicate that leader humor can impact subordinate feedback-seeking behavior via its influence on subordinates' affect-based and cognition-based trust in the leader.",Shared Decision Making and Treatment for Minority Children With ADHD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156057,Journal of transcultural nursing : official journal of the Transcultural Nursing Society,2019 06 03,"Shared decision making (SDM) involves the patient and family in medical decisions regarding treatment. The purpose of this article is to utilize the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health to explore whether family engagement in SDM increases the odds of treatment for children with ADHD, and more specifically, if the presence of SDM is associated with the reduction of racial and ethnic disparities in treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the odds of treatment for each racial/ethnic group controlling for sociodemographic and health-related variables. Results indicated that White and Multiracial families engaged in SDM were twice as likely to report treatment for ADHD. Black and Latinx families, however, showed no difference in treatment for ADHD when SDM was present. Based on these findings, we conclude that SDM may be less important for Black and Latinx families when making treatment decisions for children with ADHD."

Donors need this information to prioritise investments and lobby for continued financial support. To develop a deeper understanding of the implementation dynamics of robust HSS interventions, we retrospectively compared five USAID-supported projects in the Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Rwanda, and Zambia. A document review and key informant interviews (n = 44) were conducted, coded, and analysed in each of the five cases using an integrated implementation framework. The framework was organised by four phases of implementation. For the pre-condition phase, data-driven HSS interventions were nested in a range of political contexts and with differing levels of financial support. In pre-implementation, cases relied on diverse teams that created a data-informed, inclusive, and transparent project ethos for implementation. Implementation was located at multiple tiers of the health system, used interventions as catalysts for government initiatives, supported governance/accountability initiatives, and responded nimbly to contextual changes in the implementation climate. There was less evidence of maintenance and evolution but all cases were designed with an eye towards sustainability. This research yields important insights about the dynamics of HSS, identifying ways donors can better support countries to achieve universal health coverage.",Predicting long-term cognitive and neuropathological consequences of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: Review and theoretical framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156042,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,2019 06 03,"Prognostic modeling in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has historically focused primarily on the projection of crude outcomes such as the risk of mortality and disability. Initial work in this area has perpetuated the notion that prognosis after moderate to severe TBI can be measured as a single, static, and dichotomous outcome. However, more recent conceptualizations describe moderate to severe TBI as the initiation of a chronic disease state with high levels of inter-individual variability in terms of symptom manifestation and disease progression. Unfortunately, existing prognostic models provide limited insight into the extent of chronic cognitive and neurodegenerative changes experienced by moderate to severe TBI survivors. Though prior research has identified a variety of acute factors that appear to influence post-injury cognitive and neuropathological outcomes, an empirically supported framework for prognostic modeling of these injury-distal outcomes does not exist. The current review considers the literature on an expanded array of empirically supported predictors (both premorbid and injury-related) in association with long-term sequelae of moderate to severe TBI. We also provide a theoretical framework and statistical approach for prognostic modeling in moderate to severe TBI in order to unify efforts across research groups and facilitate important progress in this research area.",Half-life extension and non-human primate pharmacokinetic safety studies of i-body AD-114 targeting human CXCR4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156041,mAbs,2019 06 03,"Single domain antibodies that combine antigen specificity with high tissue penetration are an attractive alternative to conventional antibodies. However, rapid clearance from the bloodstream owing to their small size can be a limitation of therapeutic single domain antibodies. Here, we describe and evaluate the conjugation of a single domain i-body, AD-114, which targets CXCR4, to a panel of half-life extension technologies including a human serum albumin-binding peptide, linear and branched PEG, and PASylation (PA600). The conjugates were assessed in murine, rat and cynomolgus monkey pharmacokinetic studies and showed that the branched PEG was most effective at extending circulating half-life in mice; however, manufacturing limitations of PEGylated test material precluded scale-up and assessment in larger animals. PA600, by comparison, was amenable to scale-up and afforded considerable half-life improvements in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In mice, the circulating half-life of AD-114 was extended from 0.18 h to 7.77 h following conjugation to PA600, and in cynomolgus monkeys the circulating half-life of AD-114-PA600 was 24.27 h. AD-114-PA600 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at dose rates up to 100 mg/kg with no mortalities or drug-related clinical signs.",NET-prism enables RNA polymerase-dedicated transcriptional interrogation at nucleotide resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156037,RNA biology,2019 06 03,"The advent of quantitative approaches that enable interrogation of transcription at single nucleotide resolution has allowed a novel understanding of transcriptional regulation previously undefined. However, little is known, at such high resolution, how transcription factors directly influence RNA Pol II pausing and directionality. To map the impact of transcription/elongation factors on transcription dynamics genome-wide at base pair resolution, we developed an adapted NET-seq protocol called NET-prism (Native Elongating Transcription by Polymerase-Regulated Immunoprecipitants in the Mammalian genome). Application of NET-prism on elongation factors (Spt6, Ssrp1), splicing factors (Sf1), and components of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (TFIID, and Mediator) reveals their inherent command on transcription dynamics, with regards to directionality and pausing over promoters, splice sites, and enhancers/super-enhancers. NET-prism will be broadly applicable as it exposes transcription factor/Pol II dependent topographic specificity and thus, a new degree of regulatory complexity during gene expression.",Utility of the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS-2) in detecting feigned adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156034,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,2019 06 03,"Introduction: The Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS-2) utilizes various strategies in the detection of simulated psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to examine which of these strategies proves most useful in uncovering feigned attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood. Method: One-hundred seventy-one individuals instructed to feign ADHD were compared to 46 genuine patients with ADHD as well as 99 neurotypical controls in their reports provided on the SIRS-2. Results: Responses provided by simulators resembled those of genuine patients with ADHD on all SIRS-2 subscales with the exception of a supplementary scale tapping Overly Specified symptom reports, where a moderate effect emerged (d = 0.88). Classification accuracy remained low, with particularly poor sensitivity (sensitivity = 19.30%). Sensitivity was higher when the decision rules postulated in the first edition SIRS were applied instead of its successor's decision model, yet this increase in sensitivity came at the price of unacceptably low specificity. Conclusion: The present results call for a disorder-specific instrument for the detection of simulated ADHD and offer starting points for the development of such a tool.",Tetravalent biepitopic targeting enables intrinsic antibody agonism of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156033,mAbs,2019 06 03,"Agonism of members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) with monoclonal antibodies is of high therapeutic interest due to their role in immune regulation and cell proliferation. A major hurdle for pharmacologic activation of this receptor class is the requirement for high-order clustering, a mechanism that imposes a reliance in vivo on Fc receptor-mediated crosslinking. This extrinsic dependence represents a potential limitation of virtually the entire pipeline of agonist TNFRSF antibody drugs, of which none have thus far been approved or reached late-stage clinical trials. We show that tetravalent biepitopic targeting enables robust intrinsic antibody agonism for two members of this family, OX40 and DR5, that is superior to extrinsically crosslinked native parental antibodies. Tetravalent biepitopic anti-OX40 engagement co-stimulated OX40low cells, obviated the requirement for CD28 co-signal for T cell activation, and enabled superior pharmacodynamic activity relative to native IgG in a murine vaccination model. This work establishes a proof of concept for an engineering approach that addresses a major gap for the therapeutic activation of this important receptor class.",Calibration of highway safety manual predictive models for Kansas freeway segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156032,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2019 06 03,"The Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) are statistical formulas developed based on limited data gathered from selected few states. Therefore, the HSM recommends calibrating the HSM-default SPFs to local conditions or developing local SPFs to enhance the accuracy of crash prediction. This paper demonstrates the HSM calibration procedure for freeway segments and the quality assessment of the calibration process using Kansas freeway geometric and crash data. A minimum sample size of 446 freeway segments was calculated corresponding to 95% confidence level and 5% error; consequently, data for 521 freeway segments were collected and utilized in this freeway calibration. Results indicated that the HSM methodology overpredicts fatal and injury crashes and underpredicts property damage only crashes for freeway segments in Kansas. Results of quality assessment of the calibration process showed that estimated calibration factors were satisfactory for all freeway types considered in this study.",The biomechanical difference between running with traditional and 3D printed orthoses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156031,Journal of sports sciences,2019 06 03,"Running-related injuries have been associated with excessive foot pronation and high vertical loading rates. Traditional plaster-molded (TPM) foot orthoses are commonly prescribed to minimize these atypical biomechanical patterns. Recently, 3D printed (3DP) orthoses have become popular, yet the functional difference between these two types of orthoses remains unknown. Therefore, this study compared running biomechanics and perceived comfort during treadmill running in three orthotic conditions: 3DP orthoses, TPM orthoses, and a no-orthoses control condition (CON). Thirteen female asymptomatic runners with excessive foot pronation were recruited. Rearfoot eversion angle and velocity (at initial contact and peak) during stance, vertical loading rates, and perceived comfort were compared. Results showed lower peak rearfoot eversion angles during running with TPM (p=0.001, d=0.38) or 3DP orthoses (p=0.002, d=0.24) than CON. No differences were observed in other biomechanical parameters among the three conditions (p>0.05). Running with TPM (p≤0.001, d=1.74-1.82) and 3DP orthoses (p<0.003, d=1.06-1.34) resulted in better perceived comfort in ""medial-lateral control"" and ""heel cushioning"" than CON. There were no statistical differences in all parameters between TPM and 3DP orthoses. The present findings indicate improved comfort during running with TPM or 3DP orthoses, which hinted 3DP orthoses could be a viable alternative to TPM orthoses for clinical practice.",The effect of cognitive function on mobility improvement among community-living older adults: A 12-week resistance exercise intervention study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156030,"Neuropsychology, development, and cognition. Section B, Aging, neuropsychology and cognition",2019 06 03,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between baseline cognitive function and improvement in mobility after 12 weeks of resistance training (3 times/week; 3 sets, 6-8 repetitions at 75-80% of the 1-repetition maximum) among community-dwelling older adults in Iceland (N=205, 73.5±5.7 years, 57.0% female). Body composition, physical activity status, cardiovascular risk factors, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were measured. The linear regression model was used to examine the association between baseline MMSE and mobility improvement. Mean distance of 6MWT was 462.8±71.6 meter at baseline and mean change after the exercise intervention was 33.7±34.9 meter. The mean MMSE score at baseline was 27.6±1.9. After adjusting for baseline covariates, we found that baseline MMSE score was significantly associated with improvement in mobility among older adults after the exercise intervention. Cognitive function strongly influences the effect of exercise intervention on mobility among older adults.",Heterologous expression of azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in food-grade Lactococcus lactis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156029,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,2019 06 03,"In this study, azurin, a bacteriocin with anticancer property, was produced by food-grade Lactococcus lactis using the Nisin Controlled Gene Expression (NICE) System. In addition, the antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of recombinant azurin in the culture supernatant were also investigated. Azurin gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned into the pNZ8149 vector and the resulting recombinant DNA was transformed into food grade L. lactis NZ3900. The expression of azurin protein was induced by the optimum concentration of nisin for 3 h. Inhibition zones for Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were observed at 5.0 and 10 mg/mL concentrations of lyophilized supernatants containing azurin, but no inhibition zone at azurin-free lyophilized supernatants. When HUVEC, HT29, HCT116, and MCF7 cell lines were treated with lyophilized culture supernatants with azurin or without azurin, cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations of the supernatant. Furthermore, the supernatants containing azurin showed more anti-proliferative effect than the azurin-free supernatants. This work provides a practicable method to produce recombinant azurin in the food grade L. lactis strain. As a result, the recombinant L. lactis strain, producing azurin, can be used in the investigation of food biopreservatives and in the development of a therapeutic probiotic."

Methods: The data of the men who had 12-core prostate biopsy with a PSA value >20 ng/mg were reviewed. We recorded age, prostate volume, PSA level, and pathology report findings. Patients grouped according to PSA levels and compared for PCa detection rates, and several parameters. We created 16 prostate biopsy scenarios (S1-S16) and applied these to our database to find out the best biopsy protocol to detect PCa. Results: A total of 336 patients with a mean age of 70.5 (47-91) years were included. Mean PSA level was 190.6 (20-5474) ng/ml. PCa detection rates were 55.3%, 81.0%, and 97.7% in patients with PSA levels 20-49.99, 50-99.99, and ≥100 ng/ml, respectively. PSA level was correlated to clinically more important digital rectal examination findings. We selected 2 cores in S1-S6, 4 cores in S7-S12, and 6 cores in S13-S16. We calculated the sensitivity of each scenario and found that all scenarios in PSA Group 3 had a sensitivity >95%. In Group 2, S8, S10, S13, and S14 and in Group 1, only S14 had sensitivity >95%.

In Malawi, 42% of ever-married women have experienced some form of violence perpetrated by their current or most recent spouse. A number of studies have investigated intimate partner violence in Malawi within the context of HIV/AIDS, girls' sexual abuse, and psychological distress, and a few studies report on the role of sociocultural factors in influencing gender-based violence. No study has used cluster analysis to systematically analyze different levels of abuse among married women in Malawi. Using the 2015 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey data, we employed cluster analysis and multinomial logistic regression to analyze the distribution of different levels of abuse among married women in Malawi and the key attributes associated with each level of abuse. Correlates of domestic violence significantly differ by levels of abuse and are distributed as follows: controlling behavior (11.8%), general controlling behavior (GCB; 27.1%), moderate physical and emotional abuse (27.2%), and the high and complete abuse (8.5%). Alcohol consumption, ethnicity, and women working status were significantly associated with all four levels of abuse, but age and religion were only associated with controlling behavior and generalized controlling behavior. The strength of association between husband's alcohol consumption, woman's working status, and marriage type and domestic violence increased by level of abuse. On each of these factors, the odds of experiencing violence were lowest in the controlling behavior group and highest in the high physical and emotional abuse group. Policies and programs that are designed to tackle violence against married women in Malawi should incorporate strategies that discourage excessive alcohol consumption, promote messages that women can be bread winners, and discourage polygamous marriage.",Effects of ricin on primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156015,The Journal of international medical research,2019 06 03,We systematically investigated the cytotoxic effects of ricin in primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs).,Assimilative and Accommodative Coping and Older People's Leisure Activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156014,Journal of aging and health,2019 06 03,Assimilative and accommodative coping strategies have hardly been studied in relation to leisure activities in old age.

Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether these factors were associated with the presence of PCal. Result: We recorded the parameters of laboratory tests and clinical information from 14,427 men; men with PCal comprised 51.65% of the total group and 76.61% of the subgroup of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients. All the enrolled parameters showed meaningful differences, but the logistic regression analysis only indicated significant effects related to age (OR = 1.044, 95% CI = 1.040-1.047, and p < .001), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.035, 95% CI = 1.022-1.048, and p < .001), UA (OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.999-1.000, and p = .029), BPH (OR = 2.923, 95% CI = 2.678-3.191, and p < .001), and prostate cysts (OR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.471-0.788, and p < .001). The odds ratio of the predicted combined model is 1.068. Conclusions: PCal was detected in 51.65% of men among healthy Han Chinese and in 76.61% of BPH patients.

Greater skeletal muscle mass in men is protective against the development of T2DM compared to women, however, nutritional diversity, stress levels and other factors also affects this situation. In present retrospective study, we aimed to observe diabetic control level, metabolic parameters and general characteristics of type 2 diabetic men and to compare these values in middle aged and elderly diabetic population. Methods: The male patients with T2DM that admitted to the outpatient internal medicine clinics of our institution between November 2018 and April 2019 were included to the study. According to the age, study population divided into two groups; either younger than 60 years (group I) and 60 years or older (group II). Study parameters were compared between study groups. Results: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated Hb level (HbA1c) of group I were lower than those of the group II (p = 0.004 for FPG and p = 0.048 for HbA1c). Control level of T2DM was defined as well controlled in 20 (29%) patients in group I and 5 (10.9%) patients in group II (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Physicians should aware that well controlled T2DM is more common among younger diabetic men compared to older men and try to enhance diabetic regulation level in elderly men by interventions that aimed to improve skeletal muscle or by pharmacologic agents.",Reliability and minimal detectable change of the mini-BESTest in adults with spinal cord injury in a rehabilitation setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156010,Physiotherapy theory and practice,2019 06 03,"Background: The mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest) is a valid tool for assessing standing balance in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Its reliability has not yet been investigated with this population. Objective: To assess the test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the mini-BESTest in adults with SCI in a rehabilitation setting. Methods: Twenty-three participants admitted in a rehabilitation center following an SCI (mean age = 52.2 years, SD = 14.5; 13/23 tetraplegia; 14/23 traumatic injury) and able to stand 30 seconds without help were recruited. They were evaluated twice with the mini-BESTest to establish the test-retest reliability (interval of 1 to 2 days). One of the two sessions was video-recorded to establish the inter-rater reliability (3 physiotherapists). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,1), weighted kappa (Kw) and Kendall's W were used to determine reliability of total score and individual items. Minimal detectable changes (MDC) were computed. Results. The mini-BESTest total scores showed excellent test-retest (ICC = 0.94) and inter-rater (ICC = 0.96) reliability. Reliability of 50% of the individual items was acceptable to excellent (Κw and W = 0.35-1.00). The MDC of the mini-BESTest total score was 4 points. Conclusion: The mini-BESTest is a reliable tool to assess standing balance in adults with an SCI. A minimal change of 4 points on the total scale is needed to be confident that the change is not a measurement error between two sessions or two raters.",Is Active Transport and Leisure-Time Physical Activity Associated With Inflammatory Markers in US Adults? A Cross-Sectional Analyses From NHANES.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156008,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 03,"Background: To investigate the association between levels of active transport and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) with C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, body mass index, waist circumference, and lipids in a large representative sample of adults residing in the United States. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were carried out to quantify associations between levels of self-reported active transport (or LTPA) and quintiles of anthropometric measures and serum markers. Results: A total of 3248 adults were included. For serum inflammatory biomarkers, the authors observed a lower likelihood of being in the top quintile groups of circulating C-reactive protein (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.90) and white blood cell count (aOR: 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.95) with engaging in low to medium levels of active transport but not with high levels of active transport. Higher levels of LTPA were associated with lower likelihood of having high levels of serum inflammatory biomarkers (aOR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86 in the top C-reactive protein group and aOR: 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87 in top white blood cell group). Conclusions: Promoting active transport and/or LTPA may be a beneficial strategy to improving some, but not all, cardiometabolic health outcomes.","Alcohol and Drug Use among Youth - The Interplay of Future Orientation, Parenting, and Housing Conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156007,Substance use & misuse,2019 06 03,"Background: Past research indicated that future orientation might protect against substance use; however, this potential had not yet been examined in the context of a multiple risk factor model that would include different parenting styles and indicators of the material situation. Additionally, past research draws primarily from a limited set of geographical regions, often using convenience samples of children and adolescents. Objectives: The current study addresses these issues by examining (in)direct relationships between substance use (alcohol, marijuana, hard drugs), future orientation, different parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive), and family housing conditions, using a representative sample of Slovenian youth. Methods: Correlational and path analyses were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Additionally, possible mediating pathways were examined and evaluated. Results: Findings indicated a negative relation between future orientation and use of all substances. Next, future orientation fully mediated the effect of authoritative parenting on substance use. Finally, housing conditions had a direct and positive effect on authoritative parenting, a direct and an indirect effect on future orientation and only an indirect (through authoritative parenting and future orientation) effect on substance use. Conclusions: Results, besides indicating the relevance of future orientation in understanding substance use among youth, highlight the importance of authoritative parenting (that spans beyond childhood and adolescence) and housing conditions on the development of future orientation. In addition, findings highlight the importance of the material situation when examining antecedents of substance use among youth that might be missed if only direct effects are observed. Results are discussed in the context of the risk factor paradigm."

Materials & methods: We evaluated interactions according to type of treatment-add-on strategy: immunotherapy in combination versus standard chemotherapy-based regimens. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted and cumulated. Results: Seven trials (4278 patients) were included. The addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy-based regimens significantly increased OS (HR 0.74; p = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.61; p < 0.0001) compared with standard-of-care in NSCLC patients in first-line setting. Conclusion: Immunotherapy-based regimens constantly improved OS and PFS compared with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of nononcogene-addicted NSCLC.",Implications of differing attitudes and experiences between providers and persons with obesity: results of the national ACTION study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155994,Postgraduate medicine,2019 06 07,"Objective: Our aim was to explore how differing attitudes, expectations, and experiences among people with obesity (PwO) and healthcare providers (HCPs) might have an impact on effectively implementing current obesity treatment guidelines. Methods: Online surveys were conducted among 3,008 adult PwO (BMI≥30 by self-reported height and weight) and 606 HCPs. Results: PwO with weight loss ≥ 10% during the previous three years were more likely to have been diagnosed with obesity and to have discussed a weight loss plan with an HCP. However, only 21% believe HCPs have a responsibility to actively contribute to their obesity treatment. Further, HCPs tend not to effectively communicate the diagnosis of obesity, its nature as a serious and chronic disease, the full range of treatment options, and obesity's implications for health and quality of life. Regarding treatment goals, HCPs more often focus on BMI reduction, while PwO's goals focus on improved functioning, energy, and appearance. HCPs also tend to underestimate their patients' motivation to address their obesity. Twenty-eight percent of HCPs 'completely agreed' that losing weight was a high priority for PwO, whereas more than half of PwO 'completely agreed' that losing weight was a high priority for them. When asked how their HCP could better support them, PwO most often expressed a desire for helpful resources, as well as assistance with specific and realistic goal-setting to improve health. Conclusions: HCPs can more effectively implement obesity treatment guidelines by more clearly and proactively communicating with PwO about their diagnosis, health implications of obesity, desired treatment goals, and the full range of treatment options. HCPs should understand that most PwO believe that managing their disease is solely their own responsibility. HCPs can also encourage more effective conversations by better appreciating their patients' motivation and treatment goals.","The relationship between the functional movement screen, star excursion balance test and the Beighton score in dancers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155993,The Physician and sportsmedicine,2019 06 03,"Objectives: To determine the association between the Functional Movement Screen (FMS), Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and the Beighton Score (BS) in dancers with implications for performance and injury. Methods: The study was of cross-sectional design and included 47 female university dancers (age: 20.4 ± 0.7 years, height: 160.5 ± 5.8 cm; mass: 55.6 ± 4.8 kg). Participants completed the FMS and the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach components of the SEBT and hypermobility was assessed via the BS. Results: A fair significant correlation existed between FMS composite and total BS (r = 0.37, p = 0.01). For individual elements of the screening tools, there were 24 significant correlations between the FMS and the BS, 11 significant correlations between the FMS and SEBT and 4 significant correlations between the SEBT and BS. Conclusion: The FMS and the BS correlations highlighted the importance of the deep squat in functional movement and the relationship between FMS mobility elements and the BS. The significant correlation between the FMS and the BS may suggest that they capture similar information. The active straight leg raise and shoulder mobility measurements should be considered key elements to measure during screening.",Orbital cavernous haemangioma; profile and outcome of 76 patients managed surgically.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155992,Acta oto-laryngologica,2019 06 03,"Background: Orbital cavernous haemangioma (OCH) is one of the most common primary orbital tumours in adults. They can encroach on intraorbital or adjacent structures and be considered 'anatomically' malignant. Aims: To report a series of patients that were all managed surgically, with possible specificities and propose predictors of treatment outcome. Methods: We realised a hospital-based retrospective case review including data from 76 patient files. Results: The mean age was 37.8 years. Unilateral proptosis was observed in all patients. Visual loss was found in 32 patients (42.1%). Findings on eye examination included lagophthalmos (76.3%), blepharoptosis (21.1%), complications of corneal exposure (19.6%), strabismus (13.2%) and fundoscopic abnormalities (60.5%). Abnormal fundoscopy was significantly associated with decreased visual acuity (VA) (p < .001). Small tumours were predominant (65.8%) and size was associated with VA (correlation coefficient r = -0.5, p < .001). Surgery was mainly by lateral orbitotomy (94.7%), with early post-operative complications in 18 patients (23.7%). Multivariable analysis showed that tumour size, preoperative VA and abnormal fundoscopy were significantly associated with postoperative VA. Conclusion: Clinical and radiological profiles are consistent. Tumour size, preoperative VA, and abnormal fundoscopy seem to be important factors that could influence outcome expectations. Surgical management is still predominantly by open approaches. Severe complications remain rare.",Benefits of Acidifying Agents in Local Therapy of Diabetic Foot Ulcers Infected by Pseudomonas sp: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155991,The international journal of lower extremity wounds,2019 06 03,"Infections caused by Pseudomonas sp are difficult to resolve by antibiotics (ATBs) and local therapy. The aim of our pilot study was to assess the effect of different local agents-particularly acidifying solutions-on the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), eradication of pathogens, and economic costs related to DFU therapy. In this case study, we monitored 32 DFU patients infected by Pseudomonas species. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the local therapy provided: group 1 (n = 15)-modern local treatment; group 2 (n = 17)-acidifying antiseptic solutions. The study groups differed only with regard to ATB usage prior to enrolment in the study ( P = .004), but did not differ with regard to age, diabetes control, peripheral arterial disease, or microcirculation status. During the follow-up period, DFUs healed in 20% of cases in group 1, but there were no cases of healing in group 2 (NS). The length of ATB therapy, the number of new osteomyelitis, lower limb amputations, and the changes of DFUs status/proportions did not differ significantly between study groups. Pseudomonas was eradicated in 67% of cases in group 1 and in 65% of cases in group 2. The local treatment given to group 2 patients was associated with lower costs ( P < .0001). Conclusion. Acidifying agents had the same effect as modern healing agents on wound healing, the number of amputations, and the eradication of Pseudomonas. Moreover, therapy performed using acidifying solutions proved in our pilot study markedly cheaper.","Deformable image registration for radiation therapy: principle, methods, applications and evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155990,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2019 06 03,"Background: Deformable image registration (DIR) is increasingly used in the field of radiation therapy (RT) to account for anatomical deformations. The aims of this paper are to describe the main applications of DIR in RT and discuss current DIR evaluation methods. Methods: Articles on DIR published from January 2000 to October 2018 were extracted from PubMed and Science Direct. Our search was restricted to articles that report data obtained from humans, were written in English, and address DIR methods for RT. A total of 207 articles were selected from among 2506 identified in the search process. Results: At planning, DIR is used for organ delineation using atlas-based segmentation, deformation-based planning target volume definition, functional planning and magnetic resonance imaging-based dose calculation. In image-guided RT, DIR is used for contour propagation and dose calculation on per-treatment imaging. DIR is also used to determine the accumulated dose from fraction to fraction in external beam RT and brachytherapy, both for dose reporting and adaptive RT. In the case of re-irradiation, DIR can be used to estimate the cumulated dose of the two irradiations. Finally, DIR can be used to predict toxicity in voxel-wise population analysis. However, the evaluation of DIR remains an open issue, especially when dealing with complex cases such as the disappearance of matter. To quantify DIR uncertainties, most evaluation methods are limited to geometry-based metrics. Software companies have now integrated DIR tools into treatment planning systems for clinical use, such as contour propagation and fraction dose accumulation. Conclusions: DIR is increasingly important in RT applications, from planning to toxicity prediction. DIR is routinely used to reduce the workload of contour propagation. However, its use for complex dosimetric applications must be carefully evaluated by combining quantitative and qualitative analyses.","FeNO level and allergy status among school children in Terengganu, Malaysia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155989,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2019 06 03,"Background: Almost one third of the world population suffers from allergic conditions. Respiratory symptoms are common in Malaysian children but there are few studies on fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), inclusive of field clinical test for asthma among children in Malaysia. The aim was to provide insight on factors related to level of FeNO among students in Terengganu, Malaysia. Methods: In total, 487 randomly selected students from eight secondary schools participated (13-14 years old). A Standardized questionnaire was used to obtained information on doctors' diagnosed asthma, current asthma and respiratory symptoms. FeNO measurement and skin prick test (SPT to common allergen) were conducted. Results: The geometric mean FeNO was 16.7 ppb. Totally, 38.4% of students had elevated FeNO level (>20 ppb) and 40.3% had had positive SPT to house dust mites allergens (HDM), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p 1), Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f 1) or Felis domisticus (cat). Male gender, height, parental history of allergy, self-reported allergy, and atopy were associated with FeNO. In particular, a combination of sensitization to HDM or cat and elevated FeNO were associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma and self-reported allergy to food, pollen and cat. Conclusion: Asthma, respiratory symptoms and sensitization to HDM and cat are common among students and presence of elevated FeNO levels indicate ongoing airway inflammation.",High concentration of chemerin caused by ovarian hyperandrogenism may lead to poor IVF outcome in polycystic ovary syndrome: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155988,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 06 03,"A chronic low-grade inflammation state accounts for an important part of the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The adipose tissue derived cytokine chemerin has recently been proven to be a proinflammatory chemokine, but its mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS remains largely unresolved. From non-obese patients with and without PCOS, follicular fluid and granulosa cells were retrieved. The effect of testosterone on the expression of chemerin and its receptors was explored in granulosa cells. IVF outcomes in different groups based on FF-chemerin (chemerin in the follicular fluid) level were further compared. The concentration of FF-chemerin, and the mRNA expression of chemerin and its receptors in granulosa cells from PCOS were significantly higher than those from non-PCOS. FF-chemerin was positively correlative to total testosterone (TT) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the follicular fluid. Furthermore, testosterone upregulated the expression of chemerin and its receptors in vitro. The oocyte utilization rate and high-quality embryo rate were significantly decreased in the high FF-chemerin group. The upregulated chemerin levels in the ovary of PCOS patients, which may be caused by ovarian hyperandrogenism, may be a risk factor for oocyte maturation and embryo development. These findings may provide a basis for novel interventions to improve IVF outcomes.",Psychometric properties of the German Version of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-G): A factor analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155987,Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,2019 06 03,"Background: Activities of daily living (ADL) are crucial for children because they enable them to participate in everyday life. For the evaluation of children`s ADL performance, health professionals such as occupational therapists use standardized ADL assessments. To implement assessments into practice it is important that the score generated from an assessment can be viewed as a unidimensional measure. Aim: To investigate the factor structure of the German Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-G) in a sample of typically developing children and children with an impairment. Material and Methods: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with factor rotation was performed to assess the factor structure for the PEDI-G domains (self-care, mobility and social function) of the Functional Skills Scale and the Caregiver Assistance Scale. Results: 262 children (118 (45%) girls and 144 (55%) boys) participated in this study. Their mean age (SD) was 4 years (SD 1.91). Results suggest that the PEDI domains of the Functional Skills Scale and the Caregivers Assistance Scale can be used as unidimensional measures to evaluate child`s ability to perform activities of daily living. Conclusion: The results of this study support the use of the PEDI-G for research and practice in Austria, Germany and Switzerland."

We undertook a prospective survey including 153 premenopausal women with histological diagnosis of endometriosis. The Short Form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire comprising physical and mental component scales was used. Two groups of patients were distinguished: Group A (n = 42) with SF-12 scores above the median in both physical and mental scales; Group B (n = 111) with SF-12 scores below the median in either physical or mental scale. Group A was diagnosed and operated for endometriosis for the first time at an older age (30 vs. 26 years), had undergone more frequently a single surgical intervention (64% vs. 46%), was less affected by symptom or lesion recurrence and had reported less intense current pain symptoms than Group B. Having the first endometriosis surgery at a later age was an independent predictor of better health status (adjusted odds ratio 1.146 per year, 95% confidence interval 1.058-1.242) after accounting for the potential confounding effects of reoperation, pelvic pain and time elapsed since the first surgery. In conclusion, patients with endometriosis who had a single surgery at an older age have good symptom control and better quality of life (QoL).",Resilience and well-being after traumatic brain injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155974,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 06 03,"Purpose: This study examined the extent to which resilience is associated with well-being outcomes after traumatic brain injury, and whether those relationships are independent of global personality traits, such as affectivity. Materials and methods: Sixty-seven adults with complicated-mild to severe traumatic brain injury participated. Measures included the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Disability Rating Scale, SF-12 Health Survey, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Community Integration Measure. Results: Objective physical health and disability showed modest relation to resilience, indicating that adverse health conditions and disability decreased with increasing resilience. The three measures of subjective well-being showed modest-to-strong positive relation to resilience. These correlations between resilience and well-being generally remained significant after accounting for negative and positive affectivity. Results also suggest that the influence of resilience on well-being has a threshold effect: a greater influence on outcome among people with low or inadequate resilience than among people with average or high resilience. Conclusion: The experience of brain injury does not diminish the positive influence resilience may have on long-term well-being. Resilience may function as a buffer to trauma even in the challenging context of cognitive insult. Routine assessment of resilience might be beneficial to the rehabilitation team. Implications for rehabilitation Resilience is positively associated with subjective and objective well-being among adults with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury, and it appears to function among adults with traumatic brain injury similarly to adults without cognitive disabilities. Resilience overlaps with overarching trait personality constructs such as affectivity; yet, it has unique characteristics and unique value in understanding well-being. The adverse effects of low resilience show stronger influence on well-being than do the positive effects of high resilience. Routine assessment of resilience might be beneficial to the rehabilitation team in understanding patients and their families, especially in discharge planning, where beliefs about personal capabilities to rebound from adversity shape likely future behavior.","Inhaled salbutamol from aerolizer and diskus at different inhalation flows, inhalation volume and number of inhalations in both healthy subjects and COPD patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155973,Experimental lung research,2019 06 03,"The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the effect of inhalation-flow, inhalation-volume and number of inhalations on aerosol-delivery of inhaled-salbutamol from two different dry powder inhalers (DPIs) in both healthy-subjects and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Relative pulmonary-bioavailability and systemic-bioavailability of inhaled-salbutamol, delivered by Diskus and Aerolizer, was determined in 24-COPD patients and 24-healthy subjects. The healthy-subjects and the COPD-patients participated in the study for 7 days in which they received 4 study doses of 200 μg salbutamol (one slow-inhalation, two slow-inhalations, one fast-inhalation, and two fast-inhalations) in four alternative days with 24 hr washout period after each dose. Two urine-samples were collected from each study subjects. The first was provided 30 min post inhalation (USAL0.5), as an index of relative pulmonary-bioavailability, and the second was pooled to 24 hr post inhalation (USAL24), as an index of systemic-bioavailability. Fast-inhalation resulted in significantly higher USAL0.5 and USAL24 than slow-inhalation (p˂0.05) after one-inhalation in both healthy-subjects and COPD-patients but there was no significant difference between slow and fast-inhalation after two-inhalations. One-inhalation resulted in significantly higher USAL0.5 and USAL24 in healthy-subjects compared to COPD-patient at both slow and fast-inhalation (p˂0.05) except USAL0.5 with Diskus at slow-inhalation there was no significant difference. Also, two-inhalations resulted in significantly higher USAL0.5 and USAL24 compared to one-inhalation at slow-inhalation only (p˂0.05). No significant difference was found between Aerolizer and Diskus except in USAL0.5 of one slow-inhalation in both health-subjects and COPD-patients (p = 0.048 and 0.047, respectively). Device-formula relation is present at low inhalation-flow since Diskus resulted in significantly higher USAL0.5 and USAL24 in healthy-subjects compared to COPD-patient at slow inhalation than Aerolizer. It is essential to inhale-twice and as hard and deep as possible from each dose when using DPI especially with COPD-patients having poor inspiratory efforts such as elderly patients and children.",Beryllium inhibits apoptosis via mitochondria in beryllium-induced lung disease in the rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155972,Experimental lung research,2019 06 03,"Objective: We aimed to determine whether beryllium toxicity was associated with mitochondria apoptosis pathway in SD rats. Methods: Thirty-two SD rats were given an intratracheal instillation dose of 10 g/l beryllium oxide (0.5 ml per rat). Additional 32 rats were given an intratracheal instillation dose of 0.9% normal saline (0.5 ml per rat). The percentage of apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, the expression level of apoptosis related genes and proteins, including bcl2, Bax and Caspase-3 were detected. Results: The average of percentage of apoptosis, the expression of caspase-3, bax, and cytochrome c were decreased significantly in lung tissues from rats exposed to beryllium oxide compared to normal controls. The expression of bcl2 and ADP were increased significantly at 80 d after exposure. Conclusions: We conclude that inhibition of apoptosis by beryllium oxide involves mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in rat model of beryllium oxide-induced pulmonary disease.",Metformin protects red blood cells against rotenone induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155970,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2019 06 13,"Context: The anti-diabetic medicine metformin has been reported as an anti-ageing drug candidate as it mimics the benefits of caloric restriction and reduces ageing-related oxidative stress in various experimental organisms. Objective: We investigated the possible anti-oxidative role of metformin against rotenone-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in erythrocytes of Wistar rats. Rotenone is a well-known inducer of oxidative stress which leads to a cellular redox imbalance. Materials and methods: We have co-exposed the experimental rats with rotenone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and metformin (300 mg/kg, orally) for 30 days to investigate the protective effects of metformin on various rotenone-induced impaired oxidative stress biomarkers in rat erythrocytes. Results: We found that a significant alleviation in the levels of rotenone-induced pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant markers following exposure of metformin.

Participants were randomized to TST or COSTAR protocol. Our primary outcomes measured activity and participation after stroke: the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), and Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS). Results: Forty-four participants were randomized. The COSTAR group had an attrition rate of 50% and an average of 9.8 of 12 sessions were completed; the TST group had an attrition rate of 25% and an average of 10.7 sessions were completed. Generally both groups improved on the majority of primary and secondary outcomes. There is little evidence to support a beneficial effect of COSTAR over TST for improvement of primary measures of activity performance or secondary measures. Conclusion: Negligible findings may be attributed to an inadvertent treatment group equivalency. Further, the research design did not allow for adequate measurement of the effect of each intervention on participants' ability to generalize learned skills. Implications for rehabilitation Stroke rehabilitation is largely based upon the principles of task-specific training, which is associated with improvements in upper extremity motor performance; however, TST requires a heavy dosage and lacks generalization to untrained activities. Cognitive strategy use has been associated with improved generalization of treatment to untrained activities and novel contexts however, it is often not used in TST protocols. The results of this preliminary study found no clear advantage between task-specific training and strategy-adapted task-specific training on trained and untrained activities when both interventions targeted activity performance. Task-specific training, if focused at the activity performance level rather than the impairment reduction level, may have a stronger effect on improving in individual's ability to participate in everyday life activities even without the use of cognitive-strategies. Incorporating cognitive strategy-use into TST would likely produce the greatest effect on generalization and transfer of the treatment effects to other activities and contexts rather than solely on activity performance of trained activities.",Adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines and risk of hospitalizations for pneumonia and cerebro/cardiovascular events in the elderly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155968,Expert review of vaccines,2019 06 03,"Background: The higher effectiveness of MF59®-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (MF59-TIV) vs. nonadjuvanted TIV in preventing influenza-related hospitalizations was found considering few influenza seasons, local and heterogeneous settings. This study evaluated the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of MF59-TIV vs. nonadjuvanted TIV on the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia and cerebro/cardiovascular events across 15 consecutive influenza seasons. Research design and methods: Using Health Search Database, a case-control study was nested in a cohort of elderly vaccinated with MF59-TIV or TIV. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of hospitalizations potentially related to influenza in patients vaccinated with MF59-TIV or TIV. Results: Of 43,000 patients vaccinated with MF59-TIV (66.2%) and TIV (33.8%) for the first time, 103 cases of hospitalization for pneumonia or cerebro/cardiovascular events (0.11 per 1,000 person-weeks) during 15 influenza seasons were identified. The MF59-TIV was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalizations for pneumonia and cerebro/cardiovascular events vs. TIV [rVE: 39% (95% CI: 4-61%)]. Conclusions: In a 15-season cohort of elderly, MF59-TIV seems to reduce the risk of hospitalizations for pneumonia and cerebro/cardiovascular events when compared with nonadjuvanted TIV. Our findings support the recommendation for MF59-TIV in the elderly population.",The diagnostic performance of lysine(K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155967,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 06 03,"Objectives: Accumulating evidence show that histone demethylases play important roles in various types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the current study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of lysine(K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) in NSCLC. Methods: Serum KDM6B expression levels of 115 NSCLC patients and 88 healthy volunteers were detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between KDM6B and clinical characteristics was assessed by chi-square test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to evaluate diagnostic efficacy. Results: Serum KDM6B was significantly lower in NSCLC patients than that in healthy controls (p < .001). Moreover, low KDM6B expression was significantly associated with the high clinical stage (p = .028) and positive lymph node metastasis (p = .031). Besides, we found that the expression of KDM6B mRNA was also significantly different among healthy controls, NSCLC early stage and later stage patients (p < .05). ROC curve indicated that KDM6B could serve as a diagnostic marker for NSCLC with the cut-off value of 0.955. The AUC was 0.897 with a sensitivity of 79.5% and specificity of 84.3%. Conclusion: Down-regulation of KDM6B is significantly associated with aggressive progression of NSCLC and KDM6B may be a tool of early detection of NSCLC.",The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields combined with a static magnetic intramedullary implant on the repair of bone defects: A preliminary study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155966,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,2019 06 03,"There is a basic consensus on the biological effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on bone formation and bone reconstruction. PEMFs have been widely used in clinical treatment of osteoporosis, bone nonunion and delayed fracture healing. PEMFs is an intervention method of physiotherapy in vitro. In order to optimize the effect of PEMFs intervention, this study combined with the orthopedics clinic to construct a static magnetic intramedullary implant using NdFeB magnets as components. At the same time, it combines external-pulsed electromagnetic field to achieve locally targeted magnetic microenvironment. Rabbits were randomly divided into a combined magnetic field group (Implantation of static magnetic intramedullary implant in vivo combined with external-pulsed electromagnetic field), pulsed electromagnetic field group and control group. Micro CT and histopathology were used to estimate the effect of each group on bone formation and reconstruction in the early stage (5 weeks) of bone defect repair. Our data showed that the combined magnetic field group had relatively better new bone volume and trabecular structure in the bone defect area. The results showed that the combined magnetic field intervention method was feasible and had relatively preferably osteogenesis promoting effect. This study provides a new idea of magnetic field intervention, and also preliminarily verifies the feasibility of adding magnetic field to traditional orthopedic implant materials. However, the magnetic field strength of implanted materials still needs to be further refined.",MicroRNA-21 and microRNA-29a modulate the expression of collagen in dermal fibroblasts of patients with systemic sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155965,Autoimmunity,2019 06 03,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known candidates for modulating the dysregulated signaling pathways during fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of 16 miRNAs, which have previously been confirmed or predicted to target genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Primary culture of dermal fibroblasts was obtained from skin biopsies of diffused cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) patients and healthy controls. Expression of let-7a, miR-1, miR-15a, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-27b, miR-26a, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR29c, miR-141, miR-125a-5p, miR-193a-3p, and miR-200a were quantified by Real-time PCR. Functional analysis of microRNAs was performed using synthetic oligonucleotides. To further confirm the pro- or anti-fibrotic effects of miRNAs, normal fibroblasts were treated with 10 ng/mL of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β to generate an in vitro model of dermal fibrosis. miR-21 and miR-29a were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in both dcSSc and TGF-β-treated fibroblasts. We observed that restoration of miR-29a expression or blockade of miR-21 function negatively affected collagen production. COL1A1 expression in SSc fibroblasts is more sensitive to changes of miR-29a and miR-21 expression in compare to normal fibroblasts. miR-29a alone was effective to decrease TGF-β-induced collagen production in dermal fibroblasts. miR-21 and TGF-β had synergistic effects on induction of collagen production. However, neither miR-21 nor miR-29a affected alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in the presence or absence of TGF-β in dermal fibroblasts. miR-21 and miR-29a as pro- and anti-fibrotic miRNAs modulate collagen production in an opposing manner. Focusing on miR-21 and miR-29s as therapeutic targets would be effective in patients with SSc or other fibrotic diseases which show aberrant expression of collagen expression."

This study evaluated the effect of broccoli sprout extract (BSE) supplementation on blood histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, prostate RNA gene expression, and tissue biomarkers (histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac), HDAC3, HDAC6, Ki67, and p21). A total of 98 men scheduled for prostate biopsy were allocated into either BSE (200 µmol daily) or a placebo in our double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We used nonparametric tests to evaluate the differences of blood HDAC activity and prostate tissue immunohistochemistry biomarkers between treatment groups. Further, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on the prostate biopsies and identified 40 differentially expressed genes correlated with BSE treatment, including downregulation of two genes previously implicated in prostate cancer development, AMACR and ARLNC1. Although urine and plasma SFN isothiocyanates and individual SFN metabolites were statistically higher in the treatment group, our results did not show a significant difference in HDAC activity or prostate tissue biomarkers. This study indicates BSE supplementation correlates with changes in gene expression but not with several other prostate cancer biomarkers. More research is required to fully understand the chemopreventive effects of BSE supplementation on prostate cancer.",Ex vivo biofilm-forming ability of dermatophytes using dog and cat hair: an ethically viable approach for an infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155952,Biofouling,2019 06 14,"The aim of this study was to establish an ex vivo model for dermatophyte biofilm growth, using hair from dogs and cats. Strains of Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. tonsurans were assessed for in vitro and ex vivo biofilm production. All T. mentagrophytes and T. tonsurans isolates and 8/12 M. canis and 1/7 M. gypseum isolates formed biofilms in vitro, while all tested isolates presented biofilm growth on ex vivo models. T. mentagrophytes and M. canis formed more homogeneous and better-structured biofilms with greater biomass production on cat hair but T. tonsurans formed more biofilm on dog hair. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated fungal hyphae colonizing and perforating the hair shaft, abundant fungal conidia, biofilm extracellular matrix and biofilm water channels.

However, its role in gastric cancer is sparingly known. This study ensures the standardization of gastric cancer by the induction of N-nitroso N-methyl Urea (MNU) and to determine the role of the aqueous extract of ginger (AGE) in MNU-induced gastric cancer in albino Wistar rats. Accordingly, the anticancer potential of AGE and its possible mode of action were assessed on rats exposed to MNU, by various biochemical and molecular assays. As evidenced by the extent of lipid peroxidation, gastrin levels and histopathological sections in MNU-induced cancerous lesions at 8 wk which was stabilized at 16 wk confirming the induction of gastric carcinoma by the chemical carcinogen. Further, results revealed that AGE alleviated the oxidative stress as evidenced by the stomach antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, GPx, and GR), markers of oxidative stress (TRx, GRx) and Gastrin, a specific marker for gastric cancer and a decreased level of pro-inflammatory markers (NF-kB, TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2) which was further confirmed by histopathological analysis. AGE is responsible to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation related to gastric cancer and could be used as a potential dietary intervention in gastric cancer therapy.",Protective Effect of Tunisian Flaxseed Oil against Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155950,Nutrition and cancer,2019 06 03,"The aims of this study are to investigate the preventive effect of flaxseed oil (FO) on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Thirty adult male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were randomly divided into three groups. The control group (G1) received no treatment, the group (G2) received only intratracheally BLM, and the group (G3) received FO (2 mL/kg body weight) once a day for 60 days + BLM (4 mg/kg body weight ""bw""). Our results demonstrated that FO protected against BLM-induced PF, by increasing proline, fructose, glucose, glyceride, choline, lactate, and malate metabolites in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Balf) which are involved in anti-inflammatory reactions. Also, FO-treatment reduced the score of fibrosis and the inflammatory index and revealed a decrease in tumor growth factor beta (TGFβ) density in alveoli, inflammatory infiltrate and fibrocytes, comparatively to the BLM group. As well, our data demonstrated that acute BLM-induced fibrosis was accompanied by an oxidative stress in lung tissue as assessed by an increase of lipid peroxidation as well as antioxidant enzyme activities depletion such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The FO treatment reversed all disturbances of BLM-induced oxidative stress parameters, and increased fatty acids levels promoting anti-inflammatory reactions especially in erythrocytes (linoleic, α-linolenic, docosapentaenoic acids).",Dorsal Wrist Extrinsic Carpal Ligament Injury Exacerbates Volar Radiocarpal Instability After Intra-Articular Distal Radius Fracture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155949,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,Volar radiocarpal instability is often seen after loss of fixation of volar lunate facet fragments.

We aimed to discover themes as to how NSCLC patients and caregivers express and cope with anxiety. Design: Semi-structured interviews of patient-caregiver dyads (N = 21), coded using NVivo Software. Main Outcome Measures: Open-ended questions on anxiety mutuality, giving or receiving care, communication, and the most difficult aspects of having or caring for someone with Stage IV NSCLC. Results: Analyses revealed that patients and caregivers were linked psychologically, co-experiencing symptoms of distress or coping, rising and falling together. Shared patient and caregiver themes emerged of cognitive, behavioural and physiological manifestations of anxiety and coping mechanisms. Conclusions: Patient and caregiver expressions of anxiety and coping methods mapped onto the cognitive-behavioural model, implying potential use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address these issues. This expands understanding of symptoms and coping strategies in NSCLC, explores patient-caregiver interaction, and confirms the need for future clinical intervention. Future research should focus on development and dissemination of CBT-based dyadic interventions addressing anxiety in NSCLC patients and caregivers.",Histological Study of The Healing of Traumatic Tympanic Membrane Perforation After Vivosorb and Epifilm Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155945,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",2019 06 03,Untreated traumatic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) may lead to permanent perforations and hearing loss.

Presence of noise in the subset of descriptors reduces the quality of predictions. A complete set is considered as perfect when it does not include irrelevant or redundant elements. This paper reports complete sets of descriptors used to develop QSPR models for 1786 13C NMR chemical shifts (δC parameters) of carbon atoms in 125 diverse chemical compounds. PBE1PBE/6-311G(2d,2p) and B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis sets were used for quantum chemistry calculations after the molecular structures were optimized with semi-empirical AM1 and B3LYP/6-31G(d). The two complete sets consisting of magnetic shielding elements (σXX, σYY, σZZ) and the chemical shift principal values (σ11, σ22, σ33) were used as the inputs for support vector machine (SVM) models of δC parameters. The four SVM models obtained have the mean root mean square (rms) errors of about 4.5-4.6 ppm. The results suggest that SVM models are accurate and acceptable compared with previous models, although our models are based on a relatively large set of compounds.

Since June 2015, HHS has appeared in many provinces in China. The disease has spread from broilers to laying hens, breeders and cherry valley ducks, seriously endangering the healthy of poultry industry in China. In July 2016, an infectious disease was noticed in a goose farm in Jinan, Shandong Province, China and hydropericardium was the main finding in post portem investigations. In the actual study, we isolated a FAdV-4 strain from the livers of naturally infected goslings and designated it as SDJN. We first evaluated its pathogenicity by inoculating Taizhou geese at 10, 20, and 30 days of age with 10-7.15EID50 /0.2 ml doses of the SDJN strain in 1 mL allantoic fluid via subcutaneous injection or oral infection, respectively. Clinical symptoms and pericardial effusion appeared in geese infected subcutaneously at 10 days of age, whereas 20- and 30-day-old geese were not susceptible to FAdV-4. The results of real-time PCR showed that the replication ability of FAdV-4 in geese correlated with the age. Furthermore, results from clinical chemistry showed that FAdV-4 damaged the liver and kidney in geese and the results paralleled viral load and gross lesions. Consequently, FAdV-4 was pathogenic in geese, and the pathogenicity was related with age and mode of infection. This study is the first experimental infection of FAdV-4 in geese, which will provide a basis for further understanding of the disease.",Endophthalmitis after dropless (Tri-Moxi injection) cataract surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155929,European journal of ophthalmology,2019 06 03,A case of endophthalmitis after dropless cataract surgery with intravitreal Tri-Moxi associated with severe vision loss.,"Perceived mattering to family and friends, self-esteem, and well-being.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155928,"Psychology, health & medicine",2019 06 03,"This research examined the construct of perceived mattering, defined as the individual perception of being important for other people, and its relationship with self-esteem and well-being.

Perceived mattering was found to mediate the relationship between self-esteem and well-being. Notably, perceived mattering to family and friends and self-esteem - even though significantly interrelated - were found to differently contribute to individuals' well-being. Overall, these research findings confirm that perceived mattering should receive greater attention as a relevant psychosocial construct, with significant implications for individuals' general functioning. From a practical viewpoint, besides self-esteem, interventions to improve individuals' well-being might focus on the perception of mattering, which was found to be a more direct predictor of such a positive outcome.",Downregulation of WW domain-containing oxidoreductase leads to tamoxifen-resistance by the inactivation of Hippo signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155927,"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2019 06 03,"Understanding the molecular pathways leading to the development of tamoxifen-resistance is an important research focus as acquired tamoxifen-resistance is the main cause of death in patients with benign primary prognosis.

A very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) was identified in those samples through molecular and pathogenicity studies and designated 1/chicken/USA/1054NY/18. Phylogenetic analyses of the hypervariable VP2 nucleotide sequence region indicated that this strain belonged to genogroup 3 which comprises the vvIBDV. Partial sequence data of the VP1 gene indicated this virus also had a VP1 typical of vvIBDV. While vvIBDV have previously been identified in the United States in California and Washington State, the 1054NY vvIBDV was most closely related to isolates from Ethiopia, suggesting it is a new introduction into the U.S. The 1054NY vvIBDV was used to challenge four-week old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) layer chicks where it caused 100% morbidity and 68.7% mortality within four days. Upon necropsy, gross pathological findings in infected SPF birds included small yellowish colored bursas, some with hemorrhages on the serosal and mucosal surfaces. Microscopic lesions included inflammation, severe lymphocyte necrosis, atrophy of the follicles and follicular depletion of lymphocytes. Research Highlights: A very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) was detected in a pullet flock in New York state USA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the vvIBDV VP2 gene indicates it is not related to previous US vvIBDV isolates and appears to be a new introduction into the US.

However, translation of CaMKII inhibition has been limited by the need for selective CaMKII inhibition in cardiomyocytes. Here we tested the hypothesis that CaMKII inhibition using a cardiomyocyte-targeted gene therapy strategy would suppress arrhythmia in CPVT mouse models.","Determination of natural radionuclides and some metal concentrations in human tooth samples in the Rize province, Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155923,International journal of environmental health research,2019 06 03,"The main purpose of this study was to identify the concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides (226Ra, 232Th and 40K) and some metals (Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd) in tooth samples collected from humans living in the Rize province of Turkey.

Other anatomical structures, such as appendix, bladder, Meckel's diverticulum, ectopic testis, stomach and gynaecological organs are extremely unusual. A 48-year-old woman presented with intense right groin pain over 48 hours. Her past medical history revealed periodical moderate right groin pain coincident with her menstrual cycles, usually self-limited. No abdominal symptoms or fever were present. On physical examination, an incarcerated right femoral hernia was suspected. Subsequently abdominal ultrasound revealed a right femoral hernia containing an echogenic structure with conserved vascularisation. The patient underwent an emergency surgery. During the procedure the right fallopian tube and several small cysts were discovered as the hernia sac contents. As no ischaemic signs were observed, and the sac was sutured and reduced. Femoral hernioplasty was accomplished with polypropylene mesh. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged within 24 hours.

To test for potential competition disparities due a single category of athletes, this study aimed to compare competitive and technical-tactical performance in visually impaired judo athletes with different degrees of visual impairment. The authors analyzed 340 judo matches from the 2012 and 2016 Paralympic Games. The scores, penalties, efficiency index, and types of medals were examined, as well as the technical variation and temporal structure. The main finding was that blind judo athletes presented lower scores (p < .05; effect size [ES] = 0.43-0.73), medals (p < .05), and efficiency (p < .05; ES = 0.40-0.73); different patterns of play; and a shorter time to lose than partially sighted athletes (p = .027; ES = 0.10-0.14). However, the penalties were similar between classes (p > .05; ES = 0.07-0.14). The odds ratio of a winning medal was 3.5-8 times less in blind athletes than in partially sighted athletes (p < .01). In conclusion, blind judo athletes presented lower competitive and technical-tactical performance than athletes with some residual functional vision. These findings provide support for the development of new evidence-based criteria for judo classification based on vision impairment.",A rare case of thoracic spinal intradural extramedullary enterogenous cyst with acute onset: case report and literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155903,Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,2019 06 12,"The intraspinal enterogenous cyst, also called an neurenteric cyst, is a rare congenital disease.

He also reported a two-week hospital admission more than 20 years ago for right iliac fossa pain, which was managed conservatively. Computed tomography showed a fistulous tract extending from the bladder with an unclear connection to the bowel. Cystoscopy confirmed the presence of a vesical fistula and biopsy of the tract confirmed colonic mucosa. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was negative. A cystogram was requested as an outpatient procedure and the patient was discharged after antibiotic treatment. A few days after discharge the patient was readmitted as an emergency to critical care for severe hyperchloraemic hypokalaemic acidosis and a Glasgow Coma Score of 6/15. He was intubated and ventilated and his metabolic derangement was treated. As soon as his conditions improved, he underwent emergency laparotomy, which revealed the presence of a fistula between the caecal fundus and the bladder. The fistula was repaired and the patient recovered swiftly and completely and was discharged on postoperative day 5. At 12-month follow up the patient was completely symptoms-free, his bowel habits were normal and he has not had any urinary infection.

Important biological alterations are characteristic for the elderly subjects, which have effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the pharmaceuticals. Gradually decreased kidney function may demand the modification of the administration of the pharmaceuticals. Certain pharmaceuticals and drug-interactions are potentially dangerous for this population. Therefore several factors have to be taken into account in conjunction with the therapy of elderly patients including co-morbidities, cognitive function and the social state. At the same time, the risk-benefit ratio of the pharmaceuticals is the worst among elderly patients with pharmaceutical therapy including polypragmasy. Thus, it is inevitable for the development of geriatric pharmacotherapy that the physiologic alteration of elderly has to be taken into account not only in the daily practice but also during the development and formulation of a pharmaceutical. The present paper gives an overview of the most important factors influencing the pharmacotherapy of the elderly.

There is a need of proven effective drug prevention programs. Aim: The aim of our study was to analyze the efficiency of the Hungarian Police's DADA school-drug prevention program. Method: The research program was carried out by a standard questionnaire at Apáczai Csere János Primary School in Pécs and Kodolányi János Primary School in Pécsvárad. Results: After analyzing the participating students' answers, the results showed that the rate of those, who ""know everything"" about drugs, increased from 27% to 37.3%, and of those, who did ""not know anything"", decreased from 5.6% to 1.6% (p<0.001). Regarding self-efficiency, the DADA program did not show any significant change (p = 0.364). However, less than 60% of the students agreed the statements: ""I have learned a lot from the trainings"" and ""I received answers to several questions that I had been interested in earlier.""

Patients with malignant diseases may largely benefit from these therapies, which may result in long-term remission even in the most therapy-resistant tumour types. Differences in the mode of action of the various agents may result in varying side-effect profiles. In addition to organ-specific side-effects, overt autoimmune syndromes may also develop. Our current view of oncotherapy has changed as these mostly immune-mediated side-effects highly differ from those observed previously during the administration of traditional anti-tumour compounds. These side-effects should be carefully characterized and differentiated from infections or the progression of the underlying malignancy. Fortunately, several recent recommendations have become available on the management of immune-mediated adverse events due to checkpoint-inhibitor therapy.

Aim: The goal of our study was to examine the nutritional status of our population aged over 40, and its relationship with the severity of the disease. Method: We conducted a retrospective study at the National Korányi Institute of Pulmonology in 2017. Pulmonary function and anthropometric data were obtained from the electronic health record system. Inclusion criteria were age over 40 and the diagnosis of COPD. Severity of disease was assessed by forced expiration volume and categorized according to GOLD stages. We used SPSS Statistics V22.0 for data analysis. Results: The mean age of participants was 66; 49.3% were men, 50.7% were women. Average BMI was 27.14 kg/m², with values comprising cachexia and severe obesity. According to the FEV1%pred results of the 3236 patients, 30% fell in the GOLD I, 40% in the GOLD II, 23% in the GOLD III, and 7% in the GOLD IV categories. Pearson coefficient found positive correlation between FEV1 and nutritional status (H = 0.2297, r = 0.1401), specifically between severity of cachexia and severity of disease. The analysis of variance showed significant correlation between severity of disease and nutritional status; patients with higher BMI had better pulmonary function. Conclusion: Malnutrition had an adverse effect on pulmonary functions and performance of respiratory muscles, whereas higher BMI had a positive effect on FEV1. Our results suggest that BMI could be used as a lung function prognostic indicator for COPD patients.

We isolated 14 new bioactive metabolites, nine of which are first disclosed here. Thirty-two specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified. BGCs were correlated to some of the new compounds by heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes. Some of the compounds were found after one year of fermentation. By comparing BGCs from A. pyridodomos with those from 68 previously sequenced Onygenales fungi, we delineate a large biosynthetic potential. Most of these biosynthetic pathways are specific to Onygenales fungi and have not been found elsewhere. Family level specificity and conservation of biosynthetic gene content are evident within Onygenales.

Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain barrier integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules).

A major limitation to healing is lack of bone blood flow, which is impaired by physical disruption of intraskeletal and/or periosteal vasculature by the fracture. Thus, pharmacological interventions are needed to improve osseous blood flow, thereby accelerating bone fracture closure. Relaxin is secreted by the ovary and circulates in rodents and humans during pregnancy. Because relaxin might benefit bone fracture healing by stimulating angiogenesis, vasculogenesis (and potentially osteogenesis) through mobilization and activation of bone marrow progenitor cells, and by increasing blood flow via vasodilation, we investigated whether relaxin administration would accelerate closure of a calvarial defect in mice. Whether administered systemically by osmotic pump or locally by collagen scaffolds for ~2 week period after lesioning, relaxin did not accelerate bone healing. Despite implementing relaxin doses that reached plasma concentrations spanning the physiological to supraphysiological range, testing the closure of two different sizes of calvarial lesions, allowing for different intervals of time from instigation of cranial lesion to euthanasia, and investigating mice of different ages, we did not observe a significant benefit of relaxin in bone lesion healing. Nor did we observe stimulation of blood vessel formation in the bone lesion by the hormone. An incidental finding was that relaxin appeared to enhance trabecular bone growth in an uninjured control bone (femur). Although the results of this study were not supportive of a therapeutic benefit for relaxin on calvarial defect closure, future investigation is needed employing different animal species and experimental models of bone fracture.",The roles of spatial frequency in category-level visual search of real-world scenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155857,PsyCh journal,2019 06 03,"Visual object recognition appears to be effortless and virtually instantaneous for humans. A number of previous investigations have suggested that visual perception follows a coarse-to-fine processing sequence in which low-spatial-frequency (LSF) information provides a coarse representation of an object for an initial guess and guides the fine processing of the object based on high-spatial-frequency (HSF) information. A category-level visual search of real-world scenes shares many aspects of processing mechanisms with object recognition. However, a key difference between them is the target template in visual search that is generally known in advance. In the present study, we investigated the role of spatial frequency information in the category-level visual search of real-world scenes with three behavioral experiments. In Experiment 1, we showed that the representation of the target template, which is held in short-term memory, had biased attention more towards LSF information than HSF information in the probe trials. In Experiments 2 and 3, we further demonstrated that the near-threshold LSF information could implicitly facilitate object recognition compared with HSF information, thereby providing supporting evidence that the LSF information of the target template implicitly facilitates target recognition and search performance. These findings support the role of the coarse-to-fine principle in rapid visual search performance of real-world scenes.",A Scenario Approach to the Simonshaven Case.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155856,Topics in cognitive science,2019 06 03,"In this paper, we present a scenario approach and apply it to the Simonshaven case.

Their underlying mechanism is the generation of ultrasound or cavitation from the interaction of short optical pulses with endogenous dyes or targeted contrast agents. Among the latter, gold nanorods are outstanding candidates, but their use has mainly been reported for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatments. Conversely, much less is still known about their value as a precision tool for photomechanical manipulations, such as to impart local damage with high spatial resolution through the expansion and collapse of microbubbles. Here, we address the feasibility of gold nanorods exhibiting a distribution of surface plasmon resonances between about 900 to above 1100 nm as a contrast agent for photoacoustic theranostics. After testing their cytotoxicity and cellular uptake, we discuss their photostability and use to mediate cavitation and the photomechanical destruction of targeted cells. We find that the choice of a plasmonic band peaking around 1064 nm is key to enhance the translational potential of this approach. With respect to the standard alternative of 800 nm, at 1064 nm relevant regulations on optical exposure are less restrictive and the photonic technology is more mature.

These are HLA antigens to which the patient never made antibodies, determined by extensive laboratory testing. AM patients have superior long-term graft survival compared to highly sensitized patients in regular allocation. Here, we questioned whether the AM program also results in lower rejection rates. From the PROCARE cohort, consisting of all Dutch kidney transplants 1995-2005, we selected deceased donor single transplants with minimum one HLA mismatch and determined the cumulative 6-month rejection incidence for patients in AM or regular allocation. Additionally, we determined the effect of minimal matching criteria of one HLA-B plus one HLA-DR, or two HLA-DR antigens on rejection incidence. AM patients showed significantly lower rejection rates than highly immunized patients in regular allocation, comparable to non-sensitized patients, independent of other risk factors for rejection. Contrasting to highly sensitized patients in regular allocation, minimal matching criteria did not affect rejection rates in AM patients. Allocation based on acceptable antigens leads to relatively low risk transplants for highly sensitized patients with rejection rates similar to non-immunized individuals.

Triple negative breast cancer is characterized by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), high histologic grade, and high mitotic rate. Chemotherapy remains the primary systemic treatment, with international guidelines supporting the use of single-agent taxanes (with or without bevacizumab) or anthracyclines as first-line therapy, with a median overall survival of approximately 18 months or less. Given the suboptimal outcomes with chemotherapy, new targeted therapies for advanced TNBC are urgently needed. This review summarizes the current status of treatment, and future challenges of using new treatment options for advanced TNBC, such as poly-adenosine-diphosphate-ribose-polymerase inhibitors (olaparib and talazoparib) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg atezolizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.",Live donor liver transplantation for type 1 tyrosinemia: An analysis of 15 patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155831,Pediatric transplantation,2019 06 03,"Type 1 tyrosinemia is a rare metabolic disorder of the tyrosine degradation pathway. Due to the rarity of the disease, the best evidence literature offers is limited to guidelines based on expert opinions and optimal treatment is still a debate. LT serves as a definitive treatment of the defective metabolic pathway in the liver along with other serious disease manifestations such as LF and HCC. Nitisinone is a relatively new agent that is currently recommended for the medical management of the disease. Its mechanism of action is well understood, and efficacy is well established when started presymptomatically. This study aims to evaluate outcomes of 15 patients with type 1 tyrosinemia who underwent LT in nitisinone era and discuss its effect on prevention of HCC. A LT database of 1037 patients was reviewed. Data from 15 patients with type 1 tyrosinemia were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients except one were treated with nitisinone prior to LT. Most common indications for LT were LF and suspicious nodules. Seven patients had HCC. Mortality rate was 20% (n = 3). Nitisinone treatment has opened new horizons in the management of type 1 tyrosinemia, but LT still remains the only option for the patients developing LF and in the event of HCC.

One attractive application of clean hydrogen is to be utilized as a fuel in hydrogen fuel cells. Due to the better stability of earth-abundant electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions and the emerging hydroxide-exchange membranes, hydrogen fuel cells utilizing alkaline electrolytes become an appealing alternative to proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline condition has hindered its rapid commercialization. Herein, we report a low-cost Ni/NiO/C catalyst with abundant Ni/NiO interfacial sites as a competent HOR electrocatalyst in alkaline media. Ni/NiO/C exhibits an HOR activity one order of magnitude higher than that of its parent Ni/C counterpart measured under the same conditions. Moreover, Ni/NiO/C also shows better stability and CO tolerance than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media which renders it a very promising HOR electrocatalyst for hydrogen fuel cell applications. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to shed light on the enhanced HOR performance of Ni/NiO/C and our DFT results indicate that both hydrogen and hydroxide achieve optimal binding energies at the Ni/NiO interface, resulting from the balanced electronic and oxophilic effects at the Ni/NiO interface.",Development of a non-lethal hydrogen peroxide treatment for surveillance of Gyrodactylus salaris on trout farms and its application to testing wild salmon populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155828,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 06 03,This study documents the development of a non-lethal sampling method to recover gyrodactylid parasites from large numbers of fish that will underpin an improved surveillance strategy for Gyrodactylus salaris. A review of published literature identified over 80 compounds that have previously been tested against gyrodactylids or closely related parasite species. Five safe and relatively fast acting compounds were selected for testing to determine their efficiency in removing gyrodactylids from host fish in small-scale aquaria trials using three-spined stickleback infected with Gyrodactylus gasterostei as a model host-parasite system. The most effective compound was hydrogen peroxide; short duration exposure (3 minutes) achieved a parasite detection sensitivity of 80-89%. This article is protected by copyright.

The synthetic approach for title compounds was started from the reaction between 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivatives and Meldrum's acid for produce corresponding coumarin-3-carboxylic acids. Then, amidation of the latter compounds with 2-morpholinoethylamine or N-(3-aminopropyl)morpholine led to the formation of the compounds 5a-l. The in vitro inhibition screen against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) revealed that most of the synthesized compounds had potent AChE inhibitory while their BuChE inhibitions are moderate to weak. Among them, propylmorpholin derivative 5g bearing an unsubstituented coumarin moiety and ethylmorpholine derivative 5d bearing a 6-bromocoumarin moiety showed the most activity against AChE and BuChE, respectively. The inhibitory activity of the compound 5g against AChE was 1.78 times more than that of rivasetigmin and anti-BuChE activity of compound 5d is approximately same with rivasetigmin. Kinetic and docking studies confirmed the dual binding site ability of compound 5g to inhibit AChE.","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Liver Fibrosis Score and Cognitive Function in Middle-Aged Adults: The Framingham Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155826,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 06 14,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and has been recently related to brain health.

Electronic structure examinations support large spin delocalization to the oxygen atom. Selected oxo transfer reactions indicate ambiphilic reactivity of the Ir=O moiety. Calorimetric and computational examination of the HAT reveal a BDFEIrO-H that is sufficient for hydrogen atom abstraction towards C-H bonds and small contributions from entropy and spin-orbit coupling to the HAT thermochemistry.

We investigated the assumption that either multiple drought years occurring during a short period (multi-year droughts), or droughts occurring during the recovery period from previous drought (compounded droughts), are detrimental to subsequent growth. There is evidence that drought responses may vary among populations of widespread species, leading us to examine regional differences in responses of the conifer Pinus ponderosa to historic drought frequency in the western United States. More frequent drought conditions incurred additional growth declines and shifts in growth-climate sensitivities in the years following drought relative to single drought events, with ""triple droughts"" being worse than ""double droughts."" Notably, prediction skill was not strongly reduced when ignoring compounded droughts, a consequence of the temporally comprehensive formulation of our stochastic antecedent model that accounts for the climatic memory of tree growth. We argue that incorporating drought-induced temporal variability in tree growth sensitivities can aid inference gained from statistical models, where more simplistic models could overestimate the severity of drought legacies. We also found regional differences in response to repeated drought, and suggest plastic post-drought sensitivities and climatic memory may represent beneficial physiological adjustments in interior regions. Within-species variability may thus mediate forest responses to increasing drought frequency under future climate change, but experimental approaches using more species are necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie drought legacy effects on tree growth.

Future research on the effectiveness of these programs may benefit from an improved understanding of relationships between paraspinal muscle size and lumbosacral stability. The aim of this retrospective, secondary analysis, cross-sectional study was to test the following hypotheses related to CT measures: (a) transverse paraspinal muscle area ratios differ between hip flexion and extension, (b) lumbosacral angle and lumbosacral range of motion differ by lumbosacral angle measurement technique, and (c) transverse paraspinal muscle area ratios are correlated with CT measures of lumbosacral stability (parasagittal and parasagittal oblique foraminal area changes) regardless of hip position and with lumbosacral range of motion within each hip position. Lumbosacral CT scans in hip flexion and extension were retrieved from a previous prospective study of military working Labrador Retrievers. A single observer performed triplicate measurements of transverse paraspinal muscle area ratios, parasagittal foraminal area, and parasagittal oblique foraminal area for each hip position and another observer independently performed triplicate measurements of lumbosacral angle and lumbosacral range of motion at L7-S1 using two published techniques. Thirty-nine dogs were analyzed and significant differences were identified between hip flexion and extension for all mean transverse paraspinal muscle area ratio values (P ≤ .05). Mean lumbosacral angles also significantly differed between the published techniques in both hip flexion and extension. When comparing mean lumbosacral range of motion values, one of the published techniques produced significantly smaller values. No significant correlation was found between transverse paraspinal muscle area ratios and parasagittal foraminal area changes, parasagittal oblique foraminal area changes, or lumbosacral range of motion.

The method was tested to determine whether it is a more reliable alternative to using the length of stay and marginal mark-up allocation method. The method developed used data from a Polish specialist hospital. The study involved 4,026 patients grouped into nine diagnosis-related groups (DRG). The study methodology involved a three stage approach: (a) identification of correlates of patient costs, (b) a comparison of the costs calculated using the clinical value unit method with the alternative methods: length of stay and marginal mark-up methods, and (c) an estimation of the cost homogeneity of the DRGs. The study showed that length of stay cost allocation method may underestimate the proportion of indirect costs in patient costs for a short in-patient stay and overestimate the cost for the patients with a long stay. The total costs estimated using the marginal mark-up method were higher than those estimated with length of stay method. For most surgical procedures, the mean indirect costs are higher using clinical value unit method than when using length of stay or marginal mark-up method. In all medical procedure cases, the mean indirect costs calculated using the clinical value unit method are in the range between marginal mark-up and length of stay method. We also show that in all DRGs except one, that the coefficient of homogeneity for clinical value unit is higher than for length of stay or marginal mark-up method. We conclude that the clinical value unit method of cost allocation is a more precise and reliable alternative than the other methods.","Kaempferitrin inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and ameliorates inflammation in human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155798,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 06 03,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with the aberrant activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Kaempferitrin is a natural flavonoid glycoside that possesses anti-inflammatory bioactivity. However, the effect of kaempferitrin on RA has not yet been revealed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of kaempferitrin on human RA-FLS MH7A cell line. We found that kaempferitrin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of MH7A cells. Kaempferitrin decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and MMP-3 in MH7A cells. Moreover, kaempferitrin blocked the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Furthermore, treatment with kaempferitrin decreased paw thickness and arthritis scores, and reduced the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. In conclusion, kaempferitrin inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and ameliorated inflammation of RA-FLS by suppressing the NF-κB and Akt/mTOR pathways.",Tailoring the Mechanical Properties of 3D Microstructures Using Visible Light Post-Manufacturing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155785,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 06 03,"The photochemistry of anthracene, a new class of photoresist for direct laser writing, is used to enable visible-light-gated control over the mechanical properties of 3D microstructures post-manufacturing. The mechanical and viscoelastic properties (hardness, complex elastic modulus, and loss factor) of the microstructures are measured over the course of irradiation via dynamic mechanical analysis on the nanoscale. Irradiation of the microstructures leads to a strong hardening and stiffening effect due to the generation of additional crosslinks through the photodimerization of the anthracene functionalities. A relationship between the loss of fluorescence-a consequence of the photodimerization-and changes in the mechanical properties is established. The fluorescence thus serves as a proxy read-out for the mechanical properties. These photoresponsive microstructures can potentially be used as ""mechanical blank slates"": their mechanical properties can be readily adjusted using visible light to serve the demands of different applications and read out using their fluorescence.",Cascade sign: A guide to sonographic confirmation of central venous catheter position.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155784,Paediatric anaesthesia,2019 06 03,"Central Venous Cannulation is a crucial skill for an anesthesiologist.

These studies have consistently implicated variation in the immune gene, human leucocyte antigen (HLA), to be associated with lymphoma risk. In this review, we summarize the historical and recent evidence of HLA in both lymphoma aetiology and survival. The recent momentum in uncovering HLA associations has been propelled by the conduct of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has permitted the evaluation of imputed HLA alleles in much larger sample sizes than historically feasible with allelotyping studies. Based on the culmination of smaller HLA typing studies and larger GWAS, we now recognize several HLA associations with Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and their subtypes. Although other genetic variants have also been implicated with lymphoma risk, it is notable that HLA associations have been reported in every NHL and HL subtype evaluated to date. Both HLA class I and class II alleles have been linked with NHL and HL risk. It is notable that the associations identified are largely specific to each lymphoma subtype. However, pleiotropic HLA associations have also been observed. For example, rs10484561, which is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*01:01˜DQA1*01:01˜DQB1*05:01, has been implicated in increased FL and DLBCL risk. Opposing HLA associations across subtypes have also been reported, such as for HLA-A*01:01 which is associated with increased risk of EBV-positive cHL but decreased risk of EBV-negative cHL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small cell lymphoma. Due to extensive linkage disequilibrium and allele/haplotypic variation across race/ethnicities, identification of causal alleles/haplotypes remains challenging. Follow-up functional studies are needed to identify the specific immunological pathways responsible in the multifactorial aetiology of HL and NHL. Correlative studies linking HLA alleles with known molecular subtypes and HLA expression in the tumours are also needed. Finally, additional association studies investigating HLA diversity and lymphoma survival are also required to replicate initial associations reported to date.",Intraarticular injection of a Tin-117 m radiosynoviorthesis agent in normal canine elbows causes no adverse effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155782,Veterinary radiology & ultrasound : the official journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association,2019 06 03,"This longitudinal prospective exploratory study used serial measurements in five dogs to evaluate safety and retention of a tin-117 m (117m Sn) colloid after intra-articular injection in normal elbow joints. Each dog was deemed healthy based on physical examination, laboratory results, and radiographic evaluation of both elbows. While anesthetized, each received an MRI of both elbows, followed by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans of both elbow joints and associated lymph nodes. Joint fluid (0.5-1.0 mL) was withdrawn aseptically from the left elbow joint, followed by intra-articular injection of 117m Sn colloid (92.5 MBq; 1-1.5 ml). Post-injection assessments included blood counts, serum chemistry panels, urinalyses, radiographs, joint fluid analyses, MRI/positron emission tomography scans, scintigraphy, and biodistribution scans. On day 45-47, each dog was euthanized and a complete postmortem examination was performed. Tissue samples were submitted for histopathology and radioisotope retention studies. Left elbow joints were decalcified and sectioned for future autoradiography. Scintigraphy, 1 day after injection, indicated slight radioisotope escape from the joint to regional lymph nodes. Serial blood, urine, feces, and organ counts indicated >99.1% of the 117m Sn activity was retained in the joint for 45-47 days. Radiation output levels were below patient release levels the day following injection. Maximum standard uptake value for the injected joint decreased. Joint fluid cytology was unchanged. No dog exhibited lameness during the study. Absence of joint damage and lack of systemic effects after injection of the 117m Sn colloid in normal canine elbow joints indicate that this agent may be safely used for radiosynoviorthesis in dogs with osteoarthritis.",Dietary quercetin supplements: Assessment of online product informations and quantitation of quercetin in the products by high-performance liquid chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155780,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 06 03,"Administration of the increasingly popular dietary supplements containing quercetin may interfere with drug therapy. We intended to evaluate the online availability and quercetin content of the high-dose mono-component quercetin products and to review the potential use of quercetin products and their interactions with drugs. We monitored the online access to quercetin-containing dietary supplements, collected the relevant information from the websites, procured selected products from the vendors, and subjected them to substance analysis. The quercetin content was quantified by an HPLC-UV method. Twenty-five websites offered mono-component quercetin products, and nine products were procured. The quercetin content of eight products differed only ±10% from the nominal dose, whereas one product contained almost 30% more quercetin. Misleading indications such as antitumor and cardiovascular effects were often found on the sellers' websites. Quercetin-containing dietary supplements are available online with misleading indications. The recommended daily doses are often high (occasionally over 1,000 mg), which may induce clinically relevant interactions with medications. Because high-quercetin content of dietary supplements was confirmed, health care professionals should be aware of the unregulated internet market of dietary supplements and should consider the interactions of these substances with drugs.",Seeing the light: Urban stream restoration affects stream metabolism and nitrate uptake via changes in canopy cover.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155778,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,2019 06 03,"The continually increasing global population residing in urban landscapes impacts numerous ecosystem functions and services provided by urban streams. Urban stream restoration is often employed to offset these impacts and conserve or enhance the various functions and services these streams provide. Despite the assumption that 'if you build it, [the function] will come', current understanding of the effects of urban stream restoration on stream ecosystem functions are based on short term studies which may not capture variation in restoration effectiveness over time. We quantified the impact of stream restoration on nutrient and energy dynamics of urban streams by studying 10 urban stream reaches (five restored, five unrestored) in the Baltimore, Maryland, USA, region over a two-year period. We measured gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) at the whole-stream scale continuously throughout the study and nitrate (NO3- -N) spiraling rates seasonally (spring, summer, autumn) across all reaches. There was no significant restoration effect on NO3- -N spiraling across reaches. However, there was a significant canopy cover effect on NO3- -N spiraling, and directly comparing paired sets of unrestored-restored reaches showed that restoration does affect NO3- -N spiraling after accounting for other environmental variation. Furthermore, there was a change in GPP:ER seasonality, with restored and open-canopied reaches exhibiting higher GPP:ER during summer. The restoration effect, though, appears contingent upon altered canopy cover, which is likely to be a temporary effect of restoration and is a driver of multiple ecosystem services, e.g., habitat, riparian nutrient processing. Our results suggest that decision-making about stream restoration, including evaluations of nutrient benefits, clearly needs to consider spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy cover and tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services.

After IVM and in vitro fertilization (IVF), through expansion average scores of cumulus cells (CCs), oocytes maturation efficiency, cleavage rate and blastocyst rate of zygote, we found 5μM D4476 could increase the development potential of oocytes. After the COCs were treated with 5μM D4476, the results of quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis, Lichen red staining and PI staining showed that under without affecting germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and nuclear morphology, D4476 could significantly decrease CK1 and up-regulate TCF-4 in oocytes. Furthermore, Under without influencing the level of Bad and CTSB, D4476 could significantly increase the expression of β-catenin, TCF-4, Cx43, MAPK, PTGS-2, PTX-3, TGS-6, Bax and Bcl-2 in CCs. Western Blot analysis revealed that the addition of 5μM D4476 during the maturation of COCs resulted in a lower level of Cx43 protein at 12h and a higher expression of Cx43 protein at 24h compared to the group without D4476. These results indicate that adding optimum D4476 (5μM) to maturation medium is beneficial to maturity efficiency and development competence of bovine oocytes. This article is protected by copyright.

Finally, the reported uses of hydrophobic MOFs in practical applications such as hydrocarbon storage/separation and their use in separating oil spills from water are summarized. Finally, the state of the art is summarized and promising future developments of hydrophobic MOFs are highlighted.",Encapsulation of Plasmid DNA by Nanoscale Metal-Organic Frameworks for Efficient Gene Transportation and Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155760,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 06 03,"The intracellular delivery and functionalization of genetic molecules play critical roles in gene-based theranostics. In particular, the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) with safe nonviral vectors for efficient intracellular gene expression has received increasing attention; however, it still has some limitations. A facile one-pot method is employed to encapsulate pDNA into zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) and ZIF-8-polymer vectors via biomimetic mineralization and coprecipitation. The pDNA molecules are found to be well distributed inside both nanostructures and benefit from their protection against enzymatic degradation. Moreover, through the use of a polyethyleneimine (PEI) 25 kD capping agent, the nanostructures exhibit enhanced loading capacity, better pH responsive release, and stronger binding affinity to pDNA. From in vitro experiments, the cellular uptake and endosomal escape of the protected pDNA are greatly improved with the superior ZIF-8-PEI 25 kD vector, leading to successful gene expression with high transfection efficacy, comparable to expensive commercial agents. New cost-effective avenues to develop metal-organic-framework-based nonviral vectors for efficient gene delivery and expression are provided.",H/F-Substitution-Induced Homochirality for Designing High-Tc Molecular Perovskite Ferroelectrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155759,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 06 03,"A ferroelectric with a high phase-transition temperature (Tc ) is an indispensable condition for practical applications. Over the past decades, both strain engineering and the isotope effect have been found to effectively improve the Tc within ferroelectric material systems. However, the former strategy seems to prefer working in inorganic ferroelectric thin films, while the latter is also limited to some certain systems, such as hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics. It is noted that a mono-fluorinated molecule is geometrically very similar to its parent molecule and the substitution of H by an F atom can introduce a chiral center on the molecule to template or stabilize polar structures. Significantly, the barrier of rotation of the fluorinated organic molecules is raised, resulting in a remarkable increase in Tc . Herein, by applying the molecular design strategy of H/F substitution to the organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric (pyrrolidinium)CdCl3 with a low Tc of 240 K, two high-Tc chiral perovskite ferroelectrics, (R)- and (S)-3-F-(pyrrolidinium)CdCl3 are successfully synthesized, for which the Tc reaches 303 K. The significant enhancement of 63 K in Tc extends the ferroelectric working temperature range to room temperature. This finding provides a new effective way to regulate the Tc in ferroelectrics and to design high-Tc molecular ferroelectrics.",Comparison of gradient echo and gradient echo sampling of spin echo sequence for the quantification of the oxygen extraction fraction from a combined quantitative susceptibility mapping and quantitative BOLD (QSM+qBOLD) approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155754,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 06 03,"To compare gradient echo (GRE) and gradient echo sampling of spin echo (GESSE) sequences for the quantification of the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) from combined quantitative BOLD and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) with regard to accuracy, precision and parameter initialization.",Resveratrol chemosensitizes adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells by modulating miR-122-5p.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155753,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 03,"Breast cancer is one of the major malignancies threatening women's health worldwide, and chemotherapy tolerance has become a severe limitation of clinical treatment. Recent findings have revealed that resveratrol, as a dietary agent with antitumour activity, could prevent cancer progression by regulating microRNAs (miRNAs). Additionally, dysregulated miRNAs have been found to contribute significantly to chemoresistance by an increasing number of studies. In this study, experiments were designed to study the functional role of resveratrol in MCF-7 cells (low-invasive breast cancer) in chemosensitivity to adriamycin and to determine the targeted miRNAs of resveratrol and their key target proteins linked to cell activity. We demonstrated that in resveratrol-induced chemosensitivity, cell cycle and apoptosis were arrested in adriamycin-resistant breast cancer cells after modulation of the critical suppresser, miR-122-5p. Further miRNA modulation with miR-122-5p mimics or miR-122-5p inhibitors indicated a major effect of miR-122-5p on the regulation of key antiapoptotic proteins (B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2]) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6) in drug-resistant breast cancer cells in response to resveratrol. In conclusion, our results indicate that resveratrol acts as a potential inducer to enhance the chemosensitivity of breast cancer and also suggest that miR-122-5p is involved in the pathway of cell-cycle arrest by targeting Bcl-2 and CDKs.",Stimulation of subchondral bone cyst healing by placement of a transcondylar screw in the equine medial femoral condyle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155750,Veterinary surgery : VS,2019 06 03,To predict the bone formation stimulus of a transcondylar screw across an equine subchondral bone cyst (SBC) in an equine medial femoral condyle (MFC).

Common symptoms and signs of DVT are pain, swelling, erythema and dilated veins in the affected limb. The pre-test probability of DVT can be assessed using a clinical decision rule that stratifies DVT into ""unlikely"" or ""likely"". If DVT is ""unlikely"", refer for D-dimer test. If the D-dimer level is normal, DVT can be excluded; if the D-dimer level is increased, refer for compression ultrasound. If DVT is ""likely"", refer for compression ultrasound. When DVT is confirmed, anticoagulation is indicated to control symptoms, prevent progression and reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation may consist of a parenteral anticoagulant overlapped by warfarin or followed by a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (dabigatran or edoxaban), or of a DOAC (apixaban or rivaroxaban) without initial parenteral therapy. DOACs are the preferred treatment for DVT because they are at least as effective, safer and more convenient than warfarin. DOACs may require dose reduction or avoidance in patients with renal dysfunction, and should be avoided in pregnancy. Recent evidence shows that DVT in patients with cancer may be treated with edoxaban (after discontinuation of 5 days of initial heparin or low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) or rivaroxaban if patients prefer not to have daily injections of LMWH, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with DOACs than with LMWH in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.","Training High School Student ""Citizen Scientists"" to Document School Water Access: A Feasibility Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155729,The Journal of school health,2019 06 03,"Youth water consumption is inadequate.

Induction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is required for differentiation and is stimulated by these two factors. These studies were undertaken to determine how these two peptides lead to activation of AMPK. Enzymatic inhibitors and small interfering RNA were utilized to attenuate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) activity in osteoblasts, and both manipulations resulted in failure to activate AMPK, thereby resulting in inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. IGFBP-2 and IGF-I stimulated an increase in CaMKK2, and inhibition of IGFBP-2 binding its receptor resulted in failure to induce CaMKK2 and AMPK activation. Injection of a peptide that contained the IGFBP-2 receptor-binding domain into IGFBP-2-/- mice activated CaMKK2 and injection of a CaMKK2 inhibitor into normal mice inhibited both CamKK2 and AMPK activation in osteoblasts. We conclude that induction of CaMKK2 by IGFBP-2 and IGF-I in osteoblasts is an important signaling event that occurs early in differentiation and is responsible for activation of AMPK, which is required for optimal osteoblast differentiation.",The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for cancer patients (QLQ-C30): Australian general population reference values.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155722,The Medical journal of Australia,2019 06 03,"To generate Australian general population reference values for the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for cancer patients (QLQ-C30); to compare Australian values with published EORTC general population reference values, and to explore associations between socio-demographic and health characteristics and QLQ-C30 subscale scores.",Demonstrating suitability of the Caco-2 cell model for BCS-based biowaiver according to the recent FDA and ICH harmonised guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155721,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2019 06 03,"According to the regulatory guidelines, one of the critical steps in using in-vitro permeability methods for permeability classification is to demonstrate the suitability of the method.

First, individualized HR assessments were conducted to determine moderate and vigorous HR zones. Next, participants engaged in various exercises at a local YMCA facility (i.e., biking, elliptical, basketball, and exergame boxing) to determine how HR during these activities aligned with their individualized HR zones. During exercise bouts, HR was typically above moderate, but below vigorous HR zones for all participants. Additionally, exercises that restricted range of motion (i.e., biking and elliptical) engendered generally lower HR than exercises with greater range of motion. Vocal instructions to exercise at vigorous levels were effective at increasing HR to vigorous levels for one participant. The advantages of using HR as a metric of PA during assessment and intervention are discussed.","Bortezomib and dexamethasone, an original approach for treating multi-refractory warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155716,British journal of haematology,2019 06 03,"We report the off-label use of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone in eight adults with severe and multi-refractory warm auto-immune haemolytic anaemia (wAIHA).

Their legs are rotated through 180°, generally reduced in size, and in some extant taxa particular bones (e.g. fibula) can even be absent. The femur is the main leg bone, but to date few bat studies have considered its morphology in detail, none in a wide-scale comparative study. Yangochiroptera is the largest bat taxon, spans nearly three orders of magnitude in body mass, and is highly diverse both in ecology and behavior, representing a good model for comparative analyses. Here, we describe the anatomy of the femur in a large sample of yangochiropteran bats (125 species, 70 genera, and 12 families), and explore major trends of morphological variation and scaling patterns in this bone. We used 13 categorical characters in the anatomical description and five linear dimensions in the quantitative analyses. Based on the categorical data, each family studied here was diagnosed, and those from the Neotropical region were included in an identification key. From the phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA) we showed that, in addition to size, major axes of variation in bat femur are related to robusticity and head morphology, features that are clearly distinct among some families. We also generated a phylomorphospace based on pPCA scores, highlighting convergences in femur shape. Molossidae, Mystacinidae, and Desmodontinae were grouped based on their greater robusticity, a pattern that was also recovered from categorical data. In these families, we found anatomical features (e.g. presence of tubercles and posterior ridges on the greater trochanter, long or medially/distally displaced lateral ridges on the shaft) that are well-known from their functional link with quadrupedal locomotion. Using phylogenetic regressions, we found out that compared with body mass, femur length scaled with negative allometry, as expected, but that femur width scaled isometrically, counter to expectations. As a result, robusticity index (the ratio of width to length), scaled with positive allometry - larger bats tended to have more robust hindlimbs. At species level, our most remarkable finding was related to Myotis simus, which presented the most robust femur (for its size) among yangochiropterans. Our results reinforce the informative potential of the chiropteran femur from both taxonomic and functional perspectives. Furthermore, the allometric trends seen in this bone may help understand the strategies adopted by flying vertebrates to deal with the high energetic cost of flight and, at the same time, evolve diversified foraging behaviors."

Appropriate therapy leading to disease control has the potential to alter the known trajectory of adverse long-term physical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes in this population. Thus, optimizing treatment for children and adolescents with MS is of paramount importance. The last decade has seen a growing number of disease-modifying therapies approved for relapsing MS in adults, and available agents now include oral, injectable, and infusion therapies. Recently, the development of randomized controlled MS trials in youth has led to the first agent approved by the US FDA for the treatment of pediatric MS-fingolimod. With this, we have entered a new era of knowledge and treatment in this population and ongoing pediatric trials are expected to further inform clinical management. With the emergence of highly effective therapies targeting the inflammatory component of the disease, there has been increased interest in identifying treatment strategies that instead target mechanisms such as remyelination/repair, neuroprotection, or rehabilitation. The potential role for such emerging therapies in the treatment of pediatric MS remains an important area of study. In this review, we discuss current evidence for MS therapies in children including the treatment of acute relapses, disease-modifying therapies, and symptomatic management.

To resist the outbreak of water environmental risk events, it is important to control the risk during its production and conduction phases and cut the chain of risk conduction. Currently, there are rarely reports on the research of water environment risk conduction in river basins. In order to reveal the risk accumulation characteristics and conduction trend of water environment from Taizihe River Basin, this study tried to calculate the risk level coefficient, the comprehensive risk index, the probability and intensity of the risk conduction based on the risk energy theory, and reveal the risk conduction trend in the region. The results showed that the risk sources in the study area mainly include mining, petrochemicals, metallurgical industries and equipment manufacturing industries, and habitats were waters, cultivated land, forest land, grasslands and urban land. There were one region (R4) in the slight risk area, one region (R6) in the low risk area, two regions (R3 and R5) in the medium risk area, one region (R7) in the high risk area, and two regions in the very high risk area (R1 and R2). The upper reaches of the Taizihe River was the main risk accumulation area, and the middle and lower reaches were the main risk conduction release areas. The most important contributors to the risk were TN and NH3-N. The excess of nitrogen elements constituted the main risk source of node water quality. The highest risk during the wet and dry season occurred in the downstream section, and Tangmazhai, Xiaojiemiao, Sanchahe and Guchengzi all showed higher comprehensive risk values.

Herein, we introduce kinetic and thermodynamic factors controlling the ion exchange reactions in NPs to fully understand the fundamental mechanisms of the reactions. Additionally, many representative examples are summarized to find related advanced techniques and unique NPs constructed by ion exchange reactions. Cation exchange reactions mainly occur in chalcogenide compounds, while anion exchange reactions are mainly involved in halogen (e.g. perovskite) and metal-chalcogenide compounds. It is expected that NP syntheses through ion exchange reactions can be utilized to create new devices with the required properties by virtue of their versatility and ability to tune fine structures.",Circulating monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages express recombined immunoglobulins in glioblastoma patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155685,Clinical and translational medicine,2019 06 03,"Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant brain tumor in adults.

We decided to assess the effect of several chemotherapeutic agents on placental development by using in vitro culture of human term cytotrophoblasts. Methods Cytotrophoblasts isolated from term placentas were cultured for 48 h and treated for 24 h with epirubicin, docetaxel, vinblastine, methotrexate, tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and endoxifen. First, cell viability was assessed. Then, the effect of the treatment on trophoblast differentiation and placental angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying hCG and PlGF mRNA and protein expression. Finally, the expression of two efflux transporters, BCRP and MDR1 was investigated. Results Epirubicin only strongly decreased cell viability. Epirubicin, docetaxel, and vinblastine inhibited HCGB and PlGF expression while methotrexate, tamoxifen and its two metabolites increased it. BCRP was essentially expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts and MDR1 in undifferentiated cytotrophoblasts. Their expression was not affected by the drugs but vinblastine increased BCRP mRNA expression by 2.8-fold. Discussion The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs are well supported in vitro by syncytiotrophoblasts, except for epirubicin, which was very cytotoxic. Chemotherapy perturbed the expression of genes normally upregulated during placental differentiation and angiogenesis but not the expression of the drug transporters. Further studies looking at the effect of combination therapy and the transporter capacities to reject the drugs will be needed to better define the effects of chemotherapy on placental development and function.",Neuronal spiking in the pedunculopontine nucleus in progressive supranuclear palsy and in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155683,Journal of neurology,2019 06 03,"The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is engaged in posture and gait control, and neuronal degeneration in the PPN has been associated with Parkinsonian disorders. Clinical outcomes of deep brain stimulation of the PPN in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) differ, and we investigated whether the PPN is differentially affected in these conditions. We had the rare opportunity to record continuous electrophysiological data intraoperatively in 30 s blocks from single microelectrode contacts implanted in the PPN in six PSP patients and three IPD patients during rest, passive movement, and active movement. Neuronal spikes were sorted according to shape using a wavelet-based clustering approach to enable comparisons between individual neuronal firing rates in the two disease states. The action potential widths showed a bimodal distribution consistent with previous findings, suggesting spikes from noncholinergic (likely glutamatergic) and cholinergic neurons. A higher PPN spiking rate of narrow action potentials was observed in the PSP than in the IPD patients when pooled across all three conditions (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p = 0.0141). No correlation was found between firing rate and disease severity or duration. The firing rates were higher during passive movement than rest and active movement in both groups, but the differences between conditions were not significant. PSP and IPD are believed to represent distinct disease processes, and our findings that the neuronal firing rates differ according to disease state support the proposal that pathological processes directly involving the PPN may be more pronounced in PSP than IPD."

Physical therapists not only play an important role in the rehabilitation of the nearly 2 million adolescents and adults addicted to prescription opioids but also provide care to infants born to mothers with various drug addictions. This Perspective article explores the incidence, pathophysiology, and risk factors for neonatal abstinence syndrome and describes the clinical presentations of withdrawal and neurotoxicity in infants. Discipline-specific recommendations for the physical therapist examination and plan of care, including pharmacological management considerations, are outlined. Nonpharmacological management, including supportive care, feeding, parent education, social aspects of care, and follow-up services, are discussed from a physical therapy perspective. Finally, this article reviews developmental outcomes in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome and reflects on challenges and future directions of research in this area.","Predictors of Walking Efficiency in Children With Cerebral Palsy: Lower-Body Joint Angles, Moments, and Power.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155663,Physical therapy,2019 06 03,"People with cerebral palsy (CP) experience increased muscle stiffness, muscle weakness, and reduced joint range of motion.

Unlike other biases in epidemiologic research (e.g., measurement bias, confounding due to unmeasured factors, and selection based on unmeasured predictors of the outcome), immortal time bias can and should be avoided by the correct assignment of person time during follow up. However, even when handing person time correctly, allowing late entry into a study or into an exposure group can open the door to more insidious sources of bias, some of which we explore here. Clear articulation of the study question, including the treatment plans of interest, can provide navigation around these sources of bias and elucidate the assumptions needed for inference given the available data. Here, we use simulated data to illustrate the assumptions required under various approaches to estimate the effect of a time varying treatment and describe how these assumptions relate to the assumptions necessary to estimate single sample rates and risks in settings with censoring and truncation.",Insulinoma-associated protein 1 controls nasopharyngeal carcinoma to radiotherapy by modulating cyclin D1-dependent DNA repair machinery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155641,Carcinogenesis,2019 06 03,"Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), a zinc finger transcriptional factor, is proven to be deregulated in several types of cancers. However, comprehension of the molecular mechanism of INSM1-mediated tumor progression remains poor. Here, we show that the radioresistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients have higher expressions of INSM1 that correlated with poor prognosis. Genetic manipulation of INSM1 expression sufficiently controls the response of NPC cells to irradiation (IR). Mechanistically, cells exposed to IR, increased intracellular INSM1 competitively disrupts the interaction of cyclin D1 and CDK4 resulting in cell survival by the cyclin D1-dependent DNA repair machinery. Moreover, knockdown of INSM1 sensitives NPC cells to IR in vivo and protects xenograft mice from mortality. Taken together, these results indicate that INSM1 modulates nasopharyngeal carcinoma to radiotherapy by controlling cyclin D1-dependent DNA repair machinery that could be manipulated as a novel molecular target for NPC therapy.",Impacts of the MHC class I-like XNC10 and innate-like T cells on tumor tolerance and rejection in the amphibian Xenopus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155639,Carcinogenesis,2019 06 03,"The conditions that lead to anti- or pro-tumor functions of natural killer T (NKT) cells against mammalian tumors are only partially understood. Therefore, insights into the evolutionary conservation of NKT and their analogs - innate-like T (iT) cells may reveal factors that contribute to tumor eradication. As such, we investigated the amphibian Xenopuslaevis iT cells and interacting MHC class I-like (XNC or mhc1b.L) genes against ff-2 thymic lymphoid tumors. Upon ff-2 intraperitoneal transplantation into syngeneic tadpoles, two iT cell subsets iVα6 and iVα22, characterized by an invariant T cell receptor (iTCR) α chain rearrangement - Vα6-Jα1.43 and Vα22-Jα1.32, respectively, were recruited to the peritoneum, concomitant with a decreased level of these transcripts in the spleen and thymus. To address the hypothesize that different iT cell subsets have distinct, possibly opposing, roles upon ff-2 tumor challenge, we determined whether ff-2 tumor growth could be manipulated by impairing Vα6 iT cells or by deleting their restricting element, the XNC gene - XNC10 (mhc1b10.1.L) on ff-2 tumors. Accordingly, the in vivo depletion of Vα6 iT cells using XNC10-tetramers enhanced tumor growth, indicating Vα6 iT cells-mediated anti-tumor activities. However, XNC10-deficient transgenic tadpoles that also lack Vα6 iT cells were resistant to ff-2 tumors, uncovering a potential new function of XNC10 besides Vα6 iT cell development. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of XNC10 in ff-2 tumors broke the immune tolerance. Together, our findings demonstrate the relevance of XNC10/iT cell axis in controlling Xenopus tumor tolerance or rejection.",Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin Type A in Improving Scar Quality and Wound Healing: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155638,Aesthetic surgery journal,2019 06 03,"Botulinum toxin type A-induced ""chemoimmobilization"" has long been utilized for improved scar quality and wound healing; however, current evidence is limited to small-sized studies, and evidence-based information is inadequate for making well-informed decisions.",Superior Aerobic Capacity and Indices of Skeletal Muscle Morphology in Chronically Trained Master Endurance Athletes Compared with Untrained Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155637,"The journals of gerontology.

Skeletal muscle index was lower and body fat greater in OC vs. MA. Estimated VO2max (ml·kg-1·min-1) was similar between MA and YC, but lower in OC. Isometric leg strength normalized to fat-free mass was similar between groups, whereas normalized isometric arm strength was greater in YC than MA. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) I fibre area was greater in MA than OC, whilst MHC II fibre area was greater in YC than OC. MHC II fibre myonuclear domain size was greater in YC than OC and MA, whereas MA had greater MHC I and MHC II fibre capilliarisation than OC and YC. Satellite cell content was similar between groups.

In this work, thermal transmission in three novel carbon allotropes with sp2 and sp3 hybridization has been studied, including T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 by using non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations and phonon kinetic theory. Graphene and diamond with standard sp2 and sp3 hybridization, respectively, are also examined for comparison. Our results indicate that the thermal conductivities of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 at room temperature are much lower than those of diamond and graphene. Phonon kinetic theory analysis shows that the lower thermal conductivity of T6-carbon, T10 and 3D-C5 is caused by the combined action of their reduced phonon group velocities and relaxation time. Moreover, the bond difference parameter has been proposed to describe the relationship between bond structures and thermal conductivity in carbon allotropes, which presents a new and convenient method for in-depth understanding the thermal conductivity of carbon allotropes."

The AAs examined in this work include glycine (Gly) and the three basic AAs: histidine (His), lysine (Lys), and arginine (Arg). To identify the (AA)H+(18C6) conformations present in the experimental studies, the measured IRMPD spectra are compared to spectra calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. Relative energies of various conformers and isomers are provided by single point energy calculations carried out at the B3LYP, B3P86, M06, and MP2(full) levels using the 6-311+G(2p,2d) basis set. The comparisons between the IRMPD and theoretical IR spectra indicate that 18C6 binds to Gly and His via the protonated backbone amino group, whereas protonated Lys prefers binding via the protonated side-chain amino group. Results for Arg are less definitive with strong evidence for binding to the protonated guanidino side chain (the calculated ground conformer at most levels of theory), but contributions from backbone binding to a zwitterionic structure are likely.","Variants in MED12L, encoding a subunit of the mediator kinase module, are responsible for intellectual disability associated with transcriptional defect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155615,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2019 06 03,"Mediator is a multiprotein complex that allows the transfer of genetic information from DNA binding proteins to the RNA polymerase II during transcription initiation.

Incision length, duration of surgery, degree of intraoperative bleeding, recovery time, and findings at postoperative follow-up at one month, three months, and six months after surgery were recorded. Assessment included the two-point discrimination test, the grip and pinch strength test, the visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, the Levine questionnaire, and Kelly's therapeutic evaluation. <strong>RESULTS</strong> Incision length, duration of surgery, intraoperative bleeding, and recovery time were significantly reduced in the wrist arthroscopy group and the small incision surgery group compared with the conventional surgery group (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in the two-point discrimination or grip and pinch strength test (p>0.05).

Although many studies have claimed that timely diagnosis and early initiation of chemotherapy are important, the literature on the successful treatment of IVLBCL in elderly patients over the age of 80 years is scarce. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old man presented with abnormal elevation of lactate dehydrogenase at 1605 IU/L and altered mental status, which manifested as forgetfulness, abnormal behavior, and worsening performance status for 2 days. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or skin lesions, but a computed tomography scan of the chest showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities. With a primary consideration of IVLBCL, random skin biopsy and transbronchial lung biopsy were performed. Immediately after the pathologic findings on hematoxylin-eosin staining alone revealed abnormal large cells in the small vessels, chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) at half the usual dose was started; later on, immunostaining revealed CD20 expression in the abnormal lymphoid cells. Immediately after CHOP administration, his mental and physical symptoms rapidly resolved. After 8 cycles of dose-reduced CHOP with rituximab, he remained free from disease progression 2 years after the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS We presented a case of successful early chemotherapy for IVLBCL in an elderly patient with poor performance status. Early chemotherapy with CHOP, even before obtaining a definitive diagnosis based on immunostaining, may contribute to good outcomes.",Analysis of amino acid profiles of blood over time and biomarkers associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in STAM mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155606,Experimental animals,2019 06 03,"The changes in free amino acid (AA) levels in blood during the progression from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. We investigated serum AA levels, along with biochemical and histological events, in a mouse model of NASH. We induced NASH in male C57BL/6J mice with a streptozotocin injection and high-fat diet after 4 weeks of age (STAM group). We chronologically (6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 weeks, n=4-12 mice/group) evaluated the progression from steatohepatitis to HCC by biochemical and histological analyses. The serum AA levels were determined using an AA analyzer. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in the STAM group than in the normal group (non-NASH-induced mice). Histological analysis revealed that STAM mice had fatty liver, NASH, and fibrosis at 6, 8, and 10 weeks, respectively. Moreover, the mice exhibited fibrosis and HCC at 16 weeks. The serum branched-chain AA levels were higher in the STAM group than in the normal group, especially at 8 and 10 weeks. The Fischer ratio decreased at 16 weeks in the STAM group, with increasing aromatic AA levels. These results suggested that this model sequentially depicts the development of fatty liver, NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, and AA metabolism disorders within a short experimental period. Additionally, serum amyloid A was suggested to be a useful inflammation biomarker associated with NASH. We believe that the STAM model will be useful for studying AA metabolism and/or pharmacological effects in NASH."

Here, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of ANO on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with a focus on the signaling pathways activated by toll-like receptor (TLR)4 in response to LPS. ANO inhibited both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells without affecting cell proliferation. In this response, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 and SAPK/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 was not affected by treatment with ANO. In contrast, phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and its downstream molecule glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (Ser9) was up-regulated by ANO, suggesting that ANO stimulated GSK-3β phosphorylation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. The phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser9 has been shown to negatively regulate the LPS-induced inflammatory response. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has also been implicated in differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts and adipocytes. As expected, ANO induced alkaline phosphatase activity and promoted calcium deposition in a mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line. The ANO-induced differentiation into osteoblasts was abrogated by coincubation with Wortmannin. Furthermore, ANO promoted insulin/dexamethasone-induced differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes at much lower concentrations than adenosine. The protective roles of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway in inflammatory disorders have been well documented. Our data suggest that ANO may serve as a potential candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Promotion of osteogenic and adipocyte differentiation further suggests its application for regenerative medicine.",Ameliorative Effect of High-Dose Vitamin C Administration on Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155592,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Vitamin C is a natural nutrient with antioxidant properties and is used as a health supplement. In this study, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal administration of high-dose vitamin C (4 g/kg) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis. We prepared a mouse ulcerative colitis model by administering DSS for 7 d along with high-dose vitamin C each day during DSS treatment. Ulcerative colitis induced by DSS was ameliorated by high-dose vitamin C administration. Blood levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and iron were elevated in DSS-treated mice but lowered by high-dose vitamin C administration. Contrarily, the levels of H2O2 and iron and the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the colon were further increased by high-dose vitamin C administration. The expression levels of fibroblasts, collagen type I, and collagen type III decreased in the DSS-treated mice but increased in mice administered high-dose vitamin C. These results suggest that high-dose vitamin C administration can improve ulcerative colitis.","Selective Protein Expression Changes of Leukocyte-Migration-Associated Cluster of Differentiation Antigens at the Blood-Brain Barrier in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Systemic Inflammation Mouse Model without Alteration of Transporters, Receptors or Tight Junction-Related Protein.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155591,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important step in the progression of brain dysfunction in systemic inflammation. The purpose of this study was to identify the key regulatory molecule(s) at the BBB among the cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens involved in leucocyte migration in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation based on their absolute protein expressions. Here, we identified the absolute expression levels of 17 CD antigens in isolated brain capillaries (Bcap) of LPS-administered mice. Among them, the expression levels of CD54 and CD106 were dramatically increased in LPS-administered mice compared to the control by 6.21- and 3.67-fold, respectively. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression levels of CD11a/CD18, the counter-receptor for CD54, were similar to those of CD54 in Bcap of LPS-administered mice. On the other hand, the expression level of CD49d, part of CD29/CD49d complex, which is the counter-receptor for CD106, was under the limit of quantification. It is thus likely that CD54 at the BBB is predominantly involved in promoting leukocyte migration across the BBB in systemic inflammation. The expression levels of CD9, CD49c and CD97, which are thought to be involved in cell-to-cell interaction, were decreased by 40-60% in Bcap of LPS-administered mice. In contrast, the expression levels of 9 transporters, 2 receptors, and 1 tight junction-related protein in Bcap of LPS-administered mice were essentially unchanged compared to the control. These results suggest that enhancement of leucocyte migration in systemic inflammation involves dynamic changes of CD antigens without alterations of other major functional molecules.","Stereoisomer-Specific Induction of G2/M Phase Arrest and Apoptosis by 9-(E,Z)-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic Acid in Mouse Lymphoma Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155590,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) are generated by oxidation of linoleic acid in vivo and thought to mediate various pathophysiological responses. In this study, we examined the effects of HODEs on EL4 mouse lymphoma cell growth and found that 9-(E,Z)-HODE inhibited EL4 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no such growth inhibition was observed with other isomers (9-(E,E)-, 13-(Z,E)-, or 13-(E,E)-HODE), suggesting that the growth-inhibitory effect of HODEs was stereospecific. Analysis by flow cytometry (FACS) with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining showed that 9-(E,Z)-HODE induced apoptosis with G2/M phase arrest. We next examined the growth inhibition profile of 9-(E,Z)-HODE against a panel of 39 human cancer cell lines (JFCR39). The fingerprint of growth inhibition by 9-(E,Z)-HODE exhibited a high degree of similarity to that by MLN4924, an inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme. The intracellular NEDD8 (ubiquitin-like protein) expression in EL4 cells was decreased by the treatment with 9-(E,Z)-HODE as assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. In conclusion, 9-(E,Z)-HODE specifically induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and the decrease of NEDD8 expression might be involved in this effect.","Effects of Zoledronate on Local and Systemic Production of IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in Mice and Augmentation by Lipopolysaccharide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155589,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) containing nitrogen (N-BPs) exhibit far stronger anti-bone-resorptive effects than non-N-BPs. However, repeated administration of N-BPs causes osteonecrosis selectively in jawbones. As BPs accumulate in large amounts within inflamed bones, any N-BP released from the pool accumulated within jawbones might directly act on cells in the surrounding soft-tissues and induce inflammation or necrosis. Here, we examined the local and systemic effects of zoledronate (the most potent N-BP with the highest incidence of jawbone-necrosis) on inflammatory cytokines in mice. Locally within ear-pinnas: (i) zoledronate induced long-lasting accumulation of interleuikin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, but not tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), (ii) zoledronate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria) mutually augmented the productions of IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α, and (iii) oxidronate (a toxic non-N-BP) by itself produced not only IL-1β and IL-18, but also TNF-α. In systemic experiments using intraperitoneal injection of zoledronate and/or LPS, (i) zoledronate by itself increased none of the above cytokines in serum, and (ii) in mice pretreated (3 d before) with zoledronate, the LPS-induced increases in serum IL-1β and IL-18 were greatly augmented with a delayed slight TNF-α augmentation. These results, together with previous ones, suggest that (a) pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 accumulate within cells in soft-tissues exposed to N-BPs, and infection may augment not only their production, but also the release of their mature forms, (b) IL-1β and IL-18 (possibly together with TNF-α) may play important roles in N-BP-induced inflammation and/or necrosis, and (c) mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of BPs may differ between N-BPs and non-N-BPs.",Sac1 Phosphoinositide Phosphatase Regulates Foam Cell Formation by Modulating SR-A Expression in Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155588,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Macrophages endocytose modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL) vigorously via scavenger receptor A (SR-A) to become foam cells. In the present study, we found that Sac1, a member of the Sac family of phosphoinositide phosphatases, increases the protein level of SR-A and upregulates foam cell formation. Mouse macrophages (RAW264.7) were transfected with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Sac1. Sac1 knockdown decreased cell surface SR-A levels and impaired acetylated LDL-induced foam cell formation. Transfection of Sac1-knockdown cells with shRNA-resistant flag-Sac1 effectively rescued the expression of SR-A. Glycosylation of SR-A was largely attenuated by Sac1 knockdown, but neither mRNA expression nor protein degradation of SR-A were affected. These results suggest that Sac1 maintains SR-A protein levels by modulating SR-A glycosylation.","Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Inhibitor, Orthovanadate, Induces Contraction via Rho Kinase Activation in Mouse Thoracic Aortas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155587,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Orthovanadate (OVA), a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induces contraction in endothelium-denuded mouse thoracic aortas. OVA-induced contraction was significantly (vs. control rings) suppressed by Rho kinase (Y-27632, 10 µM), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2, FR180204, 10 µM), Erk1/2 kinase (MEK, PD98059, 10 µM), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, AG1478, 10 µM), and Src inhibitors, and was partially suppressed by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, AS601245, 10 µM) and p38 (SB203580, 10 µM) inhibitors. However, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (ML-7, 10 µM) and a metalloproteinase inhibitor (TAPI-0, 10 µM) had no effect on OVA-induced contraction in mouse thoracic aortas. Phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) was abolished by inhibitors of Src, EGFR, MEK, Erk1/2, and Rho kinase, but not by inhibitors of JNK and p38. Erk1/2 phosphorylation by OVA was blocked by inhibitors of EGFR, Src, MEK, and Erk1/2, but not by Rho kinase inhibition. Src phosphorylation at Tyr-416 was abrogated by only Src inhibitor. EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1173 was suppressed by a Src inhibitor. These findings suggest that OVA induces contraction via activation of Src, EGFR, MEK, Erk1/2, and Rho kinase, leading to inactivation of myosin light chain phosphatase via MYPT1 phosphorylation.","The Design, Synthesis and Preliminary Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of d3-Poziotinib Hydrochloride.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155586,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"To establish a synthetic route to d3-poziotinib hydrochloride. Treatment of 4-chloro-7-hydroxyquinazolin-6-yl pivalate (1) with d3-methyliodide afforded the etherization product, which reacted with 3,4-dichloro-2-fluoroaniline to generate the key intermediate d3-4-(3,4-dichloro-2-fluorophenylamino)-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl pivalate (3). Followed the de-protection reaction, the nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction with tert-butyl 4-(tosyloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate (TSP), and the de-protection reaction of t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, and the amide formation reaction with acrylyl chloride, d3-poziotinib was obtained, which was converted to hydrochloride salt by treatment with concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). Starting from a known compound 4-chloro-7-hydroxyquinazolin-6-yl pivalate (1), after 7 steps transformation, d3-poziotinib hydrochloride was obtained with a total yield of 9.02%. The structure of d3-poziotinib hydrochloride was confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and high resolution (HR)-MS. Meanwhile, the in vitro microsomal stability experiment showed that d3-poziotinib had a longer half time (t1/2 = 4.6 h) than poziotinib (t1/2 = 3.5 h).",NMR Characterization of Conformational Dynamics and Molecular Assemblies of Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155585,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Dynamic conformational transitions and molecular assemblies are essential properties of proteins, and relevant to their biological and pathological functions. Neurodegenerative diseases are known to be caused by abnormal, toxic assemblies of related proteins, e.g., amyloid β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease. Growing evidence indicates that the aggregation of various amyloidogenic proteins, including Aβ, can be highly enhanced at glycolipid membranes, suggesting that dynamic glycolipid-dependent conformational changes of proteins constitute crucial steps for their subsequent pathogenic amyloid fibril formation. It has also been proposed that several proteins, including molecular chaperones, can capture amyloidogenic proteins and thereby suppress their fibrillization. NMR spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for characterizing the conformational dynamics and intermolecular interactions of proteins, as well as for exploring transiently formed weak interactions among proteins in solution with various biomolecules, such as glycolipids. Our research group therefore attempted to elucidate the structural basis of protein-glycolipid and protein-protein interactions that either promote or suppress molecular assemblies of amyloidogenic proteins, using both solution and solid-state NMR methods in conjunction with other biophysical techniques. Our findings provide structural views of molecular processes involving amyloidogenic proteins of clinical and pathological interest and offer clues for the development of drugs to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases.",Role of Connexins in Chronic Pain and Their Potential as Therapeutic Targets for Next-Generation Analgesics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155584,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Chronic pain, including inflammatory, neuropathic pain, is a serious clinical issue. There are increasing numbers of patients with chronic pain due to the growing number of elderly and it is estimated that about 25% of the global population will develop chronic pain. Chronic pain patients are refractory to medications used to treat acute pain such as opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, the complexity and diversity of chronic pain mechanisms hinder the development of new analgesics. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanism of chronic pain is needed, which would facilitate the development of novel analgesics based on novel mechanisms. With this goal, connexins (Cxs) could be targeted for the development of new analgesics. Connexins are proteins with 20 subtypes, and function as channels, gap junctions between cells, and hemichannels that sample the extracellular space and release molecules such as neurotransmitters. Furthermore, Cxs could have functions independent of channel activity. Recent studies have shown that Cxs could be crucial in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain, and modulation of the activity or the expression of Cxs ameliorates nociceptive hypersensitivity in multiple chronic pain models. This review will cite novel findings on the role of of Cxs in the nociceptive transduction pathway under the chronic pain state and antinociceptive effects of various molecules modulating activity or expression of Cxs. Also, the potential of Cx modulation as a therapeutic strategy for intractable chronic pain will be discussed."

In yeasts, while some changes have been made in response to 1F=1N, most have resulted from two other factors: i) an improved understanding of biological diversity due to an increase in number of known species, and ii) progress in the methods for analyzing and evaluating biological diversity. The method for constructing a backbone tree, which is a basal tree used to infer phylogeny, has also progressed from single-gene trees to multi-locus trees and further, to genome trees.

There are 45 human cases worldwide including a Japanese case from Okinawa in 2009. After the finding of the human L. gallinae case, 793 chickens in Japan, including 293 from the mainland and 500 from the Nansei Island areas, were investigated to determine the prevalence of dermatophytes and their related fungal species. The survey was carried out from December 2008 to March 2013. Various dermatophytes and related fungal species were isolated from the studied chickens, with a prevalence of 24.6%. In total, 224 dermatophytes and related species were isolated in the survey. The most commonly isolated species included, in descending order of frequency, Arthroderma multifidum, Aphanoascus terreus, and Chrysosporium spp. Ar. multifidum and Ap. terreus have no record of pathogenicity, and the present isolates of Chrysosporium spp. were not matched to pathogenic Chrysosporium spp. based on the ITS rDNA sequences. Interestingly, an L. gallinae isolate was detected in a male 10-month-old shamo (fighting cock) from the main island. Furthermore, one strain of Arthroderma simii was also isolated as the second record in Japan following that from an imported chimpanzee. Although L. gallinae and Ar. simii are likely to be endemic in our country, the transmission of dermatophytosis from chickens to humans is unlikely to occur because of the reduced chances for citizens to come in contact with chickens due to various factors.",An Epidemiological Study of Feline and Canine Dermatophytoses in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155570,Medical mycology journal,2019 06 03,"In a 2012-2014 epidemiological study of feline and canine dermatophytoses in Japan, we investigated the prevalence of fungi among 296 cats and 170 dogs treated at a veterinary clinic and 51 cats and dogs at an animal shelter at Fukui City in Japan. Microsporum canis was isolated from only one cat out of the 517 animals. Also, from 2012 to 2017, we analyzed isolates from 76 cats and 15 dogs with dermatophytoses at 14 veterinary clinics across 10 prefectures in Honshu and Shikoku. M. canis was the cause for 85 of the cases and Microsporum gypseum for the other six. M. canis infection routes in cats are thought to include stray cats as well as breeding facilities and pet shops, whereas for dogs, only breeding facilities and pet shops. Tinea was found in 18.7% (14/75) of the owners of these animals.

In this study, we show that mild heat stress causes a morphological change in hyphae during the process of biofilm formation. We found that mild heat stress extended the period of hyphal stage maintenance in C. albicans biofilm. Although the rate of hyphal change from yeast form to hyphal form reached the maximum within 3 hr, later, almost every cell quickly reverted to the yeast growth phase within 6 hr at 37°C but not at 39°C, or under mild heat stress. Electron microscopy using a smart specimen preparation technique revealed that mild heat stress significantly increased the thickness of the inner cell wall accompanied by a decrease in density of the outer cell wall in the hyphae of C. albicans biofilm. To identify the gene responsible for the morphological changes associated with mild heat stress, we performed microarray gene expression analysis. Eleven genes were upregulated and 17 genes were downregulated under mild heat stress in biofilm cells. The increased PHR1 gene expression in response to mild heat stress was confirmed in quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The mutant upregulated PHR1 expression showed the same sensitivity against antifungal drug micafungin as dependent on mild heat stress.

In the present work, we aimed for identification of antitumor activity and inhibitory effects of PF-543 derivative containing aliphatic long chain (similar to known SK inhibitors) on SK1. The synthesized compound 2 exhibited an inhibitory effect on SK1 in a manner similar to that of PF-543; the PF-543 derivative manifested similar antitumor activity on HT29, HCT116 (colorectal cancer cell line), and AGS (gastric cancer cell line) cells.

A solid dispersion (SD) and a physical mixture (PM) consisting of indomethacin (IMC) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were prepared at different weight ratios as test samples, and then their T2 relaxation curves were measured by TD-NMR. The T2 relaxation curve of IMC was quite different from that of PVP by nature. T2 values of the SD and PM samples became gradually shortened with increasing IMC content. No difference in T2 relaxation curves was observed between SD and PM. By analyzing the T2 relaxation curves in detail, we succeeded in precisely quantifying the IMC contents incorporated in the samples. Next, this study evaluated the T2 relaxation curves of amorphous and crystalline states of powdered IMC. T2 relaxation rate of crystalline IMC was slightly but significantly higher than that of amorphous IMC, proving that the T2 measurement was sensitive enough to detect these differences. Finally, a thermal stress was imposed on SD and PM samples at 60°C for 7 d, and then an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation occurred in IMC in the PM sample and was successfully monitored by T2 measurement.

It was suggested that mosapride enhanced ruminal motility without adverse effects in cattle.","Genotyping of swine Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis isolates from Kyushu, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155550,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2019 06 03,"The incidence of diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is increasing annually worldwide, including Japan. Mycobacterium avium subsp. hoiminissuis (MAH) is one of the most common NTM species responsible for chronic lung diseases in animals and humans. In the current study, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing was employed to characterize the genetic diversity of swine MAH isolates from Kyushu, Japan. In total, 309 isolates were obtained from the lymph nodes of 107 pigs not displaying any clinical signs of disease, of which 307 were identified as MAH, comprising 173 strains. Based on eight established MIRU-VNTR loci, the MAH strains represented 50 genotypes constituting three lineages, and 29 had not been described in the Mac French National Institute for Agricultural Research Nouzilly MIRU-VNTR (Mac-INVM) database. MAH was the dominant M. avium complex (MAC) in pigs from Kyushu, and there was high genetic diversity among genotype profiles of MAH from Kyushu. We identified three predominant genotype profiles in the tested area sharing high relatedness with genotype profiles of strains isolated in European countries. MAH was the most common NTM in pigs from Kyushu and exhibited high diversity, with new strain-derived genotypes.",Identification of bovine papillomavirus type 1 and 2 from bovine anogenital fibropapillomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155549,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2019 06 03,"Papillomavirus (PV) is a well-known pathogen associated with epithelial and mucosal neoplastic diseases. In contrast to human PVs, characterization of animal PVs from the aspect of anogenital neoplasm is still on a learning curve. In the present study, two vulval and one anal warts, histologically diagnosed as fibropapillomas, excised from dairy cattle were analyzed. PCR and sequencing revealed that bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) and BPV-2 were detected from anal and vulval fibropapillomas, respectively. Immunohistochemistry detected PV antigen in a few differentiated keratinocytes of one vulval case. Reverse-transcriptase PCR detected the early region, but not the late region of BPV mRNA in all three cases. The present study will provide new insight into the relationship between BPV and anogenital papilloma in cattle.",Epidemiological evaluation of cats associated with feline polycystic kidney disease caused by the feline PKD1 genetic mutation in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155548,The Journal of veterinary medical science,2019 06 03,"Feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD), an inherited autosomal dominant disease, has been reported to occur mostly in Persian or Persian related cats, and to be associated with a mutation from C to A at position 10063 in exon 29 of the feline PKD1 gene (PKD1 mutation). Many clinical cases have been recognized in Japan, but the mutation rate in cats has not been reported. The objective of this study was to determine epidemiological characteristics and clinical features in cats with the PKD1 mutation. Referring veterinarians sent blood samples of 377 cats for the PKD1 gene evaluation. The blood samples were from 159 cats with renal cysts confirmed by ultrasonography, 60 cats without renal cysts, and 158 cats that did not undergo ultrasonography. In total, 150 cats carried the PKD1 mutation and the signalment, site and number of renal cysts, and results of blood test were evaluated in cats with the PKD1 mutation. The breeds with the highest rate of the PKD1 mutation were Persian (46%), Scottish Fold (54%) and American Shorthair cats (47%). However, mixed breed cats also showed high rates of the PKD1 mutation. Of cats with the mutation, the incidence of high plasma creatinine (≥1.6 mg/dl) was greater in cats ≥3 years old, although a few cats ≥9 years of age had low plasma creatinine (<1.6 mg/dl). The coincidence of renal and hepatic cysts was 12.6%, with the high prevalence in Persian cats (31%).",Hypoglycemic Effect of Acidic Polysaccharide from Schisandra Chinensis on T2D Rats Induced by High-Fat Diet Combined with STZ.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155547,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 06 03,"Polysaccharide is a key bioactive component of Schisandra chinensis and has significant pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of acidic polysaccharide from Schisandra chinensis (SCAP). Type 2 diabetic (T2D) rats were developed by giving a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ), and administered orally with SCAP (25, 50 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the rat's serum were measured. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and pathological changes of pancreas were observed. Furthermore, expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and Cleaved Caspase-3 in pancreatic islet were detected. The results showed that SCAP decreased FBG, TG, TC, LDL-C and MDA levels, increased insulin, HDL-C levels and SOD activity, improved the pathological changes in pancreatic islet. Furthermore, SCAP inhibited the up-regulation of P-JNK, BAX and Cleaved Caspase-3 proteins, and increased Bcl-2 protein expression. These data indicate that SCAP has a therapeutic effect in T2D rats, and the mechanism may be related to its protection against β-cells apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-related proteins expression to alleviate the injury caused by the oxidative stress.",[Association between health literacy and behavior regarding health checkups and health counseling in Japanese employees: A comprehensive health literacy survey of a Japanese railway company].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155543,Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,2019 06 03,"Globally, health literacy is considered important for healthy ageing.

To address this gap, this study aimed to examine the relationship between parental lifestyle factors and children's dietary habits.MethodsWe used data from the questionnaire survey of the Super Shokuiku School Project conducted in January 2016. The participants consisted of 1,632 elementary school children who answered questions about their lifestyle, while their parents answered parental lifestyle questions, including Breslow's seven health practice score (BHPS). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the strength of the relationship between parental lifestyle factors and parental dietary attitudes or children's dietary habits.ResultsCompared with good maternal BHPS, poor maternal BHPS was significantly associated with less parental interest in Shokuiku, less parental consideration of nutrient balance, and an increased rate of children eating breakfast alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-4.78, aOR, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.50-5.96 and aOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.34-4.35, respectively). There was no significant difference between parental BHPS and the following children's dietary habits: frequency of eating breakfast, vegetable intake, and snacking. These habits of children were associated with their personal lifestyle factors.ConclusionTwo types of dietary habits among children were associated with lifestyle factors of both parents and children. Nutrition education might be especially important for parents to improve their dietary attitude and children's dietary habits. However, different nutrition education interventions would be needed to appropriately address each dietary habit.",The association between thyroid hormone balance and thyroid volume in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155540,Endocrine journal,2019 06 03,"While patients with large goitrous thyroid diseases often have a relatively high serum free triiodothyronine (FT3)/free thyroxine (FT4) ratio, athyreotic patients have a relatively low FT3/FT4 ratio. Here we investigated the relationship between thyroid hormone status and thyroid volume (TV) among a large number of euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) patients. We retrospectively enrolled 2,603 untreated HT patients who visited the Kuma hospital from 2012 to 2016, and divided them into four groups as per the TV: normal TV (<20 mL), slight goiter (20 ≤ TV < 50 mL), moderate goiter (50 ≤ TV < 80 mL), and the large goiter group (≥80 mL). Baseline characteristics and laboratory data of each group were compared to those of 1,554 control subjects. The association between FT3/FT4 ratio and TV among HT patients was then analyzed. We observed a change in laboratory parameters among 13 patients in the large goiter group who were prescribed levothyroxine (LT4) for reducing TV. Compared to normal subjects, the moderate and large goiter groups exhibited significantly higher serum FT3 levels, while all HT groups exhibited lower serum FT4 levels. Serum FT3/FT4 ratios showed a positive correlation with TV (r = 0.35, p < 0.01), which was independent of age, sex, body mass index, and TgAb and TSH levels. LT4 treatment lowered serum FT3 levels and FT3/FT4 ratios significantly. Our results indicated that HT patients with increased TV tended to present with high serum FT3, low FT4, and high FT3/FT4 ratios. The elevation of deiodinase activity may be an important factor affecting thyroid hormonal balance in such patients."

In clinical studies, cultured MSCs have shown important therapeutic effects on diseases via both the reduction of neurological defects and the regulation of immune responses. However, in vivo MSC localization, function, and properties are poorly understood; therefore, the molecular understanding of MSC hierarchy is less advanced compared to hematopoietic stem cell hierarchy. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is an essential transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation from MSCs. Runx2 deficiency in Paired-related homeobox 1 (Prrx1)-derived cells (Runx2Prrx1-/- mice) results in defective intramembranous ossification. Double-positive cells for Prrx1-GFP, and stem cell antigen-1 (Sca1) (Prrx1+Sca1+ cells) in the calvaria, express Runx2 at lower levels, and are more homogeneous and primitive compared with Prrx1+Sca1- cells. Our results suggest that osteoblast differentiation in vivo may begin at the Prrx1+Sca1+ MSC stage, with sequential progression to Prrx1+Sca1- cells, followed by Osterix+Prrx1-Sca1- osteoblast precursors, which eventually form mature α1(I)-collagen+ osteoblasts. This research will enable us to better understand the in vivo molecular biology features of MSCs, leading to their therapeutic applications for tissue repair and regeneration.",[Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Compounds Regulating Brown/Beige Adipocyte Differentiation].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155526,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 06 03,"Brown adipose tissue is a critical regulator of metabolic health, and contributes to thermogenesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation through the action of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1). Recent studies have shown that cold exposure and the stimulation of β3-adrenergic receptors induce the development of brown cell-like ""beige"" adipocytes in white adipose tissue. Brown and/or beige adipocyte-mediated thermogenesis suppresses high-fat diet-associated obesity. Therefore, the development of brown/beige adipocytes may prevent obesity and metabolic diseases. In the present study, we elucidated whether naturally occurring compounds contribute to regulating the cellular differentiation of brown/beige adipocytes. We screened for the up-regulated expression of Ucp1 during beige adipogenesis using extracts of crude herbal drugs frequently used in Kampo prescriptions (therapeutic drugs in Japanese traditional medicine). This screening revealed that the extract prepared from Citri Unshiu Pericarpium [the peel of Citrus unshiu (Swingle) Marcov.] increased the expression of Ucp1 in beige adipocytes. We also focused on the function of clock genes in regulating brown/beige adipogenesis. Therefore, another aim of the present study was to evaluate naturally occurring compounds that regulate brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1) gene expression. In this review, we focus on naturally occurring compounds that affect regulatory processes in brown/beige adipogenesis, and discuss better preventive strategies for the management of obesity and other metabolic disorders.",[Adult Neurogenesis-activating Signals as Therapeutic Targets for Neurodegenerative Disorders].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155525,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 06 03,"In most mammalian species, adult neurogenesis appears to occur only in the olfactory bulb and hippocampal dentate gyrus, where neural stem/progenitor cells exist to create new neurons. The discovery of multi-potential neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) in the adult brain has precipitated a novel therapeutic strategy for harnessing these endogenous cells to aid in recovery from neurodegenerative disorders. During neurodegeneration, a plethora of endogenous factors, including cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, blood-derived factors, and reactive oxygen species, are released by the activation of resident microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating peripheral macrophages. It is interesting that these endogenous factors affect the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of newly generated cells involved in the incorporation of newly generated neurons into the brain's circuitry. The unique profile of these endogenous factors can vary the degree of neuroregeneration after neurodegeneration. We show that adult neurogenesis-activating signals are regulated by endogenous factors produced during neurodegeneration.",[Possible Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders by Promotion of Neuronal Differentiation through Organic Cation Transporters].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155524,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 06 03,"Neurons differentiated from neural stem cells mature to form a neuronal network. Neuronal maturation enables neurotransmission that regulates brain function. Therefore, abnormal neuronal differentiation causes dysfunction in neurotransmission, and is involved in the onset of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Most of the drugs currently available for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders act on membrane receptors and reuptake transporters of neurotransmitters, and control neurotransmission. These membrane proteins have a high affinity for a specific neurotransmitter, and are highly expressed in synapses. By contrast, xenobiotic transporters have a relatively lower affinity for neurotransmitters, but widely recognize various organic compounds, and are also expressed in brain neural cells. It has remained largely unknown why such xenobiotic transporters are expressed in neural cells that play a key role in neurotransmission. We have therefore attempted to clarify the physiological roles of organic cation transporters (OCTs) in neural stem cells in order to obtain new insight into the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The carnitine/organic cation transporter OCTN1/SLC22A4 is expressed at much higher levels in neural stem cells compared with other OCTs, and promotes their differentiation into neurons through the uptake of the food-derived hydrophilic antioxidant ergothioneine after oral administration. In this review, we introduce current topics on the physiological/pathophysiological roles of OCTs in neural stem cells, and discuss their possible application to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",Ad libitum feeding triggers puberty onset associated with increases in arcuate Kiss1 and Pdyn expression in growth-retarded rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155522,The Journal of reproduction and development,2019 06 03,"Increasing evidence shows that puberty onset is largely dependent on body weight rather than chronological age. To investigate the mechanism involved in the energetic control of puberty onset, the present study examined effects of chronic food restriction during the prepubertal period and the resumption of ad libitum feeding for 24 and 48 h on estrous cyclicity, Kiss1 (kisspeptin gene), Tac3 (neurokinin B gene) and Pdyn (dynorphin A gene) expression in the hypothalamus, luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and follicular development in female rats. When animals weighed 75 g, they were subjected to a restricted feeding to retard growth to 70-80 g by 49 days of age. Then, animals were subjected to ad libitum feeding or remained food-restricted. The growth-retarded rats did not show puberty onset associated with suppression of both Kiss1 and Pdyn expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). 24-h ad libitum feeding increased tonic LH secretion and the number of Graafian and non-Graafian tertiary follicles with an increase in the numbers of ARC Kiss1- and Pdyn-expressing cells. 48-h ad libitum feeding induced the vaginal proestrus and a surge-like LH increase with an increase in Kiss1-expressing cells in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). These results suggest that the negative energy balance causes pubertal failure with suppression of ARC Kiss1 and Pdyn expression and then subsequent gonadotropin release and ovarian function, while the positive energetic cues trigger puberty onset via an increase in ARC Kiss1 and Pdyn expression and thus gonadotropin secretion and follicular development in female rats.",Assessment of aloe vera ‎for qualitative fit testing of particulate respirators: a logistic regression approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155521,Industrial health,2019 06 03,"Fit testing procedure is required for filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) to ascertain an acceptable fit between the skin and facepiece sealing surface.

An herbal solution consisting of A. vera at seven different concentrations was developed. Threshold Screening Tests (TSTs) of A. vera solutions were compared to BitrexTM. To do so, solutions were administered randomly on a total of 62 participants. A placebo was also tested to ensure the taste response being valid. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.2.5.0 software. There were no statistically significant differences between the A. vera (41.7, 58.3, 75, and 91.7 mg/ml) and BitrexTM threshold tests. Therefore, the minimum concentration of A. vera to develop the threshold solution was considered to be 41.7 mg/ml.

We generated a β cell senescence signature and found that insulin resistance accelerates β cell senescence leading to loss of function and cellular identity and worsening metabolic profile. Senolysis (removal of senescent cells), using either a transgenic INK-ATTAC model or oral ABT263, improved glucose metabolism and β cell function while decreasing expression of markers of aging, senescence, and senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). Beneficial effects of senolysis were observed in an aging model as well as with insulin resistance induced both pharmacologically (S961) and physiologically (high-fat diet).

We found that cold exposure or β3-adrenergic agonist treatment of mice decreased the fibrogenic profile of precursor cells and stimulated beige adipocyte differentiation. This fibrogenic-to-adipogenic transition was impaired in aged animals, correlating with reduced adipocyte expression of the transcription factor PRDM16. Genetic loss of Prdm16 mimicked the effect of aging in promoting fibrosis, whereas increasing PRDM16 in aged mice decreased fibrosis and restored beige adipose development. PRDM16-expressing adipose cells secreted the metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which blocked precursor fibrogenesis and facilitated beige adipogenesis. BHB catabolism in precursor cells, mediated by BDH1, was required for beige fat differentiation in vivo. Finally, dietary BHB supplementation in aged animals reduced adipose fibrosis and promoted beige fat formation. Together, our results demonstrate that adipocytes secrete a metabolite signal that controls beige fat remodeling.",CircACC1 Regulates Assembly and Activation of AMPK Complex under Metabolic Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155494,Cell metabolism,2019 06 03,"We report that circACC1, a circular RNA derived from human ACC1, plays a critical role in cellular responses to metabolic stress. CircACC1 is preferentially produced over ACC1 in response to serum deprivation by the transcription factor c-Jun. It functions to stabilize and promote the enzymatic activity of the AMPK holoenzyme by forming a ternary complex with the regulatory β and γ subunits. The cellular levels of circACC1 modulate both fatty acid β-oxidation and glycolysis, resulting in profound changes in cellular lipid storage. In a tumor xenograft model, silencing or enforced expression of circACC1 resulted in growth inhibition and enhancement, respectively. Moreover, increased AMPK activation in colorectal cancer tissues was frequently associated with elevated circACC1 expression. We conclude that circACC1 serves as an economic means to elicit AMPK activation and moreover propose that cancer cells exploit circACC1 during metabolic reprogramming.",Modeling Steatohepatitis in Humans with Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Organoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155493,Cell metabolism,2019 06 03,"Human organoid systems recapitulate in vivo organ architecture yet fail to capture complex pathologies such as inflammation and fibrosis.

An overview from the Trypanosoma cruzi infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155420,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"The knowledge that the immune system is composed of a regulatory/suppressor arm added a new point of view to better understand the nature of several pathologies including cancer, transplants, infections and autoimmune diseases. The striking discoveries concerning molecules and cells involved in this kind of regulation were followed by the elucidation of equally notable mechanisms used by several pathogens to manipulate the host immune system. Vaccines against pathogens are an invaluable tool developed to help the immune system cope with a potential infection or prevent disease pathology. Nowadays, there is accumulated evidence indicating that the powerful stimulation capacity of vaccines influences not only the effector arm of the immune system but also cells with regulatory/suppressor capacity, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle that has evolved several strategies to influence the regulatory immune response. Although diverse vaccine formulations have been able to stimulate the effector response, achieving non-sterilizing protection against T. cruzi, the influence of the vaccine candidates on the regulatory machinery has scarcely been assessed. This fact may not only reveal important information concerning how vaccines may influence cells with regulatory/suppressor capacity but also open the possibility to analyze whether vaccines are able to disrupt the mechanisms used by some pathogens to manipulate the host regulatory circuits. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss available data related to the role of cellular components, like MDSCs and Foxp3+ Tregs, during T. cruzi infection, and the potential utility of those populations as additional targets for the rational design of vaccines.",Impact on antitumor response using a new adjuvant preparation as a component of a human papillomavirus type 16 therapeutic vaccine candidate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155419,Vaccine,2019 06 03,"Cervical cancer is a global public health problem and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 accounts for approximately 50% of cases worldwide.

A few adjuvants have been developed for use in human vaccines because of their limitations including lack of efficacy, unacceptable local or systemic toxicity, the difficulty of manufacturing, poor stability, and high cost. For that reasons, novel adjuvants/adjuvant systems are under search. Astragaloside VII (AST-VII), isolated from Astragalus trojanus, exhibited significant cellular and humoral immune responses. The polysaccharides (APS) obtained from the roots of Astragalus species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine and possess strong immunomodulatory properties. In the present study, the immunomodulatory effects of a newly developed nanocarrier system (APNS: APS containing carrier) and its AST-VII containing formulation (ANS: AST-VII + APNS), on seasonal influenza A (H3N2) vaccine were investigated. Inactivated H3N2 alone or its combinations with test compounds/formulations were intramuscularly injected into Swiss albino mice. Four weeks after immunization, the immune responses were evaluated in terms of antibody and cytokine responses as well as splenocyte proliferation. APNS demonstrated Th2 mediated response by increasing IgG1 antibody titers, whereas ANS showed response towards Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 by producing of IFN-γ, IL-17A and IgG2a. Based on these results, we propose that APNS and ANS are good candidates to be utilized in seasonal influenza A vaccines as adjuvants/carrier systems."

Current treatments can involve replacing part or all of the degenerate IVDs by invasive surgery. Our vision is to develop a minimally invasive approach in which high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used to mechanically fractionate degenerate tissue in an IVD; a fine needle is then used to first remove the fractionated tissue and then inject a biomaterial able to restore normal physiologic function. The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate the feasibility of trans-spinal HIFU delivery using simulations of 3-D ultrasound propagation in models derived from patient computed tomography (CT) scans. The CT data were segmented into bone, fat and other soft tissue for three patients. Ultrasound arrays were placed around the waist of each patient model, and time-reversal was used to determine the source signals necessary to create a focus in the center of the disc. The simulations showed that for 0.5 MHz ultrasound, a focus could be created in most of the lumbar IVDs, with the pressure focal gain ranging from 3.2-13.7. In conclusion, it is shown that with patient-specific planning, focusing ultrasound into an IVD is possible in the majority of patients despite the complex acoustic path introduced by the bony structures of the spine.","Myocardial Fiber Mapping of Rat Hearts, Using Apparent Backscatter, with Histologic Validation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155403,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 06 03,"Myocardial fiber architecture is a physiologically important regulator of ejection fraction, strain and pressure development. Apparent ultrasonic backscatter has been shown to be a useful method for recreating the myocardial fiber architecture in human-sized sheep hearts because of the dependence of its amplitude on the relative orientation of a myofiber to the angle of ultrasonic insonification. Thus, the anisotropy of the backscatter signal is linked to and provides information about the fiber orientation. In this study, we sought to determine whether apparent backscatter could be used to measure myofiber orientation in rodent hearts. Fixed adult-rat hearts were imaged intact, and both a transmural cylindrical core and transmural wedge of the left ventricular free wall were imaged. Cylindrical core samples confirmed that backscatter anisotropy could be measured in rat hearts. Ultrasound and histologic analysis of transmural myocardial wedge samples confirmed that the apparent backscatter could be reproducibly mapped to fiber orientation (angle of the fiber relative to the direction of insonification). These data provided a quantitative relationship between the apparent backscatter and fiber angle that was applied to whole-heart images. Myocardial fiber architecture was successfully measured in rat hearts. Quantifying myocardial fiber architecture, using apparent backscatter, provides a number of advantages, including its scalable use from rodents to man, its rapid low-cost acquisition and minimal contraindications. The method outlined in this study provides a method for investigators to begin detailed assessments of how the myocardial fiber architecture changes in preclinical disease models, which can be immediately translated into the clinic.",WNT10A rs147680216 G>A mutation indicates a higher risk for non-syndromic oral cleft in a northeastern Chinese population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155400,The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery,2019 06 03,"Non-syndromic oral cleft lip and palate is a heterogeneous group of congenital malformations that consist of cleft palate, and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. The members of the wingless type mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) integration site family (Wnts) regulate various developmental processes including craniofacial development, and have a role in that of cleft lip and palate. We aimed to identify the potential polymorphisms in the Wnt10a gene, and to explore the association between the variations in the gene and the risk of development of cleft palate. A total of 198 affected patients (cleft lip, n=67; cleft palate, n=48; and both, n=83) together with 187 healthy controls were enrolled (all from the Chinese Han population in NE China). A fragment of 316 bp was amplified from the blood genome of each participant by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers that targeted the Homo sapiens Wnt10a gene. By using the restriction enzyme AluI, the population analysed were classified into three genotypes, GG (316 bp), GA (316 bp, 117bp, 199bp) and AA (117bp, 199bp) based on the rs147680216 G/A polymorphism (Gly>Ser mutation at position 213 of Wnt10a protein) of theWnt10a gene. The frequency of allele A in the affected group was significantly higher (14.1% compared with 3.2% in the control group). The allele G with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.201 and 95% CI of 0.445 to 0.091 was not a risk factor for the condition in the affected group.

Of note, the existing intensive therapies modify risk factors but do not prevent life-threatening recurrent ischemic events in high-risk patients, who have a residual inflammatory risk displayed by increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Better understanding of the role of innate and adaptive immunity in plaque development and rupture has led to intensive investigation of anti-inflammatory strategies for CVD. Some of them are being tested in specific clinical trials and use lower doses of existing medications originally developed for other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, which have high CVD risk. Other investigations are retrospective and meta-analyses of existing clinical trials that evaluate the incidence of CVD in these inflammatory diseases. Others are based on preclinical testing such as vaccines. In this article, we summarize the main anti-inflammatory strategies and associated molecular mechanisms that are being evaluated in preclinical or clinical CVD studies."

Engaging in active foraging or flight provokes a reversal in the valence of carbon dioxide responses from aversion to approach in Drosophila [1, 2], whereas mosquitoes encountering this same chemical cue show enhanced approach toward a small visual object [3]. Sensory plasticity in insects has been broadly attributed to the action of biogenic amines, which modulate behaviors such as olfactory learning, aggression, feeding, and egg laying [4-14]. Octopamine acts rapidly upon the onset of flight to modulate the response gain of directionally selective motion-detecting neurons in Drosophila [15]. How the action of biogenic amines might couple sensory modalities to each other or to locomotive states remains poorly understood. Here, we use a visual flight simulator [16] equipped for odor delivery [17] to confirm that flies avoid a small contrasting visual object in odorless air [18] but that the same animals reverse their preference to approach in the presence of attractive food odor. An aversive odor does not reverse object aversion. Optogenetic activation of either octopaminergic neurons or directionally selective motion-detecting neurons that express octopamine receptors elicits visual valence reversal in the absence of odor. Our results suggest a parsimonious model in which odor-activated octopamine release excites the motion detection pathway to increase the saliency of either a small object or a bar, eliciting tracking responses by both visual features.",Cell Boundary Confinement Sets the Size and Position of the E. coli Chromosome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155353,Current biology : CB,2019 06 03,"Although the spatiotemporal structure of the genome is crucial to its biological function, many basic questions remain unanswered on the morphology and segregation of chromosomes. Here, we experimentally show in Escherichia coli that spatial confinement plays a dominant role in determining both the chromosome size and position. In non-dividing cells with lengths increased to 10 times normal, single chromosomes are observed to expand > 4-fold in size. Chromosomes show pronounced internal dynamics but exhibit a robust positioning where single nucleoids reside robustly at mid-cell, whereas two nucleoids self-organize at 1/4 and 3/4 positions. The cell-size-dependent expansion of the nucleoid is only modestly influenced by deletions of nucleoid-associated proteins, whereas osmotic manipulation experiments reveal a prominent role of molecular crowding. Molecular dynamics simulations with model chromosomes and crowders recapitulate the observed phenomena and highlight the role of entropic effects caused by confinement and molecular crowding in the spatial organization of the chromosome.",An Analysis of Decision under Risk in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155352,Current biology : CB,2019 06 03,"In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published a ground-breaking paper titled ""Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk,"" which presented a behavioral economic theory that accounted for the ways in which humans deviate from economists' normative workhorse model, Expected Utility Theory [1, 2]. For example, people exhibit probability distortion (they overweight low probabilities), loss aversion (losses loom larger than gains), and reference dependence (outcomes are evaluated as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point). We found that rats exhibited many of these same biases, using a task in which rats chose between guaranteed and probabilistic rewards. However, prospect theory assumes stable preferences in the absence of learning, an assumption at odds with alternative frameworks such as animal learning theory and reinforcement learning [3-7]. Rats also exhibited trial history effects, consistent with ongoing learning. A reinforcement learning model in which state-action values were updated by the subjective value of outcomes according to prospect theory reproduced rats' nonlinear utility and probability weighting functions and also captured trial-by-trial learning dynamics.",Cryptochromes-Mediated Inhibition of the CRL4Cop1-Complex Assembly Defines an Evolutionary Conserved Signaling Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155351,Current biology : CB,2019 06 03,"In plants, cryptochromes are photoreceptors that negatively regulate the ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cop1. In mammals, cryptochromes are core components of the circadian clock and repressors of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Moreover, mammalian cryptochromes lost their ability to interact with Cop1, suggesting that they are unable to inhibit CRL4Cop1. Contrary to this assumption, we found that mammalian cryptochromes are also negative regulators of CRL4Cop1, and through this mechanism, they repress the GR transcriptional network both in cultured cells and in the mouse liver. Mechanistically, cryptochromes inactivate Cop1 by interacting with Det1, a subunit of the mammalian CRL4Cop1 complex that is not present in other CRL4s. Through this interaction, the ability of Cop1 to join the CRL4 complex is inhibited; therefore, its substrates accumulate. Thus, the interaction between cryptochromes and Det1 in mammals mirrors the interaction between cryptochromes and Cop1 in planta, pointing to a common ancestor in which the cryptochromes-Cop1 axis originated.",Dynamic REM Sleep Modulation by Ambient Temperature and the Critical Role of the Melanin-Concentrating Hormone System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155350,Current biology : CB,2019 06 03,"Ambient temperature (Ta) warming toward the high end of the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) preferentially increases rapid eye movement (REM) sleep over non-REM (NREM) sleep across species. The control and function of this temperature-induced REM sleep expression have remained unknown. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons play an important role in REM sleep control. We hypothesize that the MCH system may modulate REM sleep as a function of Ta. Here, we show that wild-type (WT) mice dynamically increased REM sleep durations specifically during warm Ta pulsing within the TNZ, compared to both the TNZ cool and baseline constant Ta conditions, without significantly affecting either wake or NREM sleep durations. However, genetically engineered MCH receptor-1 knockout (MCHR1-KO) mice showed no significant changes in REM sleep as a function of Ta, even with increased sleep pressure following a 4-h sleep deprivation. Using MCH-cre mice transduced with channelrhodopsin, we then optogenetically activated MCH neurons time locked with Ta warming, showing an increase in REM sleep expression beyond what Ta warming in yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) control mice achieved. Finally, in mice transduced with archaerhodopsin-T, semi-chronic optogenetic MCH neuronal silencing during Ta warming completely blocked the increase in REM sleep seen in YFP controls. These data demonstrate a previously unknown role for the MCH system in the dynamic output expression of REM sleep during Ta manipulation. These findings are consistent with the energy allocation hypothesis of sleep function, suggesting that endotherms have evolved neural circuits to opportunistically express REM sleep when the need for thermoregulatory defense is minimized.",Regulated Activation of the PAR Polarity Network Ensures a Timely and Specific Response to Spatial Cues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155349,Current biology : CB,2019 06 03,"How do cells polarize at the correct time and in response to the correct cues? In the C. elegans zygote, the timing and geometry of polarization rely on a single dominant cue-the sperm centrosome-that matures at the end of meiosis and specifies the nascent posterior. Polarization requires that the conserved PAR proteins, which specify polarity in the zygote, be poised to respond to the centrosome. Yet, how and when PAR proteins achieve this unpolarized, but responsive, state is unknown. We show that oocyte maturation initiates a fertilization-independent PAR activation program. PAR proteins are initially not competent to polarize but gradually acquire this ability following oocyte maturation. Surprisingly, this program allows symmetry breaking even in unfertilized oocytes lacking centrosomes. Thus, if PAR proteins can respond to multiple polarizing cues, how is specificity for the centrosome achieved? Specificity is enforced by Polo-like and Aurora kinases (PLK-1 and AIR-1 in C. elegans), which impose a delay in the activation of the PAR network so that it coincides with maturation of the centrosome cue. This delay suppresses polarization by non-centrosomal cues, which can otherwise trigger premature polarization and multiple or reversed polarity domains. Taken together, these findings identify a regulatory program that enforces proper polarization by synchronizing PAR network activation with cell cycle progression, thereby ensuring that PAR proteins respond specifically to the correct cue. Temporal control of polarity network activity is likely to be a common strategy to ensure robust, dynamic, and specific polarization in response to developmentally deployed cues.",Structural Basis for the Inhibition of CRISPR-Cas12a by Anti-CRISPR Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155345,Cell host & microbe,2019 06 14,"CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1), a type V CRISPR-associated nuclease, provides bacterial immunity against bacteriophages and plasmids but also serves as a tool for genome editing. Foreign nucleic acids are integrated into the CRISPR locus, prompting transcription of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide Cas12a cleavage of foreign complementary DNA. However, mobile genetic elements counteract Cas12a with inhibitors, notably type V-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVAs). We present cryoelectron microscopy structures of Cas12a-crRNA bound to AcrVA1 and AcrVA4 at 3.5 and 3.3 Å resolutions, respectively. AcrVA1 is sandwiched between the recognition (REC) and nuclease (NUC) lobes of Cas12a and inserts into the binding pocket for the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), a short DNA sequence guiding Cas12a targeting. AcrVA1 cleaves crRNA in a Cas12a-dependent manner, inactivating Cas12a-crRNA complexes. The AcrVA4 dimer is anchored around the crRNA pseudoknot of Cas12a-crRNA, preventing required conformational changes for crRNA-DNA heteroduplex formation. These results uncover molecular mechanisms for CRISPR-Cas12a inhibition, providing insights into bacteria-phage dynamics.",Short-term safety of tranexamic acid use in posterior cervical decompression and fusion surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155344,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 06 03,"Posterior cervical decompression and fusion (PCDF) can result in substantial blood loss, leading to blood transfusions and associated complications, such as infections, hypotension and organ damage. The antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (TXA), an inhibitor of the activation of plasminogen, has been shown to be beneficial in multiple surgical procedures without any apparent increase in postoperative complications. However, there are only few studies reporting TXA utilization in cervical spine surgery and there is currently no literature detailing the short-term safety of its use in this setting. The purpose of our study is to determine the safety profile of TXA in posterior cervical decompression and fusion. From January 2015 to April 2018, 47 patients were identified to have undergone PCDF, 19 with the utilization of a TXA protocol at our institution. The incidence of adverse events was evaluated in the perioperative period and at 1 month follow-up. Of 39 patients, Nineteen (49%) received TXA as per our instructional protocol and 20 (51%) did not. Post-operative blood was significantly reduced (453 ml vs 701 ml; p = 0.03) in the group that received TXA. There was also a significant reduction in duration of surgery associated with TXA use (269 min vs 328 min; p = 0.05). There were no complications on the first 30 days after surgical intervention on the TXA group. TXA use during PCDF is a safe, effective method to reduce postoperative blood loss. Considering the limited number of patients in this study, these results should be validated on a larger group of patients.",Comparison of multiple sclerosis patients with and without oligoclonal IgG bands in South China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155343,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 06 03,"The data for oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid and the association with clinical profiles of Chinese patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is lacking.

Accurate and expedient histological diagnosis of patients' tumor specimens is required for subsequent treatment and prognostication. Currently, histology slides are visually inspected by trained pathologists, but this process is both time and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose an automated process to classify histology slides of both brain and breast tissues using the Google Inception V3 convolutional neural network (CNN). We report successful automated classification of brain histology specimens into normal, low grade glioma (LGG) or high grade glioma (HGG). We also report for the first time the benefit of transfer learning across different tissue types. Pre-training on a brain tumor classification task improved CNN performance accuracy in a separate breast tumor classification task, with the F1 score improving from 0.547 to 0.913. We constructed a dataset using brain histology images from our own hospital and a public breast histology image dataset. Our proposed method can assist human pathologists in the triage and inspection of histology slides to expedite medical care. It can also improve CNN performance in cases where the training data is limited, for example in rare tumors, by applying the learned model weights from a more common tissue type."

Molecularly, such interactions are typically communicated through proteins generated during granulopoiesis, stored in granules, or produced on demand. Here, we provide an overview of the mammalian regulation of granule protein production in the bone marrow and the de novo synthesis of cytokines by neutrophils recruited to tissues. In addition, we discuss some of the known biological roles of these protein messengers, and how neutrophil-borne granule proteins and cytokines can synergize to modulate inflammation and tumor development. Decoding the neutrophil interactome is important for therapeutically neutralizing individual proteins to putatively dampen inflammation, or for delivering modified neutrophil-borne proteins to boost host defense.","Communicating with patients, families and health professionals about managing medications in intensive care: A qualitative observational study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155314,Intensive & critical care nursing,2019 06 03,"To explore communication between patients, families, and health professionals about managing medications in intensive care.",Kinetic implication of moving warm side-stream Anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria to cold mainstream wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155313,Bioresource technology,2019 06 03,"Decreased activity of Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (Anammox) at low temperatures is widely reported and one of the key challenges to applying Anammox to mainstream wastewater treatment. In this work, we systematically measured Anammox across a range of temperatures for biomass taken from a side-stream (25-30 °C) Anammox system. Using the Cardinal temperature model with inflection (CTMI) and parameters Tmin = 10 °C, Topt = 31 °C, Tmax = 40 °C, and µmax = 0.29 d-1, the data was accurately represented. Alternatively, the popularly used Arrhenius equation was not able to consistently capture the trend we observed. The CTMI was further used to compute the relative increase in retention time and/or biomass concentration to treat the same quantity of nitrogen at sub-optimal temperatures, requiring a two-fold increase at 21 °C and three-fold increase at 19 °C. We conclude that cold adapted cultures are necessary to evaluate the possibility of cold Anammox wastewater treatment.",MxB Restricts HIV-1 by Targeting the Tri-hexamer Interface of the Viral Capsid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155311,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 06 03,"The human antiviral protein MxB is a restriction factor that fights HIV infection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that MxB targets the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects the viral genome. To make the conical-shaped capsid, HIV CA proteins are organized into a lattice composed of hexamer and pentamer building blocks, providing many interfaces for host proteins to recognize. Through extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that MxB is targeting the HIV capsid by recognizing the region created at the intersection of three CA hexamers. We are further able to map this interaction to a few CA residues, located in a negatively charged well at the interface between the three CA hexamers. This work provides detailed residue-level mapping of the targeted capsid interface and how MxB interacts. This information could inspire the development of capsid-targeting therapies for HIV.",Structure and Mechanism of Acetylation by the N-Terminal Dual Enzyme NatA/Naa50 Complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155310,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 06 03,"NatA co-translationally acetylates the N termini of over 40% of eukaryotic proteins and can associate with another catalytic subunit, Naa50, to form a ternary NatA/Naa50 dual enzyme complex (also called NatE). The molecular basis of association between Naa50 and NatA and the mechanism for how their association affects their catalytic activities in yeast and human are poorly understood. Here, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of yeast NatA/Naa50 as a scaffold to understand coregulation of NatA/Naa50 activity in both yeast and human. We find that Naa50 makes evolutionarily conserved contacts to both the Naa10 and Naa15 subunits of NatA. These interactions promote catalytic crosstalk within the human complex, but do so to a lesser extent in the yeast complex, where Naa50 activity is compromised. These studies have implications for understanding the role of the NatA/Naa50 complex in modulating the majority of the N-terminal acetylome in diverse species.","Structure, Function, and Dynamics of the Gα Binding Domain of Ric-8A.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155309,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 06 10,"Ric-8A is a 530-amino acid cytoplasmic molecular chaperone and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for i, q, and 12/13 classes of heterortrimeric G protein alpha subunits (Gα).

As oldest sensory system, we know little about the influence of olfaction on the brain, but preclinical studies such as treatment of neurological diseases through it are in the ascendant. This makes it important to clarify the effects of olfaction on brain ECS and interstitial fluid (ISF) drainage. In this study, the effect of olfactory stimulation (eugenol, EUG) on ISF flow in hippocampus and its association with aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) had been investigated. The results show that eugenol can significantly increase the activity of hippocampal neurons, but reduce the clearance and diffusion rates of Gd-DTPA and A-594 in hippocampus. Similarly, eugenol inhalation slows down the rate of Gd-DTPA in CSF entering the hippocampus and its clearance. And knockout of Aqp4 gene aggravated these processes. In vitro results showed that after Aqp4 gene silencing, astrocytes grew slowly, with significantly decreased cells number, less nuclei, atrophied bodies and shorter processes. These results concluded that olfactory stimulation can change the ECS structure of the hippocampus, slow down the ISF drainage, and improve the function of neurons, while Aqp4 plays important roles.",Structure-based discovery of antiviral inhibitors targeting the E dimer interface of Japanese encephalitis virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155294,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 03,"Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod-borne viruses posing a great threat to human beings worldwide. The E dimer configuration of the flavivirus was prominent during viral assembly, maturation and entry. Neutralization antibodies targeting E dimer played the important role in controlling the flavivirus infection. Previously, the ideal drug target of small molecular inhibitors of JEV was viral proteases and polymerases. The crystal structure of JEV E protein showed a conserved pocket in it is important at membrane fusion step. Recently, a set of anti-virus drugs has been found by virtual screening. Here, we show that the fusion-loop pocket of JEV E protein was a conservative region and an ideal drug target. ChemDiv-3 from virtual screening as the lead compound was found to show a relatively modest inhibition effect for JEV in vitro and in vivo test and could interfere with the formation of JEV sE dimer. ChemDiv-3 interacts with the amino acid residues ASN 313, PRO 314, ALA 315, and VAL 323 in E protein via hydrogen bonds for occupation of the fusion-loop pocket. The key binding sites LYS 312, ALA 513 and THR 317 forming the fusion-loop pocket are the same and other auxiliary sites are similar among the flavivirus.

To establish infection in host cells, DENV require host cellular mechanism to suppress and evade innate immunity for their replication. In this study, Ccr4-Not complex genes were screened by using RNAi approach in DENV-infected A549 and Huh7 cells. We found that CNOT2 plays a proviral role in DENV infection. The expression level of CNOT2 was up-regulated in DENV-infected cells. Down-regulation of CNOT2 significantly reduced DENV RNA replication and protein synthesis. Mechanism study showed that CNOT2 knockdown enhanced JAK-STAT antiviral signaling during DENV infection. Further analysis revealed that CNOT2 negatively modulated IFN-Independent Non-Canonical JAK/STAT pathway by accelerating the mRNA decay of JAK1 and STAT1 via its interaction with CNOT6/6L and CNOT7/8 deadenylases. Overall, these results demonstrate that CNOT2 is a novel negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway and supports DENV infection.",A knock-in mouse model of Pendred syndrome with Slc26a4 L236P mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155292,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 03,"SLC26A4 gene mutations lead to Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB4).

In this study, we generated a knock-in mouse model of Pendred syndrome with Slc26a4 L236P mutation to mimic the most common mutation found in human. Some L236P mice were observed to have significant vestibular dysfunction including torticollis and circling, the giant otoconia and destruction of the otoconial membrane was observed in L236P mice. Unlike other profoundly deafness in Slc26a4 mouse model, L236P mice present mild to profound hearing loss, consistent with the hearing threshold, inner ear hair cells also lost from slight to significant. Together, these data demonstrate that the L236P mouse phenotype is more similar to the human phenotype and should be used as a tool for further research into the human Pendred syndrome.",The role of monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) in angiotensin II-induced macrophage apoptosis and vulnerable plaque formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155290,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 03,"Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the main cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Angiotensin II (Ang II) and macrophage apoptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to address the role of monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) in Ang II-induced macrophage apoptosis and vulnerable plaque formation. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, Ang II promoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent macrophage apoptosis. Ang II markedly upregulated the expression of MCPIP1 via activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Treatment with MCPIP1 shRNA downregulated ER stress-related proteins and decreased macrophage apoptosis induced by Ang II. Ang II also activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in macrophages. Inhibition of AMPK reduced macrophage apoptosis by inhibiting the p38 MAPK/MCPIP1/ER stress pathway. Furthermore, blocking the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) with losartan effectively inhibited Ang II-induced macrophage apoptosis and AMPK/p38 MAPK/MCPIP1/ER pathway activation. In the atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque model in mice, losartan inhibited the progression of atherosclerosis and transformed vulnerable plaque into a more stable phenotype. Moreover, losartan markedly decreased the number of CD68+TUNEL+, CD68+MCPIP1+, CD68+p-eIF2α+ and CD68+CHOP+ cells in the lesion area. Taken together, Ang II promotes macrophage apoptosis via the AMPK/p38 MAPK/MCPIP1/ER stress pathway in macrophages via its receptor AT1R, which may contribute to vulnerable plaque formation. Our study clarifies a novel regulatory role of MCPIP1 in Ang II-induced macrophage apoptosis and plaque instability, providing a potential therapeutic target for prevention of ACS.",DUSP26 regulates podocyte oxidative stress and fibrosis in a mouse model with diabetic nephropathy through the mediation of ROS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155289,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 03,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of renal failure worldwide. Unfortunately, the pathogenetic mechanism of DN is far from to be understood. Dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26) is a member of the Dusp protein family, and is suggested to be involved in divers biological and pathological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. However, its role in the development of DN is still vague. In this study, we found that DUSP26 expression was increased in kidney of DN patients. Then, the wild type (DUSP26+/+) and gene knockout (DUSP26-/-) mice were used to further explore the effects of DUSP26 on DN development induced by streptozotocin (STZ). DUSP26 deficiency accelerated renal injury and dysfunction, as evidenced by the elevated glomerulosclerosis, reduced expression of Nephrin and promoted glomerular basement membrane thickness. In addition, STZ treatment resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, H2O2 overproduction and superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduction in renal cortex or glomeruli of mice. The ROS production caused the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) signaling in kidney glomeruli of STZ-induced mice. These in vivo pathological processes were further confirmed in the differentiated podocytes stimulated by glucose (GLU). Intriguingly, we found that STZ-induced DN as mentioned above was further accelerated by DUSP26-/- in mice following STZ injection. Moreover, STZ-induced fibrosis in kidney glomeruli of DN mice was markedly prolonged in DUSP26-knockout mice through potentiating transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression. More importantly, reducing ROS generation could significantly abolish DUSP26 knockdown-exacerbated TGF-β1 expression and MAPKs activation, thereby protecting podocytes from GLU-induced podocyte injury. Thus, DUSP26-regulated DN development was largely dependent on ROS generation. Taken together, we concluded that DUSP26 might be a promising therapeutic target for developing effective treatments against DN progression.",Differences in the acidic sensitivity of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) between chickens and mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155288,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 03,"Chickens, one of the most important industrial animals, are a biological animal model. Here we focused on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) to understand the pain system for acidic stimuli in chickens compared with mice. By using a whole-cell patch clamp system, we confirmed that acidic stimuli activate both chicken TRPV1 (cTRPV1) and mouse TRPV1 (mTRPV1), but the peak current of cTRPV1 is lower than that of mTRPV1, and it is difficult to desensitize cTRPV1 with an acidic stimulus compared to mTRPV1. Since the C-terminal of the calmodulin (CaM) binding site in TRPV1 was reported as one of the important structures for TRPV1 desensitization, we made chimeric cTRPV1 in which the CaM binding site of chicken is changed to that of mouse (cTRPV1-mCaM). We also compared the acidic responses of native chicken dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells with that of mouse DRG cells. The TRPV1-mCaM results showed that the desensitization of mutant cTRPV1 was similar to that of mTRPV1, and that the basal activities of mutant cTRPV1 were significantly higher than those of cTRPV1. It was also difficult to desensitize the chicken DRG cells with an acidic stimulus, unlike the mouse DRG cells. These results suggest that there are differences in the pain transduction systems for acidic stimuli between chickens and mice that are caused by the dysfunction of the C-terminal CaM biding site of cTRPV1. These results imply that chickens repeatedly feel weak pain from an acidic stimulus, without desensitization.",Rotational biplanar Chevron osteotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155287,Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 06 03,"The Chevron osteotomy is a reliable and popular osteotomy for treating hallux valgus worldwide.

It is also tempting to use PSs to assess whether genetic variation can explain a part of the geographic distribution of a phenotype. However, it is not well known how the population genetic properties of the training and target samples affect the geographic distribution of PSs. Here, we evaluate geographic differences, and related biases, of PSs in Finland in a geographically well-defined sample of 2,376 individuals from the National FINRISK study. First, we detect geographic differences in PSs for coronary artery disease (CAD), rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body-mass index (BMI), and height, but not for Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Second, we use height as a model trait to thoroughly assess the possible population genetic biases in PSs and apply similar approaches to the other phenotypes. Most importantly, we detect suspiciously large accumulations of geographic differences for CAD, WHR, BMI, and height, suggesting bias arising from the population's genetic structure rather than from a direct genotype-phenotype association. This work demonstrates how sensitive the geographic patterns of current PSs are for small biases even within relatively homogeneous populations and provides simple tools to identify such biases. A thorough understanding of the effects of population genetic structure on PSs is essential for translational applications of PSs.",Impact and Evolutionary Determinants of Neanderthal Introgression on Transcriptional and Post-Transcriptional Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155285,American journal of human genetics,2019 06 14,"Archaic admixture is increasingly recognized as an important source of diversity in modern humans, and Neanderthal haplotypes cover 1%-3% of the genome of present-day Eurasians. Recent work has shown that archaic introgression has contributed to human phenotypic diversity, mostly through the regulation of gene expression. Yet the mechanisms through which archaic variants alter gene expression and the forces driving the introgression landscape at regulatory regions remain elusive. Here, we explored the impact of archaic introgression on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We focused on promoters and enhancers across 127 different tissues as well as on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. Although miRNAs themselves harbor few archaic variants, we found that some of these variants may have a strong impact on miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Enhancers were by far the regulatory elements most affected by archaic introgression: up to one-third of the tissues we tested presented significant enrichments. Specifically, we found strong enrichments of archaic variants in adipose-related tissues and primary T cells, even after accounting for various genomic and evolutionary confounders such as recombination rate and background selection. Interestingly, we identified signatures of adaptive introgression at enhancers of some key regulators of adipogenesis, raising the interesting hypothesis of a possible adaptation of early Eurasians to colder climates. Collectively, this study sheds new light on the mechanisms through which archaic admixture has impacted gene regulation in Eurasians and, more generally, increases our understanding of the contribution of Neanderthals to the regulation of acquired immunity and adipose homeostasis in modern humans."

In this study, we focused on natural variations in milk citrate and its interplay with calcium distribution in milk, in relation to processing properties. Milk samples from individual cows from farms varying in feeding and management practices were collected from April to June 2017 to maximize natural variations in citrate and calcium. Chemical composition, rennet coagulation properties, and ethanol stability were analyzed for all milk samples. We focused particularly on calcium distribution and citrate content and the correlation of these to other milk parameters. No significant change in citrate content was observed during the sampling period, which suggests that mechanisms other than feeding affect citrate levels in milk. Several significant correlations were found, including a positive correlation between complexed serum calcium and citrate, and a negative correlation between urea and ionic calcium. These are both of interest in relation to further processing, as with regard to the stability of UHT milk and in cheese making. Although the correlation between complexed serum calcium and citrate may be explained by their affinity, the underlying driver for the negative relationship between natural milk urea and ionic calcium needs to be clarified by further studies. Furthermore, milk from the different farms varied not only with regard to organic versus conventional farming systems; feeding practices between farms also play an important role in milk composition and functionality. However, none of the differences in milk composition between farms were found to decrease milk functionality and thus would probably not cause any processing problems.",Exploration of long noncoding RNA in bovine milk exosomes and their stability during digestion in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155266,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Previous studies have demonstrated that bovine milk contains mRNA and microRNA that are largely encapsulated in milk-derived exosomes. However, little information is available about long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in bovine milk. Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNA are of particular interest given their key role in gene expression and development. We performed a comprehensive analysis of lncRNA in bovine milk exosomes by RNA sequencing. We used a validated human in vitro digestion model to investigate the stability of lncRNA encapsulated in bovine milk exosomes during the digestion process. We identified 3,475 novel lncRNA and 6 annotated lncRNA. The lncRNA shared characteristics with those of other mammals in terms of length, exon number, and open reading frames. However, lncRNA showed higher expression than mRNAs. We selected 12 lncRNA of high-expression abundance and identified them by PCR. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that lncRNA regulate immune function, osteoblastogenesis, neurodevelopment, reproduction, cell proliferation, and cell-cell communication. We also investigated the 12 lncRNA using quantitative real-time PCR to reveal their expression profiles in milk exosomes during different stages of lactation (colostrum 2 d, 30 d, 150 d, and 270 d); their resulting expression levels in milk exosomes showed variations across the stages. A digestion experiment showed that bovine milk exosome lncRNA was resistant to in vitro digestion with different digestive juices, including saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and bile juice. Taken together, these results show for the first time that cow milk contains lncRNA, and that their abundance varied at different stages of lactation. As expected, bovine milk exosomal lncRNA were stable during in vitro digestion. These findings provide a basis for further understanding of the physiological role of milk lncRNA.",Genome-wide association studies for genetic effects that change during lactation in dairy cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155265,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Genetic effects on milk production traits in dairy cattle might change during lactation. However, most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for milk production traits assume that genetic effects are constant during lactation. This assumption might lead to missing these quantitative trait loci (QTL) whose effects change during lactation. This study aimed to screen the whole genome specifically for QTL whose effects change during lactation. For this purpose, 4 different GWAS approaches were performed using test-day milk protein content records: (1) separate GWAS for specific lactation stages, (2) GWAS for estimated Wilmink lactation curve parameters, (3) a GWAS using a repeatability model where SNP effects are assumed constant during lactation, and (4) a GWAS for genotype by lactation stage interaction using a repeatability model and accounting for changing genetic effects during lactation. Separate GWAS for specific lactation stages suggested that the detection power greatly differs between lactation stages and that genetic effects of some QTL change during lactation. The GWAS for estimated Wilmink lactation curve parameters detected many chromosomal regions for Wilmink parameter a (protein content level), whereas 2 regions for Wilmink parameter b (decrease in protein content toward nadir) and no regions for Wilmink parameter c (increase in protein content after nadir) were detected. Twenty chromosomal regions were detected with effects on milk protein content; however, there was no evidence that their effects changed during lactation. For 5 chromosomal regions located on chromosomes 3, 9, 10, 14, and 27, significant evidence was observed for a genotype by lactation stage interaction and thus their effects on milk protein content changed during lactation. Three of these 5 regions were only identified using a GWAS for genotype by lactation stage interaction. Our study demonstrated that GWAS for genotype by lactation stage interaction offers new possibilities to identify QTL involved in milk protein content. The performed approaches can be applied to other milk production traits. Identification of QTL whose genetic effects change during lactation will help elucidate the genetic and biological background of milk production.",Genetic relationships of lactose and freezing point with minerals and coagulation traits predicted from milk mid-infrared spectra in Holstein cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155264,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"The aim of the present study was to assess the relationships of lactose percentage (LP), lactose yield (LY), and freezing point (FRP) with minerals and coagulation properties predicted from mid-infrared spectra in bovine milk. To achieve this purpose, we analyzed 54,263 test-day records of 4,297 Holstein cows to compute (co)variance components with a linear repeatability animal model. Parity, stage of lactation, season of calving, and herd-test-date were included as fixed effects in the model, and additive genetic animal, within- and across-lactation permanent environment, and residual were included as random effects. Lactose percentage was more heritable (0.405 ± 0.027) than LY (0.121 ± 0.021) and FRP (0.132 ± 0.014). Heritabilities (± standard error) of predicted milk minerals varied from 0.375 ± 0.027 for Na to 0.531 ± 0.028 for P, and those of milk coagulation properties ranged from 0.348 ± 0.052 for rennet coagulation time to 0.430 ± 0.026 for curd firming time. Lactose percentage showed favorable (negative) genetic correlations with milk somatic cell score (SCS) and FRP, and it was almost uncorrelated with casein-related minerals (Ca and P) and coagulation properties. Moreover, LP was strongly correlated with Na (-0.783 ± 0.022), a mineral known to increase in the presence of intramammary infection (IMI) and high somatic cell count. Indeed, Na is the main osmotic replacer of lactose in mastitic milk when the blood-milk barrier is altered during IMI. Being strongly associated with milk yield, LY did not favorably correlate with coagulation properties, likely because of the negative correlation of this trait with protein and casein percentages. Milk FRP presented moderate and null genetic associations with Na and SCS, respectively. Results of the present study suggest that the moderate heritability of LP and its genetic correlations with IMI-related traits (Na and SCS) could be exploited for genetic selection against mastitis. Moreover, selection for LP would not impair milk coagulation characteristics or Ca and P content, which are important for cheesemaking.","Fatty acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress promoted lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, and endoplasmic reticulum stress existed in the liver of severe fatty liver cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155263,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, often termed ER stress, is intrinsically linked with perturbation of lipid metabolism in humans and mice. Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty acid treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and lipid accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty acid-induced ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows. However, the mechanistic relationship between ER stress and fatty liver in dairy cows remain to be determined.","Optimal harvest timing for brown midrib forage sorghum yield, nutritive value, and ration performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155262,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a viable alternative to corn silage (Zea mays L.) in double cropping rotations with forage winter cereals in New York due to a later planting date and potentially earlier harvest date of forage sorghum than is typical for corn silage. Our objective was to determine whether harvest of brachytic dwarf brown midrib forage sorghum can take place before the currently recommended soft dough harvest time while maintaining dry matter (DM) yield, forage nutritive value, and total mixed ration performance. Seven trials were conducted on 2 research farms in central New York from 2014 to 2017. Forage sorghum received 1 of 2 fertilizer N rates at planting (112 and 224 kg of N/ha). Stands were harvested at boot, flower, milk, and soft dough stages. Forage samples were analyzed for nutritive value and substituted for corn silage in a typical dairy total mixed ration at varying amounts using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. Timing of harvest affected yield and forage nutritive value for each individual trial and across trials, and the effects were independent of N fertilizer application rate. Averaged across trials, yield ranged from 10.7 Mg of DM/ha for the boot stage to 13.5, 15.2, and 15.8 Mg of DM/ha for the flower, milk, and soft dough stages, respectively. For individual trials, yield either remained constant with harvest beyond the flower stage (4 trials), or beyond the milk stage (1 trial), whereas for 2 trials yield increased up to the soft dough stage. At the later harvest stages, DM, starch, and nonfiber carbohydrates were increased, whereas crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and 30-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility were decreased. Without adjusting for DM intake, substitution of corn silage by forage sorghum harvested at the soft dough stage resulted in stable predicted metabolizable energy allowable milk, whereas the reduced starch content of earlier harvested sorghum resulted in less metabolizable energy allowable milk with greater substitution of corn silage for sorghum. Forage sorghum can be harvested as early as the flower or milk stage without losing DM yield, allowing for timely planting of forage winter cereal in a double cropping rotation. However, energy supplementation in the diet is needed to make up for reduced starch concentrations with harvest of sorghum at flower and milk growth stages.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 affects health, growth, and fecal microbiota in milk-fed veal calves.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155261,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of one specific strain of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SCB), on the growth performance, health, and fecal bacterial profile of veal calves. A total of 84 animals were enrolled in an experiment at a commercial veal farm for a total of 7 wk. Calves were fed twice a day with a milk replacer meal during the entire experiment and were randomly assigned to receive daily either SCB supplementation (10 × 109 cfu/d) or a placebo (CON). Individual feed intake and body weight were monitored on a daily and weekly basis, respectively. Fecal samples were collected at arrival to the veal facility (wk 0) and additional samples were taken on d 14 (wk 2) and d 49 (wk 7). These samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) to examine the bacterial profiles and real-time quantitative PCR to quantify Saccharomyces cerevisiae and specific bacterial groups. The significant increase of S. cerevisiae in the feces of SCB calves at wk 2 and 7 compared with wk 0 (respectively 1.7 × 107, 1.2 × 107, and 2.2 × 105 copy number of S. cerevisiae/g of feces) indicates a good survival of that yeast strain along the gastrointestinal tract. Supplementation of SCB did not improve overall growth performance with regard to average daily gain (ADG), final body weight, and feed intake. Nevertheless, a total of 69.1% of nonsupplemented calves had diarrhea and 28.6% experienced severe diarrhea, whereas 50.0% of the calves supplemented with SCB had diarrhea and 9.5% experienced severe diarrhea. With respect to antibiotic use, 89.7% of the diarrheic calves recorded in the CON group were treated, whereas only 66.7% of the SCB diarrheic calves received an antibiotic. In addition, diarrheic calves supplemented with SCB maintained an ADG similar to nondiarrheic animals, whereas the CON diarrheic calves had a significantly lower ADG in comparison with nondiarrheic CON calves. Fecalibacterium was the most predominant bacterial genus in fecal samples of nondiarrheic and diarrheic calves supplemented with SCB, whereas fecal microbiota was predominated by Collinsella in diarrheic calves from the CON group. Live yeast supplementation in milk replacer led to a decrease of diarrhea in milk-fed veal calves and the fecal microbiota of diarrheic calves maintained a healthy community similar to nondiarrheic animals, with Fecalibacterium being the predominant genus.","The effect of partial substitution of rapeseed meal and faba beans by Spirulina platensis microalgae on milk production, nitrogen utilization, and amino acid metabolism of lactating dairy cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155260,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Alternative protein sources such as microalgae and faba beans may have environmental benefits over rapeseed. We studied the effects of rapeseed meal (RSM) or faba beans (FB) as a sole protein feed or as protein feeds partially substituted with Spirulina platensis (spirulina) microalgae on milk production, N utilization, and AA metabolism of dairy cows. Eight multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (113 ± 36.3 d in milk; mean ± SD) were used in a balanced, replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and 21-d periods. Four cows in one Latin square were rumen cannulated. Treatments were 2 isonitrogenously fed protein sources, RSM or rolled FB, or one of these sources with half of its crude protein substituted by spirulina (RSM-SPI and FB-SPI). Cows had ad libitum access to total mixed rations consisting of grass silage, barley, sugar beet pulp, minerals, and experimental protein feed. The substitution of RSM with FB did not affect dry matter intake (DMI) but decreased neutral detergent fiber intake and increased the digestibility of other nutrients. Spirulina in the diet decreased DMI and His intake. Spirulina had no effect on Met intake in cows on RSM diets but increased it in those on FB diets. Energy-corrected milk (ECM) and protein yields were decreased when RSM was substituted by FB. Milk and lactose yields were decreased in cows on the RSM-SPI diet compared with the RSM diet but increased in those on FB-SPI compared with FB. The opposite was true for milk fat and protein concentrations; thus, spirulina in the diet did not affect ECM. Feed conversion efficiency (ECM:DMI) increased in cows on FB diets with spirulina, whereas little effect was observed for those on RSM diets. The substitution of RSM by FB decreased arterial concentration of Met and essential AA. Spirulina in the diet increased milk urea N and ruminal NH4-N and decreased the efficiency of N utilization in cows on RSM diets, whereas those on FB diets showed opposite results. Met likely limited milk production in cows on the FB diet as evidenced by the decrease in arterial Met concentration and milk protein yield when RSM was substituted by FB. The results suggest the potential to improve milk production response to faba beans with supplementation of Met-rich feeds such as spirulina. This study also confirmed spirulina had poorer palatability than RSM and FB despite total mixed ration feeding and lower milk production when spirulina partially replaced RSM.","Consumer insights on prepackaged Cheddar cheese shreds using focus groups, conjoint analysis, and qualitative multivariate analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155259,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"This study established attractive attributes and drivers of purchase for prepackaged Cheddar cheese shreds. Seven focus groups of Cheddar cheese shred consumers (n = 61) were conducted to probe consumer beliefs regarding packaging, ingredients, label claims, and applications of prepackaged Cheddar cheese shreds. Subsequently, an online survey was developed utilizing the key attributes from the focus groups. The survey (n = 1,288) included maximum difference scaling, Kano questions, and adaptive choice-based conjoint analysis. Additionally, 9 different commercial Cheddar cheese shreds varying in color, shred thickness, brand, and price were selected for a follow-up qualitative multivariate analysis to gain further consumer insight on attribute importance. Consumers (n = 13) were provided with commercial packages of shreds to evaluate over a 4-week period. Consumers journaled their likes and dislikes after use of each cheese shred and subsequently participated in a final 2.5-h focus group and projective mapping exercise. Consumers placed highest importance on price, followed by nutrition claims, color, sharpness, thickness, and label claims. Four consumer clusters were identified from conjoint utility scores. One consumer cluster exhibited preference for value-added features such as nutrition claims and brand, and another consumer cluster placed importance on shred color, whereas the other 2 groups were driven primarily by price. The qualitative multivariate analysis results confirmed the focus group and survey results: meltability, orange color, lack of clumps, ability to reseal the bag, and desirable ""Cheddar"" flavor were also preferred Cheddar shred qualities.",Reliability of breeding values for feed intake and feed efficiency traits in dairy cattle: When dry matter intake recordings are sparse under different scenarios.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155258,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"Currently, routine recordings of dry matter intake (DMI) in commercial herds are practically nonexistent. Recording DMI from commercial herds is a prerequisite for the inclusion of feed efficiency (FE) traits in dairy cattle breeding goals. To develop future on-farm phenotyping strategies, recording strategies that are low cost and less demanding logistically and that give relatively accurate estimates of the animal's genetic merit are therefore needed. The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate genetic parameters for daily DMI and FE traits and use the estimated parameters to simulate daily DMI phenotypes under different DMI recording scenarios (SCN) and (2) to use the simulated data to estimate for different scenarios the associated reliability of estimated breeding value and accuracies of genomic prediction for varying sizes of reference populations. Five on-farm daily DMI recording scenarios were simulated: once weekly (SCN1), once monthly (SCN2), every 2 mo (SCN3), every 3 mo (SCN4), and every 4 mo (SCN5). To estimate reliability of estimated breeding values, DMI and FE observations and true breeding values were simulated based on variance components estimated for daily observations of Nordic Red cows. To emulate realistic on-farm recording, 5 data set replicates, each with 36,037 DMI and FE records, were simulated for real pedigree and data structure of 789 Holstein cows. Observations for the 5 DMI recording scenarios were generated by discarding data in a step-wise manner from the full simulated data per the scenario's definitions. For each of these scenarios, reliabilities were calculated as correlation between the true and estimated breeding values. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated for daily DMI, residual feed intake (RFI), and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) fitting the random regression model. Data for variance components were from 227 primiparous Nordic Red dairy cows covering 8 to 280 d in milk. Lactation-wise heritability for DMI, RFI, and ECE was 0.33, 0.12, and 0.32, respectively, and daily heritability estimates during lactation ranged from 0.18 to 0.45, 0.08 to 0.32, and 0.08 to 0.45 for DMI, RFI, and ECE, respectively. Genetic correlations for DMI between different stages of lactation ranged from -0.50 to 0.99. The comparison of different on-farm DMI recording scenarios indicated that adopting a less-frequent recording scenario (SCN3) gave a similar level of accuracy as SCN1 when 17 more daughters are recorded per sire over the 46 needed for SCN1. Such a strategy is less demanding logistically and is low cost because fewer observations need to be collected per animal. The accuracy of genomic predictions associated with the 5 recording scenarios indicated that setting up a relatively larger reference population and adopting a less-frequent DMI sampling scenario (e.g., SCN3) is promising. When the same reference population size was considered, the genomic prediction accuracy of SCN3 was only 5.0 to 7.0 percentage points lower than that for the most expensive DMI recording strategy (SCN1). We concluded that DMI recording strategies that are sparse in terms of records per cow but with slightly more cows recorded per sire are advantageous both in genomic selection and in traditional progeny testing schemes when accuracy, logistics, and cost implications are considered."

The starter diets had the same nutrient composition and moisture level but differed in particle size distribution. Calves fed CS tended to have a lower intermeal interval compared with calves fed RAH before weaning; however, meal frequency and duration, eating rate, and meal size were not affected by treatment before and after weaning, which resulted in no changes in feed intake and time spent eating. Rumination frequency was higher for calves fed CS than for calves fed RAH or RBP after weaning. Feeding RBP decreased rumination duration compared with CS and RAH after weaning; however, calves fed RBP had a higher rumination bout interval compared with calves fed CS. Calves fed CS spent more time ruminating compared with calves fed RAH or RBP after weaning. Feeding CS tended to decrease and decreased time devoted to standing and lying, respectively, compared with calves fed RBP; however, calves fed RBP tended to spend more time on nonnutritive oral behaviors compared with calves fed RAH. Calves fed CS sorted against particles retained on the 8-mm sieve of the Penn State Particle Separator (PSPS) and for particles retained on the 1.18-mm sieve of the PSPS. Feeding RAH increased sorting for particles retained on the 8- and 1.18-mm sieves of the PSPS. Calves fed RBP sorted only for particles retained on the 1.18-mm sieve of the PSPS. Calves fed RBP tended to be more susceptible to developing pneumonia compared with calves fed CS or RAH; however, frequency and duration of diarrhea and pneumonia or number of days needed to medicate the diseases were unchanged across treatment groups. Initial (d 3) blood total protein concentration was similar (6.51 g/dL) across treatment groups. Overall, replacing CS with RAH or RBP did not affect time devoted to eating and feed intake due to no significant changes in meal size or intermeal interval before and after weaning. Calves showed feed sorting at the extent to which they balanced intake of nutrients and met their nutritional needs. Calves in general were healthy; therefore, CS, RAH, or RBP can be used interchangeably based on availability and competitive feed price.",Lactobacillus plantarum CAU1055 ameliorates inflammation in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells and a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis animal model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155246,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"This study aimed to screen lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for their anti-inflammatory activity by using RAW264.7 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In all, 192 LAB strains were isolated from healthy human feces, of which 8 strains showed excellent nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity. Peptidoglycan extracts of these 8 LAB strains were subjected to NO assay, Western blot, and ELISA. Among the 8 tested strains, extracts of 4 strains significantly inhibited the production of NO, related enzyme activities such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and key cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells. The 4 strains belonged to Lactobacillus (CAU1054, CAU1055, CAU1064, and CAU1301). Oral administration of the 4 strains inhibited DSS-induced body weight loss, colon shortening, and colon damage in ICR mice. The colon tissue of the mice treated with Lactobacillus plantarum strain CAU1055 had significantly reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6. We found that strain CAU1055 could be used as a candidate probiotic strain for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Further studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of interaction between peptidoglycan of L. plantarum strain CAU1055 and upstream cellular signaling mediators.",Bioefficacy of hydroxy-selenomethionine as a selenium supplement in pregnant dairy heifers and on the selenium status of their calves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155245,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"This study aimed to determine the effects of supplementing pregnant heifers with the organic selenium (Se) source 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) during the last 8 wk of pregnancy on dam and calf Se status. A total of 42 in-calf heifers were recruited to the study and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments; a negative control (Con), sodium selenite (NaSe), or HMSeBA. Animals were blocked by body weight, body condition score, and expected calving date before treatment allocation. Following enrollment, all animals underwent a 7-wk wash-out period, after which they received their respective supplements, top-dressed daily onto a basal diet for the last 8 wk of pregnancy. Heifer blood samples were taken at weekly intervals from enrollment until 2 wk before expected calving date and as soon as possible after calving for determination of whole-blood glutathione peroxidase activity (GSH-Px) and plasma Se and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. Selenized AA were determined in plasma samples taken at 3 wk precalving. A colostrum sample was taken as close to parturition as possible for determination of colostrum total Se, selenized AA, and IgG concentration. Calves were blood sampled as close to birth as possible for determination of whole-blood GSH-Px activity and plasma Se and MDA concentrations. Differences in whole-blood GSH-Px activity did not become apparent until calving; GSH-Px activity was lowest in Con heifers but similar between NaSe and HMSeBA heifers. Plasma Se was lowest in unsupplemented heifers and greatest in those supplemented with HMSeBA; this was attributable to greater selenomethionine concentrations in the plasma of HMSeBA heifers. Colostrum Se was lowest in Con heifers and greatest in HMSeBA heifers. The greater Se concentration of HMSeBA heifers was attributable to a greater proportion of total Se comprising selenocysteine; the reason for this is not known. There was no effect of supplementation on colostrum IgG concentration. Plasma Se was lowest in calves born to Con heifers and greatest in those born to HMSeBA heifers. There were no effects of treatment on calf whole-blood GSH-Px activity or plasma MDA concentration. The enhanced Se status associated with HMSeBA supplementation is likely a consequence of selenomethionine supply and may confer benefits to both the dam and her calf postpartum.",Short communication: Selection for persistency by changing the shape of lactation curves with geometric morphometrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155244,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"The objective was to simulate the response to selection by modifying the shape of the lactation curve to improve persistency in Israeli first-parity Holstein cattle using geometric morphometrics and multivariate quantitative genetics. The 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinates representing the shape of the lactation curve were characterized using geometric morphometrics. Genetic parameters of daily milk yield were estimated for the individual animal model using REML. Results of selection were simulated using the multivariate breeders' equation. We defined 6 selection regimens: (1) decrease in the third month in milk (MIM), (2) increase in the ninth MIM, (3) decrease in the third MIM and increase in the ninth MIM, (4) decrease in the first MIM, (5) decrease in the second MIM, and (6) decrease in the fourth MIM. The first 3 selection criteria targeted changes in the MIM of previous measurements of persistency in the Israeli Holstein population, and the last 3 targeted the months with the highest variability. All selection regimens attempted to modify the shape of the lactation curve while keeping total milk yield constant. The first 3 selection regimens showed greater total responses, with the highest response for decrease in the third MIM and increase in the ninth MIM. Magnitudes of correlated responses consistently surpassed direct responses in all selection criteria, suggesting that selection on specific parts of the lactation curve would produce correlated responses in other parts. Predicted responses to selections were depicted as shape changes from the mean shape in the data set. Most predicted responses demonstrated a fairly similar shape compared with the lactation curve. The predicted responses of lactation shapes of the last 3 selection regimens were overall lower in the first 3 MIM and decreased less in the last MIM, demonstrating a much flatter shape and thus improved persistency.",Establishing a model of primary bovine hepatocytes with responsive growth hormone receptor expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155243,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"The liver becomes resistant to growth hormone before parturition in dairy cows (uncoupling of the somatotropic axis). However, the mechanism of growth hormone insensitivity has not been fully described. The aim of the present study was to improve a previous model of adult bovine hepatocytes in a sandwich culture system to ensure growth hormone receptor (GHR) expression. First, we modified the protocol for hepatocyte retrieval and tested the effect of short (18 min) and long (up to 30 min) warm ischemia on hepatocyte viability. Second, we used medium additives that affect GHR expression in vivo-insulin (INS), dexamethasone (DEX), both (INS+DEX), or no hormone additives (CTRL)-to ensure the functionality of hepatocytes, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase activity and urea concentration in the medium. We also used reverse transcriptase PCR of hepatocytes to evaluate expression of albumin (ALB), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4A), nuclear factor-κ-B-inhibitor α (NFKBIA), cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), and vimentin (VIM) mRNA. Moreover, we analyzed the expression of GHRtot (GHR), GHR1A, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) in response to exposure to media with the different compositions. Modification of the protocol (changes in rinsing and perfusion times, buffer composition, and the volume and standardization of collagenase) led to increased cell counts and cell viability. Short warm ischemia with the modified protocol significantly increased cell count (4.7 × 107 ± 1.9 × 107 vs. 3.5 × 106 ± 1.5 × 106 vital cells/g of liver) and viability (79.1 ± 8.4 vs. 37.1 ± 8.9%). Therefore, we gathered hepatocytes from the liver after short warm ischemia with the modified protocol. For these hepatocytes, lactate dehydrogenase activity was lower in media with INS and with DEX than in media with INS+DEX or CTRL; urea concentrations were highest at d 4 for INS+DEX. As well, HNF4A and ALB were more highly expressed in hepatocytes cultured with INS and INS+DEX than in those cultured with DEX or CTRL, and the substitution of DEX suppressed VIM and NFKBIA expression but increased PCK1 expression. The expression of GHR, GHR1A, and IGF1 was suppressed by dexamethasone (DEX and INS+DEX), whereas INS distinctly increased GHR, GHR1A, and IGF1 mRNA expression. Hepatocytes in a sandwich culture showed influenceable GHR expression; this study provides a model that can be used in studies examining factors that influence the expression and signal transduction of GHR in dairy cows.",Mammary gland metabolite utilization in response to exogenous glucose or long-chain fatty acids at low and high metabolizable protein levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155242,Journal of dairy science,2019 06 03,"We investigated mammary gland metabolism in lactating dairy cattle in response to energy from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels. According to a 6 × 6 Latin square design, 6 rumen-fistulated second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were abomasally infused with saline (LMP-C); isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d palm olein (LMP-LG), or 844 g/d essential AA (EAA; HMP-C); or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d glucose + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d palm olein + 844 g/d EAA (HMP-LG). Each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration (42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate on a dry matter basis) formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected on d 5 of each period. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk yield or composition differently than at the LMP level. Neither GG nor LG infusion stimulated milk protein or lactose yield, but fat yield tended to decrease with GG and tended to increase with LG. Infusion of GG increased arterial plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and decreased concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), nonesterified fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), total AA, EAA, and group 2 AA. Infusion of LG increased arterial triacylglycerides (TAG) and LCFA but did not affect EAA concentrations. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased arterial concentrations of BHB, urea, and all EAA groups and decreased the concentration of total non-EAA. Mammary plasma flow increased with GG and was not affected by LG or protein level. Uptake and clearance of total EAA and group 2 AA were affected or tended to be affected by GG × AA interactions, with their uptakes being lower and their clearances higher with GG, but only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG did not affect uptake or clearance of any AA group. The HMP level increased uptake and decreased clearance of all EAA groups and decreased non-EAA uptake. Infusion of GG tended to increase mammary glucose uptake, and tended to decrease BHB uptake only at the LMP level. Infusion of LG increased mammary uptake of TAG and LCFA and increased or tended to increase clearance of TAG and LCFA. We suspect GG increased mammary plasma flow to maintain intramammary energy and AA balance and stimulated lipogenesis in adipose, accounting for depressed arterial BHB and group 2 AA concentrations. Mammary glucose uptake did not cover estimated requirements for lactose and fat synthesis at the HMP level, except during HMP-GG infusion. Results of this study illustrate flexibility in mammary metabolite utilization when absorptive supply of glucogenic, lipogenic, and aminogenic substrate is increased.",Translation and cultural adaptation into Spanish of the Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155239,Archivos de la Sociedad Espanola de Oftalmologia,2019 06 03,"The purpose of the present study was to provide a translation into Spanish, as well as a cross-cultural adaptation, of the English version of the Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire (LVQOL).

For example, transcription involves the complex interplay between RNA polymerase II (Pol II), regulatory factors (RFs), and chromatin, but visualizing these dynamic molecular transactions in their native intracellular milieu remains elusive. Here, we zoom into single tagged genes using nanoscopy techniques, including an active target-locking, ultra-sensitive system that enables single-molecule detection in addressable sub-diffraction volumes, within crowded intracellular environments. We image, track, and quantify Pol II with single-molecule resolution, unveiling its dynamics during the transcription cycle. Further probing multiple functionally linked events-RF-chromatin interactions, Pol II dynamics, and nascent transcription kinetics-reveals detailed operational parameters of gene-regulatory mechanisms hitherto-unseen in vivo. Our approach sets the stage for single-molecule studies of complex molecular processes in live cells.",Alanine Tails Signal Proteolysis in Bacterial Ribosome-Associated Quality Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155236,Cell,2019 06 03,"In ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), Rqc2/NEMF closely supports the E3 ligase Ltn1/listerin in promoting ubiquitylation and degradation of aberrant nascent-chains obstructing large (60S) ribosomal subunits-products of ribosome stalling during translation. However, while Ltn1 is eukaryote-specific, Rqc2 homologs are also found in bacteria and archaea; whether prokaryotic Rqc2 has an RQC-related function has remained unknown. Here, we show that, as in eukaryotes, a bacterial Rqc2 homolog (RqcH) recognizes obstructed 50S subunits and promotes nascent-chain proteolysis. Unexpectedly, RqcH marks nascent-chains for degradation in a direct manner, by appending C-terminal poly-alanine tails that act as degrons recognized by the ClpXP protease. Furthermore, RqcH acts redundantly with tmRNA/ssrA and protects cells against translational and environmental stresses. Our results uncover a proteolytic-tagging mechanism with implications toward the function of related modifications in eukaryotes and suggest that RQC was already active in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) to help cope with incomplete translation.",Tracing Oncogene Rearrangements in the Mutational History of Lung Adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155235,Cell,2019 06 14,"Mutational processes giving rise to lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs) in non-smokers remain elusive. We analyzed 138 LADC whole genomes, including 83 cases with minimal contribution of smoking-associated mutational signature. Genomic rearrangements were not correlated with smoking-associated mutations and frequently served as driver events of smoking-signature-low LADCs. Complex genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis and chromoplexy, generated 74% of known fusion oncogenes, including EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS1, and KIF5B-RET. Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups-EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations. Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes."

It has been reported that statistical parametric mapping's (SPM's) probability values can be invalid for such cases. The purpose of this paper was to clarify the scope of validity for SPM analysis of nonuniformly and heterogeneously smooth one-dimensional (1D) data. We simulated a variety of nonuniformly and heterogeneously smooth Gaussian 1D data over a range of smoothness values, and computed Type I error rates across 10,000 simulation iterations for each smoothness type. Results showed that, in all cases, SPM accurately controlled error at the prescribed α=0.05. Moreover, the distribution of false positives was uniform across time, implying that all regions are equally likely to produce false positives, irrespective of local roughness. We nevertheless show that cluster-level inferences (i.e., p values specific to local regions of significance), while never exceeding alpha (by definition), may be over-or-underestimated by approximately 0.01 for the currently simulated scenarios. We conclude that SPM's null hypothesis rejection decisions are valid for both nonuniform and heterogeneous 1D data, but that clusters' p values may be marginally too small/large in rough/smooth regions, respectively. Since cluster-level p values never exceed α, these p value errors are negligible for hypothesis testing purposes. Nevertheless, inter-cluster p value comparisons should be avoided. Implications for statistical power and general results interpretation are discussed.",A framework for biomechanics simulations using four-chamber cardiac models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155211,Journal of biomechanics,2019 06 03,"Computational cardiac models have been extensively used to study different cardiac biomechanics; specifically, finite-element analysis has been one of the tools used to study the internal stresses and strains in the cardiac wall during the cardiac cycle. Cubic-Hermite finite element meshes have been used for simulating cardiac biomechanics due to their convergence characteristics and their ability to capture smooth geometries compactly-fewer elements are needed to build the cardiac geometry-compared to linear tetrahedral meshes. Such meshes have previously been used only with simple ventricular geometries with non-physiological boundary conditions due to challenges associated with creating cubic-Hermite meshes of the complex heart geometry. However, it is critical to accurately capture the different geometric characteristics of the heart and apply physiologically equivalent boundary conditions to replicate the in vivo heart motion. In this work, we created a four-chamber cardiac model utilizing cubic-Hermite elements and simulated a full cardiac cycle by coupling the 3D finite element model with a lumped circulation model. The myocardial fiber-orientations were interpolated within the mesh using the Log-Euclidean method to overcome the singularity associated with interpolation of orthogonal matrices. Physiologically equivalent rigid body constraints were applied to the nodes along the valve plane and the accuracy of the resulting simulations were validated using open source clinical data. We then simulated a complete cardiac cycle of a healthy heart and a heart with acute myocardial infarction. We compared the pumping functionality of the heart for both cases by calculating the ventricular work. We observed a 20% reduction in acute work done by the heart immediately after myocardial infarction. The myocardial wall displacements obtained from the four-chamber model are comparable to actual patient data, without requiring complicated non-physiological boundary conditions usually required in truncated ventricular heart models.",Extensive Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis in a Liver Transplant Patient: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155207,Transplantation proceedings,2019 06 03,"Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava is a clinical condition with very diverse presentations, ranging from asymptomatic patients to others with severe edema in the legs and lower torso. We report the case of a 27-year-old female patient, previously diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, with asymptomatic extensive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava. The thrombus extended from the renal veins up to the emergence of the hepatic veins, causing post-sinusoidal portal hypertension (Budd-Chiari syndrome). The patient underwent an orthotopic cadaveric liver transplant with removal of the retrohepatic vena cava and thrombectomy of blood clots from the infrahepatic vena cava. She initially recovered well from surgery, but on the 8 postoperative day she had a significant increase in hepatic injury markers and was diagnosed with rethrombosis of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A surgical thrombectomy was performed, with an intraoperative finding of chronic thrombus in both renal veins, previously undiagnosed. The thrombectomy was successful, but the patient's hepatic function continued to worsen and a second liver transplant was performed. After the second transplant she underwent several imaging exams that showed no signs of rethrombosis. She was kept on postoperative anticoagulation indefinitely, first with intravenous heparin then with rivaroxaban. An extensive investigation failed to identify any causes of thrombophilia associated with this vast thrombosis. She is currently alive and with good graft function 1 year and 4 months after the second transplant.",Liver Transplantation for Acute Liver Failure due to Yellow Fever: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155206,Transplantation proceedings,2019 06 03,"Yellow fever is a noncontagious disease caused by an arbovirus in the Flaviviridae family.

After the retransplant, he presented daily episodes of fever, even after the use of several antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal agents. A number of negative cultures from different sites were obtained. After an acute episode of mental confusion, the growth of S schenckii was observed in cultures from cerebrospinal fluid and ascites obtained from a diagnostic paracentesis.

Induction therapy was performed with thymoglobulin, and his current immunosuppression scheme included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. The patient had no history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient presented with 2 cutaneous lesions, localized on the back and abdomen, that appeared to be firm, painful, subcutaneous, erythematous nodules with an approximately 5 cm diameter overlying an infected focus and purulent material inside. The patient also had a fever and fatigue. Blood analysis showed pancytopenia with an elevation of inflammatory markers and graft dysfunction. Tissue cultures and skin biopsy with histological analysis were performed. Histopathology of the lesion showed a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate without granulomas, and acid-fast bacillus staining was negative. Nevertheless, serum QuantiFERON testing was positive. But polymerase chain reaction finally confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis. A chest computed tomography scan showed a lung pattern of miliary tuberculosis. The patient was treated with multidrug tuberculosis therapy, resulting in lesion clearance after 3 weeks. Tuberculosis is a serious infection, especially in high-risk patients, such as those in an immunocompromised state.

Previous studies have identified DPBG injury as a cause of post-liver transplant (LT) biliary stenosis; this complication is a major cause of post-LT morbidity. The incidence of biliary stenosis in our center is high (38.1%). This study evaluates the lesion of DPBG in response to ischemia. Graft BD was collected in adult LT between August 2016-July 2017, from donation after brain death. Samples of 45 grafts were collected at 2 moments: BD1-during graft preparation and BD2-before biliary anastomosis. Histological analysis of the samples was performed and then classified according to degree of lesion (0, ≤50%, and >50%). A comparison was made between the degree of lesion and graft ischemia, graft histology, donor, and procurement variables. The DPBG lesion was more frequent in BD2 (20.9% vs 7%, P = .079). BD2 lesions with DPBG lesions had higher medians and means at all times of ischemia. The difference was greater in the warm ischemia time (0: 43.3 ± 12.53 minutes vs ≤50%: 52.4 ± 14.38 minutes, P = .068). The group of BD1 with DPBG lesion presented superior median cold ischemia time (CIT). In the analysis of the remaining variables there were also no statistically significant differences.

To date, there are no studies that integrate simultaneous assessment of perceived barriers to physical activity and engagement in physical activity in older adults with PAD and diabetes. This integration is key to understanding the implications of barriers to physical activity and to developing strategies to address those barriers. Therefore, this study investigated the unique physical activity experiences of older adults with PAD and diabetes. This study used a concurrent mixed methods design. Ten adults aged 65 years and older with PAD and diabetes completed semistructured interviews about experiences with physical activity, self-reported questionnaires assessing quality of life and fear of falling, and measures of physical function (eg, 6-minute walk test, chair stand, gait speed). Physical activity was measured objectively with accelerometry. Inductive content analysis was used to identify themes, and integrated analysis was performed to evaluate patterns among qualitative and quantitative variables. On average, participants were 74 years old and spent 10% of their time in moderate or vigorous physical activity (range: 3%-18%); 80% of participants were men. Barriers to physical activity identified through qualitative interviews included lack of accessibility, lack of enjoyment of activity, lack of motivation, and pain and physical health. Facilitators to physical activity were social support, accessibility and convenience, and enjoyment of the activity. Participants with more sedentary time and less moderate or vigorous physical activity tended to report greater fear of falling and greater barriers to physical activity and achieved lower distances in 6-minute walk tests. This research provides insight into both the nature of perceived barriers to physical activity and engagement in physical activity among older adults with PAD and diabetes. The integration of self-reported measures and objective measures facilitates our understanding of the lived experiences of individuals with these conditions. Study findings can be used to support further investigation into factors that influence engagement in physical activity in individuals with PAD and diabetes and to assist in the development of strategies to address identified barriers.",Diagnosis and management of external iliac endofibrosis: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155167,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 06 03,"External iliac artery endofibrosis is an uncommon, nonatherosclerotic disease seen in endurance cyclists. It is poorly identified by providers. These otherwise healthy patients usually present with symptoms of arterial insufficiency, such as thigh or buttock pain, loss of power, or weakness occurring during strenuous exercises. These symptoms subside rapidly with rest. As these patients lack traditional risk factors of peripheral artery disease, their symptoms are often overlooked or are attributed to other etiologies, resulting in mismanagement and delayed treatment. In this case study, we report our experience with the successful management of a 48-year-old male who is a longstanding, avid cyclist. He self-referred to our institution after extensive research of providers familiar with his problem and at the recommendation of other cyclists with similar experiences.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the implementation and efficacy of a system designed to reduce average length of stay on a vascular surgery service. To effectively reduce the average length of stay in our center, we restructured patient rounds, implemented multidisciplinary rounds, introduced clinical pathways to postoperative care, and expanded outpatient management of postoperative patients. A total of 1697 adult vascular surgery patients discharged while under the medical direction of a vascular surgeon between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2016, were included in the study. Improving communication with critical staff and using procedural space outside of the main operating rooms led to a 2.8-day reduction in the length of stay (10.8 vs 8.0, P < .001). There was a trend toward a reduction in the 30-day readmission rate (12% vs 10%, respectively; P = .01) and no significant difference in the case-mix index as a measure of illness severity (2.5 vs 2.4, respectively; P = .15). Length of stay reductions were heterogeneous among the types of vascular diseases studied, with greater improvements seen in patients undergoing lower extremity amputation, lower extremity angiogram, and endovascular aneurysm repair for nonruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Less pronounced differences were observed in patients undergoing carotid artery endarterectomy or stenting and lower extremity bypasses. In conclusion, restructuring team rounds and instituting a multidisciplinary approach to discharge planning produced significant reductions in length of stay without a deleterious effect on patient care which may impact hospital profitability.",Interventional procedures in cardiovascular diseases-Training of nurses to work in a catheterization laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155162,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 06 03,"Cardiovascular diseases remain the most frequent reason for deaths in the Republic of Bulgaria and also in Europe for 2016.

Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups and underwent a PICC placement procedure between August 2014 and November 2014 and were then observed until February 2015. Thirty of them (group A) underwent a PICC placement procedure, after proper ultrasound scan and under local anesthesia, of the veins of the upper limb, internal jugular and axillary veins. The mean (±standard deviation) age of patients was 54.8 ± 9.2 years (range, 18-80 years). The primary success rate was 100% for all patients in both the groups. The procedure was not painful for the patients. In group A, after 3 months of surveillance, 7 devices were removed because the patients' therapy came to an end, and only in one incident, the catheter was removed due to soft tissue infection. Tunneled PICCs seem to be a safe option and an easy alternative to perform in contrast to placement without a tunnel. It is an easy, cheap procedure that allows us to catheterize the vein with a larger caliber and create an exit point at any preselected point on the upper limb.",Lecture-based education versus simulation in educating student nurses about central line-associated bloodstream infection-prevention guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155159,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 06 03,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention published central line-associated bloodstream infection-prevention guidelines to prevent complications and improve the quality of care; however, it is not known whether student nurses receive education about these guidelines or what is the best approach to this education. This study aimed to assess student nurses' knowledge of central line-associated bloodstream infection-prevention guidelines and to compare the effectiveness of simulation versus classroom lecturing in educating them with these prevention guidelines. It used a two-arm randomized controlled trial design with pre-post tests. It was conducted at two public universities in Jordan, with a total of 131 fourth-year student nurses as participants. The participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (receiving classroom lectures) and the control group (receiving a simulation course). Pretest and posttest data were collected using a structured questionnaire of 23 items. The overall knowledge scores in the pretest were poor with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. In the posttest, both groups showed improvement in the majority of items. The participants in the classroom lectures group scored slightly higher in the majority of items in the posttest; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the overall scores t (129) = 1.03, P = (.57), (95% confidence interval = -1.9 to 4.3).

The risk of CVD increases among those who are middle aged and among people with certain sociodemographic factors related to that risk. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of the risk of CVD and assess the factors related to this risk among adults aged 40-65 years. The study consisted of 327 individuals (208 [63.6%] women and 119 [36.4%] men) from a family health center (FHC) in Antalya, Turkey, who volunteered to participate in the study. The average age of the patients was 52.7 years. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April and September of 2016. The risk levels of the participants were calculated using the HeartScore program in 4 categories (low, moderate, high, and very high risk). In addition, sociodemographic and medical data were collected from the participants, as well. It was found that 3.4% of the patients were at a very high risk, 8% were at a high risk, 22% were at a moderate risk, and 66.7% were at a low risk of CVD. Major variables increasing this risk included diastolic hypertension by 7.49 (3.77-14.88) times. The individuals who completed secondary and high school had 2.44 times greater risk compared with those who completed primary school and lower education; moreover, those who completed university and higher education had the 2.24 times greater risk. Cardiovascular risk screening is important for apparently healthy individuals. The HeartScore program is practical for nurses and other health care professionals in FHCs to estimate individuals' risk of CVD.",Peripherally inserted central catheter ports: A vascular access specialist's systematic approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155157,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 06 03,"Implanted ports are an important vascular access device for patients with malignancies requiring long-term chemotherapy. Peripherally placed ports are increasing in use as they are a safe, cost-effective alternative to chest-placed ports. Most peripheral ports can be placed bedside by specialist nurses in designated clinical areas rather than costly operating rooms or interventional radiology suites. Peripheral ports are considered less invasive compared with chest port placement because of reduced procedural risk. To enhance the success rate of peripheral port placement and minimize risks, we provide vascular access specialists with a systematic approach along with some technical advice tips and tricks to help avoid mechanical complications such as repeated puncture of the vein, excessive bleeding, thrombosis or skin dehiscence, as well as latent complications such as catheter migration and catheter-related blood stream infection.","Influence of smoking on physical function, physical activity, and cardiovascular health parameters in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease: A cross-sectional study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155156,Journal of vascular nursing : official publication of the Society for Peripheral Vascular Nursing,2019 06 03,"The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of smoking on physical activity, walking capacity, and cardiovascular health in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

However, major questions and concerns remain regarding the benefits and risks of ADHD medication, especially in real-world settings. We conducted a qualitative systematic review of studies that investigated the effects of ADHD medication on behavioral and neuropsychiatric outcomes using linked prescription databases from the last 10 years and identified 40 studies from Europe, North America, and Asia. Among them, 18 used within-individual designs to account for confounding by indication. These studies suggested short-term beneficial effects of ADHD medication on several behavioral or neuropsychiatric outcomes (i.e., injuries, motor vehicle accidents, education, substance use disorder), with estimates suggesting relative risk reduction of 9% to 58% for these outcomes. The within-individual studies found no evidence of increased risks for suicidality and seizures. Replication studies are needed for several other important outcomes (i.e., criminality, depression, mania, psychosis). The available evidence from pharmacoepidemiology studies on long-term effects of ADHD medication was less clear. We discuss time-varying confounding and other limitations that should be considered when interpreting results from pharmacoepidemiology studies.

During earlier stages of pregnancy, the transfer of maternal thyroid hormones to the fetus is vital for adequate neurologic development. The presence of severe maternal thyroid dysfunction, particularly severe iodine deficiency, is devastating, leading to irreversible neurologic sequelae. Moreover, mild maternal thyroid conditions, such as a mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency, may also lead to milder neurologic and behavioral conditions later during the life of the offspring. Maternal dysglycemia due to pregestational or gestational diabetes mellitus is another common situation in which fetal development encounters a hostile environment. Hyperglycemia in utero may trigger metabolic conditions in the offspring, including abnormalities of glucose tolerance and weight excess. Physicians assisting pregnant women have to be aware about these conditions, because they may go unnoticed if not properly screened. Because an early diagnosis and appropriate management may prevent most of the possible negative consequences for the progeny, the prevention, early diagnosis, and proper management of these endocrine conditions should be offered to all women undergoing pregnancy. Here, we comprehensively review the current evidence about the effects of maternal thyroid dysfunction and maternal dysglycemia on the cognitive function and carbohydrate metabolism in the offspring, two prevalent conditions of utmost importance for the child's health and development.",Parental age and child outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155113,Fertility and sterility,2019 06 03,"This review summarizes the impact of parental age on children's health outcomes beyond the perinatal period.

Based on their well-studied structure-activity relationships, we semi-rationally incorporated two His mutations into glutamate receptors near ligand binding pockets as an allosteric site. The engineered glutamate receptors could be allosterically activated upon treatment of Pd(bpy) complex (bpy: 2,2'-bipyridine) through stabilization of the activated conformation in mammalian cells and cultured neurons.

Over the past two decades, significant effort has been devoted to optimizing and discovering bioorthogonal reagents that are faster, fluorogenic, and orthogonal to the already existing bioorthogonal repertoire. Conversely, efforts to explore bioorthogonal reagents whose reactivity can be controlled in space and/or time are limited. The ""activatable"" bioorthogonal reagents that do exist are often unimodal, meaning that their reagent's activation method cannot be easily modified to enable activation with red-shifted wavelengths, enzymes, or metabolic-byproducts and ions like H2O2 or Fe3+. Here, we summarize the available activatable bioorthogonal reagents with a focus on our recent addition: modular caged cyclopropenes. We designed caged cyclopropenes to be unreactive to their bioorthogonal partner until they are activated through the removal of the cage by light, an enzyme, or another reaction partner. To accomplish this, their structure includes a nitrogen atom at the cyclopropene C3 position that is decorated with the desired caging group through a carbamate linkage. This 3-N cyclopropene system can allow control of cyclopropene reactivity using a multitude of already available photo- and enzyme-caging groups.

Existing strategies employ genetic tools like the astrocyte specific promoters glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or Aldh1L1 to create transgenic animals with fluorescently labeled astrocytes. Recently, small molecule targeting moieties have enabled the delivery of bright fluorescent dyes to astrocytes.

The use of synthetic orthogonal circuits for detection of dynamic behaviors has been limited by the remarkable stability of conventional reporters. While providing an appealing feature for signal amplification, the long half-life of reporters such as GFP is typically not ideal to measure transient signals and dynamic behaviors. This chapter explores the use of post-translational regulation for the design of input-dependent circuits that produce output signals with enhanced dynamic range and superior dynamic resolution of the input. Specifically, we report the use of the NanoDeg-a bifunctional system that mediates proteasomal degradation of a cellular target with high specificity and control over rate of decay-to achieve input-dependent depletion of a GFP reporter. Feedforward loop topologies were explored and compared to conventional reporters placed directly under control of the input to identify the ideal circuit architecture that allows placing both the GFP output and the GFP-specific NanoDeg under control of a common input and regulate GFP levels not only through input-dependent transcriptional activation but also input-dependent degradation. The circuit design was implemented experimentally by building a heat-sensitive reporter and exploring the design features that result in detection of the cell response with maximal output dynamic range and dynamic resolution of the heat shock. The method reported provides the design rules of a novel synthetic biology module that will be generally useful to build complex genetic networks for enhanced detection of highly dynamic behaviors.",Human immunodeficiency virus and the liver: The impact of coinfection with hepatotropic viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155042,Annals of hepatology,2019 06 03,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) predisposes for liver damage during coinfection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) and increases the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV).

In fish, the use of germline chimeras to study the development of germ cells was first conducted in the 1990s in the model fish species medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). More recently, surrogate propagation has been actively investigated as a means of efficient gamete production not only in model fish species but also in aquaculture species and endangered species. Surrogate propagation has the following components: combination of the donor and host species, host sterilization, donor cell preparation, transplantation of germ cells, and gametogenesis and gamete production in surrogate fish. In this review, we first provide a general overview of previous studies related to germ cell transplantation and the methodologies developed for different species, and consider how these have been applied in practice. Second, we consider the development of primordial germ cells in fish embryos, particularly the molecular biological approaches used for the visualization of germ cells and sterilization of host embryos. Finally, we discuss sex control in germline chimeras, which may be a key component of the use of surrogate production in aquaculture. We focus on techniques to produce sterile fish, as these are crucial to the exclusive production of donor gametes in a surrogate host. The advantages and disadvantages of various aspects of surrogate propagation are discussed, the potential use of surrogate propagation as a seedling production system is considered, and future perspectives for aquaculture are suggested.",Eel sperm cryopreservation: An overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155036,Theriogenology,2019 06 03,"The eels are teleost fishes from the order Anguilliformes that includes several species with high commercial value. Due to the high interest for aquaculture production of some eel species and for the need to restore eel species that are endangered, several research groups have directed their research toward developing protocols to cryopreserve the spermatozoa of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla). In this review, we provide an overview on the different protocols that have been developed so far. The first developed protocols used DMSO as cryoprotectant in both species with good success, obtaining sperm motilities of over 45% in Japanese eel and over 35% in European eel. Moreover, sperm cryopreserved using DMSO was successfully used in fertilization trials, although with low fertilization rates. However, recent studies show that DMSO produce epigenetic changes in eel sperm and therefore, the last developed protocols used methanol as cryoprotectant instead. Cryopreservation protocols using methanol as cryoprotectant, showed improved motility values in both Japanese and European eel. In addition, the latest protocols have been adapted to cryopreserve larger volumes of sperm of up to 5 mL, which is useful for larger scale fertilization trials.

In polyandry, sperm competition occurs when sperm from two or more males compete to fertilize eggs from a female. Here we review how sperm competition from hatchery origin fish can cause loss of genetic variability in fish populations kept in captivity and in wild populations. In fish hatchery practices, sperm competition occurs in mass spawners that release gametes in tanks, and in artificial fertilizations when pooled semen is used. In mass spawnings sperm competition is difficult to tease apart from pre-mating competition and other post-mating selective mechanisms, whereas, studies focused on the use of pooled semen in different fish species have shown a clear relationship between sperm motility parameters and precedence in fertilization. In both situations, sperm competition will result in a loss of genetic variability that accumulates over generations, but hatchery protocols can be adjusted to mitigate it. Another source of concern regarding sperm competition for hatchery produced fish is the spatial and temporal overlap in spawning with wild individuals, either via aquaculture escapees or purposeful stocking programs. This may result in sperm competition between hatchery origin and wild males and impact natural populations. Our review suggests that in order to give every adult selected as broodstock an equal opportunity to produce offspring in captivity, mass spawning and the use of pooled semen should be limited.",Sperm collection and storage for the sustainable management of amphibian biodiversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155034,Theriogenology,2019 06 03,"Current rates of biodiversity loss pose an unprecedented challenge to the conservation community, particularly with amphibians and freshwater fish as the most threatened vertebrates. An increasing number of environmental challenges, including habitat loss, pathogens, and global warming, demand a global response toward the sustainable management of ecosystems and their biodiversity. Conservation Breeding Programs (CBPs) are needed for the sustainable management of amphibian species threatened with extinction. CBPs support species survival while increasing public awareness and political influence. Current CBPs only cater for 10% of the almost 500 amphibian species in need. However, the use of sperm storage to increase efficiency and reliability, along with an increased number of CBPs, offer the potential to significantly reduce species loss. The establishment and refinement of techniques over the last two decades, for the collection and storage of amphibian spermatozoa, gives confidence for their use in CBPs and other biotechnical applications. Cryopreserved spermatozoa has produced breeding pairs of frogs and salamanders and the stage is set for Lifecycle Proof of Concept Programs that use cryopreserved sperm in CBPs along with repopulation, supplementation, and translocation programs. The application of cryopreserved sperm in CBPs, is complimentary to but separate from archival gene banking and general cell and tissue storage. However, where appropriate amphibian sperm banking should be integrated into other global biobanking projects, especially those for fish, and those that include the use of cryopreserved material for genomics and other research. Research over a broader range of amphibian species, and more uniformity in experimental methodology, is needed to inform both theory and application. Genomics is revolutionising our understanding of biological processes and increasingly guiding species conservation through the identification of evolutionary significant units as the conservation focus, and through revealing the intimate relationship between evolutionary history and sperm physiology that ultimately affects the amenability of sperm to refrigerated or frozen storage. In the present review we provide a nascent phylogenetic framework for integration with other research lines to further the potential of amphibian sperm banking.",Leaf metabolites profiling between red and green phenotypes of Suaeda salsa by widely targeted metabolomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155029,Functional plant biology : FPB,2019 06 03,"The Chenopodiaceae Suaeda salsa (L.)

These B vitamins have important roles throughout life, from pregnancy, through childhood, to middle and older age. Achieving optimal nutritional status for preventing folate-related disease is challenging, however, primarily as a result of the poor stability and incomplete bioavailability of folate from natural food sources when compared with the synthetic vitamin form, folic acid. Thus, in European countries, measures to prevent neural tube defects (NTD) have been largely ineffective because of the generally poor compliance of women with folic acid supplementation as recommended before and in early pregnancy. In contrast, countries worldwide with mandatory folic acid fortification policies have experienced marked reductions in NTD. Low vitamin B12 status is associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction, CVD and osteoporosis. Achieving optimal B12 status can be problematic for older people, however, primarily owing to food-bound B12 malabsorption which leads to sub-clinical deficiency even with high dietary B12 intakes. Optimising B-vitamin intake may be particularly important for sub-populations with impaired folate metabolism owing to genetic characteristics, most notably the 677C→T variant in the gene encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This common folate polymorphism is linked with several adverse health outcomes, including stroke, however, recent evidence has identified its novel interaction with riboflavin (the MTHFR cofactor) in relation to blood pressure and risk of developing hypertension.

The 2016 World Health Organization VA Instrument facilitates the identification of eight specific causes of maternal death, yet maternal deaths are often unsupervised, leading to sparse and generally poor symptom reporting to inform a reliable diagnosis using VAs. There is little research evidence to support the reliable identification of specific causes of maternal death in the context of routine VAs.

The continuity of post-trial treatment was only incorporated in the 2000s by the Helsinki Declaration. The Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, published in 2006, points out that post-trial continuity may present a broader scope than just the availability of the investigated medicine. In the latest version of this Declaration, in 2013, it was stated that ""prior to the start of the clinical trial, funders, researchers and governments of the countries participating in the research should provide post-trial access for all participants who still require an intervention that was identified as beneficial. This information should also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process"". However, a systematic review on the registration of phase III and IV clinical trials, from the clinical trials website, demonstrated that the understanding of the various guidelines and resolutions is conflicting, generating edges in the post-trial setting.

As a way of maintaining the proper functioning of the systems and guaranteeing access to these medicines, some countries started to negotiate discounts with manufacturing companies. Pricing agreements have been adopted by developed countries with the objective of reducing their spending on high-cost medicines and, although they represent an opportunity for better negotiation with the industries, they violate the principle of transparency that regulates the world market.

A key barrier to achieving these goals is the lack of standardized, scalable tools to assess cognitive abilities. Objective: This study aimed to develop a tablet-based gamified assessment of cognitive abilities of 3-year-old children which can be administered by non-specialist field workers. Methods: Workshops among domain experts, literature search for established and gamified paradigms of cognitive assessments and rapid review of mobile games for 3-year-old children was done to conceptualize games for this study. Formative household visits (N = 20) informed the design and content of the games. A cross-sectional pilot study (N = 100) was done to assess feasibility of the tool and check if increasing levels of difficulty and the expected variability between children were evident in game metrics. In-depth interviews (N = 9) were conducted with mothers of participating children to assess its acceptability. Results: Six cognitive domains were identified as being integral to learning - divided attention, response inhibition, reasoning, visual form perception and integration and memory. A narrative, musical soundtrack and positive reinforcement were incorporated into the tool to enhance participant engagement. Child performance determined level timers and difficulty levels in each game. Pilot data indicate that children differ in their performance profile on the tool as measured by the number of game levels played and their accuracy and completion time indicating that it might be possible to differentiate children based on these metrics. Qualitative data suggest high levels of acceptability of the tool amongst participants. Conclusions: A DEvelopmental assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP) has been created comprising distinct games woven into a narrative, which assess six cognitive domains, and shows high levels of acceptability and generates metrics which may be used for validation against gold standard cognitive assessments.",Developing a theory-driven contextually relevant mHealth intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154988,Global health action,2019 06 10,"Background: mHealth interventions have huge potential to reach large numbers of people in resource poor settings but have been criticised for lacking theory-driven design and rigorous evaluation. This paper shares the process we developed when developing an awareness raising and behaviour change focused mHealth intervention, through applying behavioural theory to in-depth qualitative research. It addresses an important gap in research regarding the use of theory and formative research to develop an mHealth intervention. Objectives: To develop a theory-driven contextually relevant mHealth intervention aimed at preventing and managing diabetes among the general population in rural Bangladesh. Methods: In-depth formative qualitative research (interviews and focus group discussions) were conducted in rural Faridpur. The data were analysed thematically and enablers and barriers to behaviour change related to lifestyle and the prevention of and management of diabetes were identified. In addition to the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour) model of behaviour change we selected the Transtheoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to be applied to the formative research in order to guide the development of the intervention. Results: A six step-process was developed to outline the content of voice messages drawing on in-depth qualitative research and COM-B and TDF models. A table to inform voice messages was developed and acted as a guide to scriptwriters in the production of the messages. Conclusions: In order to respond to the local needs of a community in Bangladesh, a process of formative research, drawing on behavioural theory helped in the development of awareness-raising and behaviour change mHealth messages through helping us to conceptualise and understand behaviour (for example by categorising behaviour into specific domains) and subsequently identify specific behavioural strategies to target the behaviour.","The correlation between local weather and leptospirosis incidence in Kandy district, Sri Lanka from 2006 to 2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154987,Global health action,2019 06 10,"Background: Leptospirosis is an important public health problem in Sri Lanka. Most people become infected by contact with leptospires in soil and in surface water. Survival of leptospires in the environment depends upon the moisture in soil, humidity, temperature and surface water. Leptospires are spread by flood water and waterways. Therefore, the weather of an area influences the leptospirosis incidence of that area. Objectives: To find out the correlations between the leptospirosis incidence in the district of Kandy, Sri Lanka, and local weather variables and then to explore the utility of the findings. Methods: We gathered data on reported leptospirosis cases in the Kandy district and mid-year population data and calculated weekly incidences for 2006 to 2015. Daily weather data from Katugastota weather station was obtained and converted into weekly data. We plotted time series graphs and observed the correlation between six aggregated weather parameters and leptospirosis incidence. Those weather parameters were rainfall, the count of wet days per week, days with rainfall >100 mm per week, minimum temperature, average temperature and average humidity. Then we looked for correlations between leptospirosis incidence and those weather parameters by performing the wavelet analysis. Results: Our wavelet analysis results show peaks of wet days per week, days with rainfall >100 mm per week, minimum temperature, average temperature and average humidity respectively after 2, 3, 13, 20 and 1 week lags were followed by peaks of leptospirosis incidence. Nadirs (troughs) of rainfall after a week were followed by nadirs of leptospirosis incidence. Conclusions: All weather parameters studied are correlated with local leptospirosis incidence and the climate in Kandy is conducive for leptospirosis transmission. Leptospirosis incidence in the Kandy district is high compared to the national and global incidence. Therefore, leptospirosis preventive work in Kandy deserves more attention, especially during months with favorable weather for leptospirosis transmission.

Building research capacity for developing a critical mass of researchers in Pakistan was done through Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT) courses in Paris and Asia between 2010 and 2016. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the journey of SORT-IT in Pakistan from its inception to progressive expansion and discuss the challenges and ways forward. Methods: The journey began with the training of the Pakistan NTP research team lead in 2010 in an international SORT IT course at Paris. This was followed by training of two team members in Asia SORT IT courses in 2014 and 2015. These three then worked together to conceive and implement the first national Pakistan SORT IT course supported by WHO/TDR and the Global Fund in 2016. This was facilitated by international facilitators and local trained SORT-IT participants from Paris and Asia. This was followed by two further national SORT IT courses in 2017 and 2018. Results: Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 34 participants from Pakistan had been enrolled in national and international SORT IT courses. Of the 23 participants from completed courses, 18(78%) successfully completed the course. In total 18 papers were submitted and up until June 2018, 15(83%) have been published and 21 institutions in Pakistan involved with operational research as a result of the SORT IT initiative. Conclusions: The SORT IT course has been an effective way to build operational research capacity at national level and this has resulted in a large number of published papers providing local evidence for decision making on TB and other disease control programmes. The experience from Pakistan should stimulate other countries to adopt the SORT-IT model.",Correlation between Google Trends on dengue fever and national surveillance report in Indonesia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154985,Global health action,2019 06 10,"Background: Digital traces are rapidly used for health monitoring purposes in recent years. This approach is growing as the consequence of increased use of mobile phone, Internet, and machine learning. Many studies reported the use of Google Trends data as a potential data source to assist traditional surveillance systems. The rise of Internet penetration (54.7%) and the huge utilization of Google (98%) indicate the potential use of Google Trends in Indonesia. No study was performed to measure the correlation between country wide official dengue reports and Google Trends data in Indonesia. Objective: This study aims to measure the correlation between Google Trends data on dengue fever and the Indonesian national surveillance report. Methods: This research was a quantitative study using time series data (2012-2016). Two sets of data were analyzed using Moving Average analysis in Microsoft Excel. Pearson and Time lag correlations were also used to measure the correlation between those data. Results: Moving Average analysis showed that Google Trends data have a linear time series pattern with official dengue report. Pearson correlation indicated high correlation for three defined search terms with R-value range from 0.921 to 0.937 (p ≤ 0.05, overall period) which showed increasing trend in epidemic periods (2015-2016). Time lag correlation also indicated that Google Trends data can potentially be used for an early warning system and novel tool to monitor public reaction before the increase of dengue cases and during the outbreak. Conclusions: Google Trends data have a linear time series pattern and statistically correlated with annual official dengue reports. Identification of information-seeking behavior is needed to support the use of Google Trends for disease surveillance in Indonesia.",Is there convergence of gut microbes in blood-feeding vertebrates?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154984,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences",2019 06 03,"Animal microbiomes play an important role in dietary adaptation, yet the extent to which microbiome changes exhibit parallel evolution is unclear. Of particular interest is an adaptation to extreme diets, such as blood, which poses special challenges in its content of proteins and lack of essential nutrients. In this study, we assessed taxonomic signatures (by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and potential functional signatures (inferred by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)) of haematophagy in birds and bats. Our goal was to test three alternative hypotheses: no convergence of microbiomes, convergence in taxonomy and convergence in function. We find a statistically significant effect of haematophagy in terms of microbial taxonomic convergence across the blood-feeding bats and birds, although this effect is small compared to the differences found between haematophagous and non-haematophagous species within the two host clades. We also find some evidence of convergence at the predicted functional level, although it is possible that the lack of metagenomic data and the poor representation of microbial lineages adapted to haematophagy in genome databases limit the power of this approach. The results provide a paradigm for exploring convergent microbiome evolution replicated with independent contrasts in different host lineages.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 06 03,"An underexplored question in evolutionary genetics concerns the extent to which mutational bias in the production of genetic variation influences outcomes and pathways of adaptive molecular evolution. In the genomes of at least some vertebrate taxa, an important form of mutation bias involves changes at CpG dinucleotides: if the DNA nucleotide cytosine (C) is immediately 5' to guanine (G) on the same coding strand, then-depending on methylation status-point mutations at both sites occur at an elevated rate relative to mutations at non-CpG sites. Here, we examine experimental data from case studies in which it has been possible to identify the causative substitutions that are responsible for adaptive changes in the functional properties of vertebrate haemoglobin (Hb). Specifically, we examine the molecular basis of convergent increases in Hb-O2 affinity in high-altitude birds. Using a dataset of experimentally verified, affinity-enhancing mutations in the Hbs of highland avian taxa, we tested whether causative changes are enriched for mutations at CpG dinucleotides relative to the frequency of CpG mutations among all possible missense mutations. The tests revealed that a disproportionate number of causative amino acid replacements were attributable to CpG mutations, suggesting that mutation bias can influence outcomes of molecular adaptation.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 06 03,"Evolutionary convergence has been long considered primary evidence of adaptation driven by natural selection and provides opportunities to explore evolutionary repeatability and predictability. In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying convergent evolution, in part, owing to the advent of genomic techniques. However, the current 'genomics gold rush' in studies of convergence has overshadowed the reality that most trait classifications are quite broadly defined, resulting in incomplete or potentially biased interpretations of results. Genomic studies of convergence would be greatly improved by integrating deep 'vertical', natural history knowledge with 'horizontal' knowledge focusing on the breadth of taxonomic diversity. Natural history collections have and continue to be best positioned for increasing our comprehensive understanding of phenotypic diversity, with modern practices of digitization and databasing of morphological traits providing exciting improvements in our ability to evaluate the degree of morphological convergence. Combining more detailed phenotypic data with the well-established field of genomics will enable scientists to make progress on an important goal in biology: to understand the degree to which genetic or molecular convergence is associated with phenotypic convergence. Although the fields of comparative biology or comparative genomics alone can separately reveal important insights into convergent evolution, here we suggest that the synergistic and complementary roles of natural history collection-derived phenomic data and comparative genomics methods can be particularly powerful in together elucidating the genomic basis of convergent evolution among higher taxa.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 06 03,"Eukaryotic genomes contain thousands of genes organized into complex and interconnected genetic interaction networks. Most of our understanding of how genetic variation affects these networks comes from quantitative-trait loci mapping and from the systematic analysis of double-deletion (or knockdown) mutants, primarily in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evolve and re-sequence experiments are an alternative approach for identifying novel functional variants and genetic interactions, particularly between non-loss-of-function mutations. These experiments leverage natural selection to obtain genotypes with functionally important variants and positive genetic interactions. However, no systematic methods for detecting genetic interactions in these data are yet available. Here, we introduce a computational method based on the idea that variants in genes that interact will co-occur in evolved genotypes more often than expected by chance. We apply this method to a previously published yeast experimental evolution dataset. We find that genetic targets of selection are distributed non-uniformly among evolved genotypes, indicating that genetic interactions had a significant effect on evolutionary trajectories. We identify individual gene pairs with a statistically significant genetic interaction score. The strongest interaction is between genes TRK1 and PHO84, genes that have not been reported to interact in previous systematic studies. Our work demonstrates that leveraging parallelism in experimental evolution is useful for identifying genetic interactions that have escaped detection by other methods.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 06 03,"The evolutionary origins of eusociality represent increases in complexity from individual to caste-based, group reproduction. These behavioural transitions have been hypothesized to go hand in hand with an increased ability to regulate when and where genes are expressed. Bees have convergently evolved eusociality up to five times, providing a framework to test this hypothesis. To examine potential links between putative gene regulatory elements and social evolution, we compare alignable, non-coding sequences in 11 diverse bee species, encompassing three independent origins of reproductive division of labour and two elaborations of eusocial complexity. We find that rates of evolution in a number of non-coding sequences correlate with key social transitions in bees. Interestingly, while we find little evidence for convergent rate changes associated with independent origins of social behaviour, a number of molecular pathways exhibit convergent rate changes in conjunction with subsequent elaborations of social organization. We also present evidence that many novel non-coding regions may have been recruited alongside the origin of sociality in corbiculate bees; these loci could represent gene regulatory elements associated with division of labour within this group. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gene regulatory innovations are associated with the evolution of eusociality and illustrate how a thorough examination of both coding and non-coding sequence can provide a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioural evolution.

In the present study, to minimize the resin oxidation, central composite design (CCD) approach based on response surface methodology was employed with different variables (Cr(VI) concentration of 100 to 1000 mg L-1, temperature of 293 to 333 K, pH of 1 to 7, and reaction time of 0 to 120 min) using a strong anionic resin (D202). The pH and reaction time had the most significant effect on resin oxidation, followed by Cr(VI) concentration. Temperature had comparatively less significant effect on resin oxidation. The minimal Cr(VI) reduction efficiency (0.4%) was achieved with a Cr(VI) concentration of 251.5 mg L-1, temperature of 323.1 K, pH of 6.2 and reaction time of 52.5 min. Based upon a long term operation and Fourier transform infrared rays analyses, the oxidation pathway of D202 resin was proposed. The rupture of the C-N bond led to the disappearance of the nitrogen-containing functional groups, which resulted in a significant decrease of resin exchange capacity.","Biosorption of methylene blue and eriochrome black T onto the brown macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus: equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics and optimization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154956,Environmental technology,2019 06 12,"The present study had the objective to investigate the equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamic viability and system optimization of methylene blue (MB) and eriochrome black T (ET) biosorption onto Fucus vesiculosus (F. vesiculosus).

While most people recover within days to months, one in five people with mild TBI report persistent, disabling symptoms that interfere with participation (e.g. work, school, sport). People with non-head injuries may also report similar symptoms. The biopsychosocial model of health can help to explain this phenomenon: factors other than biomedical factors are associated with recovery. Important psychosocial factors include poor recovery expectations and pre- and post-traumatic psychological symptoms. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend that clinicians examine all relevant biopsychosocial factors that may contribute to persisting post-concussive symptoms and consider them when helping patients make decisions about management. However, clinical training continues to prioritize treating biomedical symptoms, and clinicians may not feel confident to deal with the psychosocial domain. Our objective is to provide 3 recommendations for clinicians to assess psychosocial factors in patients after concussion, and to argue a case for clinicians improving their skills in assessing psychosocial factors.

Concussion involves physical injury to brain tissue, and vascular and axonal damage that manifest as transient and often nonspecific clinical symptoms. Concussion diagnosis is challenging and the relationship between brain injury and clinical symptoms is unclear. The purpose of this commentary is to translate cutting-edge neuroscience to rehabilitation practice. We (1) highlight potential biomarkers that may improve our understanding of concussion and its recovery, (2) explain why researchers must address the paucity of concussion research in female athletes, and (3) present female-specific factors that should be accounted for in future studies. Integrating objective, quantitative measures of concussion pathophysiology with concussion history, genetics and genomics will help caregivers identify concussed athletes, tailor recovery protocols and protect athletes from potential long-term effects of cumulative head impact.

The service delivery for these long-term conditions has been physician-centred up till now. There is a recent move towards shared care, and nurses are being engaged in the delivery of NCD care. This study was performed in the context of a composite training initiative involving nurses and doctors. Our aim was to compare the performance of nurses with doctors to determine which skills need to be emphasised in future educational programmes. Baseline and end-training knowledge assessments were available from training records. In 2014, of a total of 387 participants from one state in India, 153 were followed up to assess long-term retention of knowledge in various NCD training domains. We found that despite a lower baseline, nurses had a similar attrition in knowledge after training compared to doctors. Results of our study emphasised that nurses can be trained for the primary care needs of NCDs and that both nurses and doctors have retraining needs.",Individual and Combined Impact of Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation on Ischemic Stroke Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154943,Stroke,2019 06 03,"Background and Purpose- We aimed to determine individual and combined effects of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) on acute ischemic stroke outcomes: in-hospital mortality, length-of-stay, and poststroke disability; long-term mortality and stroke recurrence. Methods- Prospective cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to a UK center with a catchment population of ≈900 000 between 2004 and 2016. Exposure groups were patients with neither AF nor HF (reference group), those with AF but without HF, those with HF but without AF, and those with AF+HF. Logistic and Cox regressions were used to model in-hospital and long-term outcomes, respectively. Results- A total of 10 816 patients with a mean age±SD =77.9±12.1 years, 48% male were included. Only 30 (4.9%) of the patients with HF but not AF were anticoagulated at discharge. Both AF (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.07-1.43]), HF (odds ratio, 1.40 [1.10-1.79]), and their combination (odds ratio, 2.23 [1.83-2.72]) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality. All 3 exposure groups were associated with increased length-of-stay, while only AF predicted increased disability (1.36 [1.12-1.64]). Patients were followed for a median of 5.5 and 3.7 years for mortality and recurrence, respectively. Long-term mortality was associated with AF (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.33-1.59]), HF (2.07 [1.83-2.36]), and their combination (2.20 [1.96-2.46]). Recurrent stroke was associated with AF 1.50 (1.26-1.78), HF (1.33 [1.01-1.75]), and AF with HF (1.62 [1.28-2.07]). Conclusions- The AF-associated excess risk of stroke recurrence was independent of comorbid HF. HF without AF was also associated with a significant risk of recurrence. Anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention in patients with HF without AF may require further evaluation in a clinical trial setting.",Global Convergence: Aging and Long-Term Care Policy Challenges in the Developing World.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154942,Journal of aging & social policy,2019 06 03,"Aging around the world poses a global challenge in eldercare. This challenge is particularly felt in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where population aging outpaces the development of aged care policies and services. This Perspective highlights the phenomenon of global convergence in several unsettling trends and challenges shared across LMICs. These include the weakening of informal family care systems for the elderly, growing need for formal long-term care of the frail and disabled who can no longer be adequately supported by family members, and mounting pressures for policy responses to tackle these societal challenges. It is argued that policymakers should take a proactive stance. That is, when family care for the elderly falls short and family caregivers are increasingly under strain, the government should step in and step up support to fill in the gap by developing appropriate policies and a continuum of long-term care services that are accessible and affordable for the majority of older people in need. Three general principles are then suggested with regard to long-term care provision, financing, and quality assurance, which transcend national borders and can be used to guide long-term care policymaking across LMICs."

Determinants of Burnout among Employees Referred for Inpatient Treatment of Job-Related Stress Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154931,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,2019 06 03,"Objectives: There is an ongoing debate as to whether job burnout and depression are overlapping concepts or differ from each other, although this has not been scrutinized in inpatients. To further elucidate the robustness of this relationship, we used three different measurements of depression. We further examined the influence of psychological distress, perceived stress and sleep quality in the link between depressive symptoms and burnout. Methods: We investigated 723 consecutive inpatients, aged 23 to 82 years, 51.2 % women, referred to a hospital specialized in the treatment of job stress-related disorders. Patients completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: We found significant correlations between burnout total scores as well as subscales (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, lack of accomplishment) and depressive symptoms, virtually independent of the applied depression measure. The shared variance ranged between 1.1 % and 19.4 %. Greater levels of burnout were directly associated with cognitiveaffective symptoms and, although to a lesser extent, also with somatic-affective symptoms of depression. In the multivariable analysis, significantly more total burnout symptoms were revealed in more depressed and younger patients, in men than women, and in employees with greater levels of psychological distress and perceived stress, respectively. Conclusions: The findings suggest that although burnout and depression do not represent the same psychopathology, there is considerable overlap between the two constructs; the extent of this overlap may vary depending upon the applied depression measure.",Focusing on Patients' Existing Resources and Strengths in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Psychodynamic Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154930,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,2019 06 03,"Objectives: Integrating a stronger focus on patients' existing strengths in traditional psychotherapy approaches is suggested by recent developments in psychological science, positive psychology, and psychotherapy research. However, the empirical status of treatments focusing on patients' existing strengths is unclear. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review (PROSPERO registration CRD42017054362) of studies on adaptations of traditional treatment approaches (e. g., cognitive-behavior therapy or psychodynamic therapy) explicitly focused on using patients' existing resources and strengths (hereafter, resource-focused treatments; RFT). Methods: Extensive systematic literature search yielded k = 11 treatment comparisons from 10 studies contrasting RFTs with either an alternative psychotherapeutic approach or wait list. Effect sizes controlling for pre-treatment differences (gPPWC) and standard Hedges's g effect sizes (gPOWC) were aggregated with random-effects methods Results: Across 8 direct comparisons, RFTs were superior to other psychotherapeutic approaches, as indicated by small to moderate (gPPWC = -0.349, 95 % CI -0.576, -0.122, p = .003, I2 = 46.50 %) and small effect sizes (gPOWC = -0.190, 95 % CI -0.355, -0.025, p = .024, I2 = 0.00 %) in favor of RFTs. Sensitivity analyses corroborated results. Many included studies were characterized by limited sample size, risk of bias or researcher allegiance. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed preliminary evidence for the benefits of RFTs and suggests an intensification of further research efforts. The evidence was most convincing for hypnotherapeutic-systemic interventions as an add-on for cognitive-behavioral therapy.",[Long-term effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient therapy on depressive disorders - Catamnestic- Results of the STOP-D-Study].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154929,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,2019 06 03,"Long-term effectiveness of psychodynamic inpatient therapy on depressive disorders - Catamnestic- Results of the STOP-D-StudyObjectives: Depression is one of the most common disorders with a rate of recurrence between 60-75 %. The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy is well-proven, but there is still a lack of studies proving the long-term effectiveness of inpatient treatment on depressive symptom load. Methods: After psychodynamic inpatient treatment in a psychodynamically oriented psychosomatic hospital unit, the reduction in general and depressive symptom load (e. g. BDI, HAMD, SCL-90-R) was evaluated by a six-month follow up design. The study was set up as naturalistic multicenter intervention study including a female follow-up sample (N = 291; age 25-45 years). Results: The symptom improvement reached by the inpatient treatment remained stable at the follow-up survey. Patients treated with antidepressant medication showed stronger depressive symptom load at discharge and follow-up survey compared to patients without antidepressant medication. Sociodemographic variables and a comorbid personality disorder were not associated with increased drop-out rates, but depressive symptom load and a premature ending of the treatment. Conclusions: The obtained results demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of inpatient psychodynamic psychotherapy. Further studies about the influence of post-hospital psychotherapy and medical treatment as well as patient satisfaction seem necessary.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154927,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,2019 06 03,"Objective: Background regarding a recent debate between Cuijpers et al.

Method: A main reason for the discrepancy in Cuijpers et al.'s and our conclusions is discussed. Results: In our view the discrepancy is due, among other things, to a blurred distinction between questions of relative and absolute efficacy of psychotherapy. Although the efficacy of psychotherapy vis-à-vis alternative treatments may be ambiguous, there can be little doubt about the benefits of psychotherapy relative to no treatment. Conclusion: We do not think that raising fundamental concerns about the value of psychotherapy is a service to the field. We argue that moving the field forward requires a focus on how psychotherapy works and how the access to psychotherapy can be increased.",[The risk of medical comorbidity in mental disorders with a particular focus on depressive syndromes].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154922,Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie,2019 06 03,"The risk of medical comorbidity in mental disorders with a particular focus on depressive syndromesObjectives: It has long been recognized that certain mental disorders, and in particular depressive syndromes, are associated with increased medical comorbidity. However, reliable data on the prevalence of comorbid medical diagnoses as well as the impact of these comorbidities on mortality are often rare and sometimes conflicting. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar to provide a critical account of the current state of research on the comorbidities of medical and mental disorders, with a particular focus on depressive syndromes. Results: Among patients with mental disorders, all-cause mortality is about doubled as compared to the general population causing a significantly shortened life expectancy in the range of one to two decades. This excess mortality is primarily due to increased physical morbidity and mortality, and it cannot be excluded that, for patients with severe mental disorders, excess mortality has been increased over time. Depressive syndromes are often linked to a broad range of somatic symptoms and can be found in diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, overweight/obesity, and asthma. Conclusion: Current studies provide ample evidence of close interactions between physical and mental health. Further developments in the field of psychosomatic medicine should take into consideration the health-related consequences of these interactions.",Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile duct: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154920,The Journal of international medical research,2019 06 03,"The concept of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) was introduced in the 2010 World Health Organization classification of digestive neuroendocrine neoplasms.

Objectives: Informed by the findings of the research on implementation of the multisectoral response to HIV in South Africa, and drawing from the existing literature; we propose a framework for multisector and multilevel collaboration. The framework describes key components of the process of multisector collaboration, and aims to inform policy and practice. Methods: An integrative review and synthesis of existing frameworks, models and approaches on multisectoral action in public health, governance and health, and in public administration was conducted to inform the development of the proposed framework. Results: There are seven key components that are critical in the process of multisector collaboration namely: preconditions; key drivers; structure; mechanisms; administration; execution and evaluation. Multisector collaboration is presented as an iterative process that allow for improvement and learning. The framework is presented through a visual representation which shows how the seven elements are connected, and how learning happens through-out the multisector collaboration process. Structure and mechanisms are the two central and interrelated elements of the proposed framework. Conclusion: The framework does not suggest that multisector collaboration is a panacea, but that MSA remains critical to address complex health and development issues. Focus should be on finding innovative ways to inform and strengthen its implementation in practice. The framework can be used by practitioners and policy makers to inform design, implementation, and evaluation of multisector collaborations. It reflects on complexities of MSA, and brings to the fore critical information to assess readiness and to inform the decision whether to engage in MSA or not.",The Effect of Nurse-Led Diet and Physical Activity Program for Health on Diet and Physical Activity Behavior of Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154916,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 03,"Background: Many health problems encountered in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood periods arise from problematic eating behavior, an unhealthy dietary approach, and inactive lifestyles. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the Diet and Physical Activity Program for Health, under the leadership of a nurse, on the dietary and physical activity behaviors of children. Methods: This study was planned in a quasi-experimental design with pretesting, posttesting, follow-up testing, and a control group. The study was conducted with 114 students in 2 schools. A total of 12 hours of training was given to the experimental group for 6 weeks. Institutional permission required for performing the study and an ethical consent from the commission for clinical trials of Marmara University institute of health sciences were received. Results: The results of the study reveal that Diet and Physical Activity Program for Health in posttest and follow-up periods was effective in improving dietary and physical activity behaviors of children within the program. However, the program's effect on dietary and physical activity self-efficacy was limited. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that this program was effective in development of children's behavior regarding diet and physical activity.","Physical frailty and health outcomes of fitness, hormones, psychological and disability in institutionalized older women: an exploratory association study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154915,Women & health,2019 06 03,"Little is known about symptoms associated with frailty in institutionalized Portuguese older adults. This study aimed to investigate the association of frailty with diverse geriatric health characteristics. Cross-sectional data from 140 women aged between 75 and 85 years were analyzed. Data were collected between March and June, 2016. Fried's definition of physical frailty, psychological, sex hormones, disability and physical fitness outcomes were examined. The prevalence of frailty was 40%. Frail women had lower scores in cognitive and physical fitness, and higher scores for depressive symptoms and comorbidities. Significant correlations emerged between frailty and disability, fear of falling, aerobic resistance and cognition. Regression analyses and Receiver Operating Only aerobic resistance (sensitivity [93-96%]; specificity [74-77%], p = .001) and cognition (sensitivity [77-88%]; specificity [65-71%], p < .001) remained in the equation as independently related to physical frailty. A trend of significant differences in lower systolic blood pressure may reflect being less physically active and/or having more systemic comorbidity. Fried's model can be considered applicable. The 2-minute step test and the Mini Mental State Examination could better identify frail populations. The role of blood pressure and level of education in physical frailty status needs to be further explored."

Therefore, stem cell therapy to activate self-repair of the IVD remains an exciting treatment strategy. In this respect, tissue-specific progenitors may play a crucial role for IVD regeneration, as these cells are perfectly adapted to this niche. Such a rare progenitor cell population residing in the nucleus pulposus (nucleus pulposus progenitor cells or NPPCs) was found positive for the angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2+) and was demonstrated to possess self-renewal capacity and in vitro multipotency. Here, we compared three sorting protocols, i.e., fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and a mesh-based label-free cell sorting system (pluriSelect), with respect to cell yield, potential to form colonies (colony forming units = CFUs) and in vitro functional differentiation assays for tripotency. The aim of this study was to demonstrate efficiency of three wide-spread cell sorting methods for picking rare cells (<5%) and how these isolated cells then behave in down-stream functional differentiation in adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. The cell yield among the isolation methods differed widely, with FACS presenting the highest yield (5.0 ± 4.0%), followed by MACS (1.6 ± 2.9%) and pluriSelect (1.1 ± 1.0%). The number of colonies formed was not significantly different between Tie2+ and Tie2- NPPCs. Only FACS was able to separate into two functionally different populations that showed trilineage multipotency, while MACS and pluriSelect failed to maintain a clear separation between Tie2+ and Tie2- populations in differentiation assays. To conclude, the isolation of NPPC was possible with all three sorting methods, while FACS was the preferred technique for separation of functional Tie2+ cells. .",Contextual Influences on the Sentencing of Individuals Convicted of Sexual Crimes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154899,Sexual abuse : a journal of research and treatment,2019 06 03,"This study examines effects of court and community contextual factors on sentencing outcomes for individuals convicted of sexual crimes using indicators from two perspectives-focal concerns and populist punitiveness. Sourced from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing, the sample includes 9,431 persons convicted of sexual crimes and a precision-matched sample of persons convicted of non-sexual violent crimes for comparison. Based on multilevel hurdle regression models for both incarceration and sentence length decisions, results indicate that individuals convicted of sexual crimes face enhanced sentence severity in judicial districts with smaller courts, increased jail capacity, stronger political competition, and higher religious homogeneity. The results also suggest statistically significant differences between effects for persons convicted of sexual crimes and a matched sample of persons convicted of violent crimes. Overall, results suggest that specific contextual factors have a distinguishable impact on sentencing of individuals convicted of sexual crimes.",What Do U.K. Orthopedic Surgery Patients Think About PROMs?

Statistics limit insights into how and why data are missing, so qualitative methods were used to explore this issue. Observation periods preceded semistructured interviews with 34 preoperative patients attending an orthopedic outpatient clinic. Interview themes covered: completion time/timing, orientation, setting, measures, and practicalities. Triangulated against observations, pragmatic barriers, and facilitators were considered. Refined themes included completion conditions, patient support, and national delivery. Simple improvements (e.g., quiet zone) could improve completion rates and reducing missing data. Reorganizing preoperative leaflets and their systematic distribution via standardized procedures could reassure patients, enhancing PROMs acceptance, while reducing inquiries and subsequent staff burden. Findings have implications for interpreting national statistics. They indicate that further debate about mandating preoperative PROMs is due.",Effects of resveratrol on shedding and pathological dynamics in experimental B. melitensis infection in dexamethasone-treated nonpregnant Boer goats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154897,Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,2019 06 03,"Brucellosis constitutes an infectious re-emerging zoonosis.

Twelve nonpregnant goats were divided into four groups A, B, C, and D of three animals each. Groups A and B were administered 107 CFU/mL of B. melitensis ocularly, 21 days prior to 7 days consecutive administration of dexamethasone (2 mg/kg). Group A was further administered resveratrol (5 mg/kg) intravenously for 5 consecutive days from day 31 post B. melitensis inoculation. Group C was administered similar dose of B. melitensis while group D was inoculated normal saline. Blood, nasal, ocular, and vaginal swabs were collected at intervals for analysis.

Dexamethasone administration from day 21 pi increased the frequency in the shedding dynamics, tissue bacterial load, pathological alterations (frequency of microgranuloma and intensity of immunostaining) in group B while 5 days treatment with resveratrol following dexamethasone administration significantly reduced tissue bacterial load, decline in shedding dynamics, and ameliorate damage by dexamethasone administration/B. melitensis infection.",Proliferating tumor cells mimick glucose metabolism of mature human erythrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154896,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 14,"Mature human erythrocytes are dependent on anerobic glycolysis, i.e. catabolism (oxidation) of one glucose molecule to produce two ATP and two lactate molecules. Proliferating tumor cells mimick mature human erythrocytes to glycolytically generate two ATP molecules. They deliberately avoid or switch off their respiration, i.e. tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery and consequently dispense with the production of additional 36 ATP molecules from one glucose molecule. This phenomenon is named aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect. The present review deals with the fate of a glucose molecule after entering a mature human erythrocyte or a proliferating tumor cell and describes why it is useful for a proliferating tumor cell to imitate a mature erythrocyte.

This study used a 3-group cross-over design in which participants were exposed to 3 variations of activity structures: free play, organized, or a mixture. Methods: PA was measured using ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers. All data were transformed into percentage of time spent sedentary or in MVPA. Repeated-measures mixed-effects models were used to examine differences in MVPA and sedentary among the 3 activity sessions. Participants included 197 unique children, aged 5-12 years, and were 53% male and 55% white. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in the percentage of time boys spent in MVPA during free play and mixed compared with organized only sessions (35.8% and 34.8% vs 29.4%). No significant difference was observed in the percentage of time girls spent in MVPA during free play compared with organized or mixed (27.2% and 26.1% vs 26.1%). Both boys and girls experienced ∼10% less time sedentary during free play compared with the others. Conclusion: Offering free play during PA opportunities can help children attain as much if not more MVPA compared with only offering organized, adult-led games.",Positive experience with treatment is associated with better surgical outcome in trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154893,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 06 03,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between patients' experiences with trapeziometacarpal arthroplasty and treatment outcomes in terms of patient-reported outcome measures, grip and pinch strength. We included 233 patients who received a Weilby procedure for trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis. Before surgery and 12 months after surgery, patients completed the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, and their pinch and grip strengths were measured. At 3 months after surgery, a patient-reported experience measure was completed. Using regression analysis, significantly positive associations were found between the Michigan Hand questionnaire and the patient-reported experience measure, with the strongest significant associations being for patients' experiences with information provision. No significant associations were found between the patients' experience and strength outcomes. The results highlight the potential importance of positive experience with the treatment process to improve treatment outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis. Level of evidence: IV.",Metabolic Demands of Yoga at Varying Tempos and Compared With Walking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154892,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 03,"Background: Yoga is a popular alternative to walking, but the tempo at which asanas must be performed to elicit comparable metabolic and cardiorespiratory demands is unknown. Therefore, the authors aim to compare the metabolic demands of moderate-intensity walking to Surya Namaskar yoga performed at varying tempos. Methods: Inactive obese adults with limited prior yoga experience (n = 10) completed 10 minutes of treadmill walking at a self-selected pace (rating of perceived exertion = 12-13) and three, 10-minute bouts of yoga at a low (6 s/pose; LSUN), medium (4 s/pose; MSUN), and high (3 s/pose; HSUN) tempo with 10-minutes rest between exercise bouts. Results: Mean metabolic equivalents observed in MSUN (3.64 [0.607]), HSUN (4.22 [0.459]), and treadmill (5.29 [1.147]) were greater than 3.0 (P ≤ .01), but not LSUN (3.28 [0.529], P = .13). Treadmill elicited greater caloric and kilocaloric expenditure (1.36 [0.23] L·min-1; 64 [11] kcal) than LSUN (0.87 [0.24] L·min-1; 39 [11] kcal) and MSUN (1.00 [0.29] L·min-1; 45 [13] kcal) (P ≤ .01).

Analysis of 2,296 first-time hip revision arthroplasties performed due to aseptic loosening, reported to the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154890,Acta orthopaedica,2019 06 03,"Background and purpose - Uncemented stems are increasingly used in revision hip arthroplasty, but only a few studies have analyzed the outcomes of uncemented and cemented revision stems in large cohorts of patients. We compared the results of uncemented and cemented revision stems. Patients and methods - 1,668 uncemented and 1,328 cemented revision stems used in first-time revisions due to aseptic loosening between 1999 and 2016 were identified in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to investigate unadjusted implant survival with re-revision for any reason as the primary outcome. Hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of re-revision were calculated using a Cox regression model adjusted for sex, age, head size, concomitant cup revision, surgical approach at primary and at index revision surgery, and indication for primary total hip arthroplasty. Results - Unadjusted 10-year survival was 85% (95% CI 83-87) for uncemented and 88% (CI 86-90) for cemented revision stems. The adjusted HR for re-revision of uncemented revision stems during the first year after surgery was 1.3 (CI 1.0-1.6), from the second year the HR was 1.1 (CI 0.8-1.4). Uncemented stems were most often re-revised early due to infection and dislocation, whereas cemented stems were mostly re-revised later due to aseptic loosening. Interpretation - Both uncemented and cemented revision stems had satisfactory long-term survival but they differed in their modes of failure. Our conclusions are limited by the fact that femoral bone defect size could not be investigated within the setting of the current study."

Material and methods: This case-control study consisted of 40 pregnancies with GDM and 41 healthy singleton pregnancies matched for maternal and gestational age. The maternal serum levels of cortistatin were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between groups. Results: Cortistatin levels were significantly lower in GDM group (48.85 ± 20.18 versus 65.84 ± 33.98 ng/ml, p = .008). There was a statistically significant difference in cortistatin levels between different treatment modalities and control group (χ2(2) = 8.828, p = .012).

A beneficial immune response warrants the timely regulation by Tregs, whereas a nonproductive immune response indicates insufficient effector functions or an outright failure of tolerance. There are ample reports supporting role of Tregs in suppressing spontaneous auto-immune diseases as well as promoting immune evasion by cancers. To top up their importance, several non-immune functions like tissue homeostasis and regeneration are also being attributed to Tregs. Hence, after being in the center stage of basic and translational immunological research, Tregs are making the next jump towards clinical studies. Therefore, newer small molecules, biologics as well as adoptive cell therapy (ACT) approaches are being tested to augment or undermine Treg responses in the context of autoimmunity and cancer. In this brief review, we present the strategies to modulate Tregs towards a favorable clinical outcome.",Brucella-induced thrombocytopenia: a retrospective study of 16 patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154877,The Journal of international medical research,2019 06 03,We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 16 patients with Brucella-induced thrombocytopenia.,Effects of ischaemic conditioning on tissue oxygen saturation and heart rate variability: an observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154876,The Journal of international medical research,2019 06 03,"Ischaemic conditioning (IC) has organ-protective effects, but its clinical results have been inconsistent.

Histologically, the tumor shows abundant adipose tissue admixed with a spindle cell component, often concentrated in septal and perimysial locations. The index case is being presented to discuss the histopathological and immunohistochemical clues to differentiate it from other fibrofatty tumors of childhood. Case report: An 11-month-old male child presented with a slowly growing mass on the upper back. MRI findings were suggestive of an adipocytic tumor. Microscopy revealed a lesion composed of mature adipocytes and intervening fibrous bands with infiltration into the adjacent skeletal muscle, features of lipofibromatosis. Conclusion: Lipofibromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pediatric fibrofatty tumor. Accurate diagnosis is essential for proper patient management as incomplete removal of the tumor may result in recurrence.",Declining neck circumference is an anthropometric marker related to frailty in middle-aged and elderly women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154874,Modern rheumatology,2019 06 03,"Objectives: Neck circumference (NC) has been associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. However, the association between NC and frailty remains unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between frailty and NC in middle-aged and elderly women. Methods: Frailty was diagnosed based on the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. Of women who underwent health checkup, 295 women with the following measurements were targeted: four trunk circumferences and appendicular skeletal muscle index (aSMI) measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis; albumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein levels measured using a blood test; and physical function measured using back muscle strength and timed up-and-go test (TUG). Normal and frailty group comparisons were conducted using a statistical method. Results: Significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age, body mass index, all trunk circumferences, aSMI, back muscle strength, and TUG. Logistic regression analysis showed that NC was more related with frailty among the four trunk circumferences. In multiple regression analysis, declining NC was significantly associated with frailty. Conclusions: In middle-aged and elderly women, NC has a significant association with frailty. Declining NC was shown to be an anthropometric marker of frailty, and may be a frailty risk factor.","Prevalence of iron deficiency in first trimester, nonanemic pregnant women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154873,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 06 03,"Despite a high frequency of iron deficiency in pregnancy, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated: ""there is inconclusive evidence routine supplementation for iron deficiency anemia improves maternal or infant clinical health outcomes."" In contradistinction, high-quality epidemiologic studies report long lasting deficits in infants diagnosed with iron deficiency in the first 6 months of life compared with infants who were not, with specific deficits in cognition, memory, executive function and electrophysiology documented up to 19 years of age. Infants are not routinely screened for iron deficiency. United Kingdom guidelines differ and recommend screening high-risk infants who are preterm, of diabetic, underweight, obese, or vegetarian mothers, those born to anemic or iron deficient mothers, of smokers, those with inflammatory bowel disease or abnormal uterine bleeding, and from pregnancies in which the intergravid period is <6 months. Iron parameters are not routinely drawn unless anemia is present and in some cases only if microcytic. In that iron deficiency precedes the development of anemia, and waiting for its development misses a large number of overtly iron deficient gravidas. Iron parameters were measured in 102 consecutive, nonselected, nonanemic, first trimester women presenting to their obstetricians. Using standard cutoffs of percent transferrin saturation and/or serum ferritin, 42% were observed to be iron deficient. Given the lack of harm of testing for iron deficiency, it appears prudent to err on the side of caution and screen all presenting pregnant mothers until properly powered outcome data become available.

Design: The Swedish version of the LEAQ was completed every other month over a 2-year period and correlated with the Parents' Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) and McArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) to examine overlapping areas of development. Normative curve was derived through linear mixed models and the effect of time investigated with repeated measures ANOVA. Study sample: Parents of 25 typically developing children with normal hearing (13 girls, 12 boys). Results: The norm curve of the Swedish LEAQ showed a similar equation as the original German version and the effect of time was significant. Correlations between LEAQ and CDI were moderate to high, and between LEAQ and PEACH weak or non-existing. Conclusion: The Swedish version of the LEAQ is a reliable tool in accordance with the original version.

During the past decade, patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) has been commercially introduced in order to simplify and make TKA surgery more effective, precise and efficient than conventional mechanical instrumentation (CI) and computer-assisted surgery (CAS). Nevertheless, there are critical arguments against PSI for routine use. The aim of the current manuscript is to describe advantages and limitations of PSI for primary TKA. Areas covered: By means of a description of the available literature different aspects are discussed (accuracy, clinical and functional outcomes, operative time, blood loss, efficiency and costs). Expertopinion: Most publications do not claim a significant increase in PSI accuracy over CI, but they also do not postulate PSIs accuracy is worse either. Regarding clinical aspects, PSI did not appear to give any advantage over standard techniques although, equally, it did not appear to show any disadvantages. PSI seems to reduce operative time, could reduce perioperative blood loss and provides logistical benefits in the operation room. Further studies will be required to more thoroughly assess all the advantages and disadvantages of this promising technology as an alternative to CI and CAS."

Many studies have employed content analysis to reveal categories of social support, claiming the prevalence of emotional and informational support can aid support seekers. In the studies, optimal matching theory is used to explain the helpfulness of these types of support. This article argues that content analysis is unpersuasive in its claim that support seekers benefit from social support; participants' communicative behaviors should also be considered to evaluate the potential advantages and drawbacks of such groups. Drawing on a mixed-method approach of conversation analysis and content analysis, this study investigates the sequential structure and content of social support in communication in six online self-help groups for anxiety and depression (OSGADs). The main findings show that optimal matching theory may not be suitable for elucidating how support seekers receive help due to the immediate provision of social support and little interaction otherwise. In addition, results identify expressed understanding/empathy and advice as prominent support categories in OSGADs, with most thread openers requesting support indirectly.",New compounds from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia with their protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154855,Journal of Asian natural products research,2019 06 03,"Two new flavonoids, 5,4'-dihydroxy-6,7-furanbavachalcone (1), 1″-methoxy-6,7-furanflavanone (2), together with five known compounds (3-7), were isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia.

Thus in this study we determined whether discrepancies in cardiovascular risk classification between the two SCORE algorithms are more common in ethnic minority groups relative to the Dutch.",Caveolin-1 Regulates Atherogenesis by Attenuating LDL Transcytosis and Vascular Inflammation Independent of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154825,Circulation,2019 06 03,"Atherosclerosis is driven by synergistic interactions between pathological biomechanical, inflammatory and lipid metabolic factors. Our previous studies demonstrated that absence of caveolin-1 (Cav1)/caveolae in hyperlipidemic mice strongly inhibits atherosclerosis, which was attributed to activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased production of nitric oxide (NO), reduced inflammation and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) trafficking.

Subtype C (HIV-1C) is the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype worldwide. Although it is highly prevalent in Nepal, genotypic information on Nepalese HIV-1C is limited. We herein investigated the origin and dynamics of HIV-1C in Nepal. Nearly full-length sequencing of Nepalese HIV-1C strains and phylogenetic analyses were performed. The results obtained showed that Nepalese HIV-1C is closely related to the Indian and south African strains and the introduction of HIV-1C into Nepal was estimated to be in the mid-1980s. These results suggest that multiple HIV-1C strains entered Nepal in the mid-1980s, and this was followed by a marked increase in the number of infection cases over the next decade. The present results reflect the current transmission dynamics of HIV-1C strains in Nepal, and provide valuable information for HIV monitoring and vaccine development.",A Novel Role for the AnxA1-Fpr2/ALX Signaling Axis as a Key Regulator of Platelet Function to Promote Resolution of Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154815,Circulation,2019 06 03,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (I/RI) is a common complication of cardiovascular diseases.

Rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and other CVD manifestations, including pulmonary hypertension and sudden cardiac death, are significantly higher for people living with HIV than for uninfected control subjects, even in the setting of HIV viral suppression with effective antiretroviral therapy. These elevated risks generally persist after demographic and clinical risk factors are accounted for and may be partly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Data on long-term CVD outcomes in HIV are limited by the relatively recent epidemiological transition of HIV to a chronic disease. Therefore, our understanding of CVD pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment in HIV relies on large observational studies, randomized controlled trials of HIV therapies that are underpowered to detect CVD end points, and small interventional studies examining surrogate CVD end points. The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough review of the existing evidence on HIV-associated CVD, in particular atherosclerotic CVD (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and heart failure, as well as pragmatic recommendations on how to approach CVD prevention and treatment in HIV in the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trial data.

Analysis included recording the scope, source, readability scores and benchmarking the contents against previous recommendations for discharge information. Information from 46 resources (on 41 conditions) from three separate sources was analysed. Overall, a wide range of resources were available. Inconsistency was evident in the framework and design of resources available. Approximately two-thirds of resources provided information about referral to community resources, and most had links to community health providers. Assessment of readability levels showed a predominant pitch towards a relatively high level of schooling. Existing written resources available for parents to use in caring for their child's following discharge from an ED could improve with more streamlined designs as well as consistent references to community resources and additional health providers. Parents with low reading capacity may not be able to make the most of existing resources to care for their child at home following ED discharge.

Consequently, the offset booster becomes a doubling parameter determining the distance between the two coexisting attractors, and therefore can polymerize these attractors to become a pseudo-multi-scroll attractor. This paper demonstrates that the attractor doubling operation can be applied to any dimension of the system and can also be nested at any time leading to the geometric growth of the coexisting attractors. Furthermore, various regimes of coexistence can be merged and composed together to reproduce an integrated attractor in the system.",Limit cycles created by piecewise linear centers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154799,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"In the last few years, the interest for studying the piecewise linear differential systems has increased strongly, mainly due to their applications to many physical phenomena. In the study of these differential systems, the limit cycles play a main role. Up to now, the major part of papers which study the limit cycles of the piecewise linear differential systems consider only two pieces. Here, we consider piecewise linear differential systems with three pieces. In this paper, we study the limit cycles of the discontinuous piecewise linear differential systems in the plane R2 formed by three arbitrary linear centers separated by the set Σ={(x,y)∈R2:y=0{or}x=0{and}y≥0}. We prove that such discontinuous piecewise linear differential systems can have 1, 2, or 3 limit cycles, with 3 the maximum number of limit cycles that such systems can have. Moreover, the limit cycles are nested and must intersect Σ in three or four points. The limit cycles having three intersection points with Σ can reach the maximum number 3. The limit cycles having four intersection points with Σ are at most 1, and if it exists, the systems could simultaneously have 1 or 2 limit cycles intersecting Σ in three points.",Theoretical analysis of spatial nonhomogeneous patterns of entomopathogenic fungi growth on insect pest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154798,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"This paper presents the study of the dynamics of intrahost (insect pests)-pathogen [entomopathogenic fungi (EPF)] interactions. The interaction between the resources from the insect pest and the mycelia of EPF is represented by the Holling and Powell type II functional responses. Because the EPF's growth is related to the instability of the steady state solution of our system, particular attention is given to the stability analysis of this steady state. Initially, the stability of the steady state is investigated without taking into account diffusion and by considering the behavior of the system around its equilibrium states. In addition, considering small perturbation of the stable singular point due to nonlinear diffusion, the conditions for Turing instability occurrence are deduced. It is observed that the absence of the regeneration feature of insect resources prevents the occurrence of such phenomena. The long time evolution of our system enables us to observe both spot and stripe patterns. Moreover, when the diffusion of mycelia is slightly modulated by a weak periodic perturbation, the Floquet theory and numerical simulations allow us to derive the conditions in which diffusion driven instabilities can occur. The relevance of the obtained results is further discussed in the perspective of biological insect pest control.",Stationary solitary and kink solutions in the helicoidal Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA molecule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154797,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"We study nonlinear dynamics of the DNA molecule relying on a helicoidal Peyrard-Bishop model.

We use the bond percolation theory to characterize the coinfection model under two self-awareness control strategies, including immunization strategy and quarantine strategy, and to study the impacts of the synergy effect and control strategies on cooperative epidemics. We find that strengthening the synergy effect can reduce the epidemic threshold and enhance the outbreak size of coinfected networks. On Erdős-Rényi networks, the synergy effect will induce a crossover phenomenon of phase transition, i.e., make the type of phase transition from being continuous to discontinuous. Self-awareness control strategies play a non-negligible role in suppressing cooperative epidemics. In particular, increasing immunization or the quarantine rate can enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the outbreak size of cooperative epidemics, and lead to a crossover phenomenon of transition from being discontinuous to continuous. The impact of quarantine strategy on cooperative epidemics is more significant than the immunization strategy, which is verified on scale-free networks.",Synchronization of spiral wave patterns in two-layer 2D lattices of nonlocally coupled discrete oscillators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154795,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"The paper describes the effects of mutual and external synchronization of spiral wave structures in two coupled two-dimensional lattices of coupled discrete-time oscillators. Each lattice is given by a 2D N×N network of nonlocally coupled Nekorkin maps which model neuronal activity. We show numerically that spiral wave structures, including spiral wave chimeras, can be synchronized and establish the mechanism of the synchronization scenario. Our numerical studies indicate that when the coupling strength between the lattices is sufficiently weak, only a certain part of oscillators of the interacting networks is imperfectly synchronized, while the other part demonstrates a partially synchronous behavior. If the spatiotemporal patterns in the lattices do not include incoherent cores, imperfect synchronization is realized for most oscillators above a certain value of the coupling strength. In the regime of spiral wave chimeras, the imperfect synchronization of all oscillators cannot be achieved even for sufficiently large values of the coupling strength.",Alternating activity patterns and a chimeralike state in a network of globally coupled excitable Morris-Lecar neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154794,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"Spatiotemporal chaos collapses to either a rest state or a propagating pulse in a ring network of diffusively coupled, excitable Morris-Lecar neurons.

This paper primarily addresses an issue related to how to define a spatial distance in online social networks by clustering and then proposes a partial differential equation model with a time delay to describing rumor propagation over both temporal and spatial dimensions. Theoretical analysis reveals the existence of equilibrium points, a priori bound of the solution, the local stability and the global stability of equilibrium points of our rumor propagation model.

Because of the close link between mappings, differential equations and dynamical systems, one can introduce dynamics for fractals through differential equations such that they become points of the solution trajectory. There is no doubt that the differential equations have a distinct role for studying chaos. Therefore, characterization of fractals as trajectory points is an important step toward a better understanding of the link between chaos and fractal geometry. Moreover, it would be helpful to enhance and widen the scope of their applications in physics and engineering.",On distributed coordination in networks of cyber-physical systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154791,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"This paper is concerned with the study of the global emerging behavior in complex networks where each node can be modeled as a cyber-physical system.

In spatial dynamics of cyclic competition, reproduction can occur when individuals obtain vacant rooms and, in this regard, empty sites should be resources for reproduction which can be induced by interspecific competition. In this paper, we study the role of alternative competition in the spatial system of cyclically competing five species by utilizing rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock game. From Monte-Carlo simulations, we found that strong alternative competition can lead to the reemergence of coexistence of five species regardless of mobility, which is never reported in previous works under the symmetric competition structure. By investigating the coexistence probability, we also found that coexistence alternates by passing certain degrees of alternative competition in combination with mobility. In addition, we provided evidences in the opposite scenario by strengthening spontaneous competition, which exhibits the reemergence of coexistence similarly. Our findings may suggest more comprehensive perspectives to interpret mechanisms for biodiversity by alternative strategies in spatially extended systems than previously reported.",Using control to shape stochastic escape and switching dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154777,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"We present a strategy to control the mean stochastic switching times of general dynamical systems with multiple equilibrium states subject to Gaussian white noise. The control can either enhance or abate the probability of escape from the deterministic region of attraction of a stable equilibrium in the presence of external noise. We synthesize a feedback control strategy that actively changes the system's mean stochastic switching behavior based on the system's distance to the boundary of the attracting region. With the proposed controller, we are able to achieve a desired mean switching time, even when the strength of noise in the system is not known. The control method is analytically validated using a one-dimensional system, and its effectiveness is numerically demonstrated for a set of dynamical systems of practical importance.",Correlations between the leading Lyapunov vector and pattern defects for chaotic Rayleigh-Bénard convection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154776,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"We probe the effectiveness of using topological defects to characterize the leading Lyapunov vector for a high-dimensional chaotic convective flow field. This is accomplished using large-scale parallel numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Bénard convection for experimentally accessible conditions. We quantify the statistical correlations between the spatiotemporal dynamics of the leading Lyapunov vector and different measures of the flow field pattern's topology and dynamics. We use a range of pattern diagnostics to describe the flow field structures which includes many of the traditional diagnostics used to describe convection as well as some diagnostics tailored to capture the dynamics of the patterns. We use the ideas of precision and recall to build a statistical description of each pattern diagnostic's ability to describe the spatial variation of the leading Lyapunov vector. The precision of a diagnostic indicates the probability that it will locate a region where the Lyapunov vector is larger than a threshold value. The recall of a diagnostic indicates its ability to locate all of the possible spatial regions where the Lyapunov vector is above threshold. By varying the threshold used for the Lyapunov vector magnitude, we generate precision-recall curves which we use to quantify the complex relationship between the pattern diagnostics and the spatiotemporally varying magnitude of the leading Lyapunov vector. We find that pattern diagnostics which include information regarding the flow history outperform pattern diagnostics that do not. In particular, an emerging target defect has the highest precision of all of the pattern diagnostics we have explored.",Robust approach for rotor mapping in cardiac tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154775,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 10,"The motion of and interaction between phase singularities that lie at the centers of spiral waves capture many qualitative and, in some cases, quantitative features of complex dynamics in excitable systems. Being able to accurately reconstruct their position is thus quite important, even if the data are noisy and sparse, as in electrophysiology studies of cardiac arrhythmias, for instance. A recently proposed global topological approach [Marcotte and Grigoriev, Chaos 27, 093936 (2017)] promises to meaningfully improve the quality of the reconstruction compared with traditional, local approaches. Indeed, we found that this approach is capable of handling noise levels exceeding the range of the signal with minimal loss of accuracy. Moreover, it also works successfully with data sampled on sparse grids with spacing comparable to the mean separation between the phase singularities for complex patterns featuring multiple interacting spiral waves.",Complexity reduction ansatz for systems of interacting orientable agents: Beyond the Kuramoto model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154774,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"Previous results have shown that a large class of complex systems consisting of many interacting heterogeneous phase oscillators exhibit an attracting invariant manifold.

Although very useful, these previous results are limited by the restriction that the individual interacting system components have one-dimensional dynamics, with states described by a single, scalar, angle-like variable (e.g., the Kuramoto model). In this paper, we consider a generalization to an appropriate class of coupled agents with higher-dimensional dynamics. For this generalized class of model systems, we demonstrate that the dynamics again contain an invariant manifold, hence enabling previously inaccessible analysis and improved numerical study, allowing a similar simplified description of these systems.

These periodic dynamics show 1:1 entrainment for circular and elliptical modes, and additionally the controlled system exhibits 1:2 entrainment for elliptical and triangular modes at a different set of parameters. The external periodic forcing of the periodic MBH system reveals the existence of domains of entrainment (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4) represented in the Arnold tongue structures.

We focus on the steady-state dynamics via simultaneous measurements of the acoustic pressure in the combustor and the heat release rate (HRR) from the flame. When the combustor length is increased following the onset of thermoacoustic instability, we find that the pressure signal transitions from a period-1 limit cycle to chaos, whereas the HRR signal remains chaotic owing to the presence of an intrinsic hydrodynamic mode in the flame. When the hydrodynamic mode is filtered out of the data, we find that the pressure and HRR signals are in generalized synchronization. However, when the hydrodynamic mode is retained in the data, we find that the pressure and HRR signals are either weakly phase synchronized or desynchronized. This study has two main contributions: (i) it shows that a liquid-fueled diffusion-flame combustor can exhibit dynamics as complex as those of its gaseous-fueled premixed-flame counterparts and (ii) it highlights the need to be exceptionally careful when selecting a diagnostic signal from which to calculate nonlinear measures of self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations, because our experiments show that the pressure and HRR signals can be desynchronized by the presence of a hydrodynamic mode in the flame at a frequency different from that of the dominant thermoacoustic mode.",Multiscale fractional order generalized information of financial time series based on similarity distribution entropy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154770,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"This paper addresses a novel multiscale fractional order distribution entropy based on a similarity matrix (MFS-DistEn) approach to quantify the information of time series on multiple time scales. It improves the metric method of distance matrix in the original DistEn algorithm and further defines the similarity degree between each vector so that we could measure the probability density distribution more accurately. Besides, the multiscale distribution entropy based on similarity matrix combines the advantages of both the multiscale analysis and DistEn and is able to identify dynamical and scale-dependent information. Inspired by the properties of Fractional Calculus, we select the MFS-DistEn notation as the main indicator to present the relevant properties. The characteristics of the generalized MFS-DistEn are tested in both simulated nonlinear signals generated by the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average process, logistic map, and real world data series. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the new algorithm and reveal that tuning the fractional order allows a high sensitivity to the signal evolution, which is useful in describing the dynamics of complex systems. The improved similarity DistEn still has relatively lower sensitivity to the predetermined parameters and decreases with an increase of scale.",Spike chimera states and firing regularities in neuronal hypernetworks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154769,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"A complex spatiotemporal pattern with coexisting coherent and incoherent domains in a network of identically coupled oscillators is known as a chimera state. Here, we report the emergence and existence of a novel type of nonstationary chimera pattern in a network of identically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal oscillators in the presence of synaptic couplings. The development of brain function is mainly dependent on the interneuronal communications via bidirectional electrical gap junctions and unidirectional chemical synapses. In our study, we first consider a network of nonlocally coupled neurons where the interactions occur through chemical synapses. We uncover a new type of spatiotemporal pattern, which we call ""spike chimera"" induced by the desynchronized spikes of the coupled neurons with the coherent quiescent state. Thereafter, imperfect traveling chimera states emerge in a neuronal hypernetwork (which is characterized by the simultaneous presence of electrical and chemical synapses). Using suitable characterizations, such as local order parameter, strength of incoherence, and velocity profile, the existence of several dynamical states together with chimera states is identified in a wide range of parameter space. We also investigate the robustness of these nonstationary chimera states together with incoherent, coherent, and resting states with respect to initial conditions by using the basin stability measurement. Finally, we extend our study for the effect of firing regularity in the observed states. Interestingly, we find that the coherent motion of the neuronal network promotes the entire system to regular firing.",From nonlinear reaction-diffusion processes to permanent microscale structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154768,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2019 06 03,"Biomorphs are polycrystalline aggregates that self-assemble during inorganic precipitation reactions.

The model consists of three reaction steps that convert a reactant species autocatalytically into an intermediate and eventually into a solid, immobile product.

In this study, we introduce a 3D nano-probe concept, which acts as a nano-thermistor to access surface temperatures. Fabrication of nano-bridges is done via 3D nano-printing using focused electron beams, which allows direct-write fabrication on pre-structured, self-sensing cantilever. As individual branch dimensions are in the sub-100 nm regime, mechanical stability is first studied by a combined approach of finite element simulation and scanning electron microscopy assisted in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. After deriving the design rules for mechanically stable 3D nano-bridges with vertical stiffness up to 50 N.m-1, a material tuning approach is introduced to increase mechanical wear resistance at the tip apex for high-quality AFM imaging at fast scan speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the electrical response in dependence of temperature and find a negative temperature coefficient of -(0.75 ± 0.2) 10-3 K-1 and sensing rates of (30 ± 1) ms.K-1 at noise levels of ±0.5 K, which underlines the potential of our concept.",Precautions for Combined Anterior and Posterior Long-Level Fusion for Adult Spinal Deformity: Perioperative Surgical Complications Related to the Anterior Procedure (Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154755,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,"Retrospective, single-center study.",Quantitative Feasibility Evaluation of 11C-Methionine Positron Emission Tomography Images in Gamma Knife Radiosurgery : Phantom-Based Study and Clinical Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154754,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,2019 06 03,The functional information of 11C-methionine positron emission tomography (MET-PET) images can be applied for Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) and its image quality may affect defining the tumor. This study conducted the phantom-based evaluation for geometric accuracy and functional characteristic of diagnostic MET-PET image co-registered with stereotactic image in Leksell GammaPlan® (LGP) and also investigated clinical application of these images in metastatic brain tumors.,Structure and function of the influenza A virus non-structural protein 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154753,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"The influenza A virus is a highly infectious respiratory pathogen and can cause respiratory disease annually. To prevent surges of this virus infection, an understanding of the characteristics of virus-host interaction and development of an anti-viral agent is urgently needed. The influenza A virus can infect mammalian species including humans, pigs, horses and seals. Furthermore, this virus can switch hosts and form a novel lineage. This so-called zoonotic infection provides an opportunity for virus adaptation to the new host and leads to pandemic. Most influenza A viruses express proteins that antagonize the antiviral defense of the host cell. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus is the most important viral regulatory factor controlling cellular processes to modulate host cell gene expression and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated antiviral response. This review focuses on the influenza A virus NS1 protein and outlines the current issues including the life cycle of the influenza A virus, structural characterization of the influenza A virus NS1, interaction between NS1 and host immune response factor, and design of inhibitors resistant to the influenza A virus.",Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Production from a Novel Enterococcus avium JS-N6B4 Strain Isolated from Edible Insects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154752,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing strains were isolated from four edible insects and subjected to 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Among the four GABA-producing bacteria, Enterococcus avium JS-N6B4 exhibited the highest GABA-production, and cultivation temperature, initial pH, aerobic condition, and mono-sodium glutamate (MSG) feeding were found to be the key factors affecting GABA production rate. The culture condition was optimized in terms of glucose, yeast extract, and MSG concentrations using the response surface methodology (RSM). GABA production up to 16.64 g/L was obtained under the conditions 7 g/L glucose, 45 g/L yeast extract, and 62 g/L MSG through the optimization of medium composition by RSM. Experimental GABA production was 13.68 g/L, which was close to the predicted value (16.64 g/L) calculated from the analysis of variance, and 2.79-fold higher than the production achieved with basic medium. Therefore, GABA-producing strains may help improve the GABA production in edible insects, and provide a new approach to the use of edible insects as effective food biomaterials.",Synthesis of methylated anthranilate derivatives using engineered strains of Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154751,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"Anthranilate derivates are used as flavoring and fragrant agents for a long period time. Recently, these compounds gain an attention due to the new biological functions including antinociceptive and analgesic activities. Three anthranilate derivatives, N-methylanthranilate, methyl anthrannilate, and methyl N-methylanthranilate were synthesized using metabolically engineered stains of Escherichia coli. NMT encoding N-methyltransferase from Ruta graveolens, AMAT encoding anthraniloyl-coenzyme A (CoA):methanol acyltransferase from Vitis labrusca, and PqsA encoding anthranilate Coenzyme A ligase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cloned and E. coli strains harboring these genes were used to synthesize the three desired compounds. E. coli mutants (metJ, trpD, tyrR mutants), which provide more anthranilate and/or S-adenosyl methionine, were used to increase the production of the synthesized compounds. MS/MS analysis was used to determine the structure of the products. Approximately, 185.3 μM N-methylanthranilate and 95.2 μM methyl N-methyl anthranilate were synthesized.

Roughly 10,000 human cases were reported and fatality reaches up to 40%. The majority of cases occurred in Saudi Arabia and mostly sporadic outside the country except the outbreak in South Korea in 2015. The Korean MERS-CoV isolate was isolated from the second Korean patient and its genome was fully sequenced and deposited. To develop virus-specific protective and therapeutic agents against the Korean isolate and to investigate molecular determinants of virus-host interactions, it is of paramount importance to generate its full-length cDNA. Here we report that two full-length cDNA's of a Korean patient-isolated MERS-CoV strain are generated by combination of the conventional cloning techniques and efficient Gibson assembly reactions. The full-length cDNA's were validated by restriction analysis and its sequence was verified by Sanger method. Resulting cDNA was efficiently transcribed in vitro and showing the T7 promoter-driven expression is robust. The resulting reverse genetic system will add to the published list of MERS-CoV cDNA's and facilitate the development of Korean isolate-specific antiviral measures.",A Novel miR-1958 Is a Promoter towards Mtb Survival in RAW264.7 Cells by Inhibiting Autophagy via Atg5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154748,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"Autophagy is crucial for immune defense against Mycobacterial tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Mtb can evade host immune attack and survival within macrophages by manipulating autophagic process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA, which involved in regulating vital genes during Mtb infection. The precise role of miRNAs in autophagy with the exits of Mtb remains largely unknown. In this study, we found miR-1958, a new miRNA that could regulate autophagy by interacting with 3'UTR of autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5). In addition, Mtb infection triggered miR-1958 expression in RAW264.7 cells. What's more, miR- 1958 overexpression blocked autophagic flux by impairing fusion of autophagosome and lysosome. Over expression of miR-1958 reduced Atg5 expression and LC3 puncta while inhibition of miR-1958 brought an increase of Atg5 and LC3 puncta; opposite results were observed in detection of p62. The survival of Mtb in RAW264.7 cells transfected with mimic of miR-1958 was enhanced. Taken together, our research demonstrated that a novel miR-1958 could inhibit autophagy by interacting with Atg5 and favored intracellular Mtb survival in RAW264.7 cells.",Application of the Dynamic Regulation to Increase L-Phenylalanine Production in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154747,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"Current strategies of strain improvement processes are mainly focused on enhancing the synthetic pathway of the products. However, excessive metabolic flux often creates metabolic imbalances, which leads to growth retardation and ultimately limit the yield of the product. To solve this problem, we applied a dynamic regulation strategy to produce L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) in Escherichia coli. Firstly, we constructed a series of Phe-induced promoters that exhibited different strengths through modification of the promoter region of tyrP. Then two engineered promoters were separately introduced into a Phe-producing strain xllp1 to dynamically control the expression level of one pathway enzyme AroK. Batch fermentation results of the strain xllp3 showed that the titer of Phe reached 61.3 g/l at 48 h, representing a titer of 1.36-fold of the strain xllp1 (45.0 g/l). Moreover, the L-Phe yields on glucose of xllp3 (0.22 g/g) were also greatly improved, with an increase of 1.22-fold in comparison with the xllp1 (0.18 g/g). In summary, we successfully improved the titer of Phe by using dynamic regulation of one key enzyme and this strategy can be applied for improving the performance of strains producing other aromatic amino acids and derived compounds.","Comparison of Bioethanol Production by Candida molischiana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Glucose, Cellobiose, and Cellulose.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154746,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 03,"Bioethanol has attracted much attention in recent decades as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative energy source. In this study, we compared the production of bioethanol by Candida molischiana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at different initial concentrations of cellobiose and glucose. The results showed that C. molischiana can utilize both glucose and cellobiose, whereas S. cerevisiae can only utilize glucose. The ethanol yields were 43-51% from different initial concentrations of carbon source. In addition, different concentrations of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) were directly converted to ethanol by a combination of Trichoderma reesei and two yeasts. Cellulose was first hydrolyzed by a fully enzymatic saccharification process using T. reesei cellulases, and the reducing sugars and glucose produced during the process were further used as carbon source for bioethanol production by C. molischiana or S. cerevisiae. Sequential culture of T. reesei and two yeasts revealed that C. molischiana was more efficient for bioconversion of sugars to ethanol than S. cerevisiae. When 20 g/L Avicel was used as a carbon source, the maximum reducing sugar, glucose, and ethanol yields were 42%, 26%, and 20%, respectively. The maximum concentrations of reducing sugar, glucose, and ethanol were 10.9 g/L, 8.57 g/L, and 5.95 g/L, respectively, at 120 h by the combination of T. reesei and C. molischiana from 50 g/L Avicel."

Methods: From January 2008 to December 2017, 45 patients (28 males and 17 females, aging 8 to 58 years) with severe hand injuries after burns or trauma combined with deep tissue exposure were admitted to our hospital. Two patients had whole-fingers degloving injuries, 27 patients had dorsal hand injuries, and 16 patients had palmar injuries. After debridement, the area of soft tissue defects was 7 cm×6 cm to 19 cm×12 cm combined with 0.5 cm×0.4 cm to 10.0 cm×4.0 cm of single deep tissue exposure. Different repairing methods were adopted according to the area and location of deep tissue exposure. Five patients with small area exposure were treated with artificial dermis+ vacuum sealing drainage (VSD)+ autogenous skin grafting. Thirty-eight patients with unilateral large area exposure on palm or dorsum were treated with segmented ligation of abdominal thin flaps (with area of 8 cm×7 cm to 15 cm×9 cm). Two patients with bilateral large area exposure in dorsal and palmar hands were treated with modified abdominal bag-shaped delayed thin flaps (with area of 12 cm×5 cm to 12 cm×9 cm and 12 cm×6 cm to 14 cm×9 cm). The donor sites were directly sutured or repaired with intermediate split-thickness skin or adjacent flap. The survival of grafts and flaps was observed, number of operations, wound healing time, and follow-up were recorded. Results: (1) Among the patients receiving artificial dermis+ VSD+ autogenous skin grafting, the wounds of 3 patients were healed after 2 operations, and 2 patients had artificial dermis infection and lysis, and tendon necrosis, which were healed after 3 operations. The wound healing time of 5 patients was 14 to 33 days post injury. During the follow-up of 3 months, the affected hands were in good shape with soft texture and fewer scars, and functional evaluation of hand was good in 3 cases and modest in 2 cases. (2) The patients receiving segmented ligation of abdominal thin flaps all underwent 2 operations without flap necrosis. The wound healing time was 2 to 3 weeks post injury. Thirty-five patients underwent one to six-years' follow-up, which showed that the flaps were in good shape and color with soft texture, and the functional evaluation of hand was excellent in 25 cases, good in 7 cases, and modest in 3 cases. Three patients were lost to follow-up. (3) In the 2 patients receiving modified abdominal bag-shaped delayed thin flaps, all flaps survived after 5 operations, the wounds were healed on post injury day 22 and 24 respectively, the shape and texture of the affected hands was good with no bloated appearance after separating fingers and revision. During the follow-up of 2 years, the functional evaluation of hand was good in 2 cases. Conclusions: For the complex wounds on hands after burns or trauma, if the area of deep tissue exposure is small, artificial dermis+ VSD+ autogenous skin grafting should be adopted, which has good effects. If the area of unilateral deep tissue exposure is large, segmented ligation of abdominal thin flap should be adopted; if the area of bilateral deep tissue exposure is large, modified abdominal bag-shaped delayed thin flap should be adopted. These methods can reduce the number of operations, shorten wound healing time, and obtain good shape and function of hands.",[Effect of perforator flap of the proper digital artery of the ulnar or radial side of finger in the treatment of webbed scar contracture of the same finger in child].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154733,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 06 13,"Objective: To explore the effect of the perforator flap of the proper digital artery on the ulnar or radial side of the finger in the treatment of webbed scar contracture of the same finger in child. Methods: From January 2012 to January 2016, 26 children who were treated with dressing change after burn of finger and then had webbed scar contracture along with growth and development were hospitalized in our unit, involving a total of 50 fingers. There were 14 males and 12 females among the children aged from 2 to 14 years. After the scar was dissected and released, the wound area ranged from 1.6 cm×1.0 cm to 5.0 cm×2.6 cm. The perforator flap of the proper digital artery of the ulnar or radial side of the same finger was used to repair the wound. The flap area ranged from 1.8 cm×1.0 cm to 4.6 cm×1.8 cm. The donor sites were sutured directly. The residual wounds in donor and recipient sites were repaired by full-thickness skin graft collected from inguinal area/adjacent area or adjacent perforator flap. The postoperative development and function of the fingers were followed up and observed. The range of motion of the fingers was evaluated according to the Chinese Medical Association Hand Surgery Society's upper limb functional evaluation trial standard, the Kantor Scar Cosmesis Assessment and Rating Scale was used to score the scar of finger, and the latest data were recorded. Results: The flaps and skin grafts survived successfully after operation. The patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months. The perforator flaps of the proper digital artery on the ulnar or radial side of the finger survived well at the latest follow-up, with good color and texture and a two-point discrimination distance of 9 to 12 mm. There was no contracture of the fingers, a little pigmentation in the skin graft area, no flexion deformity of the fingers, no lateral bending of the fingers to the flap-harvesting side, and no scar contracture at the webs of the fingers. Compared with that of healthy side, the development of finger was not obviously abnormal. The range of motion of the fingers was excellent in 38 fingers and good in 12 fingers, and the scar score of the fingers was 2-3 points in 31 fingers, 4-7 points in 15 fingers, and 8-10 points in 4 fingers. Conclusions: The efficacy of perforator flap of the proper digital artery of the ulnar or radial side of finger in the treatment of the webbed scar contracture of the same finger in child is reliable, with high postoperative survival rate of the flap, better color and texture, and fewer complications, which can avoid the risk of re-contracture of the finger in a short period after operation, and does not affect the growth and development of the finger.",[Early diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients with skin and soft tissue defects after trauma].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154732,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 06 13,"Objective: To investigate the early diagnosis method of pulmonary embolism in patients with skin and soft tissue defects after trauma.

The medical records of the 5 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Hierarchical screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism was performed after admission for 4-45 days. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed immediately in 2 patients who had hemodynamic disorder and were able to tolerate CTPA, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed. Clinical risk assessment was conducted for the other 3 patients who had no obvious hemodynamic disorder and only had clinical manifestations of pulmonary embolism such as chest tightness and dyspnea. Among the 3 patients, two of them were assessed as high risk possibility by clinical risk assessment and diagnosed with pulmonary embolism by CTPA immediately. The other one patient's clinical risk assessment was moderate risk possibility, but D-dimer was positive, and the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism by CTPA immediately. Wound exudation of all patients was collected within 1 week after admission for microbial culture, and wound debridement and skin grafting were performed according to the wound condition. The color Doppler ultrasonography of blood vessel on lower extremity was performed to determine deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity after appearance of symptoms of pulmonary embolism. The patient was immediately given urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator by intravenous infusion for thrombolysis after definite diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was monitored after treatment, and standardized anticoagulation began when APTT was equal to or lower than 70 seconds. The treatment results of patients, D-dimer measurement value, bed time before definite diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, number of patients underwent wound debridement during hospitalization, definite diagnosis time of pulmonary embolism after wound debridement, and number of patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity and wound infection were recorded. Results: Wounds with skin and soft tissue defects of all patients were completely healed, all skin grafts survived well, pulmonary embolism recovered well after timely treatment, and the trunk and branches of involved pulmonary artery recovered blood supply. The course of disease ranged from 1 month to 3 months. The measurement value of D-dimer was 2.4-31.7 mg/L, and the measurement values of D-dimer of 4 patients were equal to or higher than 5.0 mg/L. The bed time before definite diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was 4-46 days, with an average of 23.2 days. Four patients underwent wound debridement during hospitalization. The definite diagnosis time of pulmonary embolism after the wound debridement was 14-40 days, with an average of 20.5 days. Four patients were diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity. All patients had wound infection, and the bacteria causing wound infection included Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 2 cases, Staphylococcus aureus of 2 cases, and Enterococcus faecalis of 1 case. Conclusions: In the diagnosis process of pulmonary embolism in patients with skin and soft tissue defects after trauma, D-dimer positive, long-term bed rest, experiencing operation during hospitalization, and with deep vein thrombosis and wound infection can be regarded as the key points for diagnosis. When a patient has clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism and the above conditions, the clinician should promptly perform hierarchical screening, select the corresponding examination to confirm pulmonary embolism, and immediately perform thrombolysis for the patient with pulmonary embolism according to the patient's tolerance, thereby improving patient survival rate.",[Effects of glutamine on skeletal muscle membrane repair in severely burned mice and the functional mechanism].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154731,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 06 13,"Objective: To observe how glutamine affect the skeletal muscle membrane repair in severely burned mice through promoting the mitsugumin 53 (MG53) dimerization in skeletal muscle and to explore its functional mechanism.

Eight rats from each group were collected respectively on PID 4, 7, and 14 to harvest tibialis anterior muscle (TAM) samples. The mass of TAM on PID 14 was weighed. The ultrastructural changes of TAM myocytes on PID 7 were observed with transmission electron microscope. The apoptotic rates of TAM myocytes on PID 4, 7, and 14 were assessed by the assay of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridinetriphate-biotin nick end labeling, the expressions of cysteine-aspartic protease-3 (caspase-3) of TAM on PID 4, 7, and 14 were detected with immunohistochemistry, and protein expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ERS) associated proteins glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP), and activated caspase-12 of TAM on PID 4, 7, and 14 were detected with Western blotting. Data were processed with completely random design t test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, analysis of variance for factorial design, t test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: The blood glycemic level and body mass of rats in the two groups before injury were similar (t=0.204, 0.405, P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in blood glycemic levels of rats between the two groups on PID 1, 6, 9, 11, 12, and 14 (t=0.229, 3.339, 1.610, 0.178, 0.181, 0.079, P>0.05). Compared with those of group SS, blood glycemic levels of rats in group IT were significantly lower on PID 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (t=7.245, 4.165, 4.609, 4.018, 3.995, P<0.05 or P<0.01). On PID 14, the body mass and TAM mass of rats in group IT were (271±19) g and (0.47±0.05) g respectively, both obviously higher than (254±12) g and (0.43±0.04) g of group SS (t=2.159, 2.375, P<0.05). On PID 7, nuclear pyknosis and deformation, chromosome misdistribution, and ER swelling in TAM myocytes of rats in group SS were observed; the apoptotic alterations and ER swelling of TAM myocytes were alleviated in rats of group IT as compared with those of group SS. The apoptotic rates of TAM myocytes of rats in group IT were obviously lower than those of group SS on PID 4, 7, and 14 (t=4.262, 9.153, 9.799, P<0.01). The expressions of caspase-3 in TAM of rats in group IT were obviously lower than those of group SS on PID 7 and 14 (t=10.429, 7.617, P<0.01). Compared with those of group SS, the protein expressions of GRP78 were obviously increased on PID 4 and 14 (t=4.172, 4.437, P<0.05), the protein expressions of activated caspase-12 were obviously decreased on PID 7 and 14 (t=11.049, 11.181, P<0.01), and the protein expressions of CHOP were obviously decreased on PID 4, 7, and 14 (t=13.837, 9.572, 6.930, P<0.01) in TAM of rats in group IT. Conclusions: Insulin therapy may reduce skeletal muscle myocytes apoptosis and SMW by alleviating ERS in rats with severe scald.",[Retrospective cohort study on the correlation between high value of lactic acid and risk of death in 127 patients with extensive burn during shock stage].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154729,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 06 13,"Objective: To analyze the relationship between serum lactic acid value and risk of death in patients with extensive burn during shock stage and the related influencing factors.

With the deepening understanding of body metabolic rules after burn injury, the principle and method of nutrition therapy have been changed. On the one hand, nutrition therapy needs to adapt to the metabolic change post burn. On the other hand, nutrition should regard regulating body metabolism, protecting organ function, and maintaining internal environment stability as the core goals. Hence, some key points such as energy supplement, nutritional opportunity, and nutrition pathway need to be adjusted, in order to improve nutrition efficacy and patient prognosis.",[Effects and mechanism of fecal transplantation on acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154727,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 06 13,"Objective: To investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its regulatory mechanism. Methods: Fifteen rats were divided into control group, LPS group and LPS+FMT group by random number table method. LPS group and LPS+FMT group were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to generate rat ALI model. After 24 h of modeling, feces (10 ml/kg) were given to the LPS+FMT group twice a day, and the control group and LPS group were given the same amount of normal saline. The intervention lasted for 2 days. After 24 h of the last fecal microbiota transplantation, arterial blood gas analysis was performed in each group. Then rats were sacrificed and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method was used to detect intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) content in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) was evaluated; HE staining and lung tissue pathology scoring, immunohistochemical detection of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) predominate nuclear expression and expression of ICAM-1 of alveolar epithelial cells were conducted; Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins related to the intracellular phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. Samples of rat feces were collected and DNA was extracted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16SrDNA) were sequenced at high throughput, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted on the microbial community based on the operational classification unit. Results: The lung W/D and lung histopathological score of the LPS group were significantly higher than those of the control group, while the arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) of the LPS group was significantly lower than that of the control group [(79.2±5.89 vs 95.2±2.77) mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa](all P<0.05). The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS group was significantly higher than that of the control group, while the lactobacillus of LPS group rats was significantly lower than that of the control group. The content of ICAM-1 in serum, BALF and its relative expression on the cell membrane in the LPS group was significantly higher than that in the control group [(8.64±0.87) vs (7.40±0.32) ng/L; (0.941±0.035) vs (0.739±0.079) ng/L; (0.250±0.010) vs (0.076±0.010)] (all P<0.05). Moreover, the relative expression levels of phosphorylated P65 (p-P65), p-PI3K and p-AKT nucleoprotein in the LPS group were significantly higher than those in the control group (4.89±0.27 vs 3.28±0.13, 0.265±0.030 vs 0.036±0.013 and 0.444±0.040 vs 0.109±0.016) (all P<0.05). The above injury effect was reduced after fecal fungus transplantation. The lung W/D and lung pathological score of LPS+FMT group were significantly lower than those of LPS group, and PaO(2) of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group [(88.0±3.53) mmHg]. The results of intestinal flora sequencing revealed that the diversity index of LPS+FMT group was significantly lower than that of LPS group, and the lactobacillus genus of LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that of LPS group. ICAM-1 in the blood serum ((7.44±0.46) ng/L), BALF (0.834±0.040) ng/L) and its relative expression on alveolar epithelial cell membrane (0.173±0.030), the relative expression of p-P65, p-PI3K and p-AKT protein of NF-κB in alveolar epithelial cells was down-regulated ((2.99±0.28, 0.090±0.013 and 0.206±0.018) in LPS+FMT group than those of LPS group, the differences were statistically significant (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Fecal transplantation can alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in rats, and its regulatory effect may be related to inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing the expression of inflammatory factor ICAM-1.",[The renal protective effect and mechanism of liraglutide in diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154726,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 06 13,"Objective: To investigate the protective effect of liraglutide on kidney of diabetic mice induced by high-fat diet and its possible mechanisms. Methods: C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into normal chow diet (NC) group and high-fat diet (HFD) group, which were fed with normal chow diet and HFD for 12 weeks respectively. After diet challenge, the mice were randomly divided into normal control group, normal chow diet with liraglutide treatment (NC+Lira) group, HFD group and high-fat diet with liraglutide treatment (HFD+Lira) group. The mice in NC+Lira and HFD+Lira groups were given intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide (400 μg·kg(-1)·d(-1)) for 8 weeks, while mice in NC and HFD groups were given intraperitoneal injection of same amount of normal saline. Urinary albumin and creatinine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Renal morphology was observed by HE staining. The expression levels of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) were determined by Western blot. Results: Compared with HFD group, liraglutide significantly lowered the body weight [(30.98±1.29) g vs (39.43±2.58) g], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [(7.21±0.15) mmol/L vs (9.55±0.29) mmol/L] and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) [(205.48±17.14) μg/mg vs (319.86±34.14) μg/mg] in HFD+Lira group (all P<0.05). HE staining showed that glomerular hypertrophy of HFD group alleviated after liraglutide treatment. The expression level of TXNIP in the kidney of HFD mice significantly decreased after liraglutide treatment (0.41±0.10 vs 3.50±0.70), while expression level of SIRT1 significantly increased (0.75±0.15 vs 0.32±0.04) (both P<0.05). Conclusion: Liraglutide could improve diabetic nephropathy by up-regulation of SIRT1 expression and down-regulation of TXNIP expression in diabetic mice induced by HFD.",[Analysis of unplanned reoperation following vitreoretinal surgery].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154725,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 06 13,"Objective: To determine the incidence of unplanned reoperation following vitreoretinal surgery and identify the reasons for unplanned reoperations. Methods: Case records of all patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between June 2014 and June 2017 were reviewed to determine the incidence of unplanned reoperations during the primary admission and within 90 days following vitreoretinal surgery. Results: A total of 3 356 case records were reviewed. During the primary admission, 97 times of unplanned reoperation occurred in 81 cases [45 males and 36 females, aged (47.3±16.8) years].The incidence of unplanned reoperation was 2.4% (81/3 356). The most common primary diseases were retinal detachment (25 cases, 30.9%), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (23 cases, 28.4%) and silicone oil filled eye (17 cases, 21.0%). The most common reasons for unplanned reoperation were new onset or recurrent retinal detachment (33 times, 34.0%), increased intraocular pressure (23 times, 23.7%), as well as hyphema and inflammation (16 times, 16.5%). The percentages of the primary diseases and reasons for unplanned reoperation within 90 days following vitreoretinal surgery were not significantly different when compared with those during the primary admission. Desired results could be achieved in all cases after unplanned reoperation. Conclusions: The primary diseases of unplanned reoperation for vitreoretinal surgery are complicated retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and silicone oil filled eyes. New onset or recurrent retinal detachment, increased intraocular pressure, hyphema and inflammation are common causes of reoperation."

Methods: From October 2016 to October 2017, a total of 23 258 women aged 25-65 years were enrolled in the physical examination center and gynecological clinic of Huzhou Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital. All the women had Aptima HPV tested, further Aptima HPV-GT testing for positive women and liquid-based thin layer cytology Thinprep cytologic test (TCT). Women with Aptima HPV (+) or ≥low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or obvious clinical symptoms (including vaginal bleeding after intercourse and watery, bloody vaginal discharge) were referred for colposcopy and further biopsy with or without endocervical curettage (ECC) if indicated. Expression of Aptima HPV, HPV 16 and HPV 18/45 with different cytological diagnostic groups and histological diagnosis groups were compared respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of Aptima HPV detection and TCT in identifying histological diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse (HSIL(+)) were compared. Results: (1) The positive rates of Aptima HPV, HPV 16 and HPV 18/45 were 14.00% (3 257/23 258), 1.85% (430/23 258) and 0.86% (199/23 258) respectively.The positive rates of Aptima HPV, HPV 16 and HPV 18/45 increased with cytology grading in squamous epithelium [negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), LSIL, atypical squamous cell cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), all P=0.000)]. According to histology results, the positive rates of Aptima HPV, HPV 16 and HPV 18/45 increased with histology grading in squamous epithelium (normal cervical tissue, LSIL, HSIL and SCC, all P=0.000).

Methods: A total of 1 541 patients with cervical cancer were treated between February 2009 and October 2016 in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. The median age at diagnosis was 49 years (ranged 20-82 years old). The numbers of patients with cervical cancer from North China, Northeast China, East China, Central China and other regions (including Northwest, Southwest and South China) were 961, 244, 175, 87 and 74 cases, respectively. Pathological types: 1 337 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 87 usual adenocarcinoma (ADC), 23 adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), 20 mucinous carcinoma (MC), 19 clear cell carcinoma (CCC), 12 endometrioid carcinoma (EC), 25 neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), 9 serous carcinoma (SC), 5 villous adenocarcinoma (VADC) and 4 minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDAC). The prevalence of high-risk HPV in different regions, age groups at diagnosis and pathological types in cervical cancer were analyzed. The attribution of 13 high-risk HPV subtypes in different pathological types of cervical cancer based on proportional attribution method, and the attribution of high-risk HPV subtypes prevented by 9-valent HPV vaccine in SCC and ADC were calculated. Results: (1) The prevalence of high-risk HPV in 1 541 patients with cervical cancer was 86.6% (1 335/1 541). The multiple high-risk HPV infection rate in patients with SCC ≥60 years old (23.0%, 37/161) was significantly higher than those in patients aged 45-59 years old and ≤44 years old [11.4% (85/747) vs 11.7% (50/429), P<0.01], and the high-risk HPV infection rates of patients with cervical cancer in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central China and other regions were respectively 86.8% (834/961), 87.7% (214/244), 83.4% (146/175), 83.9% (73/87) and 91.9% (68/74). SCC (86.8%, 1 337/1 541) and ADC (5.6%, 87/1 541) were the most common pathological types in cervical cancer. The high-risk HPV prevalence of SCC, ADC, ASC, MC, NEC and VADC were 90.1% (1 205/1 337), 74.7% (65/87), 87.0% (20/23), 65.0% (13/20), 72.0% (18/25) and 5/5 respectively. The high-risk HPV infection rates of SC, EC, CCC and MDAC were 4/9, 3/12, 2/19 and 0/4 respectively.

While, HPV 18 (44.1%), HPV 16 (20.5%), HPV 52 (2.3%), HPV 58 (1.2%) and HPV 51 (1.2%) were the main carcinogenic subtypes in ADC. The main carcinogenic high-risk HPV subtypes of ASC, NEC and MC were HPV 18 and HPV 16. The total attribution of HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 prevented by 9-valent HPV vaccine in SCC and ADC were 82.6% and 68.1% respectively; the attribution of HPV 45 in SCC and ADC were only 0.8% and 0. Conclusions: SCC and ADC are the main pathological types in cervical cancer. SCC, ADC, ASC, MC, NEC and VADC are closely related to high-risk HPV infection. HPV 16 is the main carcinogenic genotypes of SCC.

Most studies are retrospective analyses of prospectively collected databases. Evidence suggests a positive correlation between frailty level and mortality rate, postoperative complication rate, length of stay, and the possibility of discharge to a skilled nursing facility; these correlations have been illustrated across various spine procedures. The leading index is the modified frailty index, which measures 11 deficits. The development of more comprehensive frailty indices, such as the Adult Spinal Deformity Frailty Index, are promising and have high predictive value regarding postoperative complication rate in patients with spinal deformity. However, a frailty index that combines clinical, radiographic, and laboratory measures awaits development. Perhaps, the use of a frailty index in preoperative risk stratification for elective spine procedures could serve multiple purposes, including screening for high-risk patients, enhancement of operative decision making, approximation of complication rate for informed decision making, and refinement of perioperative care. Further prospective studies are warranted to determine clinically meaningful interventions in frail individuals.",Pullout Strength Predictor: A Machine Learning Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154706,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,A biomechanical study.,Feasibility and Safety of Outpatient Lumbar Microscopic Discectomy in a Developing Country.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154705,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,Prospective study.,"Factors Affecting Postoperative Sagittal Alignment after Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion in Adult Spinal Deformity: Posterior Osteotomy, Anterior Longitudinal Ligament Rupture, and Endplate Injury.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154704,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,Prospective cohort study.,Surgical Results of Patients with Myelopathy due to Ossification of the Ligamentum Flavum with Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament or a Vertebral Fracture at the Same Level of the Thoracic Spine: A Retrospective Comparative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154703,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,Retrospective and comparative study.,Effect of Indirect Neural Decompression with Oblique Lateral Interbody Fusion Was Influenced by Preoperative Lumbar Lordosis in Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154702,Asian spine journal,2019 06 03,Retrospective clinical study on the indirect decompressive effect of oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) for adult spinal deformity.

A 17-year-old male patient with severe blast injury of the right lower extremity was admitted to our department on the fifth day after a terrorist bombing attack. Initially he had been admitted to an emergency department with segmental tibia fracture and arterial injury (Gustilo IIIC). An amputation had been foreseen due to ischemia that persisted even after orthopedic fixation and revascularization interventions, followed by fasciotomy incisions. After consultation with our department hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy was administered twice daily for the first week. Ischemia improved prominently after 10 HBO2 sessions. HBO2 therapy was continued together with antibiotherapy and wound care. The patient underwent a total of 40 HBO2 sessions and two reconstructive operations and healed without amputation. Vascular injuries with concomitant orthopedic trauma cause most of the delayed amputations in bombing attacks since ischemia can persist at the microvascular level even though adequate treatments are applied. HBO2 corrects hypoxia at tissue level and so provides oxygen for the critically ischemic cells in the injured area. HBO2 also enhances host defense and decreases the ischemia reperfusion injury. In this case, HBO2 was effective in survival and functional recovery (salvage) of the extremity together with regular wound care, antibiotherapy and surgical repair.",Visualization of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in a late tissue radiation injury of the chest wall treated with adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy using fluorescence angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154687,"Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc",2019 06 02,"Adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer treatment often involves high doses of radiation, making patients more susceptible to late radiation tissue injury (LRTI), severe complications of which involve necrosis and ulceration.

The calibration data contained details of human, goat, sheep and pig exposures to raised pressure while breathing air or oxygen/nitrogen mixtures. No exposures had substantial staged decompression or cases of suspected pulmonary barotrauma. DCS risk was scaled between species and with body mass. A parameter was introduced to account for the possibility of the occurrence of some symptom types masking others.

The probability of experiencing hypoxia is related to the type of dive and the equipment used. Hypoxia in diving is a potentially fatal event for the diver, as it can lead to the loss of brain functions and consequently to the loss of breathing control, all in the absence of specific premonitory symptoms. It is a risk that may be encountered more frequently by divers who use a closed-circuit rebreather (CCR). For those who use this type of equipment, hypoxia is usually the most frequent cause of death [1]. Our study was aimed at the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation in order to identify, in the future, a preclinical hypoxic condition. We combined the use of pulse oximetry with two forehead sensors on an underwater diver subject who was using an electronic closed-circuit rebreather (ECCR). Despite the known limits of this method and the preliminary status of these findings [2], the recorded data show a clear validity in the use of pulse oximetry in immersion for the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation. In the future, the pulse oximeter could become part of the instrumentation of the diver who uses CCR gear. The device could easily be implemented in these rebreathers. The possibility of being able to perform a basic instrumental analysis means that the diver can become more quickly aware of imminent hypoxia, characterized by the absence of clearly identifiable warning symptoms, and can put in place all the correct procedures for an emergency ascent, avoiding serious consequences.",MicroRNA profiling in serous cavity specimens: Diagnostic challenges and new opportunities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154675,Cancer cytopathology,2019 06 02,"The cytomorphologic evaluation of serous cavity specimens can quickly determine the cause of an effusion as well as the presence or absence of a neoplastic process. Ancillary tests such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are frequently used to help to definitively identify malignant cells, determine a site of origin, and distinguish between malignant and reactive mesothelial proliferations. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been increasingly evaluated in cytologic specimens, including those from serous cavities. The examination of miRNA is attractive because of the stability of miRNA in such specimens and data suggesting that miRNA can provide prognostic and therapeutic information in addition to its role in diagnosis. Furthermore, miRNAs exist within extracellular exosomes, and this allows for their analysis in specimens that contain only rare malignant cells, degenerated cells, or obscuring components. This review discusses the technical aspects of specimen processing for miRNA analysis, recent studies of miRNA expression in malignant serous cavity specimens, and the potential importance of miRNA expression analysis for serous cavity specimens in the near future.",Cassava brown streak virus Ham1 protein hydrolyses mutagenic nucleotides and is a necrosis determinant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154674,Molecular plant pathology,2019 06 02,"Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a leading cause of cassava losses in East and Central Africa, and is currently having a severe impact on food security. The disease is caused by two viruses within the Potyviridae family: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), which both encode atypical Ham1 proteins with highly conserved inosine triphosphate (ITP) pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase) domains. ITPase proteins are widely encoded by plant, animal, and archaea. They selectively hydrolyse mutagenic nucleotide triphosphates to prevent their incorporation into nucleic acid and thereby function to reduce mutation rates. It has previously been hypothesized that U/CBSVs encode Ham1 proteins with ITPase activity to reduce viral mutation rates during infection. In this study, we investigate the potential roles of U/CBSV Ham1 proteins. We show that both CBSV and UCBSV Ham1 proteins have ITPase activities through in vitro enzyme assays. Deep-sequencing experiments found no evidence of the U/CBSV Ham1 proteins providing mutagenic protection during infections of Nicotiana hosts. Manipulations of the CBSV_Tanza infectious clone were performed, including a Ham1 deletion, ITPase point mutations, and UCBSV Ham1 chimera. Unlike severely necrotic wild-type CBSV_Tanza infections, infections of Nicotiana benthamiana with the manipulated CBSV infectious clones do not develop necrosis, indicating that that the CBSV Ham1 is a necrosis determinant. We propose that the presence of U/CBSV Ham1 proteins with highly conserved ITPase motifs indicates that they serve highly selectable functions during infections of cassava and may represent a euphorbia host adaptation that could be targeted in antiviral strategies."

Consequently, the physical and social functioning of patients suffering from severe sensory disabilities is limited on several levels. This has motivated the development of a novel therapeutic alternative: &ldquo;artificial senses&rdquo;, more commonly known as sensory neuroprostheses. In order to restore lost function, sensory neuroprostheses attempt to take advantage of the information transfer pathway common to all senses: (i) transduction of the physical stimulus by sensory receptors, (ii) transmission of relevant information to primary sensory areas in the brain by sensory afferents, and (iii) analysis and integration of the information at multiple levels in the central nervous system. Neurosensory deficits might occur upon damage to any of the structures involved in this process. However, damage to the peripheral sensory receptor is often the cause of neurosensory loss. Most sensory neuroprostheses attempt to &ldquo;replace&rdquo; the malfunctioning or missing peripheral sensory organ by directly delivering basic sensory information to the brain using electrical currents. If the prosthesis is able to deliver enough consistent information, the brain will be able to correctly interpret it and useful rehabilitation can be achieved. This review presents the main challenges related to the development, implementation and translation to clinical practice of these devices: (i) sensory information needs to be efficiently delivered to specific neural targets (e.g., peripheral afferents or specific central nuclei); (ii) then the expected physiological response must be evoked and quantified; (iii) the restoration of basic sensory abilities can lead to useful rehabilitation in meaningful everyday activities; (iv) optimal prospects require specific rehabilitation therapy and lifelong medico-technical follow-up. To conclude, the current state and future of sensory neuroprostheses will be discussed. This will include current clinical and technical challenges, future prospects, and the potential of these devices to improve our fundamental knowledge of sensory physiology and neurosensory deficits.",Use of day and night urinary iodine excretion to estimate the prevalence of inadequate iodine intakes via the estimated average requirement cut-point method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154659,Swiss medical weekly,2019 06 02,"The objectives were to determine urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in day and night samples collected over a 24-hour period and evaluate the usual dietary iodine intake distribution from this collection. We propose a method by which the prevalence of inadequacy can be calculated from a single 24-hour collection, reducing the burden on participants and the study costs. The samples from 1128 participants were collected between 2009 and 2013 within the framework of the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes observational cohort study; 1024 samples were suitable for statistical evaluation of iodine analysis. Participants were over 18, resident in Switzerland and of European ancestry. Over 24 hours, urine was collected as night-time (bedtime until and including first morning urine) and day-time (the remainder) samples. Associations with variables, in particular to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were investigated using mixed models. The 24-hour median UICs were 73 and 96 &micro;g/l for women (n = 542) and men (n = 482), respectively; 24-hour median intakes (derived from the corresponding excretion) were 127 and 156 &micro;g/d, respectively. Day and night excretions were normalised to 24-hour excretion values and the usual intake distribution calculated by the US National Cancer Institute method. The Estimated Average Requirement cut-point method was used to calculate the prevalence of inadequacy, estimated at 14% for women and 4% for men; above the target of 2-3%. We conclude that segregating 24-hour urine into day and night collections is sufficient to determine the prevalence of iodine inadequacy in the population and reduces the burden on participants by sparing a second 24-hour collection.

He also presented with hyperaminoaciduria, renal diabetes, phosphaturia, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, supporting a diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome. In this case, the cause of Fanconi syndrome was most likely entecavir, which had been administered as needed depending on his renal function for 5 years. After drug discontinuation and replacement with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate therapy once a week, the patient's kidney function recovered and electrolyte anomalies partially improved. We highlight the fact that entecavir may induce severe renal dysfunction, which can cause the development of Fanconi syndrome; therefore, close monitoring of proximal tubular function is recommended during entecavir therapy.","Methylation profile of genes involved in inflammation, in the blood from pregnancies with maternal preeclampsia due to untreated gestational diabetes mellitus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154656,"Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2019 06 02,To investigate DNA methylation changes in peripheral blood from patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE) due to poorly treated GDM.,"Identified trans-splicing of YELLOW-FRUITED TOMATO 2 encoding the PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1 protein alters fruit color by map-based cloning, functional complementation and RACE.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154655,Plant molecular biology,2019 06 02,"Found a trans-splicing of PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1 alters tomato fruit color by map-based cloning, functional complementation and RACE providing an insight into fruit color development. Color is an important fruit quality trait and a major determinant of the economic value of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Fruit color inheritance in a yellow-fruited cherry tomato (cv. No. 22), named yellow-fruited tomato 2 (yft2), was shown to be controlled by a single recessive gene, YFT2. The YFT2 gene was mapped in a 95.7 kb region on chromosome 3, and the candidate gene, PHYTOENE SYNTHASE 1 (PSY1), was confirmed by functional complementation analysis. Constitutive over expression of PSY1 in yft2 increased the accumulation of carotenoids and resulted in a red fruit color, while no causal mutation was detected in the YFT2 allele of yft2, compared with red-fruited SL1995 cherry tomato or cultivated variety (cv. M82). Expression of YFT2 3' region in yft2 was significantly lower than in SL1995, and further studies revealed a difference in YFT2 post-transcriptional processing in yft2 compared with SL1995 and cv. M82, resulting in a longer YFT2 transcript. The alternatively trans-spliced allele of YFT2 in yft2 is predicted to encode a novel LT-YFT2 protein of 432 amino acid (AA) residues, compared to the 412 AA YFT2 protein of SL1995. The trans-spliced event also resulted in significantly down regulated expression of YFT2 in yft2 tomato, and the YFT2 allele suppressed expression of the downstream genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and carotenoids synthesis by a mechanism of the feed-forward regulation. In conclusion, we found that trans-splicing of YFT2 alters tomato fruit color, providing new insights into fruit color development.",Interlaboratory Comparative Study to Detect Potentially Infectious Human Enteric Viruses in Influent and Effluent Waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154654,Food and environmental virology,2019 06 02,"Wastewater represents the main reusable water source after being adequately sanitized by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).

Concomitantly, a viability PMAxx-RT-qPCR was applied to all the samples to get information on the potential infectivity of both influent and effluent waters. The ranges of the titers in influent waters for NoV GI, NoV GII, RV, and HAstV were 4.80-7.56, 5.19-7.31 log gc/L, 5.41-6.52, and 4.59-7.33 log PCRU/L, respectively.

Moreover, the viral titers detected by viability RT-qPCR showed statistical differences with RT-qPCR alone, suggesting the potential viral infectivity of the samples despite some observed reductions. The proposed method could be applied in ill-equipped laboratories, due to the lack of a requirement for a specific apparatus (i.e., ultracentrifuge).",Surveillance of Enteric Viruses and Thermotolerant Coliforms in Surface Water and Bivalves from a Mangrove Estuary in Southeastern Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154653,Food and environmental virology,2019 06 02,"This study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of a mangrove estuary in the Vitória Bay region, Espírito Santo, Brazil.

Human adenovirus, rotavirus A (RVA), and norovirus genogroup II were analyzed by quantitative PCR. The highest viral load was found in RVA-positive samples with a concentration of 3.0 × 104 genome copies (GC) L-1 in water samples and 1.3 × 105 GC g-1 in bivalves. RVA was the most prevalent virus in all matrices. Thermotolerant coliforms were quantified as colony-forming units (CFU) by the membrane filtration method. The concentration of these bacteria in water was in accordance with the Brazilian standard for recreational waters (< 250 CFU 100 mL-1) during most of the monitoring period (12 out of 13 months). However, thermotolerant coliform concentrations of 3.0, 3.1, and 2.6 log CFU 100 g-1 were detected in M. charruana, M. guyanensis, and C. rhizophorae, respectively. The presence of human-specific viruses in water and bivalves reflects the strong anthropogenic impact on the mangrove and serves as an early warning of waterborne and foodborne disease outbreaks resulting from the consumption of shellfish and the practice of water recreational activities in the region."

This study monitored the recovery of low-intertidal, soft-bottom infauna macrobenthic invertebrates in Bodo Creek intermittently over a 7-year period post oil spill. Samples were taken twice a month (spring and neap low tides) for 6 months (September 2015-February 2016) at sites previously studied (pre-spill baseline studies, 3-year and 5-year post-spill studies) for the effects of oil pollution using the same sampling methods used during initial studies of the same area. Comparatively, the initial studies reported Polychaeta as the dominant class against the dominant Crustacea reported in this 7-year post-spill study, indicating a change in the community structure of the study area. Infauna macro-invertebrate communities recorded showed an improvement (that is, increased species richness and number of individuals) over the initial 3-year and 5-year post-spill studies. However, relating the results to the initial baseline pre-spill studies, an annual average of 9.7% recovery rate was observed. Analysis of results showed that the total hydrocarbon content (THC) of the sediment remained high (90.08-12,184 mg/kg) but was markedly lower than levels observed during the initial post-spill study (6422-7186 mg/kg). Tidal flushing and biodegradation processes were deemed responsible for the reduction in THC.

In contrast, significant increases were observed for Cd2+ content in roots, leaves and grains, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, radical scavenging activity (DPPH), reducing power capacity, and fragmentation in DNA in comparison to controls (without Cd2+ or Pb2+ addition). However, treating the Cd2+- or Pb2+-stressed wheat plants with Spm, Spd, or Put, either by seed soaking or foliar spray, significantly improved growth and yield characteristics and activities of POD, GR, AAO, PPO, SOD, and CAT, DPPH, and reducing power capacity in wheat plants. In contrast, Cd2+ levels in roots, leaves, and yielded grains, and fragmentation in DNA were significantly reduced compared with the stressed (with Cd2+ or Pb2+) controls. Generally, seed soaking treatments were more effective than foliar spray treatments. More specifically, seed priming in Put was the best treatment under heavy metal stress. Results of this study recommend using polyamines, especially Put, as seed soaking to relieve the adverse effects of heavy metals in wheat plants.",Magnetic Fe3O4/multi-walled carbon nanotubes materials for a highly efficient depletion of diclofenac by catalytic wet peroxideoxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154640,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 02,"The aim of this work is to synthesize a magnetic magnetite/multi-walled carbon nanotube (Fe3O4/MWCNT) catalyst by a method combining co-precipitation and hydrothermal treatments for the efficient removal of diclofenac (DCF) by catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO). The support (MWCNTs) shows a moderate-large surface area and good adsorption capacity, leading to the improvement of the magnetite (Fe3O4) dispersion on its surface. The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied in order to find out the effect of the reaction parameters on DCF removal, allowing to establish the optimum operating conditions (T = 60 °C, [H2O2]0 = 2.7 mM, [catalyst] = 1.0 g L-1). The optimum CWPO experiment showed an outstanding catalytic activity at non-modified pH solution (6.7), obtaining a 95% of DCF removal after 3 h reaction time; this high efficiency can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the iron-based catalyst with the high quantity of •OH radicals generated on the surface of the catalyst. In addition, the Fe3O4/MWCNT material exhibited good reusability along three consecutive reaction cycles, finding a pollutant removal close to 95% in each cycle of 3 h reaction time. Additionally, a degradation mechanism pathway was proposed for the removal of DCF by CWPO. The versatility of the material was finally demonstrated in the treatment of different environmentally relevant aqueous matrices (a wastewater treatment plant effluent, surface water, and hospital wastewater), obtaining an effective reduction in the ecotoxicity values.",Recommendations for the management of construction and demolition waste in treatment plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154639,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 02,"The construction and demolition waste is one of the heaviest and most voluminous waste streams generated in the European Union. It comprises approximately one third of the waste generated. Recycling this stream waste will provide ecological and sustainable benefits. The recycled aggregates from the construction and demolition waste are beginning to be used in civil construction, as substitutes for natural aggregates. The possible applications of recycled aggregates in the infrastructure construction projects will mainly depend on the quality of the recycled aggregates. This will be determined by the nature and the origin of the construction and demolition waste, and the treatment system used. It requires a comprehensive response by part of the processing agents, mainly construction and demolition companies, and above all public administrations. This work proposes recommendations for the handling of the construction and demolition waste, both in the demolition and in the treatment plants. A quality control system is suggested too.","Characteristics, hazards, and control of illegal villa (houses): evidence from the Northern Piedmont of Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154638,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 02,"Unapproved and illegal buildings have sprawled into the Northern Piedmont of the Qinling Mountains.

In Oman, prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men, with the majority of prostate cancer patients presenting in the more advanced stages of the disease. Public awareness of the risk factors, symptoms and emphasising the importance of seeking early medical attention could help to improve the outcomes and survival rates of prostate cancer patients. The aim of this study is to determine the awareness levels of the risk factors, symptoms and barriers to seeking early medical intervention among adult Omani men. A validated questionnaire measuring the knowledge of risk factors, symptoms and barriers to seeking early medical help was used to collect data from adult Omani men attending a teaching hospital in Muscat, Oman. Out of 720 men who were invited, 600 participated in the study (response rate = 83%). The most recognised risk factor was obesity (366; 61.0%), and the least was sexually transmitted diseases (204; 34.0%); the most recognised symptom was unexplained weight loss (26.5%), the least was changes in seminal fluid (13.3%); the most common barrier to seeking early intervention was ""not trusting the medical knowledge of the doctors"" (57.5%), the least was ""difficulty in arranging transport"" (19.5%). Age, education level, marital status and family history of cancer were significantly associated with the participants' knowledge of prostate cancer. Participants received a significant part of their prostate cancer awareness via the social media. National awareness campaigns using social media and information leaflets are needed to educate Omani men on prostate cancer awareness and prevention and to increase trust in the expertise of medical professionals. Further research exploring the barriers to seeking early medical intervention is needed.",Successful Development of a Competency-Based Residency Training Program in Radiation Oncology: Our 15-Year Experience from Within a Developing Country.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154636,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 06 02,"One of the main challenges of delivering high quality of care to cancer patients in developing countries is the lack of well-trained radiation oncologists. This is a direct cause for the lack of residency programs coupled with lack of resources. This article describes and details establishments of a successful and sustainable radiation-oncology residency program in our country. The program has been in operation for 14 years and has trained and graduated radiation oncologists who are now working in various countries. The curriculum of the 4-year residency program, fashioned according to American College of Radiologists (ACR) recommendations, includes site-specific clinical rotations and didactic lectures in clinical oncology, radiobiology, medical physics, statistics, and epidemiology. It also includes a component of advanced clinical experience in the form of 3-month externship at one of collaborating centers outside the country. Evaluation of the residents is conducted annually via written exams and 360° feedback. Residents also sit for the formal certification exam in radiation oncology from the national Medical Council. The exam consists of 2 written exams and one oral. As a form of benchmarking residents' knowledge, they are required to sit for the ACR examinations held annually and conducted in Amman in tandem. The program has successfully trained and graduated 28 residents, who now work as consultant radiation oncologists locally and abroad. Each resident has gone through a structured training that includes exposure to a Western-style patient-management culture, enhancing the breadth and width of their clinical experience. The residency program, initiated in a developing country, underwent many challenges, yet it overcome all obstacles and resulted in a successful training of competent radiation oncologists serving the region.",Success Bias and Inflation Bias After Planning and Communicating Emotional Support.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154635,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 06 02,"This study investigates the potential for cancer patients' supporters to experience cognitive biases after communicating emotional support messages. A success bias was predicted, such that those who planned their messages would rate those messages as more effective in comparison with those who did not plan their messages (H1a-H1c). An inflation bias was also predicted, such that supporters would rate their messages as more effective than cancer patients who also rated the messages (H2a-H2c). One hundred laboratory participants were randomly assigned to a planning or distraction task before recording an emotional support message for a friend who had hypothetically been diagnosed with cancer. Laboratory participants rated their own messages in terms of relational assurances, problem-solving utility, and emotional awareness. Subsequently, cancer patients viewed and rated the laboratory participants' messages on the same characteristics. Participants who planned their messages rated their messages significantly higher than those who did not plan their messages in terms of relational assurance and problem-solving utility but not emotional awareness. Irrespective of planning or distraction condition, participants also rated their messages significantly higher on all three dependent variables than did cancer patients. Supporters should be aware of the propensity to overrate their supportive abilities and guard against the assumption that planning messages results in more effective support messages.",A Threshold of Meaning for Work Disability Improvement in Psoriatic Arthritis Measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154634,Rheumatology and therapy,2019 06 02,"The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Specific Health Problem Questionnaire (WPAI:SHP) is used to assess the impact of an intervention on work productivity in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Male goats (n = 7 per breed) were used to conduct a summertime 28-day trial along with hypohydration. The animals were fitted with miniscule thermologgers, intraperitoneally and subcutaneously, to measure core (Tc) and peripheral (Tp) body temperatures (BT), respectively. All goats were kept under shaded housing for a 7-day basal period before being switched to unshaded pens for the next 21 days. During the first 14 days, animals had free access to water. However, during the third 7-day period, access to water was time-restricted (4 h/day). Finally, it was restricted to 40% of the third week's average daily intake over the last 7 days. Exposure to the unshaded conditions resulted in pronounced heat stress in all animals, as reflected by 0.42 and 1.44 °C rises for Tc and Tp, respectively. The F1 goats displayed a clear heterothermic adaptive response, especially after the water restriction bouts' initiation. Interestingly, the F1 goats displayed higher ratios of renal relative medullary thickness (77.7, 73.3, and 72.6 ± 1.1%) along with higher circulating concentrations of antidiuretic hormone (44.6, 31.6, and 11.6 ± 3.7 ng/mL), respectively, which suggested an improved water metabolism.",Handling shock in idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (Clarkson's disease): less is more.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154613,Internal and emergency medicine,2019 06 02,"Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (ISCLS) presents with recurrent potentially life-threatening episodes of hypovolemic shock associated with severe hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia. Timely recognition is of paramount importance because ISCLS, despite resembling other kinds of hypovolemic shock, requires a peculiar approach, to prevent life-threatening iatrogenic damage. Due to the rarity of this condition with only scattered cases described worldwide, evidence-based recommendations are still lacking. Here, we summarize our 40 years' experience in treating shock in ISCLS patients to derive a therapeutic algorithm. Records from 12 ISCLS patients (mean follow-up is 6 years, with a mean age at symptoms' onset of 51.5 years) were informative for treatment modalities and outcome of 66 episodes of shock. Episodes are divided in three phases and treatment recommendations are the following: prodromal symptoms-signs (growing malaise, oligo-anuria, orthostatic dizziness) last 6-12 h and patients should maintain rigorous bed rest. The acute shock phase lasts 24-36 h. Patients should be admitted to ICU, placed on restrictive infusion of fluids favoring cautious boluses of high-molecular-weight plasma expanders when SAP < 70 mmHg; monitored for cerebral/cardiac perfusion, myocardial edema and signs of compartment syndrome. The post-acute (recovery) phase may last from 48 h to 1 week. Monitor for cardiac overload to prevent cardiac failure; in case of persistent renal failure, hemodialysis may be necessary; consider albumin infusion. Complications listed by frequency in our patients were acute renal failure, compartment syndrome and neuropathy, rhabdomyolysis, myocardial edema, pericardial-pleural-abdominal effusion, cerebral involvement, acute pulmonary edema and deep vein thrombosis.",Single or Combined Applications of Zinc and Multi-strain Probiotic on Intestinal Histomorphology of Broilers Under Cyclic Heat Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154611,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2019 06 02,"Two-hundred-eighty-day-old broiler chicks were divided into seven groups.

Significant decrease (p < 0.05) was observed in villus height (VH), VH to crypt depth ratio, and villus surface area of all intestinal segments in the T2 group when compared with the T1 group. The same parameters had significantly higher (p < 0.05) values in the jejunum and ileum of the Zn- and probiotic-supplemented groups (alone + combination) when compared with the T2 group. The birds exposed to HS showed fewer (p < 0.05) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the jejunum and ileum than the T1 group, while their count increased in the jejunum and ileum with dietary treatments.

There is a link between FKN and steroidogenesis as FKN induces progesterone synthesis. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder associated with low progesterone production and insulin resistance. We aimed to explore whether women with PCOS have any difference in FKN levels compared to women without PCOS. We also focused on determination of any association between FKN levels and hormonal-metabolic parameters in women with PCOS.,Asparagine 79 is an important amino acid for catalytic activity and substrate specificity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154605,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 02,"Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), a member of cholylglycine hydrolase (CGH) family, catalyze the hydrolysis of glycine and taurine-linked bile salts in the small intestine of human. BSH is evolutionarily related to penicillin V acylase (PVA) which hydrolyses a penicillin V and is also a member of CGH family. Although, five of the six amino acids, C2, R16, D19, N170, N79 and R223, supposed to be responsible for catalytic activity of BSH enzyme, are strictly conserved in all CGH family members, N79 is partially conserved in this family. In this study, in order to analyze the correlation between N79 and catalytic activity or substrate specificity of BSH, the polar and acidic N79 was substituted for the aliphatic and hydrophobic V79 by PCR-based site directed mutagenesis and mutant recombinant BSH was expressed in E. coli BLR(DE3). While the effects of the mutation on catalytic activity and substrate specificity of BSH were detected by ninhydrin assay. The effect of this mutation on the stability of the BSH was observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Although V79 mutation resulted in stable BSH, it reduced the catalytic activity and altered substrate specificity of BSH. The results suggested that N79 might be important for substrate binding and catalytic turnover of BSH.",Addressing the impact of different fetal bovine serum percentages on mesenchymal stem cells biological performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154604,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 02,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are presently on the top of hierarchy in the field of stem cell therapy, due to their miraculous therapeutic abilities in diminishing the symptoms of many chronic diseases and initiating regeneration and repair for various damaged tissues and organs. The foremost initial step to reach high success rate in any MSCs based study is the optimization of culture growth media by establishing a suitable fetal bovine serum (FBS) percentage that suits the purpose of MSCs based experiment. Choosing the suitable FBS percentage is a controversial issue and merely depends on the researchers experience and suggested recommendations by the suppliers. Despite the huge improvements in overall MSCs investigating approaches, there are no definite protocols that set up a range of FBS percentages that can be followed. Toward achieving this objective, we evaluate in the present report the effect of using various FBS percentages (5-20%) added to DMEM low glucose media, on the biological behaviour of MSCs. Growing MSCs in high FBS percentages containing culture media (15% and 20% FBS) increase the proliferation and expansion rate of MSCs, although it decreases the immunosuppressive properties. On the other hand, adding low FBS percentage (7% FBS) to MSCs culture media enhanced the immunosuppression characteristics of MSCs, even though the proliferation rate was moderately reduced. 7% FBS is the cut off percentage that can be used without negatively altering major MSCs biological properties in which using 5% FBS will cause a tremendous decrease in the proliferation capacity and immunosuppressive properties. This report may assist other researchers in choosing appropriate FBS percentage when preparing MSCs culture media that serve the purpose of their MSCs based studies.",Identification of novel rhesus macaque microRNAs from naïve whole blood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154603,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 02,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as novel molecular tools for diagnosing and treating diseases. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are the most widely used nonhuman primate species for biomedical studies, yet only 912 mature miRNAs have been identified in this species compared to 2654 in humans and 1978 in mice. The aim of this project was to help bridge that gap in knowledge by evaluating circulating miRNA in naïve rhesus monkeys and comparing results with currently available databases in different species in order to identify novel, mature miRNAs. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood of ten healthy, adult rhesus macaques. After performing next generation sequencing (NGS), 475 novel, mature miRNAs were identified in rhesus macaques for the first time; of those, 423 were identified for the first time in any species. The most abundantly expressed novel rhesus macaque miRNA, hsa-miR-744-5p, has previously been described in humans. Database assessment of hsa-miR-744-5p potential gene targets showed that while the gene targets showed > 90% sequence similarity between rhesus and humans, many did not share the same consensus sequences. The identification of 475 novel miRNAs in the blood of rhesus macaque reflects the complexity and variety of miRNAs across species. Further NGS studies are needed to reveal novel miRNA that will inform on species-, tissue-, and condition-specific miRNAs.",Is there any correlation between apoptotic genes expression in cumulus cells with embryo morphokinetics?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154602,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 02,"The aim was to assess the correlation between apoptotic genes of cumulus cells (CCs) with embryo morphokinetics as non invasive methods for embryo selection. Evaluation of cleavage activity among in vitro-fertilized embryos was dependent on determining not only expression profiles of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in CCs surrounding ovulated oocytes but also morphokinetic parameters such as time of second PB extrusion (tPB2), pronuclei appearance (tPN), pronuclei fading (tPNf), formation of two to eight cells (t2-t8) and cleavage pattern [uneven at two cells stage, cell fusion (Fu) and trichomonas mitoses (TM)].

The aims were to: (a) evaluate acceptability and feasibility of an innovative theory-based intervention designed to change both child and adult behavior, and (b) generate effect sizes for a definitive randomized controlled trial. The oral health of sixty children aged 5-9 years with a repaired cleft lip and/or palate was assessed before randomization to one of three conditions: (a) control group, (b) intervention group in which children and adults were asked to form implementation intentions, or (c) intervention plus booster group in which adults were additionally sent a reminder about the implementation intentions they and their children formed. Oral health assessments were repeated at 6-month follow-up alongside exit interviews. The procedures proved popular and participants exposed to the intervention additionally reported believing that forming implementation intentions was effective. Descriptive statistics generally showed oral health improvements across all conditions, although the effects were more marked in the intervention plus booster condition, where plaque improved by 44.53%, gingivitis improved by 20.00% and free sugar consumption improved by 8.92% (vs. 6.43% improvement, 15.00% deterioration and 15.58% improvement in the control group, respectively). Data collection procedures were acceptable and the intervention feasible. The effect sizes suggest that the intervention plus booster condition has sufficient promise to proceed to a fully-powered randomized controlled trial. The intervention has the potential to be adapted to tackle other child health behaviors and to be deployed at scale."

It is conjectured that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play definitive roles in the process. To decipher the signaling overlap behind this phenotypic resemblance, the activity status of RTKs is probed in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues and cell models. Activities of only about one-third changed in a similar fashion, whereas about half of them showed opposite outcomes when exposed to contrasting signals akin to AD and T2D. Interestingly, irrespective of disease type, RTKs with enhanced and compromised activities clustered distinctly, indicating separate levels of regulations. Similar regulatory mechanisms within an activity cluster could be inferred, which have potential to impact future therapeutic developments.",Psychiatric Risk Assessment from the Clinician's Perspective: Lessons for the Future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154587,Community mental health journal,2019 06 02,"Accurate prediction of risk-states in Serious Mental Illnesses (SMIs) is critical for reducing their massive societal burden. Risk-state assessments are notably inaccurate. Recent innovations, including widely available and inexpensive mobile technologies for ambulatory ""biobehavioral"" data, can reshape risk assessment. To help understand and accelerate clinician involvement, we surveyed 90 multi-disciplinary clinicians serving SMI populations in various settings to evaluate how risk assessment is conducted and can improve. Clinicians reported considerable variability in conducting risk assessment, and few clinicians explicated their procedures beyond tying it to broader mental status examinations or interviews. Very few clinicians endorsed using currently-available standardized risk measures, and most reported low confidence in their utility. Clinicians also reported spending approximately half the time conducting individual risk assessments than optimally needed. When asked about improvement, virtually no clinicians acknowledged biobehavioral, objective technologies, or ambulatory recording. Overall, clinicians seemed unaware of meaningful ways to improve risk assessment.",Pectus Carinatum: a non-invasive and objective measurement of severity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154586,Medical & biological engineering & computing,2019 06 02,"To date, standard methods for assessing the severity of chest wall deformities are mostly linked to X-ray and CT scans. However, the use of radiations limits their use when there is a need to monitor the development of the pathology over time. This is particularly important when dealing with patients suffering from Pectus Carinatum, whose treatment mainly requires the use of corrective braces and a systematic supervision. In recent years, the assessment of severity of chest deformities by means of radiation-free devices became increasingly popular but not yet adopted as standard clinical practice. The present study aims to define an objective measure by defining a severity index (named External Pectus Carinatum Index) used to monitor the course of the disease during treatment. Computed on the optical acquisition of the patients' chest by means of an appositely devised, fast and easy-to-use, body scanner, the proposed index has been validated on a sample composed of a control group and a group of Pectus Carinatum patients. The index proved to be reliable and accurate in the characterization of the pathology, enabling the definition of a threshold that allows to distinguish the cases of patients with PC from those of healthy subjects.

The only mapping algorithm for estimating Child Health Utility-9D (CHU9D) utilities from Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) responses has limitations. This study aimed to develop a more accurate algorithm.,Prediction of BCG responses in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the era of novel immunotherapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154583,International urology and nephrology,2019 06 02,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillations are considered as a gold standard of therapy in high- and intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Unfortunately, up to 40% of patients might experience treatment failure and even 15% of patients initially diagnosed with NMIBC will progress to muscle-invasive disease. Since patients, who fail to respond to BCG, are at particular risk of progression, immediate radical cystectomy (RC) is currently recommended to provide cancer control. However, immunotherapy in NMIBC management still evolves. Immune checkpoint inhibitors emerge as new immunotherapeutics, which in the future might be combined with BCG and may serve as an alternative to radical cystectomy in patients, who failed to respond to BCG alone or are at particular a priori risk of BCG failure, especially if RC is not a safe option. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify NMIBC patients that will not benefit from BCG therapy and demand radical cystectomy. In the following review, we attempt to focus on several clinical and molecular factors and demonstrate the efforts directed to unravel their significance in BCG-failure risk assessment.",Fluoroquinolones-resistant Shigella species in Iranian children: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154582,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,2019 06 02,"Shigella is one of the most common causes of childhood dysentery along with high rate of morbidity and mortality in both developing and developed countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, the prevalence of fluoroquinolones-resistant Shigella species is increasing worldwide which can cause treatment failure of Shigella infections. Since there has not been any comprehensive information on drug-resistant Shigella species in Iran, we conducted the following meta-analysis to raise awareness.",Is immediate breast reconstruction safe in women over 70? An analysis of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154580,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 06 02,The safety of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) in older women is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the 30-day postoperative complication rates following IBR (implant-based or autologous) in older women (≥ 70 years) with breast cancer and to compare them to younger women (18-69 years).,The impact of distinct triple-negative breast cancer subtypes on misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154578,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 06 02,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) includes mostly aggressive types of breast cancer with poor prognosis. Due to its growth pattern, misinterpretation in clinical imaging is more frequent than in non-TNBC. As the group of TNBC contains heterogeneous types of tumors, marker expression-based subtypes have recently been established. We analyzed clinical features and false-negative imaging findings that could potentially lead to diagnostic delay within the subtypes.",Eucalyptus Edge Effect on Quercus-Herbivore Interactions in a Neotropical Temperate Forest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154577,Neotropical entomology,2019 06 02,"Fragmentation leads to the formation of edges between habitats, which in turn changes biotic and abiotic factors that might influence herbivory or plant-herbivory interactions. The aims of this study were to describe the herbivory community associated with oak (Quercus) and to determine the effects of proximity to a Eucalyptus edge and season on insect herbivory. We selected three forest sites that were subsequently divided into three quadrants located at different distances from the Eucalyptus edge: edge (0 m), intermediate (30 m), and oak forest interior (60 m). We randomly selected 10 oak trees per quadrant and conducted monthly surveys, during the dry and rainy season (from February to October 2010), where we quantified leaf area and the percentage of herbivory. These were analyzed using linear mixed models, with distance and season as fixed factors and individual and site as random factors. The primary oak herbivores were Lepidoptera caterpillars. We found that herbivory increased away from the edge but just during the rainy season, although higher herbivory levels were found during the dry season. These results seem to be related to a specialist community of herbivorous associated to the Quercus. This study emphasizes the importance of considering border effect, especially within Natural Protected Areas to establish strategies to improve and maintain native oak forest and the biodiversity of its Lepidoptera herbivorous community."

Several markers have been proposed as helpful in the identification of follicular thyroid tumors with malignant potential and worse prognosis, of which the specific point mutations C250T and C228T in the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) promoter region seem to be particularly promising. We describe a patient presenting with a large pelvic mass, in which a core needle biopsy was consistent with follicular-patterned thyroid tissue positive for a Q61R NRAS mutation and the C228T TERT promoter mutation. Upon clinical investigation, a 60-mm lesion was detected in the right thyroid lobe. The ensuing FNAB was consistent with a follicular thyroid tumor, Bethesda IV, positive for the same NRAS mutation and both the C228T and C250T TERT promoter mutations. A total thyroidectomy was performed, and a widely invasive FTC was diagnosed. Tumor tissue samples from various parts of the primary lesion were investigated for TERT promoter mutations, displaying C228T in three samples and C250T in one. Interestingly, the C228T mutations showed a coupling to areas with high Ki-67 proliferation indexes. Our data indicate that TERT promoter mutations can exhibit spatial heterogeneity in FTCs, with implications for clinical management as well as providing insights into the molecular biology underlying the tumoral etiology.",Injection and Heterosexual Risk Behaviors for HIV Infection Among Non-gay Identifying Men Who Have Sex with Men and Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154560,AIDS and behavior,2019 06 02,"Non-gay identifying men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) are an important subgroup of men who have sex with men (MSM) and have been underrepresented in studies of MSM that only use gay venues to draw their samples. We assessed heterosexual and drug use risks of MSMW who use drugs in a sample of male entrants to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel drug treatment programs from 2005 to 2018. Blood samples were collected and tested for HIV and HSV-2 infections. Among HIV seronegative participants, MSMW had significantly greater odds of sharing used needles with others, and reporting unprotected sex with female casual partners and female commercial sex partners, compared to their counterparts who reported sex with women exclusively (MSWE). Although not recruited from gay venues, MSMW had a significantly higher HIV prevalence than MSWE (23% vs. 10%, p < 0.001). Interventions that are specifically tailored to HIV prevention among MSMW are needed to ameliorate the prevalence of HIV risks and infection.",Using Social Media to Enhance Provider Network for HIV and Harm Reduction Service Integration in Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154559,AIDS and behavior,2019 06 02,Social media can potentially serve as a platform to coordinate medical care among fragmented health sectors. This paper describes procedures of using social media to enhance antiretroviral therapy (ART) and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) providers' virtual network for integrated service for HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vietnam. A total of 88 ART and MMT treatment providers participated in person group sessions followed by online virtual support to improve service integration. In-person reunions were held to reinforce Facebook participation and network activities. Content analysis was used to identify keywords and topic categories of the online information exchange. Both MMT and ART providers were actively engaged in online communications. Referral and treatment adherence were the two most frequently discussed topic areas by both the MMT and ART providers. Frequent cross-agency connections were observed. Online provider networks and communities could be built and useful to support treatment providers to improve service integration.,"Molecular-genetic diversity of the endangered Dalmatian barbelgudgeon, Aulopyge huegelii from the Buško Blato reservoir.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154556,Genetica,2019 06 02,"A number of studies investigating different aspects of IUCN endangered species, Aulopyge huegelii Heckel, 1843 (Dalmatian barbelgudgeon) biology have been conducted, but data on molecular genetics are lacking. The goal of this survey was to assess the genetic structure of the A. huegelii population from the Buško Blato reservoir, based on four mitochondrial DNA regions and five microsatellite loci. Excluding cytochrome b, more than one haplotype has been detected in all sequenced mtDNA regions, most of which had not been previously described. A total of seven composite haplotypes were detected. Nucleotide diversity was relatively low for all coding genes but slightly higher for the control region. Microsatellite analysis revealed a relatively high value of major allele frequency, lower values of observed and expected heterozygosity, as well as a moderately reduced number of alleles and genotypes in three of the five observed loci. Although with a clear trend of decline, the level of genetic diversity is still sufficient to ensure the subsistence of the population if the stressors are removed. Otherwise, the loss of heterozygosity will continue, possibly to the point of a complete eradication of the Dalmatian barbelgudgeon from the Buško Blato reservoir.",iPLA2 Activation Mediates Granular Exocytosis and Corrects Microbicidal Defects in ROS-Deficient and CGD Human Neutrophils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154555,Journal of clinical immunology,2019 06 02,"The ubiquitous calcium-independent phospholipase A2 enzyme (iPLA2) is inhibited by calmodulin binding and known to be responsible for phospholipid remodeling housekeeping functions including granule exocytosis-associated membrane fusion in normal human neutrophils.

However, the comparative efficacy and safety between 0.1 mm ePTFE and autologous pericardium in this surgical procedure remained undetermined. This single-center cohort study included 46 patients aged 3-146 months who received implanted simplified hand-sewn trileaflet valved conduits: 31 patients (Group A) received 0.1 mm ePTFE valved conduits and 15 patients (Group B) received autologous pericardium valved conduits. Perioperative and follow-up outcomes up to 3 years after the surgeries were evaluated. No perioperative complications or early mortality were observed in either group, while one Group A patient aged 46 months died 6 months after surgery due to residual ventricular septal defect. No patients in Group A developed severe regurgitation or stenosis in valves of the conduits, but two moderate stenosis by echocardiography, and seven patients in group B were deemed to be conduit dysfunction (two stenosis, three stenosis plus regurgitation, and the remaining two regurgitation). No conduits failure was detected in group A, while two patients in group B (one for severe stenosis and the other one for severe regurgitation). After 6, 12, and 36 months, 95.2%, 88.9%, and 88.9% of Group A patients and 92.3%, 68.4%, and 42.7% of Group B patients were free from valved conduit dysfunction. After the same follow-up periods, all Group A patients had no conduit failure and 92.3%, 80.8%, and 80.8% of Group B patients were free from valved conduit failure. Within the 3-year follow-up period, 0.1 mm ePTFE novel simplified hand-sewn trileaflet valved conduits appear to be associated with a lower incidence of graft failure than autologous pericardium valved conduits.",Unmet Needs of People with Serious Mental Illness: Perspectives from Certified Peer Specialists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154551,The Psychiatric quarterly,2019 06 02,"Examine the unmet needs of people with serious mental illness (SMI) from the perspective of certified peer specialists. 267 certified peer specialists from 38 states completed an online survey (female [73%], 50.9 [SD = 12] years, and non-Hispanic White [79.8%]). Many respondents reported a primary mental health diagnoses (n = 200), 22 respondents reported their diagnosis as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (11%), 46 respondents reported bipolar disorder (22.1%), 47 respondents reported major depressive disorder (22.6%), 29 respondents reported post-traumatic stress disorder (13.9%), 27 respondents reported alcohol/substance use disorder (13%), 2 respondents reported personality disorder (1%), and 12 reported ""other"" (5.8%). A mixed methods convergence analysis integrated quantitative with qualitative data. Social isolation (n = 160, 59.9%) and feeling lonely (n = 159, 59.6%) were the most highly endorsed unmet need, followed by the need to address chronic health conditions (n = 80, 30%), prevent mental health hospitalization (n = 71, 23.6%), and prevent drug use (n = 66, 24.7%). Four themes emerged: need to address basic necessities, loneliness and social isolation, hope, and addiction. Addressing loneliness and social isolation were identified as the primary unmet needs among people with SMI. Addressing co-morbid health conditions may simultaneously impact other unmet needs. Hope is an important intervention target. Initial insights from this study can be used to guide researchers' efforts to incorporate certified peer specialists perspectives in developing programs to meet the needs of people with SMI. Future research using participatory research methods can further examine these initial insights.",Multiclass Benchmarking Framework for Automated Acute Leukaemia Detection and Classification Based on BWM and Group-VIKOR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154550,Journal of medical systems,2019 06 10,"This paper aims to assist the administration departments of medical organisations in making the right decision on selecting a suitable multiclass classification model for acute leukaemia. In this paper, we proposed a framework that will aid these departments in evaluating, benchmarking and ranking available multiclass classification models for the selection of the best one. Medical organisations have continuously faced evaluation and benchmarking challenges in such endeavour, especially when no single model is superior. Moreover, the improper selection of multiclass classification for acute leukaemia model may be costly for medical organisations. For example, when a patient dies, one such organisation will be legally or financially sued for incidents in which the model fails to fulfil its desired outcome. With regard to evaluation and benchmarking, multiclass classification models are challenging processes due to multiple evaluation and conflicting criteria. This study structured a decision matrix (DM) based on the crossover of 2 groups of multi-evaluation criteria and 22 multiclass classification models. The matrix was then evaluated with datasets comprising 72 samples of acute leukaemia, which include 5327 gens. Subsequently, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used in the benchmarking and ranking of multiclass classification models. The MCDM used techniques that include the integrated BWM and VIKOR. BWM has been applied for the weight calculations of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR has been used to benchmark and rank classification models. VIKOR has also been employed in two decision-making contexts: individual and group decision making and internal and external group aggregation. Results showed the following: (1) the integration of BWM and VIKOR is effective at solving the benchmarking/selection problems of multiclass classification models. (2) The ranks of classification models obtained from internal and external VIKOR group decision making were almost the same, and the best multiclass classification model based on the two was 'Bayes. Naive Byes Updateable' and the worst one was 'Trees.LMT'. (3) Among the scores of groups in the objective validation, significant differences were identified, which indicated that the ranking results of internal and external VIKOR group decision making were valid."
