This study aimed to observe parental perceived barriers for 6- to 10-year-old children's participation in organized sports and understand to what extent the socioeconomic status, the place of residence, and children's sex, age, and sport participation affect those perceived barriers. Methods: Data were collected from 834 parents of 6- to 10-year-old children living in the Portuguese Midlands, using a multiple-choice questionnaire. Parents reported the perceived barriers to children's sport activities, such as time, health, transportation, costs, safety, facilities, weather, tiredness, and lack of interest. Children's and sociodemographic characteristics were also collected. Results: Time and costs were the most reported barriers by parents. Barriers to access were mostly reported by parents of girls and younger children, parents of inactive children, and families living in an urban setting and in socioeconomic disadvantage. Perceived barriers differed according to both children's and sociodemographic characteristics, highlighting the need to reduce costs and increase the variety of sports/facilities, particularly in families with girls, younger children, and those with lower incomes from more urbanized areas. Conclusions: The present findings should be considered in future planning and interventions to effectively promote physical activity in children.","""I Would Just Feel Really Relaxed and at Peace"": Findings From a Pilot Prison Yoga Program in Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195908,International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology,2019 06 14,"International research provides support for yoga as a well-being intervention in prison. No systematic research has been undertaken in Australia to assess the effectiveness of prison yoga programs. In 2017, the authors, in partnership with Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Corrective Services and the Yoga Foundation, introduced a weekly pilot yoga program at the ACT prison. This article presents quantitative and qualitative findings from the program. Although the small sample size (n = 8) is acknowledged, our findings indicate that participants attained statistically and clinically significant benefit from the program, demonstrated by improvements in their levels of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, goal-direction, negative affect, and non-acceptance. They also reported improved flexibility, sleep and relaxation, pain reduction, and identified improvements in their mental well-being, commenting that the program made them feel ""calm"" and ""at peace."" The article concludes by advocating for the expansion of such programs in Australian prisons and further research on such programs.",Prevalence and risk factors of group B Streptococcus colonisation in intrapartum women: a cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195907,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2019 06 14,"A cross-sectional study was conducted at a Thai university hospital between November 2016 and March 2017 to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonisation in pregnant women who were admitted to the labour room for delivery. Rectovaginal specimens were collected and processed for the identification of GBS. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate factors associated with GBS colonisation. Statistical significance was set at p < .05. Fifty-seven of 505 pregnant women (11.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.0-15.0%) were found to have GBS colonisation. Teenage pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 3.83, 95% CI 1.13-13.02, p < .05), multi-parity (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.69-7.60, p < .01) and non-Buddhist religions (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.01-3.48, p < .05) were significantly associated with GBS colonisation. Intrapartum risk factors were not associated with GBS colonisation. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? The prevalence of GBS colonisation in pregnant women varies by geographic areas and ethnicities, ranging from 2.3 to 32.9%. Risk factors for GBS colonisation have been studied but the results were inconsistent. What do the results of this study add? This study reports the prevalence of GBS colonisation in intrapartum women in Southern Thailand to be 11.3%. We also identified some independent risk factors for GBS colonisation which were teenage pregnancy, multi-parity and non-Buddhist religions. To our knowledge, the relationship between religious belief and identification of GBS has never been reported before. We also found that intrapartum risk factors that have been used as the indication for intrapartum antibiotics administration have no correlation with GBS colonisation. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study adds to the literature the prevalence and risk factors of GBS colonisation in the setting of a developing country. It also shows that intrapartum risk identification alone is not an optimal strategy to reduce infection associated with GBS. Instead, prenatal GBS screening should be encouraged to identify women with GBS colonisation to reduce the risk of infection and unnecessary antibiotics exposure.",Real-time computer-aided diagnosis of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps using an auto-fluorescence imaging system and novel color intensity analysis software.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195905,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2019 06 14,"Objectives: An endoscopic technique that provides ≥90% negative predictive value (NPV) for differentiating neoplastic polyps is needed for the management of diminutive (≤5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps. This study aimed to assess whether a newly developed software can achieve ≥90% NPV for differentiating rectosigmoid diminutive polyps based on the green-to-red (G/R) ratio, obtained by dividing the green color tone intensity by the red color tone intensity on autofluorescence imaging (AFI). Methods: From December 2017 to May 2018, consecutive patients with known polyps who were scheduled for endoscopic treatment at our institution were prospectively recruited. All colorectal diminutive polyps were differentiated by computer-aided diagnosis using autofluorescence imaging (CAD-AFI) using a novel software-based automatic color intensity analysis; subsequent diagnosis was made by endoscopists based on trimodal imaging endoscopy (TME), which combines AFI, white-light imaging (WLI) and magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) findings. Thereafter, all polyps were removed endoscopically, and the histopathological diagnosis was evaluated. Results: Ninety-five patients with 258 diminutive rectosigmoid polyps and 171 diminutive non-rectosigmoid polyps were enrolled. Regarding diminutive rectosigmoid polyps, the NPV for differentiating neoplastic polyps was 93.4% (184/197) [95% confidence interval (CI), 89.0%-96.4%] with CAD-AFI and 94.9% (185/195) (95% CI, 90.8%-97.5%) with TME. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for differentiating diminutive rectosigmoid neoplastic polyps by CAD-AFI were 91.5%, 80.0%, 95.3% and 85.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Real-time CAD-AFI was effective for differentiating diminutive rectosigmoid polyps. This objective technology, which does not require extensive training or endoscopic expertise, can contribute to the effective management of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps.",Investigation of laser pulsing parameters' importance in Er:YAG laser skin ablation: a theoretical study conducted via newly developed thermo-mechanical ablation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195904,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",2019 06 14,"Objective: Importance of laser pulsing parameters and tissue's mechanical properties in the Er:YAG laser skin-tissue ablation is not adequately understood. The goal here was to develop a computational model that incorporates skin tissue's mechanical properties to investigate the influence of Er:YAG laser pulsing parameters on tissue ablation and coagulation. Methods: Tissue's mechanical properties were incorporated by modeling ablation as a tissue water vaporization occurring under elevated pressures that depend on tissue's stress-strain relationships. Tissue deformation was assumed unidirectional; therefore, a one-dimensional model was utilized. Analytical solution and experimental results were used to verify and validate the model. Then, influence of pulse duration (10 µs-2 ms) and fluence (0-30 J cm-2) on coagulation depth and ablation efficiency was explored. Results: Verification and validation results suggested that the model is acceptably accurate. Minimal effect of pulse duration on coagulation depth was predicted at sub-ablative conditions. At those conditions, coagulation depth increased asymptotically to ∼90 µm with increasing pulse fluence. At ablative conditions, coagulation depth decreased asymptotically to 22-28 µm with increasing pulse irradiance. Ablation efficiency plateaued at high pulse fluences and long pulse durations. Mechanical properties were important as about 50% increase in coagulation depth and 25% decrease in ablation efficiency were predicted when considering the high strain-rate loading effect in comparison with quasi-static loading. Conclusions: Proper tuning of Er:YAG laser pulsing parameters can substantially improve its therapeutic outcomes. The effect of these parameters varies and depends on whether the laser-tissue conditions are ablative or sub-ablative.",Correlates of Self-Care Behaviors in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes and Comorbid Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195903,The Diabetes educator,2019 06 14,"The purpose of this study was to describe sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of diabetes self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and comorbid heart failure (HF).",The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device induces endometrial decidualisation in women on tamoxifen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195902,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2019 06 14,"There is conflicting literature on whether the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS; Mirena®) induces decidualisation in the tamoxifen-treated endometrium. The expression of the decidualisation marker IGFBP-1 was measured using immunohistochemistry in endometrial biopsies and in serum (using ELISA) of 20 postmenopausal women at the start of tamoxifen-treatment for breast cancer. Ten women were then fitted with LNG-IUS and the other ten received tamoxifen-treatment only and acted as controls. Samples were taken at baseline and after 12 months. At baseline, all endometrial samples were negative for IGFBP-1 and at 12 months, IGFBP-1 was only expressed in the endometria of women fitted with the LNG-IUS, confirming the observed histological features of decidualisation. By contrast, serum IGFBP-1 concentrations were increased by tamoxifen, but not in the group receiving LNG-IUS. In conclusion, tamoxifen induces a rise in serum IGFBP-1 suggesting a systemic, possibly hepatic effect, whilst LNG abrogates this in both the liver and endometrium. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Previous reports of the use of LNG-IUS in women on tamoxifen have provided conflicting evidence as to whether the endometrium exhibited decidualisation or not. These reports were however based solely on histological examination and lacked supporting biochemical data. What do the results of this study add? After 12 months of treatment with LNG-IUS, the endometria of women on tamoxifen show histological features of decidualisation and the presence of the decidualisation marker IGFBP-1, suggesting that levonorgestrel protects the tamoxifen-treated uterus from additional pathology by causing decidualisation. Serum levels of IGFBP-1 were expected to be a reflection of uterine production, but contrary to expectations, higher levels were identified in women on tamoxifen alone. These data suggest that an inhibition of tamoxifen-induced serum IGFBP-1 production (possibly from a hepatic source) by LNG-IUS occurred and indicates independent systemic effects of both drugs in post menopausal breast cancer patients. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This research demonstrated a mechanism for endometrial protection in women on tamoxifen. It also alerts clinicians to the fact that both tamoxifen and LNG-IUS exert systemic effects in this patient group.","Life after armed group involvement in Nepal: A clinical ethnography of psychological well-being of former ""child soldiers"" over time.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195901,Transcultural psychiatry,2019 06 14,"Little is known about the longitudinal effects of early age involvement of young people in armed groups and their well-being as they return to strongly affected, politicised communities. Current research and policy are often driven by the assumption of a causal relationship between participation in this war experience and psychological damage. This article explores the role of young people's armed group experience during the Nepal People's War, compared with post-conflict stressors, in shaping intra-psychic impact and distress, and which processes enable well-being and resilient functioning. Findings are reported from an 18-month clinical ethnography of a cohort of 17 Nepalese young subjects, where participant-observation methods were used to explore their daily lives after exiting the armed group and follow-up research conducted six years later. The findings highlighted limited evidence for on-going intra-psychic impact and distress related directly to their armed group experience; when such distress occurred, it appeared to be generated more by the structural violence of their environments. The key constituents determining their well-being included: a sense of closeness through emotional connectedness with their family, ideological proximity with the values of the armed group, closeness in their bond with the community, and the social-emotional-economic capital available to them to navigate the harsh structural constraints of post-conflict life. These data further challenge the prevailing assumption that this war experience inevitably leads to psychological damage, and the article argues that structural violence often plays a predominant role in cases where psychological distress does arise.",Designing and Testing of a Health-Economic Markov Model for Prevention and Treatment of Early Psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195900,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2019 06 14,"Background: This study aims to report on the design of a model to determine the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of early psychosis (PsyMod) and to estimate ten-year cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interventions targeting individuals with ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis or with first episode psychosis (FEP). Methods: PsyMod was built in parallel with the development of a new standard of care for treatment of early psychosis in the Netherlands. PsyMod is a state-transition cohort simulation model and considers six health states, namely ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), FEP, post-FEP, no-UHR, recovery/remission, and death. Results are expressed as total healthcare costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and budget impact. Results: PsyMod was used to extrapolate budget impact and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for preventing FEP for individuals at UHR of psychosis (CBTuhr) compared to care as usual. CBTuhr resulted in a per-patient increase of 0.06 QALYs and a per patient cost reduction of €654 (dominant ICER) with a reduction in 5-year healthcare costs of €1,002,166. Conclusions: PsyMod can be used to examine cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interventions targeting prevention and treatment of FEP and is freely available for academic purposes upon request by the authors.",Development and pre/post testing of a decision aid supporting Chinese parental and young women's HPV vaccination decision-making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195899,Women & health,2019 06 14,"We developed and tested the acceptability and utility of a novel HPV vaccination decision aid (DA) among Chinese young women aged 18-26 years and parents of adolescent girls aged 9-17 years. From March to May 2016, a total of 101 parents plus 109 young women completed baseline surveys assessing their HPV vaccination knowledge, decision self-efficacy, decision conflict, and HPV vaccination intention. Two weeks after receiving the DA, 84 (83.2%) parents and 92 (84.4%) young women completed re-assessments. Chi-square tests or t-tests were performed to compare the before-and-after differences. Cohen's d was calculated to indicate the effect size. After reading the DA, both participating young women's and parents' knowledge of HPV vaccination (Cohen's d = 0.62 among young women and d = 0.59 among parents) and decision self-efficacy (d = 0.38 among young women and d = 0.59 among parents) significantly increased. Both young women's and parents' decision conflict (d = -0 · 98 and -1.06) significantly decreased. The proportion of young women intending to receive HPV vaccination and parents deciding to vaccinate daughters against HPV significantly increased (p < 0 · 0001). The DA showed good acceptability and utility facilitating HPV vaccination decision-making for most Chinese young women and parents of adolescent girls. Further randomized controlled trials of this tool are essential."

Moreover, the role of identity satisfaction in depressive symptoms and affective well-being was evaluated, examining the moderating effect of motherhood. The study involved 74 women, aged between 19 and 57 years (Mean = 37.7 years, SD = 10.7 years). Thirty-two women (43.2%) had children, aged between 2 and 29 years. All women had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and mild to moderate disability. Mothers experienced greater depressive symptoms than childless women. Moreover, motherhood moderated the effect of disease duration on adjustment, with mothers reporting greater depressive symptoms, less affective well-being and less identity satisfaction than childless women as time passed since the diagnosis. Finally, greater identity satisfaction was related to less depressive symptoms and greater affective well-being, with a moderating effect of motherhood. The results outline the relevance of the process of identity redefinition for women's adjustment to MS early in the illness. Moreover, the results underscore the need to take into account the additional burden of motherhood when promoting women's adjustment to MS.","Identification of Celastramycin as a Novel Therapeutic Agent for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-High-throughput Screening of 5,562 Compounds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195886,Circulation research,2019 06 14,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by enhanced proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) accompanying increased production of inflammatory factors and adaptation of the mitochondrial metabolism to a hyperproliferative state.

This study assessed quality and effectiveness of popular calorie counting apps in weight management and behaviour change. Top 20 apps were selected from Google Play store and their quality was assessed using a 55-point scoring scale on attributes like standards used, content accuracy, user interface and sources of database. The mean (±SD (standard deviation)) quality score was 36.95 (±5.65). The calorie and activity recommendations were compared with standards and over 65 per cent apps over/underestimated calorie intake. To assess effectiveness, 60 young volunteers were recruited and divided into two groups. The intervention group (n = 30) was asked to use one of the top 3 apps for 8 weeks. Pre- and post-comparisons were made with the control group (n = 28). No significant difference was noted in anthropometry or food consumption.

We conducted a survey of 401 Australian researchers and human research ethics committee (HREC) members to examine their experience, attitudes, and ethical concerns toward engaging participants via SM. Data revealed that researchers and HREC members share similar concerns and attitudes about using SM in general and in research. We identified a strong demand for additional support, training, and guidance on SM research ethics. This need reflects researchers' and HREC members' limited confidence and knowledge of ethical issues in this context and a lack of awareness of available SM-specific ethical guidelines.",One for two: A novel and highly sensitive virulence factor-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the simultaneous detection of Rodentibacter pneumotropicus and Rodentibacter heylii in environmental sample material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195883,Laboratory animals,2019 06 14,"Hygienic monitoring of laboratory rodents has focused more and more on the analysis of environmental sample material by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. This approach requires profound knowledge of specific genetic sequences of the agents to be monitored and the assays need to be permanently adapted to take the latest research into account. [Pasteurella] pneumotropica was recently reclassified into the new genus Rodentibacter, with Rodentibacter (R.) pneumotropicus and R. heylii as the most commonly detected species in laboratory mouse colonies. This study aimed at the development of a specific qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection of both agents. A novel primer probe set, based on detection of the specific virulence factor' 'inclusion body protein A' gene (ibpA), was confirmed by testing the assay on currently described Rodentibacter type species and other Pasteurellaceae. Furthermore, it was validated within four different barrier units and results were compared with the cultural analysis of sentinel mice. The assay was suitable to specifically detect R. pneumotropicus and R. heylii and discriminate them from other murine Rodentibacter spp. In addition, it revealed high sensitivity for the detection of both agents in environmental sampling material including exhaust air dust in individually ventilated cage systems. Altogether, higher pathogen prevalence was detected via qPCR of environmental samples compared with cultural diagnostics of sentinel mice. This study describes a qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection of R. pneumotropicus and R. heylii. This assay was demonstrated to be beneficial during routine health monitoring, especially with regard to environmental sampling strategies.",Exercising Alone or Exercising With Others and Mental Health Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Longitudinal Analysis of Cross-Lagged and Simultaneous Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195882,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 14,"Background: Although the beneficial effects of physical activity and exercise on mental health are well known, the optimal conditions for them for benefitting mental health are still unclear. Engaging in exercise with others might have more desirable effects on mental health than engaging in exercise alone. This study examined the associations between exercising alone, exercising with others, and mental health among middle-aged and older adults. Methods: Baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys were conducted with 129 individuals. Time spent exercising alone or with others was measured using a 7-day diary survey. Total physical activity was objectively measured using an accelerometer. Mental well-being was assessed using the simplified Japanese version of the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index, and mental distress was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler Distress Scale (K6). Results: Cross-lagged and simultaneous effects models revealed that exercising with others positively influenced mental well-being. Exercising alone and total physical activity did not significantly influence mental well-being. Neither total physical activity, exercising alone, nor exercising with others was significantly associated with mental distress. Conclusion: Engaging in exercise with others could be effective in improving mental well-being relative to engaging in exercise alone.",Development of Perfectionism in Junior Athletes: A Three-Sample Study of Coach and Parental Pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195881,Journal of sport & exercise psychology,2019 06 14,"Perfectionism predicts cognitions, emotions, and behaviors in sport. Nonetheless, our understanding of the factors that influence its development is limited. The authors sought to address this issue by examining the role of coach and parental pressure in the development of perfectionism in sport. Using 3 samples of junior athletes (16-19 years; cross-sectional n = 212, 3-month longitudinal n = 101, and 6-month longitudinal n = 110), the authors examined relations between coach pressure to be perfect, parental pressure to be perfect, perfectionistic strivings, and perfectionistic concerns. Mini meta-analysis of the combined cross-sectional data (N = 423) showed that both coach pressure and parental pressure were positively correlated with perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. In contrast, longitudinal analyses showed that only coach pressure predicted increased perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns over time. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence that coaches may play a more important role in the development of junior athletes' perfectionism than parents.",Prediction and prevention of hypoglycaemic events in type-1 diabetic patients using machine learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195880,Health informatics journal,2019 06 14,"Tight blood glucose control reduces the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, this is very difficult due to the large intra-individual variability and other factors that affect glycaemic control. The main limiting factor to achieve strict control of glucose levels in patients on intensive insulin therapy is the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Therefore, hypoglycaemia is the main safety problem in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, negatively affecting the quality of life of patients suffering from this disease. Decision support tools based on machine learning methods have become a viable way to enhance patient safety by anticipating adverse glycaemic events. This study proposes the application of four machine learning algorithms to tackle the problem of safety in diabetes management: (1) grammatical evolution for the mid-term continuous prediction of blood glucose levels, (2) support vector machines to predict hypoglycaemic events during postprandial periods, (3) artificial neural networks to predict hypoglycaemic episodes overnight, and (4) data mining to profile diabetes management scenarios. The proposal consists of the combination of prediction and classification capabilities of the implemented approaches. The resulting system significantly reduces the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia, improving safety and providing patients with greater confidence in decision-making.",Screening for Opioid Use Disorder in the Largest Jail in Arkansas: A Brief Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195879,Journal of correctional health care : the official journal of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,2019 06 14,"Individuals who have experienced incarceration have an increased risk of both fatal and nonfatal overdose. Given the increases in illicit opioid use in Arkansas and across the South, many individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are likely to encounter the criminal justice system, particularly county jails. However, there are currently no published data on OUD among entrants into county jails in the South. This study presents data from an OUD screening project initiated by the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility, the largest county jail in the state of Arkansas. As part of the regular intake process, a jail staff person administered the Rapid Opioid Dependence Screen. De-identified data were provided to researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The data clearly show an increased prevalence of OUD, justifying the need for evidence-based substance use programs such as MAT in jail settings in the South.",Predicting Hawaiian Youth's Physical Activity and Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Behaviors: A 10-Year Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195878,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 14,"Background: Health behaviors in childhood and adolescence are implicated in health behaviors and chronic disease risk in adulthood for the majority of the US population. However, little is known about these relationships in Hawaiian youth. This study investigated the extent to which childhood physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable consumption behaviors predicted later behaviors across a 10-year period in Hawaiian youth. Methods: Three cohorts of fourth- to sixth-grade students who participated in an elementary after-school program (Fun 5) provided baseline data (Y1-data collected between 2003 and 2007), 5-year (Y5-data collected between 2008 and 2012), and 10-year (Y10-data collected between 2013 and 2017) follow-up surveys. Demographic, PA, and fruit and vegetable consumption measures were completed at all 3 time points. Bivariate and multiple regressions were computed in 2018. Results: Y1 and Y5 behavior predicted PA in young adulthood. For fruit and vegetable consumption, Y1 behavior predicted Y5 behavior but not Y10 behavior, and Y5 behavior predicted Y10 behaviors. Conclusions: Similar to mainland US youth, it is important to address PA and nutrition early in the life span for Hawaiian youth to increase long-term preventive health behaviors and reduce long-term chronic disease risk."

As more than 90% of females abusing opioids are of child-bearing age, the failure to adequately address the opioid epidemic continues to negatively impact the next generations. Accurate and timely identification of infants at risk for withdrawal from in-utero exposure is critical to ensure high-quality perinatal and neonatal care. Beginning with an evaluation of current best practices and performing a literature review, we identify the challenges to current screening processes and how these limitations limit the ability to provide appropriate care to infants at the risk of withdrawal. We first describe the limitations of the available assays for the detection of opioid and opioid metabolites across different biological sources from both the mother and the infant. We then present a discussion surrounding factors that contribute to maternal willingness to disclose use. Particularly, in light of the limitations of biological screening, any barrier to maternal disclosure further complicates effective care delivery. Barriers to disclosure include legal ramifications and state policies, provider and societal behaviors and biases, and maternal factors. Moving forward, universal prenatal screening surveys coupled with enhanced outreach and education to providers centering on the limitations of both patient report and biological sampling, as well as comprehensive and supportive services for women of reproductive age with substance use disorders, are needed to both enhance detection for NOWS and improve long-term maternal-child health.",Factors affecting the outcome of pregnancy with rheumatic heart disease: an experience from low-middle income country.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195863,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2019 06 14,"Studies on pregnancy with rheumatic heart disease (RHD), still common in the developing world, are relatively old and small. This retrospective study was conducted to study the outcome of pregnancy in women with RHD and factors associated with poor outcome. We studied 353 pregnancies in 273 women. In 35% of the patients, the diagnosis was first made during index pregnancy. Women with severe MS had lesser gestational age at delivery and birth weight than those with mild-to-moderate MS. Women with NYHA III-IV status delivered at lesser gestational age had lesser birth weight and had higher perinatal and maternal mortality than NYHA I-II status. Pregnancy outcome was better among women who underwent Balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV) when indicated than those who did not. Cardiac complications were higher in women with severe MS and poor NYHA status. Early booking is important for the optimal outcome. BMV is safe during pregnancy and should be done when necessary. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Rheumatic heart disease continues to be the major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Most of the recent studies discuss pregnancy with heart disease as a whole with RHD being a part. What do the results of this study add? A large number of women in developing countries conceive with unknown underlying heart disease. Late access to antenatal care is associated with poor outcome. Cardiac and obstetric complications are significantly higher in women with severe mitral stenosis and poor NYHA functional status. Balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV) during pregnancy is safe and technically feasible. BMV averts major complications that may occur due to severe disease. Patients with RHD can undergo labour and vaginal delivery under vigilant monitoring. What are the implications for clinical practice? Thorough clinical examination by the clinician at initial visit is important to detect unknown heart disease. Symptoms pointing towards underlying heart disease should prompt evaluation. This study provides evidence for population-based screening for heart disease in women. Optimal management of compensated mitral stenosis requires weighing the risks and benefits of pharmacological therapy versus BMV in the context of maternal condition. BMV should be performed when necessary.",Umbilical cord bilirubin level and pre-discharge hyperbilirubinemia risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195862,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 06 14,"Objectives: To assess whether arterial umbilical cord bilirubin (aUCB) level at delivery predicts predischarge neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, facilitating a safe discharge from the hospital. Methods: Prospective analysis of hospital biochemistry records identified near term and term infants with recorded aUCB and predischarge, at 36 h of life, capillary heal bilirubin (cHB), to identify those with a cutoff of bilirubin levels >9 mg/ml, >75th percentile on the nomogram of Bhutani et al. Results: Of 616 study neonates, median (IQR) aUCB and cHB levels were 1.5 mg % (IQR 0.7-2.2) and 7.7 mg % (IQR 6.6-8.9), respectively. The values resulted statistically correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.26, p < .0001) and an increment of 1 mg/dl in aUCB was associated with an increment (Regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval) of mean cHB 0.49 (0.33-0.65, p < .0001). Among these, 143 (23.2%) neonates developed bilirubin levels >9 mg/ml at 36 h of life and multivariable analysis confirmed that cHB levels (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.82; p < .0001) and vaginal delivery (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33-4.36; p = .005) were significantly associated with bilirubin levels >9 mg/ml. Conclusions: These data suggest that aUCB should be added to the list of major risk factors for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.","Metal nanomaterials: Immune effects and implications of physicochemical properties on sensitization, elicitation, and exacerbation of allergic disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195861,Journal of immunotoxicology,2019 06 14,"The recent surge in incorporation of metallic and metal oxide nanomaterials into consumer products and their corresponding use in occupational settings have raised concerns over the potential for metals to induce size-specific adverse toxicological effects. Although nano-metals have been shown to induce greater lung injury and inflammation than their larger metal counterparts, their size-related effects on the immune system and allergic disease remain largely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly concerning since metals are historically recognized as common inducers of allergic contact dermatitis, occupational asthma, and allergic adjuvancy. The investigation into the potential for adverse immune effects following exposure to metal nanomaterials is becoming an area of scientific interest since these characteristically lightweight materials are easily aerosolized and inhaled, and their small size may allow for penetration of the skin, which may promote unique size-specific immune effects with implications for allergic disease. Additionally, alterations in physicochemical properties of metals in the nano-scale greatly influence their interactions with components of biological systems, potentially leading to implications for inducing or exacerbating allergic disease. Although some research has been directed toward addressing these concerns, many aspects of metal nanomaterial-induced immune effects remain unclear. Overall, more scientific knowledge exists in regards to the potential for metal nanomaterials to exacerbate allergic disease than to their potential to induce allergic disease. Furthermore, effects of metal nanomaterial exposure on respiratory allergy have been more thoroughly-characterized than their potential influence on dermal allergy. Current knowledge regarding metal nanomaterials and their potential to induce/exacerbate dermal and respiratory allergy are summarized in this review. In addition, an examination of several remaining knowledge gaps and considerations for future studies is provided.",Quality of life in persons with hearing loss: a study of patients referred to an audiological service.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195860,International journal of audiology,2019 06 14,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between hearing loss (HL) and general quality of life (QoL) in adults seeking hearing aids (HAs). Design: The patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire's general part and a questionnaire measuring self-assessed communication ability (Abbreviated Profile of hearing Aid Benefit-APHAB). These responses were compared with EORTC scores from a general population and patients with former head and neck cancer. Study sample: One-hundred and fifty-eight adults with HL were recruited prior to hearing aid (HA) fitting with one half seeking renewal of their HA. Results: General QoL scores among patients with HL were similar to those in the general population, but higher than in many chronic serious diseases. Patients with unilateral HL reported slightly worse social function and more fatigue than patients with bilateral HL. Self-assessed communication ability correlated with general QoL scores. Also, we found that best ear pure tone average (PTA), cognitive and physical QoL function predicted APHAB scores. Conclusion: In the investigated HL group, general QoL scores seem to be relatively close to those seen in the general population.","Evaluation of cord blood creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and s100B levels in nonreassuring foetal heart rate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195859,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 06 14,"Aim: To evaluate the possible associations between creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and s100B levels in umbilical cord blood and nonstress test results, cord-blood gas analyses and Apgar scores. Material and methods: A total of 93 caesarean section deliveries after 34 + 0/7 gestational week (GW) were evaluated. The study (n = 50) and control (n = 43) groups consisted of type III and type I nonstress test (NST) according to the 2008 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development workshop report on electronic fetal monitoring. The serum levels of ProBNP II, S100-B, CK-MB, and cTnT were measured in cord blood and were evaluated according to the NST results, cord-blood gas analyses (pH und base-excess values) and one and 5-minute Apgar scores. Exclusion criteria for both groups included congenital abnormalities, multiple pregnancy, chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and placental abruption. Results: Mean age, weight, height, gestational age, and birth weight were comparable in type I and III NST groups. 1.

Design: Prospective study comparing the performance of a single British group of children to North-American norms on the LiSN-S (North American version). Study sample: The British group was composed of 46 typically developing children, aged 6-11 years 11 months, from a mainstream primary school in London. Results: No significant difference was observed between the British's group performance and the North-American norms for Low-cue, High-cue, Spatial Advantage and Total Advantage measure. The British group presented a significantly lower performance only for Talker Advantage measure (z-score: 0.35, 95% confidence interval -0.12 to -0.59). Age was significantly correlated with all unstandardised measures. Conclusion: Our results indicate that, when assessing British children, it would be appropriate to add a corrective factor of 0.35 to the z-score value obtained for the Talker Advantage in order to compare it to the North-American norms. This strategy would enable the use of LiSN-S in the UK to assess auditory stream segregation based on spatial cues.","The efficacy and safety of BM-PHA for the correction of nasolabial folds: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, split-face clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195857,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 06 14,"Background: Multiple types of fillers have been developed for soft tissue augmentation. Objective: We investigated the efficacy and safety of the novel filler BM-PHA. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, split-face study, 91 participants received injections of BM-PHA and Restylane Perlane (PER) into the nasolabial folds. Efficacy was determined by the improvements in the Wrinkle Severity Rating Score (WSRS) and Global Esthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and safety by adverse events, laboratory tests, and a check of vital signs. Results: WSRS scores assessed by independent evaluators at Week 24, the primary efficacy measure, showed no significant difference between the two treatments. The treatments also showed no significant differences in WSRS scores assessed by the evaluators at Week 8 and WSRS and GAIS scores assessed by the treating investigators and participants at Weeks 8 and 24. The proportion of nasolabial folds whose WSRS scores improved by at least one grade at Week 24 was similar between the treatments. Only minor local side effects were reported without sequelae. Conclusion: BM-PHA was not inferior to PER in the treatment of moderate to severe nasolabial folds and may be an appropriate alternative product for their improvement. Further studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of BM-PHA.",Is portable foetal electrocardiogram monitor feasible for foetal heart rate monitoring of small for gestational age foetuses in the home environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195856,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2019 06 14,"Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) foetuses are at greater risk of complications than normal foetuses. Studies have demonstrated that foetal electrocardiogram (ECG) device (Monica-AN24) can be employed for monitoring foetal heart rate (FHR). However, its reliability and acceptability has not been assessed in SGA foetuses. This study was aimed at: (a) determining the acceptability of wearing the device more than once, (b) investigating the reliability of acquiring successful FHR data at different gestation. Patients with singleton non-anomalous foetus >24 weeks gestation and an estimated foetal weight below tenth percentile were recruited. Thirty-five women wore the device once. Twenty-four of these wore second time (68.6%). Overall, success-rate of FHR signals was 48.6% and increased to 68.8% beyond 34 weeks gestation. Foetal ECG is a promising method for monitoring SGA foetus >34 weeks gestation. Compared to day recordings, foetal signals were more reliable at night. Further studies are required before its clinical utility can be ascertained. IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Pregnancies that are affected by small-for-gestational-age (SGA) foetus pose a major public health problem and are associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is no consensus on the optimal timing of delivery. Current methods employed for monitoring SGA foetuses include ultrasound scans for foetal-biometry and Doppler assessments. However, they provide a snapshot of information on foetal well-being, restrict patient mobility and cannot be employed over long-time periods. It is plausible that ambulatory foetal-ECG device that enable monitoring over a longer time period may better inform decisions about the timing of delivery. What do the results of this study add? Trans-abdominal foetal-ECG is a promising method of monitoring SGA foetus in the home setting with a success rate of acquiring reliable foetal heart rate (FHR) data over 90% at night time. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Overall, the study approved the concept of long-term home monitoring and has highlighted the facilitators and barriers to wearing the monitor in clinical care. These observations can be used to undertake robust research to assess the use of foetal-ECG monitor singly or in conjunction with current monitoring techniques for optimal foetal surveillance.",Histopathological and Clinical Differences Between Primary Breast Carcinomas With Neuroendocrine Features and Primary Breast Carcinomas Mimicking Neuroendocrine Features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195855,International journal of surgical pathology,2019 06 14,"We aimed to determine the histopathological differences between primary breast carcinomas with neuroendocrine features (NEBC) and carcinomas mimicking neuroendocrine features (NEBC-like). Twenty-three cases with NEBC, all showing positive staining for synaptophysin and/or chromogranin-A in ≥50% of tumor cells and 36 cases with NEBC-like (no staining for neuroendocrine [NE] markers but suspicious for NE morphology in terms of solid/trabecular growth patterns) were included in the study. Significant differences were found between the groups in terms of the patients' ages, histologic/nuclear grade of tumor, lymphovascular invasion, comedo-type ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), microcalcification, Ki-67 proliferation index, nuclear shape, and level of peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration. The presence of large-size solid cohesive groups of tumor cells; plasmocytoid, spindle, and/or columnar shapes of tumor cells; and eosinophilic-granular appearance of cytoplasm were mostly noted in the NEBC group. The presence of small- to medium-sized solid cohesive groups of tumor cells; high-grade histologic and nuclear features; clear cytoplasm; and round to ovoid nucleus were mostly noted in the NEBC-like group. No significant differences were found in terms of tumor size, ER/PR/HER2 status, as well as the presence of DCIS, elastosis, extracellular/intracellular mucin, signet ring cells, apocrine features, and accompanying papilloma or ductal ectasia. In conclusion, small- to medium-sized solid cohesive groups of tumor cells, high-grade features, clear cytoplasm, round to ovoid shape of nucleus, lymphovascular invasion, comedo-type DCIS, microcalcification, high level of Ki-67 proliferation index (≥20%), and moderate/strong level of peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration might support non-NE features in breast carcinomas."

It is likely to affect the metabolism of CYP2E1 substrates such as acetaminophen which is a common household pain relief medicine. This study investigated the possible pharmacokinetic interaction between K. parviflora and acetaminophen in rats. Acetaminophen (100 mg/kg, p.o) was administered to rats for nine consecutive days. On days 4-9, K. parviflora extract (250 mg/kg, p.o) was given to the acetaminophen-treated rats. After co-administration with K. parviflora, the concentrations of acetaminophen during day 5-8 markedly decreased compared with acetaminophen-only group. At day 9, the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen in the presence of K. parviflora extract also decreased, including area under the concentration-time curve (from 1.68 ± 0.16 to 0.34 ± 0.04 mg.min/mL), the maximum concentration (from 19.10 ± 1.90 to 4.48 ± 0.56 µg/mL), and half-life (from 21.29 ± 1.36 to 10.81 ± 1.24 min).

Depending on disease activity, neurologists can now propose treatments with different levels of efficacy, from injectable and oral treatments with modest efficacy, to highly active immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies which can be used as induction therapies. Nevertheless, this gain in efficacy has come with an increase in the global burden of treatment-related adverse events, including notably opportunistic infections and autoimmune diseases. Areas covered: The authors have reviewed extensively the existing literature to gain insight into the adverse events associated with each of the disease modifying therapies, so as to help neurologists choose the right treatment for their patients. The authors have reviewed data from phase 3 randomized controlled trials as well as post-marketing surveillance data. The authors classified and summarized the adverse events based on frequency, severity and clinical relevance. Expert opinion: As the number and diversity of these adverse events is expected to increase, careful surveillance of patients under treatment will be even more important. The characteristics of the MS population, i.e. mainly young adults, of whom women of childbearing age, who will remain treated for decades, and the need for serial administration of distinct treatments with different mechanisms of action highlights the importance of a comprehensive risk-benefit assessment.",Proteomic investigations into hypertension: what's new and how might it affect clinical practice?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195841,Expert review of proteomics,2019 06 14,"Introduction: Hypertension is a multifactorial disease that has, thus far, proven to be a difficult target for pharmacological intervention. The application of proteomic strategies may help to identify new biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prompt treatment of hypertension, in order to control blood pressure and prevent organ damage. Areas covered: Advances in proteomics have led to the discovery of new biomarkers to help track the pathophysiological processes implicated in hypertension. These findings not only help to better understand the nature of the disease, but will also contribute to the clinical needs for a timely diagnosis and more precise treatment. In this review, we provide an overview of new biomarkers identified in hypertension through the application of proteomic techniques, and we also discuss the difficulties and challenges in identifying biomarkers in this clinical setting. We performed a literature search in PubMed with the key words ""hypertension"" and ""proteomics"", and focused specifically on the most recent literature on the utility of proteomics in hypertension research. Expert Opinion: There have been several promising biomarkers of hypertension identified by proteomics, but too few have been introduced to the clinic. Thus, further investigations in larger cohorts are necessary to test the feasibility of this strategy for patients. Also, this emerging field would profit from more collaboration between clinicians and researchers.",Lipotoxicity-associated inflammation is prevented by guarana (Paullinia cupana) in a model of hyperlipidemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195840,Drug and chemical toxicology,2019 06 14,"Hyperlipidemia causes lipotoxicity which prompts an inflammatory response linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Natural compounds have been receiving special attention for its potential to treat diseases, inexpensiveness, and safety. Guarana (Paullinia cupana) has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may prevent chronic diseases caused by changes in lipid profile. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of guarana powder (Paullinia cupana) in the purine metabolism and inflammatory profile in lymphocytes and serum of rats with Poloxamer-407-induced hyperlipidemia. Pretreatment with guarana 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day or caffeine (0.2 mg/kg/day) by gavage was applied to adult male Wistar rats for a period of 30 days. As a comparative standard, we used simvastatin (0.04 mg/kg) post-induction. Hyperlipidemia was acutely induced with intraperitoneally injection of Poloxamer-407 (500 mg/kg). Guarana powder and caffeine increased the activity of the E-NTPDase (ecto-apyrase), and all pretreatments decreased the E-ADA (ecto-adenosine deaminase) activity, reducing the inflammatory process caused by lipotoxicity. In hyperlipidemic rats, ATP levels were increased while adenosine levels were decreased, guarana and caffeine reverted these changes. Guarana powder, caffeine, and simvastatin also prevented the increase in INF-γ and potentiated the increase in IL-4 levels, promoting an anti-inflammatory profile. Guarana promoted a more robust effect than caffeine. Our results show that guarana powder and caffeine have an anti-inflammatory as seen by the shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory profile. The effects of guarana were more pronounced, suggesting that guarana powder may be used as a complementary therapy to improve the lipotoxicity-associated inflammation.",Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava: Implications of Surgical Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195839,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,2019 06 14,"Persistent left superior vena cava is the most common congenital anomaly of thoracic venous return, which results when the left anterior cardinal vein fails to regress.

All the results indicated the 5 F-loaded CA-PLGA-PEG-LA NPs can be employed as a novel potentially targeting drug delivery system for liver cancer therapy.",Dissociation between speech modalities in a case of altered accent with unknown origin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195836,Clinical linguistics & phonetics,2019 06 14,"We present a case of sudden onset, acquired altered accent in the speech of NL, a 48-year-old, left-handed female. NL's typical Standard Southern British English accent was preserved in singing and reading, but altered in recitation, repetition and spontaneous speech. Neuropsychological investigation, impressionistic and acoustic analysis of accented and unaccented speech are documented. The altered accent displays a slower speech rate and longer duration of consonants and vowels. There is evidence for a shift towards syllable-timed rhythm. NL's altered accent displays atypical coordination between voicing and supra-laryngeal articulation, reduced mean and range of F0, and minor differences in vowel space. These features are broadly consistent with other documented cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome, regardless of aetiology. However, NL's profile of preserved and impaired speech does not fit any pattern typically associated with organic neurological disorder. Moreover, left-handed preference may contribute to differences between singing and reading, versus recitation, repetition and spontaneous speech.","Developing Evidence-Based Design Guidelines for Medical/Surgical Hospital Patient Rooms That Meet the Needs of Staff, Patients, and Visitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195834,HERD,2019 06 14,"This research investigated medical/surgical (Med/Surg) patient room design to accommodate the needs of hospital staff, while at the same time accommodating the needs of patients and their visitors.","Body Mass Index in Mother and Child Dyads and its Association With Household Size and Parents' Education in 2 Urban Settings of Yucatan, Mexico.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195833,Food and nutrition bulletin,2019 06 14,"Overweight/obesity (OW/OB) coexists in mother-child dyads.

Cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 14,"Background The relationship of coronary artery calcium (CAC) with adverse cardiac remodeling is not well established. We aimed to study the association of CAC in middle age and change in CAC from early adulthood to middle age with left ventricular (LV) function. Methods CAC score was measured by computed tomography at CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) year-15 examination and at year-25 examination (Y25) in 3043 and 3189 participants, respectively. CAC score was assessed as a continuous variable and log-transformed to account for nonlinearity. Change in CAC from year-15 examination to Y25 was evaluated as the absolute difference of log-transformed CAC from year-15 examination to Y25. LV structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography at Y25. Results At Y25, mean age was 50.1±3.6 years, 56.6% women, 52.4% black. In the multivariable analysis at Y25, higher CAC was related to higher LV mass (β=1.218; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-diastolic volume (β=0.811; adjusted P=0.007), higher LV end-systolic volume (β=0.350; adjusted P=0.048), higher left atrial volume (β=0.214; adjusted P=0.009), and higher E/e' ratio (β=0.059; adjusted P=0.014). CAC was measured at both year-15 examination and Y25 in 2449 individuals. Higher change in CAC score during follow-up was independently related to higher LV mass index in blacks (β=4.789; adjusted P<0.001), but not in whites (β=1.051; adjusted P=0.283). Conclusions Higher CAC in middle age is associated with higher LV mass and volumes and worse LV diastolic function. Being free of CAC from young adulthood to middle age correlates to better LV function at middle age. Higher change in CAC score during follow-up is independently related to higher LV mass index in blacks.",Accuracy of Myocardial Blood Flow Estimation From Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Cardiac CT Compared With PET.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195817,Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 14,"Background The accuracy of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) from dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomography acquisitions has not been fully characterized. We evaluate computed tomography (CT) compared with rubidium-82 positron emission tomography (PET) MBF estimates in a high-risk population. Methods In a prospective trial, patients receiving clinically indicated rubidium-82 PET exams were recruited to receive a dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomography exam. The CT protocol included a rest and stress dynamic portion each acquiring 12 to 18 cardiac-gated frames. The global MBF was estimated from the PET and CT exam. Results Thirty-four patients referred for cardiac rest-stress PET were recruited. Of the 68 dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomography scans, 5 were excluded because of injection errors or mismatched hemodynamics. The CT-derived global MBF was highly correlated with the PET MBF (r=0.92; P<0.001) with a mean difference of 0.7±26.4%. The CT MBF estimates were within 20% of PET estimates ( P<0.02) with a mean of (1) MBF for resting flow of PET versus CT of 0.9±0.3 versus 1.0±0.2 mL/min per gram and (2) MBF for stress flow of 2.1±0.7 versus 2.0±0.8 mL/min per gram. Myocardial flow reserve was -14±28% underestimated with CT (PET versus CT myocardial flow reserve, 2.5±0.6 versus 2.2±0.6). The proposed rest+stress+computed tomography angiography protocol had a dose length product of 598±76 mGy×cm resulting in an approximate effective dose of 8.4±1.1 mSv. Conclusions In a high-risk clinical population, a clinically practical dynamic contrast-enhanced cardiac computed tomography provided unbiased MBF estimates within 20% of rubidium-82 PET. Although unbiased, the CT estimates contain substantial variance with an standard error of the estimate of 0.44 mL/min per gram. Myocardial flow reserve estimation was not as accurate as individual MBF estimates.",Quantitative Studies of Diabetic Foot Ulcer Evolution Under Treatment by Digital Stereotactic Photography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195816,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2019 06 14,"Imaging the lower extremity reproducibly and accurately remains an elusive goal.

Shifting the CGM signal by 9 min backward in time versus PG and SMBG data improved the analytical accuracy of the DG4P sensor and the reliability of clinical research endpoint (hypoglycemia, postprandial glucose increments) detection. Since this method takes advantage of post-processing of CGM data, it is particularly suited for the optimization of data processing in clinical studies.

ICS are frequently also prescribed to COPD patients with mild or moderate airflow limitation, outside guidelines, with the risk of unwanted effects. No investigation to date has addressed the views of these milder COPD patients on ICS withdrawal. The objective is to assess the views of COPD patients with mild or moderate airflow limitation on the staged withdrawal of ICS prescribed outside guidelines. One-to-one semi-structured qualitative interviews exploring COPD patients' views about ICS use and their attitudes to proposed de-prescription were conducted. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was completed. Seventeen eligible COPD patients were interviewed. Many participants were not aware they were using an ICS. None was aware that prevention of exacerbations was the indication for ICS therapy or the risk of associated side effects. Some were unconcerned by what they perceived as low individual risk. Others expressed fears of worsening symptoms on withdrawal. Most with mild or moderate airflow limitation would have been willing to attempt withdrawal or titration to a lower dosage of ICS if advised by their clinician, particularly if a reasoned explanation were offered. Attitudes in this study to discontinuing ICS use varied. Knowledge of the drug itself, the indications for its prescription in COPD and potential for side effects, was scant. The proposed withdrawal of ICS is likely to be challenging and requires detailed conversations between patients and respiratory healthcare professionals.",O-GlcNAcylation of Histone Deacetylase 4 Protects the Diabetic Heart from Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195810,Circulation,2019 06 14,"World-wide, diabetes and heart failure represent frequent comorbidities with high socioeconomic impact and steadily growing incidence, calling for a better understanding of how diabetic metabolism promotes cardiac dysfunction.

The purpose of this study was to examine if the concentration of thymol as the main compound of Thymus vulgaris essential oil (TEO) influenced the antioxidant defence system in broilers. 2. Twenty-four broiler chickens were randomly divided at the day of hatching into three dietary treatment groups (0, 0.05 and 0.1%, w/w TEO) with eight birds in each and were fed until four weeks of age. 3. Thymol content in plasma, duodenal wall and breast muscle significantly increased when 0.1% thyme oil was added to the diet (P<0.05). Thymol concentration in plasma significantly correlated with levels measured in the duodenal wall and feed (rs=0.7857, P<0.05; rs=0.7647, P<0.05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration decreased significantly (P<0.05) in blood from chickens fed 0.1% TEO supplementation. Although the thymol concentration did not significantly decrease MDA amounts in breast muscle, a declining trend was observed. 4.

Crude SPs together with V45 and (F1-F8) were examined for their carbohydrate, protein, and sulfate contents. In addition, their degree of polymerization (DP) was estimated and they were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Fractions S1, F4, F5, and F8 showed promising antioxidant and antitumor activities in vitro. In particular, the remarkable antitumor activity of F5 on three types of cancer cell lines could be attributed to its comparable contents of protein, carbohydrate, and sulfate, in addition to its comparable contents of rhamnose and glucuronic acid, and the same for glucose and arabinose. F5 also possessed the highest Hill coefficient among the four promising fractions indicating a higher degree of cooperativity in ligand binding.

Here, we investigated the effect of hispidulin on the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic responses in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells. When RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) IgE and subsequently stimulated with DNP-human serum albumin (HSA), histamine and β-hexosaminidase were released from the cells by degranulation of activated mast cells. However, pretreatment with hispidulin before the stimulation of DNP-HSA markedly attenuated release of both in anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether hispidulin inhibits anti-DNP IgE and DNP-HSA-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), as an animal model for Type I allergies. Hispidulin markedly decreased the PCA reaction and allergic edema of ears in mice. In addition, activated RBL-2H3 cells induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-4), which are critical for the pathogenesis of allergic disease, through the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of JNK activation by hispidulin treatment reduced the induction of cytokine expression in the activated mast cells. Our results indicate that hispidulin might be a possible therapeutic candidate for allergic inflammatory diseases through the suppression of degranulation and inflammatory cytokines expression.",Motivational Climate and Physical Activity: A Multigroup Analysis in Romanian and Spanish University Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195759,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Motivational climate in sport is a psychosocial construct which is related with several factors, such as healthy habits and well-being, and is influenced by teachers, trainers, and parents.

Glucose oxidase (GOx) was used as an alternative to horseradish peroxidase as the carrier of the competing antigen. GOx catalyzed the oxidation of glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide, which acted as a reducing agent to reduce Au3+ to Au on the surface of gold seeds (5 nm), This reaction led to a color change in the solution from colorless to purple, which was observable to the naked eye. Various parameters that could influence the detection performance of pELISA were investigated. The developed method exhibited a considerably high sensitivity for FB1 qualitative naked-eye detection, with a visible cut-off limit of 1.25 ng/mL. Moreover, the proposed pELISA showed a good linear range of 0.31-10 ng/mL with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.86 ng/mL, which was approximately 13-fold lower than that of a horseradish peroxidase- (HRP)-based conventional ELISA. Meanwhile, the proposed method was highly specific and accurate. In summary, the new pELISA exhibited acceptable accuracy and precision for sensitive naked-eye detection of FB1 in maize samples and can be applied for the detection of other chemical contaminants.",Human Milk Oligosaccharides in the Milk of Mothers Delivering Term versus Preterm Infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195757,Nutrients,2019 06 14,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a major component of human milk, and play an important role in protecting the infant from infections.

In all, 22 HMOs were analyzed in 500 samples of milk from 25 mothers breastfeeding very preterm infants (< 32 weeks of gestational age, < 1500g of birthweight) and 28 mothers breastfeeding term infants. The concentrations of most HMOs were comparable at equivalent postpartum age. However, HMOs containing α-1,2-linked fucose were reduced in concentration in preterm milk during the first month of lactation. The concentrations of a number of sialylated oligosaccharides were also different in preterm milk, in particular 3'-sialyllactose concentrations were elevated. At equivalent postmenstrual age, the concentrations of a number of HMOs were significantly different in preterm compared to term milk. The largest differences manifest around 40 weeks of postmenstrual age, when the milk of term infants contains the highest concentrations of HMOs. The observed differences warrant further investigation in view of their potential clinical impact.",A Predictive Model Assessing Genetic Susceptibility Risk at Workplace.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195756,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"(1) Background: The study of susceptibility biomarkers in the immigrant workforce integrated into the social tissue of European host countries is always a challenge, due to high individual heterogeneity and the admixing of different ethnicities in the same workplace. These workers having distinct cultural backgrounds, beliefs, diets, and habits, as well as a poor knowledge of the foreign language, may feel reluctant to donate their biological specimens for the biomonitoring research studies. (2) Methods: A model predicting ethnicity-specific susceptibility based on principal component analysis has been conceived, using the genotype frequency of the investigated populations available in publicly accessible databases. (3) Results: Correlations among ethnicities and between ethnic and polymorphic genes have been found, and low/high-risk profiles have been identified as valuable susceptibility biomarkers. (4) Conclusions: In the absence of workers' consent or access to blood genotyping, ethnicity represents a good indicator of the subject's genotype. This model, associating ethnicity-specific genotype frequency with the susceptibility biomarkers involved in the metabolism of toxicants, may replace genotyping, ensuring the necessary safety and health conditions of workers assigned to hazardous jobs."

This study aimed to estimate the diagnosed proportion of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) among foreign residents in Japan, covering 1990-2017 and stratifying by geographic region of the country of origin. A balance equation model was employed to statistically estimate the diagnosed proportion as a single parameter. This used published estimates of HIV incidence and prevalence, population size, visit duration, travel volume, as well as surveillance data on HIV/AIDS in Japan. The proportion varied widely by region: People from Western Europe, East Asia and the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and North America were underdiagnosed, while those from sub-Saharan Africa, South and South-East Asia, and Latin America were more frequently diagnosed. Overall, the diagnosed proportion of PLWHA among foreign residents in Japan has increased, but the latest estimate in 2017 was as low as 55.3%; lower than the estimate among Japanese on the order of 80% and far below the quoted goal of 90%. This finding indicates a critical need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, including disparate access to HIV testing.",Impact of Rhinovirus Infections in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195744,Viruses,2019 06 14,"Rhinovirus (RV) is an RNA virus that causes more than 50% of upper respiratory tract infections in humans worldwide. Together with Respiratory Syncytial Virus, RV is one of the leading causes of viral bronchiolitis in infants and the most common virus associated with wheezing in children aged between one and two years. Because of its tremendous genetic diversity (>150 serotypes), the recurrence of RV infections each year is quite typical. Furthermore, because of its broad clinical spectrum, the clinical variability as well as the pathogenesis of RV infection are nowadays the subjects of an in-depth examination and have been the subject of several studies in the literature. In fact, the virus is responsible for direct cell cytotoxicity in only a small way, and it is now clearer than ever that it may act indirectly by triggering the release of active mediators by structural and inflammatory airway cells, causing the onset and/or the acute exacerbation of asthmatic events in predisposed children. In the present review, we aim to summarize the RV infection's epidemiology, pathogenetic hypotheses, and available treatment options as well as its correlation with respiratory morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population.",Evaluation of Permeate Quality in Pilot Scale Membrane Distillation Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195743,Membranes,2019 06 14,"In this work, the salinity of permeate obtained with membrane distillation (MD) in pilot scale systems was analyzed. Experiments were performed with three different spiral-wound commercial modules, one from Solar Spring with 10 m2 surface membrane area and two from Aquastill with 7.2 and 24 m2. Intermittent operation meant that high permeate conductivity was measured in the beginning of each experiment, which was gradually decreasing until reaching a constant value (3-143 µS·cm-1 for seawater feed). The final quality reached did not depend on operating conditions, only the time it took to reach it. This can be because the permeate flux dilutes the minimal feed leak taking place through pinholes in the membranes. Larger feed leak through the membrane was observed when operating in vacuum-enhanced air-gap MD configuration (V-AGMD), which is compatible with this explanation. However, for the increase of feed leak with salinity (up to 1.8 M), a conclusive explanation cannot be given. Pore wetting due to crystallization is discarded because the high permeate quality was recovered after washing with distilled water. More studies at higher salinities and also at membrane level are required to investigate this.",Non-Pungent n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA)-Derived Capsaicin Analogues as Potential Functional Ingredients with Antioxidant and Carbohydrate-Hydrolysing Enzyme Inhibitory Activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195742,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"N-Eicosapentaenoyl vanillylamine (EPVA) and N-docosahexaenoyl vanillylamine (DHVA), derived from n-3 polyunsaturated eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, were studied for their potential antioxidant and carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzyme inhibitory activities together with capsaicin and the corresponding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The antioxidant potential was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay, β-carotene bleaching test, and ferric reducing ability power (FRAP). In the ABTS assay the following trend of potency could be observed EPVA > DHVA ≥ capsaicin. In addition, except for the FRAP test, all samples showed a greater activity than the positive controls used as reference compounds in the antioxidant assays. Both EPVA and DHVA showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values much lower than acarbose, which was used as the reference drug in the carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzyme inhibitory activity assays. It is interesting to note that structural changes in capsaicin derivatives had higher impacts on α-glucosidase than on α-amylase inhibition. Taken together, our data suggest that both EPVA and DHVA, which are not limited in compliance-related considerations with respect to capsaicin, due to absence of pungency, could be proposed as functional ingredients for the development of products for the management of type II diabetes and border-line hyperglycaemic patients.","Transcriptome Profile Analysis of Winter Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in Response to Freezing Stress, Reveal Potentially Connected Events to Freezing Stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195741,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"Winter rapeseed is not only an important oilseed crop, but also a winter cover crop in Northern China, where its production was severely limited by freezing stress. As an overwinter crop, the production is severely limited by freezing stress. Therefore, understanding the physiological and molecular mechanism of winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in freezing stress responses becomes essential for the improvement and development of freezing-tolerant varieties of Brassica napus. In this study, morphological, physiological, ultrastructure and transcriptome changes in the Brassica napus line ""2016TS(G)10"" (freezing-tolerance line) that was exposed to -2 °C for 0 h, 1 h, 3 h and 24 h were characterized. The results showed that freezing stress caused seedling dehydration, and chloroplast dilation and degradation. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, soluble protein and soluble sugars were increased, as well as the relative electrolyte leakage (REL) which was significantly increased at frozen 24 h. Subsequently, RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 98,672 UniGenes that were annotated in Brassica napus and 3905 UniGenes were identified as differentially expressed genes after being exposed to freezing stress. Among these genes, 2312 (59.21%) were up-regulated and 1593 (40.79%) were down-regulated. Most of these DEGs were significantly annotated in the carbohydrates and energy metabolism, signal transduction, amino acid metabolism and translation. Most of the up-regulated DEGs were especially enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. Transcription factor enrichment analysis showed that the AP2/ERF, WRKY and MYB families were also significantly changed. Furthermore, 20 DEGs were selected to validate the transcriptome profiles via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In conclusion, the results provide an overall view of the dynamic changes in physiology and insights into the molecular regulation mechanisms of winter Brassica napus in response to freezing treatment, expanding our understanding on the complex molecular mechanism in plant response to freezing stress.",The Mechanical Properties of Reinforced Concrete Plate-Girders when Placed Under Repeated Simulated Vehicle Loads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195740,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"The effect of vehicle loads on reinforced concrete plate-girders was evaluated using the current Chinese specifications. Repeated loading performance tests with loading amplitudes of 77 kN, 97 kN, and 121 kN, which correspond to the standard vehicle load, 1.25 times overload, and 1.6 times overload proportions effect were carried out on three full-scale simply-supported reinforced concrete plate-girders. Our research results indicate that the development of cracks in reinforced concrete beams can be divided into three stages: rapid development, stability, and failure. During the entire process, the strain of steel and concrete did not reach their yield strain. The most severe damage done to the concrete beams was the brittle fractures caused by the fatigue fracturing of the rebar. When in a stable condition, the extent to which the vehicle was overloaded had a significant effect on the fatigue performance of the beam, and the corresponding residual deflection and residual strain increased with the rise in the overload proportion. In addition, as the overload proportion increased, the stiffness degradation and the cumulative damage that occurred under the same loading cycle was more significant. The test beam reached failure after being subjected to 350,000 and 670,000 repeated loading cycles, when the load was 1.6 times and 1.25 times of the standard load effect. With a standard vehicle load effect, the test beam was able to endure 2,000,000 repeated load cycles with no significant degradation in stiffness and bearing capacity.",Marine Carotenoid Fucoxanthin Possesses Anti-Metastasis Activity: Molecular Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195739,Marine drugs,2019 06 14,"Fucoxanthin is commonly found in marine organisms; however, to date, it has been one of the scarcely explored natural compounds. We investigated its activities in human cancer cell culture-based viability, migration, and molecular assays, and found that it possesses strong anticancer and anti-metastatic activities that work irrespective of the p53 status of cancer cells. In our experiments, fucoxanthin caused the transcriptional suppression of mortalin. Cell phenotype-driven molecular analyses on control and treated cells demonstrated that fucoxanthin caused a decrease in hallmark proteins associated with cell proliferation, survival, and the metastatic spread of cancer cells at doses that were relatively safe to the normal cells. The data suggested that the cancer therapy regimen may benefit from the recruitment of fucoxanthin; hence, it warrants further attention for basic mechanistic studies as well as drug development.",Faster Release of Lumen-Loaded Drugs than Matrix-Loaded Equivalent in Polylactic Acid/Halloysite Nanotubes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195738,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Nanocomposite-based drug delivery systems with intrinsic controlled release properties are of great interest in biomedical applications. We report a novel polylactic acid (PLA)/halloysite nanotube (HNT) nanocomposite-based drug delivery system. PLA/HNT nanocomposites have shown immense potential for use in biomedical applications due to their favorable cyto- and hemo-compatibility. The objective of this study was to evaluate the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from PLA/HNT composites matrix and the effect of preloading the API into the lumen of the HNT on its release profile. Aspirin was used in this study as a model drug as it is a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet agent widely used for various medical conditions. These two types of drug-loaded PLA/HNT nanocomposites were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), surface wettability and mechanical testing. Statistical analysis was conducted on numerical data. Drug entrapment and in vitro drug release studies were conducted using UV spectrophotometry. Results indicate that aspirin was successfully loaded into the lumen of HNT, which resulted in the sustained release of aspirin from the nanocomposites. Furthermore, the addition of HNT into the polymer matrix increased the mechanical properties, indicating its suitability as a drug-eluting reinforcing agent.",Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous-Derived Astaxanthin Regulates Lipid Metabolism and Gut Microbiota in Obese Mice Induced by A High-Fat Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195737,Marine drugs,2019 06 14,"Astaxanthin is an important antioxidant with many biological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, and immuno-modulatory activities. Most of these biological activities are derived from (3S,3'S)-astaxanthin, while the activities of (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin are rarely reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet. In this work, 40 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 8 groups fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin or Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous for 8 weeks. The weight gain, energy intake, fat index, plasma triacylglycerol and cholesterol, liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol, and gut microbiota were determined. The results showed that the addition of (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous to the high-fat diet as a supplement prevented weight gain, reduced plasma and liver triacylglycerol, and decreased plasma and liver total cholesterol. The addition of (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous also regulated the gut microbiota of the mice, which optimized the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes and increased the content of Verrucomicrobia, especially Akkermansia. The changes in the gut microflora achieved a healthier structure, thus reducing the incidence of obesity. Thus (3R,3'R)-Astaxanthin has the function of regulating lipid metabolism and gut microbiota to prevent obesity caused by a high-fat diet. The production strain of (3R,3'R)-astaxanthin, X. dendrorhous, has the same function as astaxanthin in preventing obesity caused by a high-fat diet, which reflects its potential ability as a probiotic drug.","Unique Mutational Spectrum of the GJB2 Gene and its Pathogenic Contribution to Deafness in Tuvinians (Southern Siberia, Russia): A High Prevalence of Rare Variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195736,Genes,2019 06 14,"Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the main cause for nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness 1A (DFNB1A) in many populations. GJB2 mutational spectrum and pathogenic contribution are widely varying in different populations. Significant efforts have been made worldwide to define DFNB1A molecular epidemiology, but this issue still remains open for some populations. The main aim of study is to estimate the DFNB1A prevalence and GJB2 mutational spectrum in Tuvinians-an indigenous population of the Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). Sanger sequencing was applied to analysis of coding (exon 2) and non-coding regions of GJB2 in a cohort of Tuvinian patients with hearing impairments (n = 220) and ethnically matched controls (n = 157). Diagnosis of DFNB1A was established for 22.3% patients (28.8% of familial vs 18.6% of sporadic cases). Our results support that patients with monoallelic GJB2 mutations (8.2%) are coincidental carriers. Recessive mutations p.Trp172Cys, c.-23+1G>A, c.235delC, c.299_300delAT, p.Val37Ile and several benign variants were found in examined patients. A striking finding was a high prevalence of rare variant p.Trp172Cys (c.516G>C) in Tuvinians accounting for 62.9% of all mutant GJB2 alleles and a carrier frequency of 3.8% in controls. All obtained data provide important targeted information for genetic counseling of affected Tuvinian families and enrich current information on variability of GJB2 worldwide."

This technique exhibits prominent relevance in a wide range of medical applications wherein the miniaturized platform for manipulation (immobilization, separation or rotation), and detection of biological particles (cells or molecules) can be conducted. DEP can be performed using advanced planar technologies, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) through interdigitated capacitive biosensors. The dielectrophoretically immobilization of micron and submicron size particles using interdigitated electrode (IDE) arrays is studied by finite element simulations. The CMOS compatible IDEs have been placed into the silicon microfluidic channel. A rigorous study of the DEP force actuation, the IDE's geometrical structure, and the fluid dynamics are crucial for enabling the complete platform for CMOS integrated microfluidics and detection of micron and submicron-sized particle ranges. The design of the IDEs is performed by robust finite element analyses to avoid time-consuming and costly fabrication processes. To analyze the preliminary microfluidic test vehicle, simulations were first performed with non-biological particles. To produce DEP force, an AC field in the range of 1 to 5 V (peak-to-peak) is applied to the IDE. The impact of the effective external and internal properties, such as actuating DEP frequency and voltage, fluid flow velocity, and IDE's geometrical parameters are investigated. The IDE based system will be used to immobilize and sense particles simultaneously while flowing through the microfluidic channel. The sensed particles will be detected using the capacitive sensing feature of the biosensor. The sensing and detecting of the particles are not in the scope of this paper and will be described in details elsewhere. However, to provide a complete overview of this system, the working principles of the sensor, the readout detection circuit, and the integration process of the silicon microfluidic channel are briefly discussed.",Dietary Glycemic Index and Load and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Updated Meta-Analyses of Prospective Cohort Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195724,Nutrients,2019 06 14,"Published meta-analyses indicate significant but inconsistent incident type-2 diabetes(T2D)-dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) risk ratios or risk relations (RR). It is nowover a decade ago that a published meta-analysis used a predefined standard to identify validstudies. Considering valid studies only, and using random effects dose-response meta-analysis(DRM) while withdrawing spurious results (p < 0.05), we ascertained whether these relationswould support nutrition guidance, specifically for an RR > 1.20 with a lower 95% confidence limit>1.10 across typical intakes (approximately 10th to 90th percentiles of population intakes). Thecombined T2D-GI RR was 1.27 (1.15-1.40) (p < 0.001, n = 10 studies) per 10 units GI, while that forthe T2D-GL RR was 1.26 (1.15-1.37) (p < 0.001, n = 15) per 80 g/d GL in a 2000 kcal (8400 kJ) diet.The corresponding global DRM using restricted cubic splines were 1.87 (1.56-2.25) (p < 0.001, n =10) and 1.89 (1.66-2.16) (p < 0.001, n = 15) from 47.6 to 76.1 units GI and 73 to 257 g/d GL in a 2000kcal diet, respectively. In conclusion, among adults initially in good health, diets higher in GI or GLwere robustly associated with incident T2D. Together with mechanistic and other data, thissupports that consideration should be given to these dietary risk factors in nutrition advice.Concerning the public health relevance at the global level, our evidence indicates that GI and GLare substantial food markers predicting the development of T2D worldwide, for persons ofEuropean ancestry and of East Asian ancestry.",Organization of DNA in Mammalian Mitochondria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195723,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"As with all organisms that must organize and condense their DNA to fit within the limited volume of a cell or a nucleus, mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is packaged into nucleoprotein structures called nucleoids. In this study, we first introduce the general modes of DNA compaction, especially the role of the nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that structure the bacterial chromosome. We then present the mitochondrial nucleoid and the main factors responsible for packaging of mtDNA: ARS- (autonomously replicating sequence-) binding factor 2 protein (Abf2p) in yeast and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) in mammals. We summarize the single-molecule manipulation experiments on mtDNA compaction and visualization of mitochondrial nucleoids that have led to our current knowledge on mtDNA compaction.

The main biochemical function of the CSN is the control of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-system through regulation of cullin-RING E3-ligase (CRL) activity by deNEDDylation of cullins, but the CSN also serves as a docking platform for signaling proteins. The catalytic deNEDDylase (isopeptidase) activity of the complex is executed by CSN5, but only efficiently occurs in the three-dimensional architectural context of the complex. Due to its positioning in a central cellular pathway connected to cell responses such as cell-cycle, proliferation, and signaling, the CSN has been implicated in several human diseases, with most evidence available for a role in cancer. However, emerging evidence also suggests that the CSN is involved in inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. This is both due to its role in controlling CRLs, regulating components of key inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and complex-independent interactions of subunits such as CSN5 with inflammatory proteins. In this case, we summarize and discuss studies suggesting that the CSN may have a key role in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and heart failure. We discuss the implicated molecular mechanisms ranging from inflammatory NF-κB signaling to proteotoxicity and necrosis, covering disease-relevant cell types such as myeloid and endothelial cells or cardiomyocytes. While the CSN is considered to be disease-exacerbating in most cancer entities, the cardiovascular studies suggest potent protective activities in the vasculature and heart. The underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues will be critically discussed.",Cannabidiol Overcomes Oxaliplatin Resistance by Enhancing NOS3- and SOD2-Induced Autophagy in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195721,Cancers,2019 06 14,"Although oxaliplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, patients often develop resistance to it. Therefore, a new strategy for CRC treatment is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cannabidiol (CBD), one of the components of the cannabis plant, in overcoming oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells. We established oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines, DLD-1 R and colo205 R, in CRC DLD-1 and colo205 cells. Autophagic cell death was induced when oxaliplatin-resistant cells were treated with both oxaliplatin and CBD. Additionally, phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) was increased in oxaliplatin-resistant cells compared to that in parent cells. Combined treatment with oxaliplatin and CBD reduced phospho-NOS3 levels and nitric oxide (NO) production and resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing the levels of superoxide dismutase 2, an antioxidant present in the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, these results suggest that elevated phosphorylation of NOS3 is essential for oxaliplatin resistance. The combination of oxaliplatin and CBD decreased NOS3 phosphorylation, which resulted in autophagy, by inducing the overproduction of ROS through mitochondrial dysfunction, thus overcoming oxaliplatin resistance.","Asian Livestock Industry Leaders' Perceptions of the Importance of, and Solutions for, Animal Welfare Issues.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195720,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 14,"The welfare of farm animals has been the focus of increasing international interest, however, the movement has had little engagement with livestock leaders who are, arguably, the stakeholders in the position most able to make decisions that impact on animal welfare at critical times. Previous studies have drawn attention to the need to engage in constructive collaborations with the livestock industry for the betterment of animal welfare, and to uncover mutual benefits for both stakeholders and proponents of animal welfare with which collaborations can be motivated. This study aimed to continue this need to understand leaders in livestock management, by consulting their opinions as to what constitutes the most critical animal welfare issues during farming and slaughter, and what they see as some of the solutions to begin addressing livestock welfare issues in their country. Seventeen focus group sessions were held with 139 leaders in livestock industries in six diverse countries in Asia, including China, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Bangladesh. Leaders included government representatives, key academics in agriculture, and business managers and leaders within the domestic animal agriculture industries, as relevant to each country. After conducting thematic analysis and applying basic statistical measures, the findings suggest that solutions within the themes of education, training, and awareness are most valued. However, how each of these could be best addressed varied by country. The need for local research and local solutions also contributed to the most frequent opportunities, as did the requirement for prescriptive and consistent standards and expectations.

The inductance amplitude and signal-to-noise (SNR) of iron particles ranging from 60-130 μm and copper particles ranging from 120-180 μm can be increased by at least 7.0-2.4 and 4.5-2.0 times, respectively. We demonstrate the successful detection of 30 μm iron particles and 90 μm copper particles using double solenoid coils with silicon steel sheets. In capacitance detection experiments, the silicon steel sheets can improve the sensitivity of capacitance detection, but the improvement effect is not obvious. We demonstrate the successful detection of 140 μm water droplets and 240 μm bubbles using double solenoid coils with and without silicon steel sheets. The capacitance amplitude and SNR of detecting water droplets ranging from 140-150 μm and bubbles ranging from 240-250 μm can be increased by 37.4-21.9% and 18.5-8.0% using double solenoid coils with silicon steel sheets, respectively.",Estimation of Interference Arrival Direction Based on a Novel Space-Time Conversion MUSIC Algorithm for GNSS Receivers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195718,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"In the estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA) for interference signals, the direction-finding error of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm will increase in the case of multiple interferences or when the interfering signal power is weak. In this paper, a space-time conversion MUSIC (STC-MUSIC) algorithm is proposed, and the concept of a focusing parameter is introduced to improve the performance of the DOA estimation. Meanwhile, a method of variable step size peak search is proposed to reduce the amount of calculation of the STC-MUSIC algorithm. The final simulation and experimental results show that the STC-MUSIC algorithm improves the purity of the noise subspace effectively, thus improving the precision and robustness of the DOA estimation for interference signals significantly. In comparison to traditional algorithms, the convergence, stability, root mean square error (RMSE) and other performance characteristics are improved greatly.",Plasma Polymerized Allylamine-The Unique Cell-Attractive Nanolayer for Dental Implant Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195717,Polymers,2019 06 14,"Biomaterials should be bioactive in stimulating the surrounding tissue to accelerate the ingrowth of permanent implants. Chemical and topographical features of the biomaterial surface affect cell physiology at the interface. A frequently asked question is whether the chemistry or the topography dominates the cell-material interaction. Recently, we demonstrated that a plasma-chemical modification using allylamine as a precursor was able to boost not only cell attachment and cell migration, but also intracellular signaling in vital cells. This microwave plasma process generated a homogenous nanolayer with randomly distributed, positively charged amino groups. In contrast, the surface of the human osteoblast is negatively charged at -15 mV due to its hyaluronan coat. As a consequence, we assumed that positive charges at the material surface-provoking electrostatic interaction forces-are attractive for the first cell encounter. This plasma-chemical nanocoating can be used for several biomaterials in orthopedic and dental implantology like titanium, titanium alloys, calcium phosphate scaffolds, and polylactide fiber meshes produced by electrospinning. In this regard, we wanted to ascertain whether plasma polymerized allylamine (PPAAm) is also suitable for increasing the attractiveness of a ceramic surface for dental implants using Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia.",Screening of Phenanthroquinolizidine Alkaloid Derivatives for Inducing Cell Death of L1210 Leukemia Cells with Negative and Positive P-glycoprotein Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195716,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"We describe the screening of a set of cryptopleurine derivatives, namely thienoquinolizidine derivatives and (epi-)benzo analogs with bioactive phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids that induce cytotoxic effects in the mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210. We used three variants of L1210 cells: i) parental cells (S) negative for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression; ii) P-glycoprotein positive cells (R), obtained by selection with vincristine; iii) P-glycoprotein positive cells (T), obtained by stable transfection with a human gene encoding P-glycoprotein. We identified the most effective derivative 11 with a median lethal concentration of ≈13 μM in all three L1210 cell variants. The analysis of the apoptosis/necrosis induced by derivative 11 revealed that cell death was the result of apoptosis with late apoptosis characteristics. Derivative 11 did not induce a strong alteration in the proportion of cells in the G1, S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but a strong increase in the number of S, R and T cells in the subG1 phase was detected. These findings indicated that we identified the most effective inducer of cell death, derivative 11, and this derivative effectively induced cell death in S, R and T cells at similar inhibitory concentrations independent of P-gp expression."

The proposed device can convert linearly polarized incident waves to their cross-polarized transmitted waves. Inspired by the aperture coupled transmitarray, a transmissive multi-layered unit cell structure was designed, which can operate in two frequency bands. The designed structure can manipulate the polarization of the transmitted wave into the cross-polarization of the incident waves at 10.36 GHz and 11.62 GHz. The cross-polarized transmittance of the proposed cross-polarization converter is higher than 0.93. In addition, the transmitted wave has an extremely low co-polarized component, which results in a nearly 100% polarization conversion ratio. The two working frequencies can be tuned independently. The proposed cross-polarization converter was simulated, fabricated and measured. The simulation results confirm with the measurement results.",Design and Validation of a Single-SOI-Wafer 4-DOF Crawling Microgripper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195703,Micromachines,2019 06 14,"This paper deals with the manipulation of micro-objects operated by a new concept multi-hinge multi-DoF (degree of freedom) microsystem. The system is composed of a planar 3-DoF microstage and of a set of one-DoF microgrippers, and it is arranged is such a way as to allow any microgripper to crawl over the stage. As a result, the optimal configuration to grasp the micro-object can be reached. Classical algorithms of kinematic analysis have been used to study the rigid-body model of the mobile platform. Then, the rigid-body replacement method has been implemented to design the corresponding compliant mechanism, whose geometry can be transferred onto the etch mask. Deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) is suggested to fabricate the whole system. The main contributions of this investigation consist of (i) the achievement of a relative motion between the supporting platform and the microgrippers, and of (ii) the design of a process flow for the simultaneous fabrication of the stage and the microgrippers, starting from a single silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Functionality is validated via theoretical simulation and finite element analysis, whereas fabrication feasibility is granted by preliminary tests performed on some parts of the microsystem.",A Power-Efficient Multiband Planar USB Dongle Antenna for Wireless Sensor Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195702,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) had been applied in Internet of Things (IoT) and in Industry 4.0. Since a WSN system contains multiple wireless sensor nodes, it is necessary to develop a low-power and multiband wireless communication system that satisfies the specifications of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Certification European (CE). In a WSN system, many devices are of very small size and can be slipped into a Universal Serial Bus (USB), which is capable of connecting to wireless systems and networks, as well as transferring data. These devices are widely known as USB dongles. This paper develops a planar USB dongle antenna for three frequency bands, namely 2.30-2.69 GHz, 3.40-3.70 GHz, and 5.15-5.85 GHz. This study proposes a novel antenna design that uses four loops to develop the multiband USB dongle. The first and second loops construct the low and intermediate frequency ranges. The third loop resonates the high frequency property, while the fourth loop is used to enhance the bandwidth. The performance and power consumption of the proposed multiband planar USB dongle antenna were significantly improved compared to existing multiband designs.",Older Adults and Digital Society: Scientific Coverage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195701,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"While there is a progressive ageing of the population, we are witnessing a rapid development of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). Although for most of society this technology is within reach, there are population segments for whom access is limited, especially adults who are considered of old age. Due to the relevance that the relationship between ICTs and older adults acquires in today's society, it is necessary to carry out an analysis of the scientific literature in order to understand the knowledge structure of this field. In this research, a comparative bibliometric analysis of 172 documents published in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases was carried out until 2018 and is complemented by a co-citation analysis. The results show that this subject is incipient and is in its exponential growth stage, with two thirds of the production concentrated in the 2012-2018 period.

Membrane filtration is a promising technology to improve separation, but fouling of the membranes causes a significant reduction in flow capacity. To reduce fouling, optimization of the backwashing parameters is given much attention. Comprehensive and time-consuming experiments are used to model the effect of backwashing, but most methods neglect time varying features present in the offshore produced water treatment train. In this paper, a backwashing scheduling algorithm is proposed, which dynamically selects the filtration and backwashing durations to maximize the average net permeate production. The proposed algorithm is tested on a lab-scaled pilot plant, where it was able to adapt as irreversible fouling accumulated and the OiW concentration changed. The paper concludes that the removal rate of oil fouling was observed to be dependent on the rate at which the backwashing pressure could be established. As the proposed method online adapts to the current conditions, it can improve the filtration capacity compared to cases with constant backwashing and filtration durations throughout the lifetime of the facilities.",Calcium Signaling Pathways: Key Pathways in the Regulation of Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195699,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"Nowadays, high epidemic obesity-triggered hypertension and diabetes seriously damage social public health. There is now a general consensus that the body's fat content exceeding a certain threshold can lead to obesity. Calcium ion is one of the most abundant ions in the human body. A large number of studies have shown that calcium signaling could play a major role in increasing energy consumption by enhancing the metabolism and the differentiation of adipocytes and reducing food intake through regulating neuronal excitability, thereby effectively decreasing the occurrence of obesity. In this paper, we review multiple calcium signaling pathways, including the IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-Ca2+ (calcium ion) pathway, the p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, and the calmodulin binding pathway, which are involved in biological clock, intestinal microbial activity, and nerve excitability to regulate food intake, metabolism, and differentiation of adipocytes in mammals, resulting in the improvement of obesity.","Demographic, Social and Health-Related Variables that Predict Normal-Weight Preschool Children Having Overweight or Obesity When Entering Primary Education in Chile.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195698,Nutrients,2019 06 14,"We determined which variables are predictive of normal-weight (N) Chilean 4-year-olds developing overweight/obesity when entering primary school. This study used national data of preschoolers (PK, age 4) in 2011 through 2015, and the same children in the first grade (1st G, age 6) in 2013 through 2017. We formed longitudinal cohorts considering PK as the baseline and 1st G as the follow-up and included anthropometric, socio-demographic, and health variables in PK and anthropometry in the 1st G. We report the percentage N who remained N at follow-up (N-N) or gained excessive weight (N-OW) and (N-OB), by sex. We ran univariate logistic regressions to determine for each variable, its association with gaining excessive weight (N-OW + OB), incorporating significant variables (p < 0.001) in multivariate logistic regression. A total of 483,509 (251,150 girls) of PK had anthropometry in the 1st G. In PK, 22% of the children were obese; in the 1st G (24.8% and 19.7% in boys and girls, respectively). Of normal-weight children, 30% developed OW + OB. The predictive variables were: Being born macrosomic, attending a very vulnerable school, being indigenous, the mother's low schooling, and the child being cared for by the grandmother after school. In this study, the factors predicting that normal-weight preschoolers gain excessive weight gain in a short period of time are mostly related to poverty. Prevention should focus on this population.","Design, Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of Coumarin-1,2,3-triazole Hybrids Obtained from Natural Furocoumarin Peucedanin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195697,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole-substituted coumarins and also 1,2,3-triazolyl or 1,2,3-triazolylalk-1-inyl-linked coumarin-2,3-furocoumarin hybrids was performed by employing the cross-coupling and copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction approaches.

By the original methods, new well-defined sheet polymers having nanopores or nanospaces have been synthesized for the first time. Their composite membranes, containing small amounts (1.0 wt%) of sc(Rf), had ultrahigh oxygen permeability (Po2 > 1000 barrer), and their plots were beyond the Robeson's upper bound line in the graph of oxygen permselectivity (α = Po2/PN2) versus Po2. Both α and Po2 values were enhanced by adding only small amounts (1.0 wt%) of sc(Rf). One of the sc(Rf)s synthesized on the base membrane surface showed the best performance, i.e., Po2 = 5300 barrer and α = 2.5. The membrane surface was effectively covered by sc(Rf), judging from the contact angle values. It is thought that nanopores and nanospaces created in and between sc(Rf) molecules played an important role for the enhancement of both α and Po2/PN2."

Kidney failure has long been known to cause circadian sleep disturbances. Using an adenine-induced model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mice, we probe the possibility that such sleep disturbances originate from aberrant circadian rhythms in kidney. Under the CKD condition, mice developed unstable behavioral circadian rhythms. When observed in isolation in vitro, the pacing of the master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), remained uncompromised, while the kidney clock became a less robust circadian oscillator with a longer period. We find this analogous to the silencing of a strong slave clock in the brain, the choroid plexus, which alters the pacing of the SCN. We propose that the kidney also contributes to overall circadian timekeeping at the whole-body level, through bottom-up feedback in the hierarchical structure of the mammalian circadian clocks.",Three Structural Features of Functional Food Components and Herbal Medicine with Amyloid β42 Anti-Aggregation Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195683,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Aggregation of amyloid β42 (Aβ42) is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are numerous naturally occurring products that suppress the aggregation of Aβ42, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Based on NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis, we propose three structural characteristics found in natural products required for the suppressive activity against Aβ42 aggregation (i.e., oligomerization by targeting specific amino acid residues on this protein). These characteristics include (1) catechol-type flavonoids that can form Michael adducts with the side chains of Lys16 and 28 in monomeric Aβ42 through flavonoid autoxidation; (2) non-catechol-type flavonoids with planarity due to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that can interact with the intermolecular β-sheet region in Aβ42 aggregates, especially aromatic rings such as those of Phe19 and 20; and (3) carboxy acid derivatives with triterpenoid or anthraquinoid that can generate a salt bridge with basic amino acid residues such as Lys16 and 28 in the Aβ42 dimer or trimer. Here, we summarize the recent body of knowledge concerning amyloidogenic inhibitors, particularly in functional food components and Kampo medicine, and discuss their application in the treatment and prevention of AD.","A Cross-Sectional Study on 3-(2-Deoxy-β-D-Erythro-Pentafuranosyl)Pyrimido[1,2-α]Purin-10(3H)-One Deoxyguanosine Adducts among Woodworkers in Tuscany, Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195682,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"Occupational exposure to wood dust has been estimated to affect 3.6 million workers within the European Union (EU). The most serious health effect caused by wood dust is the nasal and sinonasal cancer (SNC), which has been observed predominantly among woodworkers. Free radicals produced by inflammatory reactions as a consequence of wood dust could play a major role in SNC development. Therefore, we investigated the association between wood dust and oxidative DNA damage in the cells of nasal epithelia, the target site of SNC. We have analyzed oxidative DNA damage by determining the levels of 3-(2-deoxy-β-D-erythro-pentafuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10(3H)-one deoxyguanosine (M1dG), a major-peroxidation-derived DNA adduct and a biomarker of cancer risk in 136 woodworkers compared to 87 controls in Tuscany, Italy. We then examined the association of M1dG with co-exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), exposure length, and urinary 15-F2t isoprostane (15-F2t-IsoP), a biomarker of oxidant status. Wood dust at the workplace was estimated by the Information System for Recording Occupational Exposures to Carcinogens. M1dG was measured using 32P-postlabeling and mass spectrometry. 15-F2t-IsoP was analyzed using ELISA. Results show a significant excess of M1dG in the woodworkers exposed to average levels of 1.48 mg/m3 relative to the controls. The overall mean ratio (MR) between the woodworkers and the controls was 1.28 (95% C.I. 1.03-1.58). After stratification for smoking habits and occupational status (exposure to wood dust alone and co-exposure to VOCs), the association of M1dG with wood dust (alone) was even greater in non-smokers workers, MR of 1.43 (95% C.I. 1.09-1.87). Conversely, not consistent results were found in ex-smokers and current smokers. M1dG was significantly associated with co-exposure to VOCs, MR of 1.95 (95% C.I. 1.46-2.61), and occupational history, MR of 2.47 (95% C.I. 1.67-3.62). Next, the frequency of M1dG was significantly correlated to the urinary excretion of 15-F2t-IsoP, regression coefficient (β) = 0.442 ± 0.172 (SE). Consistent with the hypothesis of a genotoxic mechanism, we observed an enhanced frequency of M1dG adducts in woodworkers, even at the external levels below the regulatory limit. Our data implement the understanding of SNC and could be useful for the management of the adverse effects caused by this carcinogen.",Adsorption of Direct Blue 78 Using Chitosan and Cyclodextrins as Adsorbents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195681,Polymers,2019 06 14,"The dyeing industry is one of the most polluting in the world. The adsorption of dyes by polymeric matrixes can be used to minimize the discharge of dyes into the environment. In the present study, chitosan-NaOH and β-cyclodextrin-epichlorohydrin polymers were used to remove the dye Direct Blue 78 from a wastewater model. To understand the adsorption behavior of Direct Blue 78 onto the polymers, adsorption rate and maximum adsorption capacity were calculated using kinetic tests and isotherm curves respectively. The kinetic data and mechanism of the adsorption process were analyzed by three models and the equilibrium data by three adsorption isotherms; also the different thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Results showed that the adsorption process follows pseudo-second-order kinetics in both polymers and the Langmuir isotherm best-fitted data for chitosan-NaOH polymer and the Freundlich isotherm for the β-CDs-EPI polymer. The adsorption process is exothermic in both cases and spontaneous for the β-CDs-EPI polymer to a certain temperature and not spontaneous for the chitosan-NaOH polymer and β-CDs-EPI polymer at higher temperatures. The complementary action of an advanced oxidation process eliminated >99% of the dye from water.

Angiogenesis plays a key role in osteosarcoma (OS) development and progression. Acidity is a hallmark of malignancy in a variety of cancers, including sarcomas, as a result of an increased energetic metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of EVs derived from osteosarcoma cells on angiogenesis and whether extracellular acidity, generated by tumor metabolism, could influence EVs activity. For this purpose, we purified and characterized EVs from OS cells maintained at either acidic or neutral pH. The ability of EVs to induce angiogenesis was assessed in vitro by endothelial cell tube formation and in vivo using chicken chorioallantoic membrane. Our findings demonstrated that EVs derived from osteosarcoma cells maintained either in acidic or neutral conditions induced angiogenesis. The results showed that miRNA and protein content of EVs cargo are correlated with pro-angiogenic activity and this activity is increased by the acidity of tumor microenvironment. This study provides evidence that EVs released by human osteosarcoma cells act as carriers of active angiogenic stimuli that are able to promote endothelial cell functions relevant to angiogenesis.",Characterization of a Lytic Bacteriophage as an Antimicrobial Agent for Biocontrol of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli O145 Strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195679,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O145 is one of the most prevalent non-O157 serogroups associated with foodborne outbreaks. Lytic phages are a potential alternative to antibiotics in combatting bacterial pathogens. In this study, we characterized a Siphoviridae phage lytic against STEC O145 strains as a novel antimicrobial agent. Escherichia phage vB_EcoS-Ro145clw (Ro145clw) was isolated and purified prior to physiological and genomic characterization. Then, in vitro antimicrobial activity against an outbreak strain, E. coli O145:H28, was evaluated. Ro145clw is a double-stranded DNA phage with a genome 42,031 bp in length. Of the 67 genes identified in the genome, 21 were annotated with functional proteins, none of which were stx genes. Ro145clw had a latent period of 21 min and a burst size of 192 phages per infected cell. The phage could sustain a wide range of pH (pH 3 to pH 10) and temperatures (-80 °C to -73 °C). Ro145clw was able to reduce E. coli O145:H28 in lysogeny broth by approximately 5 log at 37 °C in four hours. These findings indicate that the Ro145clw phage is a promising antimicrobial agent that can be used to control E. coli O145 in adverse pH and temperature conditions.",Evaluating the Effects of KCl on Thermal Behavior and Reaction Kinetics of Medium Density Fiberboard Pyrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195678,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"The effects of potassium chloride (KCl) on the pyrolysis of medium density fiberboard (MDF) were investigated by using thermogravimetry/Fourier-transfer infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). Five MDF samples treated with different KCl concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%) were heated with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The thermogravimetry (TG) results showed that KCl caused the primary pyrolysis stage towards lower temperatures. The FTIR results indicated that with the concentrations of KCl, the formation of CH4 and C=O functional groups decreased while the formation of CO2 and CO increased. To figure out the reason for the observed phenomena, the kinetic parameters in primary pyrolysis and the secondary charring reaction were estimated by a differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm. The prediction indicated that KCl shifted the initial degradation temperature of each component of MDF towards a lower temperature. Char and gas yields increased with the concentration of KCl, whereas the tar yield reduced. The changes in activation energies revealed that KCl played a catalyst role in the reaction of resin, hemicellulose and cellulose in primary pyrolysis. For lignin, KCl had little effect. In the secondary charring reaction, KCl apparently promoted the reaction of tar. The catalytic effect of KCl on MDF pyrolysis was the combination of primary pyrolysis and the secondary charring reaction. Finally, the optimal catalytic concentration for KCl on MDF pyrolysis was analyzed.",Issue of Compliance with Use of Personal Protective Equipment among Wastewater Workers across the Southeast Region of the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195677,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Wastewater workers are exposed to different occupational hazards such as chemicals, gases, viruses, and bacteria. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a significant factor that can reduce or decrease the probability of an accident from hazardous exposures to chemicals and microbial contaminants. The purpose of this study was to examine wastewater worker's beliefs and practices on wearing PPE through the integration of the Health Belief Model (HBM), identify the impact that management has on wastewater workers wearing PPE, and determine the predictors of PPE compliance among workers in the wastewater industry. Data was collected from 272 wastewater workers located at 33 wastewater facilities across the southeast region of the United States. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted to present frequency distributions of participants' knowledge and compliance with wearing PPE. Univariate and multiple linear regression models were applied to determine the association of predictors of interest with PPE compliance. Wastewater workers were knowledgeable of occupational exposures and PPE requirements at their facility. Positive predictors of PPE compliance were perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of contracting an occupational illness (p < 0.05). A negative association was identified between managers setting the example of wearing PPE sometimes and PPE compliance (p < 0.05). Utilizing perceived susceptibility and severity for safety programs and interventions may improve PPE compliance among wastewater workers.",Antimicrobial Effect and Probiotic Potential of Phage Resistant Lactobacillus plantarum and its Interactions with Zoonotic Bacterial Pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195676,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Development of phage-resistant probiotic particularly Lactobacillus is an alternative approach to enhance their beneficial effects as in animal feed supplements. In this study, we developed phage-resistant Lactobacillus plantarum (LP
+PR
) mutant and compared their antimicrobial effects and probiotic potential against zoonotic bacterial pathogens including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes with phage-sensitive L. plantarum (LP) strain. LP
+PR
 strain showed markedly higher growth rate than wild-type LP strain. In co-culture with LP
+PR
 and in the presence of cell-free cultural supernatants (CFCSs) of LP
+PR
, the growth of S. Typhimurium, EHEC, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes were reduced significantly (P < 0.05). The adhesion ability of LP
+PR
 was slightly higher than the LP on human epithelial INT-407 cells. Most importantly, LP
+PR
 strain significantly inhibited the adhesive and invasive abilities of all four zoonotic pathogens to INT-407 cells (P < 0.05). Moreover, real-time qPCR revealed that in the presence of LP
+PR
 strain or its CFCSs, expression of virulence genes of these zoonotic bacterial pathogens were suppressed significantly (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the LP
+PR
 strain is capable of inhibiting major zoonotic bacterial pathogens efficiently and would be a potential candidate for industrial usage in animal production or fermentation.",Identification of the Fungal Pathogens of Postharvest Disease on Peach Fruits and the Control Mechanisms of Bacillus subtilis JK-14.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195675,Toxins,2019 06 14,"Postharvest fungal disease is one of the significant factors that limits the storage period and marketing life of peaches, and even result in serious economic losses worldwide. Biological control using microbial antagonists has been explored as an alternative approach for the management of postharvest disease of fruits. However, there is little information available regarding to the identification the fungal pathogen species that cause the postharvest peach diseases and the potential and mechanisms of using the Bacillussubtilis JK-14 to control postharvest peach diseases. In the present study, a total of six fungal isolates were isolated from peach fruits, and the isolates of Alternaria tenuis and Botrytis cinerea exhibited the highest pathogenicity and virulence on the host of mature peaches. In the culture plates, the strain of B. subtilis JK-14 showed the significant antagonistic activity against the growth of A. tenuis and B. cinerea with the inhibitory rates of 81.32% and 83.45% at 5 days after incubation, respectively. Peach fruits treated with different formulations of B. subtilis JK-14 significantly reduced the mean disease incidences and lesion diameters of A. tenuis and B. cinerea. The greatest mean percent reduction of the disease incidences (81.99% and 71.34%) and lesion diameters (82.80% and 73.57%) of A. tenuis and B. cinerea were obtained at the concentration of 1 × 107 CFU mL-1 (colony forming unit, CFU). Treatment with the strain of B. subtilis JK-14 effectively enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) in A. tenuis and B. cinerea inoculated peach fruits. As such, the average activities of SOD, POD and CAT were increased by 36.56%, 17.63% and 20.35%, respectively, compared to the sterile water treatment. Our results indicate that the isolates of A. tenuis and B. cinerea are the main pathogens that cause the postharvest peach diseases, and the strain of B. subtilis JK-14 can be considered as an environmentally-safe biological control agent for the management of postharvest fruits diseases. We propose the possible mechanisms of the strain of B. subtilis JK-14 in controlling of postharvest peach diseases."

Identified a Role for ZmTCP42 in Drought Tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195663,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"The Teosinte-branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating (TCP) plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) have been demonstrated to play a fundamental role in plant development and organ patterning. However, it remains unknown whether or not the TCP gene family plays a role in conferring a tolerance to drought stress in maize, which is a major constraint to maize production. In this study, we identified 46 ZmTCP genes in the maize genome and systematically analyzed their phylogenetic relationships and synteny with rice, sorghum, and ArabidopsisTCP genes. Expression analysis of the 46 ZmTCP genes in different tissues and under drought conditions, suggests their involvement in maize response to drought stress. Importantly, genetic variations in ZmTCP32 and ZmTCP42 are significantly associated with drought tolerance at the seedling stage. RT-qPCR results suggest that ZmTCP32 and ZmTCP42 RNA levels are both induced by ABA, drought, and polyethylene glycol treatments. Based on the significant association between the genetic variation of ZmTCP42 and drought tolerance, and the inducible expression of ZmTCP42 by drought stress, we selected ZmTCP42, to investigate its function in drought response. We found that overexpression of ZmTCP42 in Arabidopsis led to a hypersensitivity to ABA in seed germination and enhanced drought tolerance, validating its function in drought tolerance. These results suggested that ZmTCP42 functions as an important TCP TF in maize, which plays a positive role in drought tolerance.",Quercetin Regulates the Integrated Stress Response to Improve Memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195662,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"The initiation of protein synthesis is suppressed under several stress conditions, inducing phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), thereby inactivating the GTP-GDP recycling protein eIF2B. By contrast, the mammalian activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4, also known as cAMP response element binding protein 2 (CREB2)) is still translated under stress conditions. Four protein kinases (general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2) kinase, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), PKR-endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related kinase (PERK), and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI)) phosphorylate eIF2α in the presence of stressors such as amino acid starvation, viral infection, ER stress, and heme deficiency. This signaling reaction is known as the integrated stress response (ISR). Here, we review ISR signaling in the brain in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose that targeting ISR signaling with quercetin has therapeutic potential, because it suppresses amyloid-β (Aβ) production in vitro and prevents cognitive impairments in a mouse model of AD.",Improving Nursing Staff Attitudes toward Vaccinations through Academic Detailing: The HProImmune Questionnaire as a Tool for Medical Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195661,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Vaccinations remain the most effective way of preventing infection, disease, and mortality. Public health institutions consequently recommend vaccines to target groups, including healthcare workers, who are considered to be more at risk of exposure and transmission. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess, through the administration of a questionnaire, the nursing staff's knowledge and attitude towards recommended vaccinations, and to explore the effects of a training course (carried out according to the academic detailing methodology) aimed at increasing operators' knowledge and outreach on recommended vaccinations among healthcare workers. A total of 85 HCWs (30 nursing coordinators and 55 nurses) completed the questionnaire. Results demonstrate a higher rate of agreement towards vaccinations in nursing staff answers (75%), if compared with results of other studies (62-63%). Statistically significant differences between nursing coordinators and nurses can be found. Regarding vaccination attitudes, nursing coordinators agreed in 86% of the answers on healthcare workers' vaccination vs 70% of nurses (p < 0.001). Considering immunization for influenza, 57% of nursing coordinators vs 18% of nurses reported for vaccination (p < 0.001). Educational programs, carried out according to academic detailing methods, could impact on vaccination attitudes and raise awareness about recommended vaccinations among healthcare workers. The questionnaire is a useful tool for investigating nursing staff knowledge and attitudes towards vaccinations, and to implement strategies to promoting vaccinations among healthcare workers.",Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus Envelope Glycoproteins Evolve to Broaden Receptor Usage Under Pressure from Entry Competitors †.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195660,Viruses,2019 06 14,"The subgroup A through E avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses (ASLV(A) through ASLV(E)) are a group of highly related alpharetroviruses that have evolved their envelope glycoproteins to use different receptors to enable efficient virus entry due to host resistance and/or to expand host range. Previously, we demonstrated that ASLV(A) in the presence of a competitor to the subgroup A Tva receptor, SUA-rIgG immunoadhesin, evolved to use other receptor options. The selected mutant virus, RCASBP(A)Δ155-160, modestly expanded its use of the Tvb and Tvc receptors and possibly other cell surface proteins while maintaining the binding affinity to Tva. In this study, we further evolved the Δ155-160 virus with the genetic selection pressure of a soluble form of the Tva receptor that should force the loss of Tva binding affinity in the presence of the Δ155-160 mutation. Viable ASLVs were selected that acquired additional mutations in the Δ155-160 Env hypervariable regions that significantly broadened receptor usage to include Tvb and Tvc as well as retaining the use of Tva as a receptor determined by receptor interference assays. A similar deletion in the hr1 hypervariable region of the subgroup C ASLV glycoproteins evolved to broaden receptor usage when selected on Tvc-negative cells.",Detection of Single Steel Strand Distribution in Grouting Duct Based on Capacitive Sensing Technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195659,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Grouting ducts (containing steel strands) are widely used to increase the structural strengths of infrastructures. The determination of the steel strand's integrity inside of ducts and the grouting quality are important for a strength evaluation of the structure. In this study, a capacitive sensing technique was applied to identify the cross-sectional distribution of the steel strands. The distribution was expressed in polar coordinates in an external post-tensioned pre-stressed duct model. An improved capacitive sensor structure was designed, which consisted of four electrodes, and different electrode-pairs were used to determine various locations' information of the steel strands. Two rounds of measurements were conducted using the designed sensor to detect the angle (θ) and center distance (r) of the steel strand in the duct. The simulated and experimental results are presented and analyzed. In general, it is difficult to locate the angle of a steel strand directly from first-round capacitance measurements by analyzing the experimental results. Our method based on Q-factor analysis was presented for the position detection of a steel bar in an external post-tensioned pre-stressed duct. The center distance of the steel bar could be identified by second-round capacitance measurements. The processed results verified the effectiveness of the proposed capacitive sensor structure. Thus, the capacitive sensing technique exhibited potential for steel strand cross-section distribution detection in external post-tensioned pre-stressed ducts.","Distinctive Formation of Volatile Compounds in Fermented Rice Inoculated by Different Molds, Yeasts, and Lactic Acid Bacteria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195658,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Rice has been fermented to enhance its application in some foods. Although various microbes are involved in rice fermentation, their roles in the formation of volatile compounds, which are important to the characteristics of fermented rice, are not clear. In this study, diverse approaches, such as partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), metabolic pathway-based volatile compound formations, and correlation analysis between volatile compounds and microbes were applied to compare metabolic characteristics according to each microbe and determine microbe-specific metabolites in fermented rice inoculated by molds, yeasts, and lactic acid bacteria. Metabolic changes were relatively more activated in fermented rice inoculated by molds compared to other microbes. Volatile compound profiles were significantly changed depending on each microbe as well as the group of microbes. Regarding some metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids, it could be observed that certain formation pathways of volatile compounds were closely linked with the type of microbes. Also, some volatile compounds were strongly correlated to specific microbes; for example, branched-chain volatiles were closely link to Aspergillus oryzae, while Lactobacillus plantarum had strong relationship with acetic acid in fermented rice. This study can provide an insight into the effects of fermentative microbes on the formation of volatile compounds in rice fermentation.",Assessment of Leaching Characteristics of Solidified Products Containing Secondary Alkaline Lead Slag.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195657,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Reuse of waste is one of the main principles of sustainable development and circular economy. Secondary alkaline lead slag is a hazardous waste generated in the recycling process of lead-acid batteries that may be suitable in construction materials. The environmental impact of the use of lead slag as a partial replacement of fine aggregates in the cement-based stabilization/solidification (S/S) process for the preparation of concrete was studied in this paper. Solidified products containing 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% slag were laboratory tested by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) analyses and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). At the same time, the leachability of toxic elements from solidified products with a high percent of slag was evaluated under environmental conditions for during one year. The results of the UCS and TCLP indicated that utilization of this type of slag in cement-based applications may be justified with its controlled addition. However, the described application of the slag was disputed due to the high release of As under high alkaline environmental conditions. Eh-pH analyses and the geochemical modeling using the software PHREEQC were evaluated, as well as the mechanism of pollutant (Pb, As) immobilization (precipitation, adsorption) as a function of pH conditions.",Utility and Predictive Value of Human Standard Semen Parameters and Sperm DNA Dispersion for Fertility Potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195656,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Because the assessment of sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) plays a key role in male fertility, our study was designed to find the relationships between SDF and standard semen parameters. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that 18% SDF is a prognostic parameter for discriminating between men with normal and abnormal standard semen parameters (n = 667). Men with > 18% SDF had significantly lower quality semen, a higher prevalence of abnormal semen characteristics, and a higher odds ratio for abnormal semen parameters compared to men with ≤ 18% SDF. An ROC analysis provided predictive values for age and semen parameters to distinguish between men with SDF > 18% and men with ≤ 18% SDF. SDF was positively correlated with male age and teratozoospermia index but negatively with sperm concentration, total number of spermatozoa, sperm morphology, progressive motility, and vitality. Our study shows that 18% SDF has a predictive value for distinguishing between men with normal and abnormal semen characteristics. Men with >18% SDF have a higher risk for abnormal semen parameters, while age and obtained semen parameters have a predictive value for SDF. There is a relationship between SDF and conventional sperm characteristics, and thus, SDF can be incorporated into male fertility assessment.",Characterization of Palladium Nanoparticles Produced by Healthy and Microwave-Injured Cells of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195655,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Numerous studies have focused on the bacterial synthesis of palladium nanoparticles (bio-Pd NPs), via uptake of Pd (II) ions and their enzymatically-mediated reduction to Pd (0). Cells of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (obligate anaerobe) and Escherichia coli (facultative anaerobe, grown anaerobically) were exposed to low-dose radiofrequency (RF) radiation(microwave (MW) energy) and the biosynthesized Pd NPs were compared. Resting cells were exposed to microwave energy before Pd (II)-challenge. MW-injured Pd (II)-treated cells (and non MW-treated controls) were contacted with H2 to promote Pd(II) reduction. By using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) associated with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, the respective Pd NPs were compared with respect to their mean sizes, size distribution, location, composition, and structure. Differences were observed following MWinjury prior to Pd(II) exposure versus uninjured controls. With D. desulfuricans the bio-Pd NPs formed post-injury showed two NP populations with different sizes and morphologies. The first, mainly periplasmically-located, showed polycrystalline Pd nano-branches with different crystal orientations and sizes ranging between 20 and 30 nm. The second NPpopulation, mainly located intracellularly, comprised single crystals with sizes between 1 and 5 nm. Bio-Pd NPs were produced mainly intracellularly by injured cells of E. coli and comprised single crystals with a size distribution between 1 and 3 nm. The polydispersity index was reduced in the bio-Pd made by injured cells of E. coli and D. desulfuricans to 32% and 39%, respectively, of the values of uninjured controls, indicating an increase in NP homogeneity of 30-40% as a result of the prior MWinjury. The observations are discussed with respect to the different locations of Pd(II)-reducing hydrogenases in the two organisms and with respect to potential implications for the catalytic activity of the produced NPs following injury-associated altered NP patterning.",An Overview on Acute Malnutrition and Food Insecurity among Children during the Conflict in Yemen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195654,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,This study aims to describe malnutrition among children under five and to describe the food insecurity status during the current conflict in Yemen.

The absorption spectra under amorphous and crystalline phase conditions was evaluated by the transfer matrix method (TMM). It was shown that significant tuning of absorption can be achieved by switching the phase of thin layer of GST between amorphous and crystalline states. The near unity (>90%) absorption can be significant maintained by incidence angles up to 75 under crystalline state for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations.

We repeated a population survey from 2012 in order to examine how attitudes towards GS have changed over time. Our survey (N = 1004) was administered in Sheffield (UK) in 2015, replicating the 2012 experiment. The questionnaire included a food frequency survey and assessed self-reported GS as well as associated variables (prevalence, current diet, pre-existing conditions, etc.). The overall rates of key variables and chi-squared analysis in comparison to the previous survey were as follows: self-reported GS was 32.8% (previously 12.9%, p < 0.001), pre-existing coeliac disease (CD) was 1.2% (previously 0.8%, p = 0.370), following a GFD was 3.7% (previously 3.7%, p = 0.997). Self-reported GS was positively associated with some pre-existing conditions, including anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, headaches, and other food allergies/intolerances (including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); chi-squared analyses, all p < 0.001). Over a 3-year period, the fraction of people who self-reported GS increased by over 250%. Despite this, arguably more meaningful indications of underlying physiological GS remained comparable. This research suggests that the public perception of gluten is causing a marked increase in the number of people who erroneously believe they are sensitive to it.","A Dynamical and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression Modelling of Malaria Incidence in Limpopo Province, South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195637,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Recent studies have considered the connections between malaria incidence and climate variables using mathematical and statistical models. Some of the statistical models focused on time series approach based on Box-Jenkins methodology or on dynamic model. The latter approach allows for covariates different from its original lagged values, while the Box-Jenkins does not. In real situations, malaria incidence counts may turn up with many zero terms in the time series. Fitting time series model based on the Box-Jenkins approach and ARIMA may be spurious. In this study, a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was formulated for fitting malaria incidence in Mopani and Vhembe-two of the epidemic district municipalities in Limpopo, South Africa. In particular, a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was formulated for daily malaria counts as a function of some climate variables, with the aim of identifying the model that best predicts reported malaria cases. Results from this study show that daily rainfall amount and the average temperature at various lags have a significant influence on malaria incidence in the study areas. The significance of zero inflation on the malaria count was examined using the Vuong test and the result shows that zero-inflated negative binomial regression model fits the data better. A dynamical climate-based model was further used to investigate the population dynamics of mosquitoes over the two regions. Findings highlight the significant roles of Anopheles arabiensis on malaria transmission over the regions and suggest that vector control activities should be intense to eradicate malaria in Mopani and Vhembe districts. Although An. arabiensis has been identified as the major vector over these regions, our findings further suggest the presence of additional vectors transmitting malaria in the study regions. The findings from this study offer insight into climate-malaria incidence linkages over Limpopo province of South Africa.",The Relationship Analysis on Corn Stalk Rot and Ear Rot According to Fusarium Species and Fumonisin Contamination in Kernels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195636,Toxins,2019 06 14,"Fusarium diseases, including corn root rot, sheath rot, stalk rot, and ear rot are frequently occurring in maize producing areas of China. Fusarium stalk rot and ear rot are the most serious diseases and often occur at the same time, but it is unclear whether there is a correlation between Fusarium composition and disease occurrence. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between the two diseases. A total of 49 corn stalk rot samples were collected from 15 regions of eight provinces in China from 2016 to 2018. The pathogens were isolated and identified separately from stalks, ear stems, and kernels. The contents of the fumonisins (FB1 and FB2) were detected in kernels. The results showed that the main Fusarium species were found in corn kernels, ear stems and stalks at the same time. The results showed that 1201 strains of Fusarium verticillioides, 668 strains of Fusarium oxysporum, 574 strains of Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), 318 strains of Fusarium equiseti, 95 strains of Fusarium proliferatum, and 40 strains of Fusarium subglutinans were isolated from 1470 corn kernels, 245 ear stems, and 1225 stalks randomly selected from 49 samples. The contamination rate of fumonisins in the 49 samples was 57.1% with an average content of 1.9 μg/g, of which four samples exhibited higher levels as set by the European Commission (4.0 μg/g). These results provide a certain association between stalk rot and ear rot and lay a foundation to study the relationships among Fusarium maize diseases.",Wildcard Fields-Based Partitioning for Fast and Scalable Packet Classification in Vehicle-to-Everything.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195635,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) requires high-speed communication and high-level security. However, as the number of connected devices increases exponentially, communication networks are suffering from huge traffic and various security issues. It is well known that performance and security of network equipment significantly depends on the packet classification algorithm because it is one of the most fundamental packet processing functions. Thus, the algorithm should run fast even with the huge set of packet processing rules. Unfortunately, previous packet classification algorithms have focused on the processing speed only, failing to be scalable with the rule-set size. In this paper, we propose a new packet classification approach balancing classification speed and scalability. It can be applied to most decision tree-based packet classification algorithms such as HyperCuts and EffiCuts. It determines partitioning fields considering the rule duplication explicitly, which makes the algorithm memory-effective. In addition, the proposed approach reduces the decision tree size substantially with the minimal sacrifice of classification performance. As a result, we can attain high-speed packet classification and scalability simultaneously, which is very essential for latest services such as V2X and Internet-of-Things (IoT).","Relationship between Academic Stress, Physical Activity and Diet in University Students of Education.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195634,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"(1) Background: Several research works have shown the relationship between physical activity (PA), adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) and health. Nevertheless, there are few studies that demonstrate the relationship of these habits with academic performance, and specifically with academic stress. (2) Methods: This descriptive, non-experimental, and cross-sectional study aims to analyse the associations between these variables in a sample composed of 515 university students, using as main instruments the KIDMED, PAQ-A and the Scale of Academic Stress. (3) Results: The university students analysed showed higher levels of academic stress for women, and especially in the academic obligations and communication of own ideas. In addition, it was shown that those university students that had a body mass index (BMI) associated with being overweight or under-weight were the respondents with higher levels of stress. Finally, the students with a low adherence to MD had higher scores for stress associated with the communication of their own ideas, while PA was not related to academic stress. When sex and BMI variables were controlled in the regression model, no associations were obtained between stress and diet quality. (4) Conclusions: This study shows interesting implications in the treatment of academic stress. Although stress was not associated with diet and physical activity, it was linked to a worse state of health associated with states of being overweight, being of special interest the treatment of stress in women.",Glycidyl Methacrylate-Emulsion Styrene Butadiene Rubber (GMA-ESBR)/Silica Wet Masterbatch Compound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195633,Polymers,2019 06 14,"In the tire industry, solution styrene butadiene rubber (SSBR), which can introduce a functional group with good reactivity to silica at chain ends, is used to increase rolling resistance performance by considering fuel economy. However, this is not environmentally friendly because SSBR uses an organic solvent for polymerization, and it is difficult to increase its molecular weight. Functionalized emulsion SBR (ESBR) can solve the problems of SSBR. The molecular weight of ESBR molecules can be easily increased in an eco-friendly solvent, i.e., water. A functionalized ESBR introduces a functional group with good reactivity to silica by introducing a third monomer during polymerization. In this field, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) has been reported to show the best properties as a third monomer. However, for GMA-ESBR, the viscosity is high and processability is disadvantageous. Therefore, we polymerized GMA-ESBR and manufactured silica compounds to clarify the causes of these problems. In addition, wet masterbatch (WMB) technology, which is a new compound manufacturing method, was applied to manufacture the silica compound, and the physical properties are compared with those of a dry masterbatch. The results clarified the problem of GMA-ESBR, which could be solved by using WMB technology.",Long-Term Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195632,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 14,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is commonly used to control disease activity in patients with SLE. We evaluated its potential additional therapeutic effect for reducing CVD in SLE patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study, in which one million participants were sampled from 23 million beneficiaries and data were collected from 2000 to 2013. In total, 826 SLE patients receiving HCQ medication were included after exclusion for previous CVD. The total number of SLE patients was 795 after follow-up for more than one year. After adjusting for chronic comorbidity, a significantly decreased hazard ratio (HR) for coronary artery disease (CAD) was found among SLE patients with a high usage of HCQ for at least 318 days (HR = 0.31, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.12-0.76). A low HR for CAD was observed in SLE patients with a high cumulative dose of at least 100,267 mg HCQ (HR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.66). However, there was no significant lowering of the HR for stroke. Long-term HCQ therapy decreases the HR of CVD in SLE patients. The cardiovascular protective effect of HCQ therapy was associated with decrease in CAD, but not stroke."

Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are the most widely used therapies for HBV infection, but they often require long-lasting administration to avoid the risk of HBV reactivation at withdrawal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to shorten the duration of NUC therapy by accelerating virus control, and to complement the effect of available anti-viral therapies. In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific T cells are functionally defective, and this exhaustion state is a key determinant of virus persistence. Reconstitution of an efficient anti-viral T cell response may thus represent a rational strategy to treat chronic HBV patients. In this perspective, the enhancement of adaptive immune responses by a checkpoint inhibitor blockade, specific T cell vaccines, lymphocyte metabolism targeting, and autologous T cell engineering, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and TCR-redirected T cells, constitutes a promising immune modulatory approach for a therapeutic restoration of protective immunity. The advances of the emerging immune-based therapies in the setting of the HBV research field will be outlined.",In-Depth Characterization of Secondary Phases in Cu2ZnSnS4 Film and Its Application to Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195618,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Secondary phases are common in Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films, which can be fatal to the performance of solar cell devices fabricated from this material. They are difficult to detect by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) because of the weak peak in spectra compared with the CZTS layer. Herein, it was found that in-depth elemental distribution by a secondary ion mass spectroscopy method illustrated uniform film composition in the bulk with slight fluctuation between different grains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted after sputtering the layer with different depths. An Auger electron spectrum with Auger parameter were used to check the chemical states of elements and examine the distribution of secondary phases in the CZTS films. Secondary phases of CuS, ZnS and SnS were detected at the surface of the CZTS film within a 50-nm thickness while no secondary phases were discovered in the bulk. The solar cell fabricated with the as-grown CZTS films showed a conversion efficiency of 2.1% (Voc: 514.3 mV, Jsc: 10.4 mA/cm2, FF: 39.3%) with an area of 0.2 cm2 under a 100 mW/cm2 illumination.

Within this intracellular compartment, Histoplasma yeast replication requires the acquisition of several essential nutrients, including metal ions. Recent work has shown that while iron, zinc, and copper are sufficiently abundant in resting macrophages, cytokine activation of these host cells causes restriction of these metals from intracellular yeasts as a form of nutritional immunity. Faced with limited iron availability in the phagosome following macrophage activation by IFN-γ, Histoplasma yeasts secrete iron-scavenging siderophores and employ multiple strategies for reduction of ferric iron to the more physiologically useful ferrous form. IFN-γ activation of macrophages also limits availability of copper in the phagosome, forcing Histoplasma reliance on the high affinity Ctr3 copper importer for copper acquisition. GM-CSF activation stimulates macrophage production of zinc-chelating metallothioneins and zinc transporters to sequester zinc from Histoplasma yeasts. In response, Histoplasma yeasts express the Zrt2 zinc importer. These findings highlight the dynamics of phagosomal metal ion concentrations in host-pathogen interactions and explain one mechanism by which macrophages become a less permissive environment for Histoplasma replication with the onset of adaptive immunity.",Toddler Temperament Mediates the Effect of Prenatal Maternal Stress on Childhood Anxiety Symptomatology: The QF2011 Queensland Flood Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195616,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"It is not known whether alterations to temperamental characteristics associated with prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) exposure account for the development of childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing behaviors and anxiety symptoms). The QF2011 Queensland flood study examined whether (1) toddler temperamental characteristics explained the association between PNMS exposure and childhood anxiety symptomatology; and (2) whether effects were dependent upon child sex or the timing of gestational exposure to PNMS. We investigated the effects of various aspects of flood-related stress in pregnancy (objective hardship, cognitive appraisal, subjective distress) on maternal report of 16-month toddler temperament (attentional control, shy-inhibition, negative reactivity), 4-year maternal-reported childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing and anxiety symptoms; N = 104), and teacher reports of internalizing behaviors (N = 77). Severity of maternal objective hardship during pregnancy and shy-inhibited behaviors were uniquely associated with 4-year child anxiety symptoms. Mediation analyses found that higher levels of 16-month negative reactivity accounted, in part, for the relationship between increased maternal objective flood-related hardship and greater internalizing behaviors (maternal but not teacher report). Neither child sex nor gestational timing of exposure moderated the hypothesized mediations. Our findings highlight several pathways through which varying aspects of disaster-related PNMS may influence early childhood anxiety symptomatology.",Methods for Assessing and Optimizing Solar Orientation by Non-Planar Sensor Arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195614,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Non-planar sensor arrays are used to determine solar orientation based on the orientation matrix formed by orientation vectors of the sensor planes. Solar panels or existing photodiodes can be directly used without increasing the size or mass of the spacecraft. However, a limiting factor for the improvement of the accuracy of orientation lies with the lack of an assessment-based approach. A formulation was developed for the supremum (i.e., the least upper bound) of orientation error of an arbitrary orientation matrix in terms of its influencing factors. The new formulation offers a way to evaluate the supremum of orientation error considering interference with finite energy and interference with infinite energy but finite average energy. For a given non-planar sensor array, a sub-matrix of the full orientation matrix would reach the optimal accuracy of orientation if its supremum of orientation error is the least. Principles for designing an optimal sensor array relate to the configuration of the orientation matrix, which can be pre-determined for a given number of sensors. Simulations and field experiment tested and validated the methods, showing that our sensor array optimization method outperforms the existing methods, while providing a way of assessment and optimization.",Microwave-Leaching of Copper Smelting Dust for Cu and Zn Extraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195613,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"Industrial wastes may contain high concentrations of valuable metals. Extraction and recovery of these metals have several economic and environmental advantages. Various studies showed positive effects of microwaves as a pretreatment method before the leaching of minerals. However, there are empty rooms for exploring simultaneous microwave and leaching (microwave-leaching) of industrial waste material for the production of valuable metals. This investigation examined the microwave-leaching method to extract copper and zinc from a copper-smelter dust (CSD). The results of microwave-leaching mechanism were compared with conventional heating leaching based on kinetics modelling. The final Cu recovery in the conventional heating and microwave irradiation was 80.88% and 69.83%, respectively. Kinetic studies indicated that the leaching reactions follow diffusion across the product layer. Based on X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses, during conventional experiments sulfate; components formed with high intensity as an ash layer which prevents reagent access to the solid surface and decreases the Cu dissolution. While the sulfate components did not detect in the microwave-leaching residuals which means that microwave irradiation helped to decrease the ash layer formation. Taking all mentioned results into consider it can be concluded that microwave-leaching can be considered as an efficient method for extraction of valuable metals from waste materials.",Out-Of-Pocket Expenditures on Dental Care for Schoolchildren Aged 6 to 12 Years: A Cross-Sectional Estimate in a Less-Developed Country Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195612,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Aim: The objective of this study was to estimate the Out-Of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPEs) incurred by households on dental care, as well as to analyze the sociodemographic, economic, and oral health factors associated with such expenditures. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 763 schoolchildren in Mexico. A questionnaire was distributed to parents to determine the variables related to OOPEs on dental care. The amounts were updated in 2017 in Mexican pesos and later converted to 2017 international dollars (purchasing power parities-PPP US $). Multivariate models were created: a linear regression model (which modeled the amount of OOPEs), and a logistic regression model (which modeled the likelihood of incurring OOPEs). Results: The OOPEs on dental care for the 763 schoolchildren were PPP US $53,578, averaging a PPP of US $70.2 ± 123.7 per child. Disbursements for treatment were the principal item within the OOPEs. The factors associated with OOPEs were the child's age, number of dental visits, previous dental pain, main reason for dental visit, educational level of mother, type of health insurance, household car ownership, and socioeconomic position. Conclusions: The average cost of dental care was PPP US $70.2 ± 123.7. Our study shows that households with higher school-aged children exhibiting the highest report of dental morbidity-as well as those without insurance-face the highest OOPEs. An array of variables were associated with higher expenditures. In general, higher-income households spent more on dental care. However, the present study did not estimate unmet needs across the socioeconomic gradient, and thus, future research is needed to fully ascertain disease burden.",Tire-Pressure Identification Using Intelligent Tire with Three-Axis Accelerometer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195611,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 14,"An intelligent tire uses sensors to dynamically acquire or monitor its state. It plays a critical role in safety and maneuverability. Tire pressure is one of the most important status parameters of a tire; it influences vehicle performance in several important ways. In this paper, we propose a tire-pressure identification scheme using an intelligent tire with 3-axis accelerometers. As the primary sensing system, the accelerometers can continuously and accurately detect tire pressure with less electronic equipment mounted in the tire. To identify tire pressure in real time during routine driving, we first developed a prototype for the intelligent tire with three 3-axis accelerometers, and carried out data-acquisition tests under different tire pressures. Then we filtered the data and concentrated on the vibration acceleration of the rim in the circumferential direction. After analysis, we established the relationship between tire pressure and characteristic frequency of the rim. Finally, we verified our identification scheme with actual vehicle data at different tire pressures. The results confirm that the identified tire pressure is very close to the actual value.",Coffee Intake and Obesity: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195610,Nutrients,2019 06 14,"Many studies have explored the relationship between coffee-one of the most commonly consumed beverages today-and obesity.

The included studies assessed obesity by body mass index (BMI, a measure of overall adiposity) or waist circumference (WC, a measure of central adiposity); analyzed the measure as a continuous outcome or binary outcome. Using random effects model, weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained for continuous outcomes; summary relative risk (RR) and 95% CI for the highest vs. lowest categories of coffee intake were estimated for binary outcome. For BMI, WMD was -0.08 (95% CI -0.14, -0.02); RR was 1.49 (95% CI 0.97, 2.29). For WC, WMD was -0.27 (95% CI -0.51, -0.02) and RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.84, 1.36). In subgroup analysis by sex, evidence for an inverse association was more evident in men, specifically for continuous outcome, with WMD -0.05 (95% CI -0.09, -0.02) for BMI and -0.21 (95% CI -0.35, -0.08) for WC.

In turn, type 2 diabetes may cause complications such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Obesity is a major risk factor for developing systemic insulin resistance, and skeletal muscle is the first tissue in susceptible individuals to lose its insulin responsiveness. Interestingly, lean individuals are not immune to insulin resistance either. Non-obese, non-diabetic subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), for example, exhibit insulin resistance at the very onset of CKD, even before clinical symptoms of renal failure are clear. This uraemic insulin resistance contributes to the muscle weakness and muscle wasting that many CKD patients face, especially during the later stages of the disease. Bioenergetic failure has been associated with the loss of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in obesity and uraemia, as well as in the development of kidney disease and its sarcopenic complications. In this mini review, we evaluate how mitochondrial activity of different renal cell types changes during DKD progression, and discuss the controversial role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in DKD. We also compare the involvement of skeletal muscle mitochondria in uraemic and obesity-related muscle insulin resistance.","""I Would Never Come Here Because I've Got My Own Garden"": Older Adults' Perceptions of Small Urban Green Spaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195595,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 14,"Green spaces are known to improve health and wellbeing via several mechanisms, such as by reducing stress and facilitating physical activity. However, little is known about the impact of the smaller green spaces typically found in urban environments on wellbeing, especially for older adults. This study investigated experiences in adults (5 males and 10 females) aged 60 years and over of small urban green spaces in a large UK city. Fifteen older adults were interviewed using semi-structured walk-along interviews and photo elicitation methods in Old Moat, Greater Manchester. Twelve of the participants lived in Old Moat at the time of the study, and the remaining three participants previously lived in Old Moat and were frequent visitors. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. Smaller urban green spaces were perceived differently to large green spaces, and participants were more likely to use larger green spaces such as parks. The smaller green spaces were perceived as belonging to other people, which discouraged the older adults from using them. The older adults also emphasized the importance of taking care of small urban green spaces and preventing them from becoming overgrown. Urban planners should consider these factors, since they indicate that the size and type of urban green spaces may influence whether they improve health and wellbeing. Further research should investigate in more detail which types of urban green space are most conducive to facilitating physical activity and improving wellbeing.",Gene Expression Indicates Altered Immune Modulation and Signaling Pathway Activation in Ovarian Cancer Patients Resistant to Topotecan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195594,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 14,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies. Topotecan remains an essential tool in second-line therapy; even so, most patients develop resistance within a short period of time. We aimed to identify biomarkers of topotecan resistance by using gene expression signatures derived from patient specimens at surgery and available subsequent responses to therapy. Gene expression was collected for 1436 patients and 10,103 genes. Based on disease progression, patients were categorized as responders/nonresponders depending on their progression free survival (PFS) state at 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after surgery. For each gene, the median expression was compared between responders and nonresponders for two treatment regimens (chemotherapy including/excluding topotecan) with Mann-Whitney U test at each of the four different PFS cutoffs. Statistical significance was accepted in the case of p < 0.05 with a fold change (FC) ≥ 1.44. Four genes (EPB41L2, HLA-DQB1, LTF and SFRP1) were consistently overexpressed across multiple PFS cutoff times in initial tumor samples of patients with disease progression following topotecan treatment. A common theme linked to topotecan resistance was altered immune modulation. Genes associated with disease progression after systemic chemotherapy emphasize the role of the initial organization of the tumor microenvironment in therapy resistance.

By 2008 the pest had moved into sugarcane- and rice-growing areas of East Texas and Louisiana, and by 2012 it was reported on noncrop host plants in Florida. Efforts to suppress E. loftini in United States sugarcane with chemicals and biological control agents were unsuccessful, so both tactics were discontinued, and E. loftini infestation of sugarcane has continued unchecked. During the last 15 years, however, research has focused on the pest's ecology, improved insecticides and scouting methods, the identification of sugarcane resistance mechanisms, and new cultural tactics. A surveillance technique was developed that indicates when larvae are most vulnerable to insecticide sprays. Currently, registered insecticides for E. loftini control are not widely applied, although some show promise, including an insect growth regulator. A number of potentially useful cultural practices are available, including plowing under fallow stubble, judicious use of fertilizer, adequate irrigation, avoiding proximity to E. loftini-susceptible maize cultivars, and enhancement of natural enemy populations.

Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of barley that reduces quality of grain. FHB can also result in the accumulation of mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Breeding FHB resistant varieties has been a long-term goal of many barley-producing countries, including Canada. While the genetic basis of DON detoxification via production of less-phytotoxic conjugates such as DON-3-glucoside (DON3G) is well documented in barley, little information exists in reference to varietal response. Over two years, 16 spring, two-row barley genotypes, of importance to western Canadian barley breeding programs, were grown as short-rows and inoculated following spike emergence with a Fusarium graminearum conidia suspension. Half of the plots were harvested at soft dough stage and then dissected into rachis and grain components, whereas the remainder was harvested at maturity. Multiple Fusarium-mycotoxins were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mycotoxin content was elevated at the earlier harvest point, especially in the rachis tissue. DON3G constituted a significant percentage (26%) of total trichothecene content and thus its co-occurrence with DON should be considered by barley industries. DON3G was highly correlated with DON and 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON). The ratio of D3G/DON exhibited consistency across genotypes, however more-resistant genotypes were characterized by a higher ratio at the soft-dough stage followed by a decrease at maturity. Plant breeding practices that use DON content as a biomarker for resistance would likely result in the development of barley cultivars with lower total DON-like compounds.",Allergic to Innovation? Dietary Change and Debate about Food Allergy in the United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194475,,2019 06 14,"This chapter investigates how allergists and their patients have understood the relationship between dietary change and allergy during the twentieth century. Industrial food production and the emergence of a global food economy provided both challenges and, possibly, explanations for food allergy sufferers and their physicians. As the production of food became further removed geographically from consumers during the course of the twentieth century, it became more difficult for food allergy sufferers to identify harmful allergens, thus making accidental exposure more likely. But many allergists also suspected that some of the ingredients used in food processing – especially maize and synthetic food dyes – were also potent allergens. Although such ideas were contested, they also mirrored deeper concerns about escalating rates of autoimmune disease. The chapter argues that, rather than dismissing such ideas out of hand, we should engage with them more deeply in the hope of explaining why such diseases are on the rise.",From John Yudkin to Jamie Oliver: A Short but Sweet History on the War against Sugar,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194474,,2019 06 14,"Sugar and the link between its consumption and chronic disease is today’s most debated dietary concern. Yet, as this chapter demonstrates, this debate is not a new one. Rather, the modern link between sugar and disease can be traced to the 1950s when a dialogue emerged in response to the post-war rise in chronic disease. Utilising published and unpublished texts of the late British nutritionist and anti-sugar campaigner John Yudkin, this chapter explores the numerous factors which shaped his ideas about sugar and the mediums used to propagate these to the public. Placing the history of advice about sugar in historical perspective, it provides an analysis of several key themes: the rise of nutrition science, the emergence of the state as a nutritional authority, the role of gender and cultural ideals in prescribing dietary advice, and the influence of commercial and professional interests in shaping public information concerning diet.",Reed Sternberg Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194473,,2019 06 14,"Hodgkin lymphoma characteristically presents with Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. When the cells are mononucleated, they are called Hodgkin cells. When they are multinucleated, they are called Reed-Sternberg cells.[1] The classic Reed-Sternberg cell is a large cell that can be more than 50 micrometers in diameter.[2] It is binucleated with prominent eosinophilic nuclei that are surrounded by abundant cytoplasm.[3] Reed-Sternberg cells were first illustrated incorrectly by Greenfield in a paper published in 1878. In 1898, Carl Sternberg published a paper in German that included illustrations of the cells along with the description of their pathology. However, Sternberg believed that Hodgkin disease was a form of tuberculosis. In 1902, Dorothy Reed described RS cells in her well-known paper, ""On the Pathological Changes in Hodgkin Disease, with Especial Reference to it's Relation to Tuberculosis."" She included a clear description of the cells, along with illustrations that she made herself. Reed emphasized that Hodgkin disease was unrelated to tuberculosis, and she used animal inoculation to prove her point. She showed that there was no immunological response to tuberculin in Hodgkin disease.[4]","Anatomy, Head and Neck, Eye Retina",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194472,,2019 06 14,"The retina is a layer of photoreceptors cells and glial cells within the eye that captures incoming photons and transmits them along neuronal pathways as both electrical and chemical signals for the brain to perceive a visual picture. The retina is located in the posterior segment and forms the innermost boundary among the other major layers of the eye that include the vascular choroid and the fibrous sclera. Disease manifestations can occur in the retina at different stages of life, many of which severely compromise visual ability and consequently the quality of life."
